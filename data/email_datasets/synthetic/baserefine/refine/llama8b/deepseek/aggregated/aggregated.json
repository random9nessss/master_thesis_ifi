It will also increase in the coming month. However, we can see that in February 2019, there were 8 ETDs, whereas in January 2019 there were 7 ETDs. The transhipment movement from West Africa & other major US destinations to Long Beach will increase by more than 10% this year. Hence we may see less berth congestion in the months of January, February & March 2019. However, the probability of berth congestion in April and onward months is very high as long as the CBP do not relax any of their existing regulations to reduce the dwell time.\n\nBest regards,\nPeter"

Typically, ships wait in line for 2-4 days to get to the berth, and the number of ships in line can vary unpredictably as ships can arrive at any time without prior notice.\n\nWhen two berths are available, the Terminal usually handles the berthing order based on when the ship can reach the berth. If your vessel arrives on the scheduled day, your berth time will likely be honored. However, if you are late due to port congestion and cannot reach the reserved berth, your berth may be given to another ship, and you will have to wait in line for the next available slot.\n\nBest regards,\nMs. Morris"

No pressure, I just need an answer by then.\n\nThis is especially important because the vessel concerned has to clear their port of 90,000 tonnes of cargo at the same time as loading the product in question. As such, it is best to keep the loading plan as close to the current laycan as possible for reasons of space and availability.\n\nThat's why I would be keen to get your laycan in a day or so.\n\nThank you again for your assistance.\n\nRegards,\nMike"

However, we could suggest an alternative which could be very convenient for you. The following is the technical background:\n\nAs you probably know, a number of passenger ships go from South America to the Caribbean; among them is the MS Francy, which normally operates between Brazil and Venezuela. This ship was specially chartered by a tour operator from Dubai who asked us for help.\n\nBest regards,\nJoseline"

This vessel was used by a tour operator from Dubai, who asked us to help them with the organisation of the operation. I will ask them to contact you to give you all the details. This operator was looking for containers, but we have done the calculation and we see that there is no need to use containers, because the cost would be too high in relation to the volume. So the only way would be by 20' pallets, using the forklift.\n\nBest regards,\nJoseline"

This cargo vessel will be chartered by the tour operator for this voyage. We suggest the option by 20' flat racks (pallets) to be loaded on the decks of the vessel and also by trucks to be driven aboard and carried in the hold of the vessel. This will be the cheapest way to move your cargo. Please let me know if you would like us to quote on this proposal. The itinerary of the ship is as follows:\n\n*Dep.

The extra charges are due to a discount we receive from the port authority in Israel for shipping at least 100,000 tonnes annually.\n\nAdditionally, I can offer you a discount if you opt for shipping insurance, which would add $3 per tonne. You will also need to deposit $20,000 into our account before we commence shipping. The freight will be FOB, meaning you will be responsible for all charges related to moving the cement from the terminal to your desired location.\n\nLet me know if you are interested.

Seablue is a crude vessel, and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers coming out of Chinese yards.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not come out in China, other tankers would come out of the dock and China would be fixed.

Therefore, the price level at which China is fixed would not be different even if Seablue was out of the drydock.\n\nLPG cargoes are different since we cannot use LPG in crude tankers, and crude cargoes are not as easy to fix as LPG, since many producers are contracted and certain prices are set.\n\nThe next drydocked Seablue is in...\n\nBest regards,\nKathy"

In a credit insurance, an ABG can find a solution for a charterer in Hong Kong. Otherwise, your chartering manager from ABG is free.\n\nBest regards,\nDoug"

I assume you need to ship it by sea.\n\nThe oil trade operates on a just-in-time inventory management model, whereby oil is shipped to tankers as needed. This provides a stable supply and demand, eliminates inventory storage costs, and prevents oil from degrading over time.\n\nSince your request involves shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days, my freight quote estimate would exceed what is available. Please confirm that your request is for 25,000 tons of oil in a seven-day freight, and I can provide a quote to the maximum that is available to my company.\n\nThanks,\nPerry"

If you are shipping this amount of oil in an outbound tanker, then the only companies capable of doing so are Shell, Chevron, and Exxon. I don't have contacts with these companies.\n\nIf you're shipping by sea, then you'll need a port in Copenhagen to load onto a tanker. I've emailed my contacts in the seaport of Copenhagen. They'll be in touch with me in the morning.\n\nIf you're shipping by road, then the quantity would need to be in 45-liter plastic oil drums. The storage space and legal limitations of this option would be impossible to organize in such a short time frame.\n\nI'm going to have to say 'no' to your request for shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days. I'm also saying 'no' to your request to contact the seaport in Copenhagen. If you insist, I'll let my seaport contacts know to contact you, but don't expect a reply.\n\nI'm sorry, but I simply don't have the resources to fill your request.

This air is then used to maintain the appropriate temperature for the goods. Please note that our ships do not have refrigeration in the holds. However, we have rooms designed for bulk goods that could accommodate the palm kernel oil. It should fit in one or two such rooms, with a loading rate of 7-8 tons per hour.\n\nThe maximum weight per carcase is 1,500 kg, as the container cannot handle heavier loads. To prevent damage during loading, we have made special arrangements. The shell of the palm kernel oil must be sealed after loading, and we recommend using a special sealing material for this purpose. I can send you a sample of this material if you wish.\n\nBest regards,\nJames Kleine\nManaging Director, Kleine Business Consultancy"

The market in Jeddah is quite large. I will reach out to you on Facebook to facilitate the introduction, as you can find them in my friends list.\n\nAlso, do you have a suitable vessel for 5,000MT of DAP fertilizer from Karachi to Jeddah next week?\n\nBest regards,\nPaul"

I came across your profile on LinkedIn and found you very qualified to assist me in a very urgent matter.\n\nA few years ago, I employed a ship broker by the name of Brian Hopkin from Thomas Hopkin & Co to help charter a vessel to ship my company's produce from Panama to the West Coast of the USA. Unfortunately, a few days into the voyage, the vessel ran aground and was a total loss. Not only did Brian misrepresent his ship owner to be a reputable one, he went ahead and used me to sign up an insurance contract for his own personal benefit, under the influence of alcohol. He connived with the insurance company to release his profit after the ship sank, but my company is still waiting for its share of the payout.\n\nAt the time, I wasn't aware that he had so much experience in ship brokerage. I learned his dishonesty at the expense of my company. He had forged documents showing a photograph of the vessel to the owners before shipping and didn't tell me about his limited experience as an underwriter. Now I am having trouble recovering the costs of the cargo.\n\nCan you help me find a reliable ship broker to ship a product from Greece to Rotterdam? Can you advise on the best route, avoid legal and insurance mishaps, and ensure my company is protected against mishaps and liabilities?\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance.\n\nBest regards,\nCieran"

We\u2019ve never sold that quantity of MGO before, but our company, as a division of a larger corporation, has supplied over 100,000mt to major trading companies in recent years. We are capable of handling this order.\n\nThe time frame for loading can be negotiated between the supplier and buyer. Typically, we provide shipping documents within 10-12 days of the shipment and request payment in cash 4 weeks later. The buyer is responsible for paying the bank documentary charges within 2 weeks of the shipment.\n\nFinding a supplier who can deliver 200,000mt in one go is challenging.

The average delivery time is around 45 days, though it can be shortened depending on the vessel\u2019s route.\n\nThe costs for this shipment range from USD 10 to USD 20 per mt, depending on the vessel size, route, and distance.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend shipping the order in two parts, each around 100,000mt.\n\nBest regards,\nCapt.

If you can provide evidence that these charges are the owners\u2019 responsibility\u2014for example, a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo\u2014we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses. However, if you are simply adding charges to cover your agency\u2019s costs, this is unethical, and we will not proceed with payment.\n\nAdditionally, we require more details about the cargo, such as its origin, grade, and product code. This information will enable us to provide a more accurate freight quote.\n\nPlease provide as much detail as possible in your emails to expedite the process and avoid unnecessary delays.\n\nBest regards,\nAlain Ferris"

Let me try to address your concerns.\n\nFirstly, the Ever Given ship was successfully dislodged from the Suez Canal on March 29th, after being stuck for almost a week. However, it remains in the canal until it can be re-fueled and towed to another location for repairs. The process of refueling and repairing the ship is expected to take several weeks.\n\nAs for the backlog of vessels in the canal, the congestion has indeed caused delays. As of May 2nd, there are 67 vessels waiting to enter the Suez Canal, while an additional 55 are waiting to exit. This situation is likely to affect shipping schedules, including your shipment from China to Long Beach.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nLogistics Team"

Your cargo is a noxious substance that has been denied to others in the past, so this must be done delicately.

'Anyone who works with anhydrous ammonia or other fertilizers must read this, and they must share it with their teams,' says Director of Regulatory Affairs Brian Jennings.\n* When a group of California manufacturers and distributors went before the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss the 2013 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) proposed by the U.S. EPA, they did not leave empty-handed. A bill was introduced in the state legislature that would provide a tax incentive to encourage renewable fuel blending.\n\nBest,\nSteve"

With foreign financial firms having acquired Blythe & Blythe Energy, CITGO, Pacific Gas & Electric, Southwestern Bell, Texas Utilities, among others, it is rather apparent that while the American energy market remains the largest, there are better opportunities elsewhere. As an energy venture capital firm focused on developing LNG, Biomass, Oil & Gas projects and related ventures, this trend is noteworthy.\n\nBest regards,\nFrancois Menez & Sandrine Menez"

If a tanker could travel through the route, I'm sure that the insurance premiums wouldn't be a major problem.\n\nI could not find any such tanker available right now, so it's not a matter of just connecting the dots.

Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way, and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h. We can also do up to 2,000 mt/h if the coal can be delivered to the berth quickly and easily.\n\nBe advised that in March, the water in the port will be very low. Because of this, we need to ensure the vessel\u2019s draft is suitable for the conditions.\n\nRegards,\nBrian"

And even a commitment to pay for a formal inspection would not be sufficient to get past U.S. Customs\u2019 questions.

This rate was introduced to reflect the charterer's ability to make a simple and accurate calculation based on the CBM stated on their cargo. However, our customer, Shell, has indicated that they will not proceed with this arrangement for their LNG shipments unless the CBM charge is less than 90 cbm.\n\nWe are also requesting that BIMCO revise the wording of the applicable provision in the GCM/Voyage Charterparty to ensure clarity and alignment with our customer's requirements.\n\nBest Regards,\nDavid Dalschaert"

The US Gulf is the only origin that we can produce in volume. We currently expect to have sufficient petcoke available to meet all of our charterers' requirements. However, you will still need to present your documentary requirements (full set of Bills of Lading (BLs), your Charter Party, LPA Form 1, and their most recent IOPPCA, etc.) to obtain our booking approval.\n\nThe US Gulf produces 3 grades of petcoke: a very fine grade, a coarse grade, and a lamellar (wax-contaminated) grade. We are able to book all 3 grades of petcoke on an as-available basis.\n\nWe will soon update our webpage with the latest information.\n\nBest regards,\nMrs. Bird"

I am writing because I am concerned about the current state of my company.\n\nAs you may know, our CEO, Mr. Smith, is leaving and is rumored to be heading for JPS. The news had a significant impact on the market cap, with our stock down 8 percent on the day of the announcement.\n\nThe plan is to name an interim replacement while a search is conducted to find a successor. Obviously, this is not the best time to be making a change, but it seems unavoidable.\n\nWith that said, I'm looking for advice on how to turn this situation around.\n\nBest regards,\nJeff"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Import FormsModule:\n```typescript\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n```\n2. Add FormsModule to the imports array in the @NgModule declaration:\n```typescript\nimports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule ]\n```\n3. Add [email] to the input tag.\n\nThis will give you an input that looks something like this:\n```html\n<input type='email' [email]>\n```\n\nAt the end of the day, I found it quite trivial, and I suspect that most people would, too.\n\nBest,\nDeveloper"

However, if you need to handle more specific edge cases, you might want to add custom validation logic. For example, you could use a regular expression to ensure the email follows a specific format.\n\nIn the end, I ended up going with the approach that I outlined in the first email.

I told him about the buyer's and the seller's interests and that he should give the buyer's company's address because the buyer is overseas.

It is not that we are concerned about your ability to broker deals, but we would like to put you through your paces, as it were. The deal with the American electronics firm is our first priority.\n\n2) In relation to the electronics deal, I would like to ask that you consider moving the timeline up. It's become clear to us that American firms are now looking to work with British firms in a bid to access their very competitive tax rates. Moving the deal forward would make us an attractive proposition.\n\n3) Finally, in relation to the rate you quoted for the electronics firm, I would like to discuss this further to ensure it aligns with our expectations.\n\nBest regards,\nFelicia"

You could really try and find out the MT readings; I'm going to go with them. I need this so I can estimate how much gas it will take for the sale to be profitable.\n\nThank you for all your help.

There is an addendum, which I assume will be applied to container ships and not to other vessels such as your DWT which sail through. It's not my fault.\n\nSince the signing of the Neutrality Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama of 1926, the Panama Canal has been operated as an interoceanic highway in a manner which has been equitable and impartial to all the merchant vessels of all nations, and in a manner consistent with the operation of other interoceanic waterways. The tolls for the use of the waterway have been established in the Treaty at rates which would be consistent with the tolls charged to vessels.\n\nBest,\nSam"

They just get the information they need to keep doing their jobs.\n\nHowever, if you put the same information into a 'smartcard', suddenly it becomes very interesting. A Smartcard can contain information, documents, images, videos, and even music. It can also include online links and information that can be downloaded from the Internet, as well as many other things. Smartcards can be sent as gifts.\n\nBest regards,\nLogistics Team"
