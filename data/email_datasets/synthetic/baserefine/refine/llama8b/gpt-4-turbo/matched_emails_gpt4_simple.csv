Barter or similar type of shipping would be another way to get product, basically you are trading something for the shipping, typically a product that the shipper wants. 
I have not used this type of transaction so I don't know about the legalities or security in terms of the recipient. 
There are companies that specialize in these types of transactions so I would not recommend going it alone.

Re: Medium Term Charter in June
Dear Joseph,
We will be able to be ready to proceed with a 45-60 day charter in June for a vessel that can carry 5000mt LPG in cargo tanks. 
We are currently preparing our requirements list for an upcoming voyage with an LPG carrier that can carry 11,000mt LPG. 
Would you kindly send us a draft contract based on your voyage time,  LPG capacity and MT and your prices. 
For purposes of understanding your company and industry, we would like to know:
Are you an oil or chemical trader? How many days would the vessel be anchored prior to the loading port?
I look forward to your response.

Hi Ms. McKinney,                    Planning a 3,500MT cargo of crude oil from Milford Haven to Gibraltar. Can you let me know if there will be enough berthing space this coming October, and how much demurrage is likely?                    Many thanks,                    Maja

Hi Mr. Peter,                    We have a cargo to ship from Mundra to Long Beach. I do not anticipate any berth congestion in either port, but would you still please confirm that?                    Many thanks,                    Michael

Hi Michael,                  Hope you are well.                      As far as Mundra is concerned, there will be no berth congestion (whether it be monthly or weekly) in any month of this year.                 Regarding the port of Long Beach, the container volume is consistently increasing month on month. It will also increase in the coming month. However, we can see that in February 2019, there were 8 ETDs, whereas in January 2019 there were 7 ETDs. The transhipment movement from West Africa & other major US destinations to Long Beach will increase by more than 10% this year. Hence we may see less berth congestion in the months of January, February & March 2019. However, the probability of berth congestion in April and onward months is very high as long as the CBP do not relax any of their existing regulations to reduce the dwell

Hi
Kindly note the following changes in view of the proposed cut off 
· All STS, which were used in the past to eliminate congestion, will cease by end of March 2019. 
· Due to many more factors like larger volume, berth congestion & diversification, the terminal now prefers containers which are loaded on to wagons, trucks, rail heads, special containers (Transponders, Chilled, Refrigerated, etc.) as well as containers which are to be exported via Ocean Terminal, Pier 400, Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT), ……………… the list goes on. 
· Longer term (year on year), terminal hopes that terminal will be able to achieve more in terms of more Gate out/container return, which is the only way the terminal will be able to handle more volume.

The transshipment movement from West Africa and other major US destinations to Long Beach will cause an increase of more than 10% this year. Although there's less congestion expected in the early months, starting from April, the prospects of high congestion are significant unless CBP regulations are adjusted. Regards, Peter

Hi Everyone,

There are some students in a course that I teach who asked me to provide
advice in writing a proposal for a project. It seems that the
deadline for submitting the proposals is fast approaching, and they have
not started to work on writing a proposal yet. Also, one of the students
told me that they had asked many of their professors for advice, and
most of the professors whom they had contacted did not respond.
Therefore, I thought that maybe you would be able to provide them with
some advice, if you had time, and also perhaps let them know that

Thank you for your response. Regarding your query, the insurance policy I am quoting does not cover cargo loss. You can review my policy details here: [Ship the Box Insurance Policy](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f0f50a4d746a5642fe1f64a/5f4f66f7d957cd00018cd78e_Ship_the_box_Insurance_Policy.pdf).

Please note, as per our agreement, any claims will be the responsibility of you and the broker, while I provide compensation. Regarding the pricing and terms, these areas are agreeable and can be discussed further if necessary.

You have a couple of options:
1. Liaise with the ship's broker for market pricing. Be aware that the favorable pricing might not prompt quick responses.
2. Place the current proposal on your sales sheet and forward it to my agents.

Looking forward to your decision.

Body: Dear [Attorney's Name], 

Thank you for your inquiry. I appreciate your questions concerning the estate of Elaine Thompson. 

Elaine’s Will does meet all legal requirements for probate. Regarding her assets, she owned several investments and properties, details of which can be further discussed. Some assets, such as certain insurance policies, are not subjected to the Will’s terms. 

To commence administration, an application for probate must be filed, followed by detailed asset collection and assessment. The tax implications can vary, and it might be beneficial to consult a tax professional. 

For a more detailed conversation, please feel free to call me, or I can also arrange a meeting with my colleague, who specializes in estate planning if needed. 

Sincerely, 

Shari"

Body: Dear Alex, I have received your request concerning the 45,000MT diesel shipment. The charterer's preferred cargo window is during the 2nd and 3rd weeks of October, ideally as late within this range as possible. It is also a requirement that the vessel arrives in Dublin by the 20th of October. Should there be a change from the charterer concerning the acceptance window to the end of August, would you be able to facilitate this change? Regards, Glenys

Hi Ms. Morris,                    We have an enquiry for 13,000MT of rice from Colombo to Matadi. Can you give us a berth congestion forecast and how does your laytime allowance work in case of port delays?                    Many thanks,                    Robert
Email 2:
Matadi is a very busy port with cargoes often backed up at berth. There is no guaranteed transit time to discharge ships. It is typical for ships to be waiting in line from 2-4 days to get to berth and there is not a predictable number of ships in line to discharge as ships can come at any time without warning.
                
                It is typical to run back up and sometimes 2 berths simultaneously. When two berths are available, the berthing order is typically handled by the Terminal based on when the ship can reach the berth. In the event that your vessel can reach the berth on the day that is scheduled for your vessel, your berth time will likely be honored. If you are late due to port congestion and cannot reach the berth that is reserved for you, your berth may be given to another ship and you will have to wait in line for the next","From: robert@shippingco.com

Body: Dear Robert,

Matadi is frequently busy with cargoes often experiencing congestion. There is no guaranteed transit time for discharging ships, and it is typical for vessels to wait from 2-4 days to berth. The number of ships in line is unpredictable, as vessels can arrive without prior notice. When two berths are open, the terminal typically manages the berthing order based on the arrival timing of the ships. If your vessel reaches the berth as scheduled, your slot will likely be honored. However, if your arriving ship is delayed due to port congestion and misses the reserved berth time, it may be reassigned to another vessel, and yours will need to wait for the next available slot.

Best regards,
Ms. Morris"

Hi Don,                    What is the loading window for 40,000MT of #2 fuel oil from Haldia to Singapore? Also, please advise on the laycan.                    Regards,                    Mike
Email 2:
The answer from someone on the ship side will be most welcomed (current laycan for oil 40k Haldia-Sing). In the meantime, and not to put any undue pressure on the person, but I need an answer by 20:00 Hong Kong time on the 12th. No pressure I just need an answer by then.
This is especially important because the vessel concerned has to clear their port of 90,000 tonnes of cargo at the same time as loading the product in question.
As such, it is best to keep the loading plan as close to the current laycan as possible for reasons of space and availability.
That's why I would be keen to get your laycan in a day or so.
Thank you again for your assistance.

Hi Mike,
The laycan for the product is as follows: Loading window is as follows: (Laycan 12th Aug/14th Aug; ETA Singapore 15th Aug/16th Aug)

Hi Don,                 The laycan for the oil was to be between 12-16 Aug. The opening/closing date of the laycan as well as the ETA for Singapore are critical, therefore it's best that you let me know the exact ETA for Singapore.
The cargoes to be loaded are cargo 1 & 2.
                The vessel has to load both oil cargoes at Haldia at the same time.

I assume this is for shipping to Montevideo, Uruguay?
[Short answer] Considering the cost of Ethanol at USD 700.00/t, loading at Moin and routing via Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, then the FOB Hamburg is USD 420.00/t with a port rotation in Moin, Santos, and Constanza.

Our company can offer competitive shipping costs and services for transporting Ethanol to Montevideo, Uruguay. We are happy to provide more information and a detailed quote upon request.

Based on your information, I can provide you with an estimate for the shipping cost of 250 MT of Ethanol from Moin, Honduras to Montevideo, Uruguay.

Based on the given data, and assuming the routing via Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, our preliminary assessment suggests a freight cost estimate of USD 700.00 per ton for Ethanol loading at Moin.

Dear Chuck,

Please consider this. What is the answer you expect to get if you ask a question like this in a job interview? Just think about it.

Best regards,
Chris

The two parties are negotiating the details of the trade transaction. Chuck has asked about the airfreight and insurance costs, and Chris has said he'll get back to Chuck about the cost details. Chuck, however, is impatient, and he asks again for the details. Chuck's questions assume that Chris can find the details easily. Chuck also does not show much flexibility in accepting a later answer.

You will remember that I sent you a quotation some days ago for
the shipment from Montevideo to the Vargas Free Zone (Isla Margarita,
Venezuela). I attach it for your review.
As I explained to you, your freight forwarder is using the
transportation of a passenger vessel for which they charge you a huge
amount of money (of course with a very high margin of profit for them).
However, we could suggest an alternative which could be very convenient
for you. The following is the technical background:
As you probably know, a number of passenger ships go from South America
to the Caribbean; among them is the MS Francy, which normally operates
between Brazil and Venezuela. This ship was specially chartered by a

operator from Dubai, who asked us to help them with the organisation of the
operation. I will ask them to contact you to give you all the details. This
operator was looking for containers, but we have done the calculation and
we see that there is no need to use containers, because the cost would be
too high in relation to the volume. So the only way would be by 20' pallets,

with a very good cargo vessel which will be leaving from the port of Valparaiso
on 24 July and arriving in Isla Margarita on 27 July. This cargo vessel will be
chartered by the tour operator for this voyage. We suggest the option by 20' flat
racks (pallets) to be loaded on the decks of the vessel and also by trucks to
be driven aboard and carried in the hold of the vessel. This will be the cheapest
way to move your cargo. Please let me know if you would like us to quote on this

Hi Markus, I would like to have your assistance on this matter.
I have been in communication with an agent in Cartagena and he had informed me that isopropanol is extremely dangerous to transport and he is trying to deter us. He had offered an alternative product for the price you had provided.
The supplier is directly from the US and I think there is no reason for any third party to be involved in the transaction.
To be honest with you, the suppliers are not even prepared to sell the product at the prices you had quoted. For this reason, I don’t think we will be able to do business with you and appreciate if you will be kind enough to refund the advance payment of 1,200USD.

Body: Hi Markus, I have consulted with an agent in Cartagena, and he warned about the dangers of transporting isopropanol, suggesting an alternate product instead. The US suppliers are not willing to sell at the previously quoted prices. For this reason, our deal cannot proceed under the current terms. I kindly ask for a refund of the advance payment of $1,200 USD that was previously made. Thank you for your understanding and assistance in this matter. Best Regards, Mahesh Nambiar"

The best rate for you will be $60 per tonne + $5 in extra charges. The extra charges is because the port authority in Israel gives us that discount if we ship at least 100,000 tonnes per year.

We are able to handle up to 100,000 tonnes per year on an annual contract basis. Our best rate for you would be $60 per tonne with an additional $5 in surcharges. These extra charges result from discounts provided by the Israeli port authority conditioned on shipments of at least 100,000 tonnes per year.

We also offer a discount if you opt for shipping insurance, which would add an extra charge of $3 per tonne. Prior to starting the shipment, a deposit of $20,000 is required. Note, our freight terms are FOB, implying that you will cover all expenses from the terminal to your warehouse or another desired location.

Please let me know if you are interested. I am preparing the necessary documents for your agreement.

Body: Hey Maria,

For 3,000MT of bulk Ammonium Sulfate from Damietta to Koper, we can take care of this shipment. Our laycan is next week, Tuesday, the 15th. Is that schedule acceptable for you?

Thanks for your email, the proposed schedule looks good! How do we confirm these dates officially? Should I enter them into your Transport Management System (TMS) directly?

The best approach would be to confirm our discussion about the fixed laycans via this email, and then I'll forward it to our IT team. They will update the dates in the TMS to ensure everything is set. Does that work for you?

                    Dear Mr. Bush,
                    Thank you for your inquiry.

                    In order to make an offer we would need to know the date of shipment, vessel, and cargo type. If the vessel is not chartered we can suggest the estimated rates.

                    If the vessel is already on charter and the vessel type is known then we can suggest the freight rate.

                    In the above two cases, an offer is being provided but it is not a fixed rate.

                    If the vessel has already been loaded, then a time charter rate must be negotiated.

                    In the case of a time charter, the vessel owner may expect at least 2 voyages to break even.

                    If the owner is offering you a time charter, it

I have several storage tanks and packing equipment available and I will be able to accept a 5,000MT shipment of waste plastic film starting July 28. As for the lead time, it will take me about four days to finish the tanking of the plastic film. I can do all the loading, stuffing and lashing and you will be responsible for the fixing and sealing of the hatch. Will the cargo be using hatch cover or will it be double-containerized? Please advise, so I can make the necessary arrangements for the storage. Will you be able to cover the last two shipments for $2,500? We could not accept this kind of condition because the terminal handling fees and port storage costs are already included in the quoted price. I think the best arrangement we could do is to have a rate adjustment

Regarding the coverage of the last two shipments within $2,500, unfortunately we cannot accommodate this due to included terminal handling fees and port storage costs. A rate adjustment could be a viable alternative.

Mr. Silver,                    We’re looking for a 500 ton cargo of corn from Quebec to Tokyo. Could you provide a freight quote under CFR terms, and can your vessel sail before the 20th?                    Best regards,                    Gordon

Mr. Silver,
Thank you for your reply. We have already loaded on a vessel and made the transportation contract. However, the transportation company asks for the following documents: a set of bills of lading, a certificate of insurance and a set of commercial invoices. I would appreciate your advice.
Yours sincerely,
Tom

The problem of Cargo Document is tricky because it involves the dispute on whether the transportation company should be considered as the agent of the seller.

Business background:
The first email shows that the buyers have agreed on an acceptance to offer (letter of acceptance, cf. § 1384, Italian Code of Commercial law (Codice Commerciale)) and made a transportation contract for the 500 ton cargo of corn with a third party. As for the Seller, the second email shows that the Seller still thinks that the transportation company is his agent and the Buyers are not

Dear Gordon,
Silver Shipping, Inc. is currently arranging the shipping for you. It will be more convenient if you could tell us the name of the third party or the transportation company to deal with the shipping contract. We are looking forward to getting your email. Thank you very much.
Yours sincerely,
Michael Silver, President Silver Shipping, Inc.
</Email 3>

The main issue:
For the transaction to be a sale with CIF clause, at the moment of conclusion of the contract of sale, the Seller and the Buyers have to agree on the destination port and the Seller have to insure the goods for the Buyers. If the Buyers do not have a transportation contract, the Seller must comply with this CIF clause to fulfill the contract. Otherwise, the Seller should not promise the contract with the Buyers at all, which is the same as Article 6 § 1 (c) of the ICC
Email 4:
Gordon,
Mr. Silver would like to know where you have got the buyers of the corn. We have already got buyers but you asked for the freight and insurance costs. We do not understand why. As we agreed, you are responsible for the sale, insurance and transportation of the corn. We expect to see a written transportation contract from you within the next 3 days. Please forward to Mr. Silver a copy of the transportation contract.
Yours sincerely,
Bill
</Email 4>
The point is that the Seller has not decided what destination port the Buyers are going to choose yet. It seems that the Sellers have fulfilled all the CIF obligations in this case. Thus, it is unnecessary to involve any transportation company. If there is no such transportation company that the Seller and the Buyers both use, the contract of sale cannot be considered as a CIF contract. Therefore, the Sellers should not","From: gordon@example.com

Hi Blayney,                    Not at all.                    Seablue is a crude vessel and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers coming out of  Chinese yards.
As I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not come out in China, other tankers would come out of the dock and China would be fixed.                    These tankers would operate at a price level set by the most competitive time charter tanker which is the drydocked Seablue and therefore the price level at which China is fixed would not be different even if Seablue was out of the drydock.
LPG cargoes are different since we can not use LPG in the crude tankers and crude cargoes are not as easy to fix as LPG, since many producers are contracted and certain prices are set.

Body: Hi Blayney, Not at all. Seablue is a crude vessel and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers from Chinese yards. As I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not resume operations in China, other tankers would compensate by departing Chinese docks. These tankers would operate at a price level set by the most competitive time charter, which is the drydocked Seablue. Therefore, the price level at which cargoes are fixed in China would not differ even if Seablue was operational. LPG cargoes are different since we cannot use crude tankers for them, and crude cargoes are more complex to arrange as many producers have set contracted prices. Best, Kathy

Email 2:
Hi,                    We bought 2 x 50foot containers of crude oil from Balikpapan to Jakarta for 700 USD.                    All the best,                    Emma

After investigating 82 oil container rates in Balikpapan from February to May 2016, Emma wrote email 1 to request advice on market rates for the 22nd to 23rd of the month. When the suggested rate was below market rate, she accepted the offer via email 2.

Solution:
The correct answer is a2, and the explanation is as follows:
The business communication has the characteristic of taking the buyer's interest into consideration. The buyer is assumed to be the focus in business communication.
Email 3:
Dear Ms. Scott,                   We would like to purchase some crude oil. We have a request for a load of cargo delivered to China on or around the 22nd to 23rd of this month. What is the market rate for this?                    Regards,                    Emma

Answer Options:
a1. Email 3 asked the oil supplier for the market rate of oil containers and the price, which shows great concern for the buyer's interest.
a2. The oil supplier provides a quotation below the market rate in email 4, showing concern for the buyer's interest.
a3. The oil supplier provided a quotation that was on par with the market rate in email 4, showing no concern for the buyer's interest.
a4. The oil supplier provided a quotation that was much higher than the market rate in email 4, showing great concern for the buyer's interest.

I have reviewed the booking details and noticed the cargo size is only 11,200MT, which is unusual. Additionally, all our current slots are full. Our maximum charterers' credit limit is $4M and vessel's $1M. Please verify these details and suggest how you wish to proceed given these constraints.

Hello Dr Al-Bashir,                    Could you ship 2,000 barrels of gasoline from Genoa to Bridgetown this week? We have recently received market quotation but have no way of verifying its accuracy and wish to discuss it.                    Best,                    Raymond

Dr. Al-Bashir,
             We are extremely interested in moving forward with our transaction. We can finance 50% of the $800,000, and we need to know how you will finance the other$400,000. I am prepared to wire you $100,000 towards the transaction on condition that you forward the other$300,000 (and the ship documents) within 10 days of receiving this deposit. I understand that this is a small amount relative to the transaction, but I am sending you this deposit on the condition that it will be returned within 14 days if you are not able to complete the transaction. Since this is not a substantial amount, I expect that you will not have any difficulty in wiring me back the $100,000. I am sending you this cash transfer request by express courier today. Please send me a confirmation of the receipt of my transfer

<Why haven’t you sent me the deposit?> I am really sorry for the delay on our side. I was out of the office due to personal reasons for a few days. We have paid all our bills and we have enough funds. I just need your Bank’s Swift Code and your Account Number, then we can proceed to making the payment today.

Problem

A recent widespread email spam campaign targeted the energy and commodities trading industry with messages claiming that their customers wanted to use their services to buy crude oil and related products from reputable traders in the market. Some traders were approached in a very business-like manner, allegedly by major oil firms. The email subject line would indicate that the email was from a trusted business partner, such as a large energy firm or similar corporate client.

The email requests are easy to read but hard to understand. A foreign sounding person claiming to be an executive from a respectable company in a similar industry wants to “spot” some “margin fee” – what? An explanation for what these terms mean may have come attached

They represent a major Japanese refiner, Osaka Gas.

When a business receives a large unsolicited order they often feel obligated to make the sale.

In both situations, the client should take a step back and evaluate the order. First, the client should

As the requests are unsolicited and we have not received any communication with our buyer in the past, it would be a good idea to contact them directly to confirm their intent. We could ask the buyer for more information and maybe arrange to speak with the buyer directly. When speaking with the buyer, it would be important to ask them to provide more information about the deal. The buyer may have a reasonable explanation for their request. However, it is important to keep in mind that a reasonable explanation does not necessarily mean the request is legitimate.

So she already appreciated the role of Reza’s proposing concrete example as shown in the second email above.

For general reference, a LSA is a LOI (letter of intent) document.

Introduction

The use of “Email 1” as an example is taken from a popular LinkedIn post of Sam Nara on the subject of using a working example when making a proposal (source: Linkedin).

I have learned a lot from Sam’s post, and I think the post helps provide an excellent practical starting point. In this post, I will provide further explanations to highlight more subtle points not included in Sam’s original post, and also discuss how these points are implemented in our Lean Email.

Email 1 is a typical email. Its objective is to propose a working example to a recipient.

I do need your help here to review and submit the revised LSA to admin for approvals!

In this example, Rosalind first thanked Reza for sending her a revised LSA, then reminded Reza that she required his help to proceed with the transaction.

Based on this email, Reza needs to do two things to support Rosalind in closing this transaction:

• Review the LSA before submitting the LSA to Rosalind’s admin for approvals.
• Submit the LSA to Rosalind’s admin for approvals.

Reza can do these two tasks simply by using Lean Email by clicking the buttons as shown below. Clicking on the Review button will pop-up a Review/Submit page, which contains a Review tab, and a Submit tab.

# Word Problem

### Solution 1

From the email the relevant facts are:

• The farmer wants to charter a ship to transport 15000 mt of rice to Jakarta.
• According to Ms. Armitage, the loading can be completed by around 20–22 November with delivery ETA around 10–12 December.

We know the ship will depart Singapore to Jakarta but
Email 3:
Hi Sally,                There will be another chartered starting from Singapore to Jakarta, departing on 18 Nov.                If you are interested, please advise latest by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony

</Email 3>

The sender mentions in Email 3 that the ship will leave Singapore to Jakarta on 18 November. That means there will be a time difference between 18 November and 20 November. So this information is not consistent with the information given in Email 2, which is the main source of information.

One reason for inconsistency could be the mistake in Email 2, when Ms. Armitage wrote 22 November instead of 20 November. Or one may assume that when Ms. Armitage sent Email 2, she didn't know about the departure date on 18 November.

Let us consider the following situation:
Email 4:
Hi Sally,                There will be a chartered departing on 18 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec.                Please advise if you are interested by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony

</Email 4>

In Email 4, we assumed that Ms. Armitage may have made a mistake in Email 2, and corrected it in Email 4. So let us analyze this situation.

Assume the ship leaves Singapore on 18 November and arrives at Jakarta on 10 December. This means the ship will take 22 days to reach Jakarta.

So, if loading is completed on 20 November, it will take a minimum of 2 days to complete the loading. It may take longer.

• So the loading will take place between 18 and 20 November.

Can you accept transshipments of grain from the other side of the Atlantic (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany)?                    4.       How many times per year can you transship to Vladivostok from Europe?                    5.       What do your services entail?                    6.       Can you store bulk products in your vessels?                    7.       Do you have terminals in New York or Vladivostok?                    8.

                    Mr. Marina,

                    Sorry for the delay! I have some new information.

                    1. The transit time would be approx. 4 weeks. We normally handle bulk containers (20 feet and 40 feet) but we can try with other vessels if you want. We do not usually carry these products, but we can do it from 15,000 tons per trip.                    2. We can accept transshipment of grain from other ports in Europe. In principle it is every two weeks from Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany) with transshipment to Vladivostok once per month. You can also order grain from these ports for the transshipment in the United States.                    3. Our services include transshipment of grain from the United States and transshipment from Europe to Vladivostok. 4. No

Dear Mr. Woo,                    Could you please provide a 7-day freight estimate for 25,000MT of oil from Copenhagen to Lagos.                    Thanks,                    Felipe

Dear Felipe,                 25,000 tons of oil from Copenhagen to Lagos in a seven-day freight?                    That's quite a bit of oil, Felipe. I assume you need to ship it by sea.                    You see, the oil trade operates on a just-in-time inventory management model, whereby oil is shipped to tankers as needed. This provides a stable supply and demand, eliminates inventory storage costs and prevents oil from degrading over time.                    Since your request involves shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days, my freight quote estimate would exceed what is available.                    Please confirm that your request is for 25,000 tons of oil in a seven-day freight and I can provide a quote to the maximum that is available to my company.

Dear Felipe,                 Again, shipping 25,000 tons in seven days is an unusual request.                    If you are shipping this amount of oil in an outbound tanker, then the only companies capable of doing so are Shell, Chevron and Exxon. I don't have contacts with these companies.                    If you're shipping by sea, then you'll need a port in Copenhagen to load onto a tanker. I've emailed my contacts in the seaport of Copenhagen. They'll be in touch with me in the morning.                    If you're shipping by road, then the quantity would need to be in 45 liter plastic oil drums. The storage space and legal limitations of this option would be impossible to organize in such a short time frame.

If you insist, I'll let my seaport contacts know to contact you, but don't expect a reply.                    I'm sorry, but I simply don't have the resources to fill your request.

Dear Felipe,                 Yes, I've contacted the Copenhagen seaport. They say you're 'absolutely okay' with me contacting them? You see, the contact I've made at the seaport of Copenhagen is the Director. He's a very important person who receives hundreds of emails from oil dealers like yourself, so he just needs to be advised that the shipping in question is okay. He's very busy, but if he doesn't reply within two weeks, please email him directly to remind him. You can just copy me on the email.                 This is your second response that implies you're okay with me contacting the seaport, so I'm sending you a copy of this email for your reference.

Subject: Freight Estimate and Options
Timestamp: 2023-03-02 13:40
Body: Dear Felipe,
Shipping 25,000 tons in seven days is quite unusual. For such a significant shipment via sea, you would need to load onto a tanker at a port in Copenhagen. Currently, I don't have direct contacts with major oil companies like Shell, Chevron, or Exxon who can accommodate such a capacity. Additionally, arranging transport by road in such a short timeframe is impractical due to storage space and legal constraints.
I suggest submitting your request directly to one of the large oil companies. I've also contacted the Copenhagen seaport and will inform you once I receive their response.

Perry

Hello Katherine,                     Thanks for your inquiry and interest in working with us.
I'd like to point out a few things that may be useful for you to consider when doing business with us:
* **Additional charges**: Please note that, the above rates do not include Accelerated discharge charges for +35 days cargo to be paid by Seller.   You will need to bear this cost in mind when considering the above rates.
* **Availability of vessels**: I'm afraid, the vessel availability may be very limited in this trade during April-May 2023 due to busy Season. We have a few vessels that we can offer at the above rates but they are all loaded already in their previous trades and are due to return to Russia after discharging and we'll require 20-30 days notice from you to fit a ballast leg. Hence, you may consider booking a vessel now at the above rates","From: katherine@importexportinc.com

Body: Hello Mr. Kosar,

Thank you for sending over the details. I am ready to proceed but need clarification on the spreadsheet. It lists a charge of $2.3 million for the voyage, along with additional charges like Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF). Also, there is a weight limit of 150 tons. Could you explain these details in simpler terms?

Best regards,
Henrik

Body: Hello Henrik,

Thank you for your inquiry. The transportation costs are divided into three sections: freight ($2.3 million), BAF (which covers fluctuating fuel prices), and other surcharges. The weight limit of 150 tons applies to the maximum safe operational capacity of the vessel. Please let me know if you need further details or clarification.

Best regards,

Hi James,                    Looking to move 5,8kmt of palm kernel oil from Port Klang to Male. Can you advise how the refrigeration is done in the holds.                    Cheers,                    Mona
Email 2:
Dear Mona,        The refrigeration is done by ventilation - the holds are ventilated by system that draws air through ice cold seawater. The air is then used to keep the goods at right temperature. There is no refrigeration in the holds of our ships. In between, there are rooms for packages of bulk goods.                    We could load the PKE in these rooms. It should fit in one or two such rooms. The loading rate would be 7-8t per hour.                    The max weight per carcase is 1.500kg. The container could not handle heavier carcases.                    To prevent damage of the PKE during loading, we have made special arrangements for the loading. The shell of the PKE must be closed after being loaded and we suggest using special sealing material for this purpose. A sample of this material can be sent if you wish.                    Should you

Hi James,                    That sounds good. I can arrange the product to arrive in 20 ft containers.

I can arrange the sealing material, do you have the dimensions of the rooms you have in mind?                    Thanks again.                    Mona
Email 4:
Dear Mona,        The rooms are about 8,5m by 2,9m, 2,8m high. That should be sufficient. A container is the best to move it. We have also made arrangements for transporting the PKE in ISO containers.                    If you have difficulties to do so, we could also load the goods at our port in Port Klang, moving the goods in our own trucks from there.

Subject: Re: Request for Shipping Information on Palm Kernel Oil
Timestamp: 2023-02-01 15:20
Body: Dear Mona,

Thank you for reaching out. Our vessels manage temperature-sensitive cargo like palm kernel oil using ventilated holds. The ventilation system cools the air via ice-cold seawater and circulates it to keep the cargo at the required temperature. Unfortunately, there are no dedicated refrigeration units in the holds.

We can load the palm kernel oil in ventilated rooms suitable for package or bulk goods. These rooms can accommodate one or two containers, with a loading rate of 7-8 tons per hour and a maximum weight limit of 1500 kg per container.

Special arrangements for loading to prevent damage to the palm kernel oil will include sealed containers. We can provide a sample of the required sealing material if needed.

Dear Madame/Sir
We are looking for a voyage from October 25th to 28th for 26,000MT.

To **be looking** **for** a voyage

To **do** something, the subject is doing, the action. 

Compare:
To **be** waiting for a friend.

We are looking for a voyage means that they need someone to buy their product.  

One must use the passive for this sentence. 
We have the object in the sentence - voyage.  This can be changed to object of the preposition **for** - voyage **for**.  
This change turns the whole sentence into the passive sentence.

The subject will be the preposition. 
We know this because the preposition **for** comes before the subject.  We can make it **a voyage**.

We are **looking** for **a voyage**

The question is
Email 4:
**Who** are **looking** **for** **a voyage**

Answer **They** are looking for a voyage. 

## Common mistake in student papers

1. Using the active form for these sentences.  

We do not use the active form when there is a preposition after the subject.  
It should be  
**He** is looking **for** a house. 
We have the active form **He** is looking, but **for** comes after it.
We change the active form to the passive form, thus creating the passive form.

**There** is looking **for** a house.

2. Removing the article. 

The article **a** is required to make the sentence active.  
**He** is looking **for** a house.  
If you remove **a**, you have created a passive sentence.

There is an obvious difference in intent of these two emails, despite their similar opening lines.

Email 1 is making a clear request, and they go on to add an additional question (""Can you please confirm rate and availability?"").

Email 2 is vague. They want to ""advice"" on shipping charges and how best to deliver to the Mombasa warehouse, but without specifying what the item they want to ship is, or what the conditions are.

They say they have some ""seed crops"", but how can we determine whether this is a valid offer or not without further information?

Dear Mrs. Carter,
                    I am confused about the sea cargo volume of my vessel. The agreement said 3,000 tons of Liquefied Petroleum Gas, with a total of 5,000 tons of oil. I'm looking at the cargo space of the GDDT-101 vessel for 7,800 tons. How come you've shipped so much cargo? The remaining space should have been filled with some rice, but I see none in the photos you sent.
                    Weigh the hull and contact me right away. Do you have any idea what your vessel will be rated? Do you want to remove some of the oil? Your vessel is large, the last time I was in an all-oil ship was in 2003.

Body: Dear Ramón,

I am puzzled regarding the sea cargo volume aboard my vessel, GDDT-101. According to our agreement, we were to ship 3,000 tons of Liquefied Petroleum Gas and 5,000 tons of oil. However, the current total seems to be 7,800 tons, excluding any cargo of rice which was also supposed to be part of the shipment. There appears to be a discrepancy in what was loaded compared to what has been documented.

Could you please weigh the hull and get back to me immediately regarding this? Are there any updates on the vessel's rating, and was there any consideration to offload some of the oil to adjust the cargo weight?

The credit note is for one of your jobs to Red Star Logistics in January 2013. As you will see from my attached email, you will note that you did not pay the correct amount at the time, although you have now completed payment.                The reason that I have raised the credit note is that I was unable to obtain full payment of the correct amount from your company at the time. The customer service representatives for your company at the time have not been able to offer a full explanation as to why this was so.

Body: Dear Mr. Jones,
I am writing to clarify a credit note raised for invoice number 1234567 (STG 456.78). This credit note relates to a service provided to Red Star Logistics in January 2013. It appears there was an underpayment initially, which has now been rectified. However, the full payment of the correct amount was not possible at that time. Previously, the customer service team was unable to provide a full explanation for this issue. I believe issuing a credit note was the correct action to address this discrepancy.
Kind regards,
Chris

 These replies were received:

The container number is not a mistake. It has been deleted from the manifest. Do you understand this?

No, I do not understand. Why has it been deleted?

I thought I said that I would not use a loaded container to transport coal, because it would not be able to fit everything that was needed to be transported. So I asked for a container with nothing in it, to be used for coal. The cargo manifest is a copy of the order. I do not need a container number, just the description of what is in the cargo.

The cargo manifest lists cargoes that are not in the containers you have sent. You must supply the correct containers.

How can you ask for cargoes if they have already been sent? I will check the numbers, but the cargo manifest has not been updated since you received it.

Subject: Re: Inquiry about Corn Oil Delivery to Xiamen
Timestamp: 2023-03-15 10:45
Body: Hello Edward,

Thank you for your inquiry. Regarding the warehouse and loading costs, we might reduce expenses by using our own facilities in Xiamen rather than relying on the port's services. I can assist in finding a suitable warehouse. This could potentially result in a cheaper arrangement.

Best regards,
Mr. Yi"

Hi Dr. Nakamura,
The shipping details we're looking at were for May. Are you looking at other dates?

Hi Gracie,
Thank you for your email. I will wait for your reply.

This snippet represents two separate emails. The first emails are typical types of emails in any trade conversation. They represent the customer asking for the shipping schedule for May and for the best shipping quote for that date. In email 3, the customer sends the complete address.

The customer appears to have followed up again with an email to ask about a different date. Nakamura responds again by asking to wait for

Hi Gracie,

...[while Nakamura leaves for vacation. Nakamura's email box remains empty for a month, and she does not respond to Gracie's email.]

## 1 Answer

Nakamura would have followed up on the request as soon as possible; Nakamura was probably away on vacation for most of that time, so the email system was empty.

I think Nakamura could have sent an auto-responder or had her colleagues respond to email queries for her, while she was on vacation.

My job as a Process Safety Coordinator for a company operating in various Asian countries, I often have to send emails in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai.  I’ve never needed to be away from my job for an extended period of time.

Donny at Grupo Timsan is offering you 370fob Santos.
Please advise if we are in line with your intention. 
I guess that, if you are willing to buy it, it must be because you have already obtained a 1/1 cargo for January.

Thank you for reaching out and explaining the situation with your orthopedic shoes. It is concerning to hear that your shoes are deteriorating under heavy activities such as basketball or soccer. Even if the materials are the same as other brands, there could be numerous factors affecting the durability, from the quality of the input materials to the specific techniques used in your manufacturing process. We recommend conducting a thorough review of your entire production process and inspecting your material supplies. Additionally, consider whether these activities are recommended for the specific design of your orthopedic shoes.

How about 6,800MT of sugar from Montevideo to Ijmuiden?                    Best,                    Alaric

The seller has given me details of 6,800MT of sugar. Unfortunately, however, they also sent me 3 pictures of the product:              I’m sorry, but these pictures are awful! They’re 60 years old and look like they were taken with a pinhole camera. My boss is an animal and won’t let me buy anything without quality photos, and I think he’s right.

Body: Alaric, I received the details of the 6,800MT of sugar. Unfortunately, the seller provided three pictures of the product that are severely outdated and of poor quality. They appear to be 60 years old and resemble photos taken with a pinhole camera. My supervisor has strict standards for visual verifications and will not approve purchases without high-quality images. Could you kindly request the seller to provide new, high-quality photos of the sugar? It would help immensely in speeding up the decision-making process. Thank you, and please keep me posted on any updates."

• ## Scenario: Case B

You are the commercial manager at AB Degradeant, a big industrial chemical firm. You use Chloroform as a key ingredient in a number of products, and have been quoted an FOB price of US$29,500/MT for buying chloroform from BLS Chemicals in Singapore. A customer has just placed an order for 7,500 MT of Chloroform from you.

Based on the above information, answer the following questions:

1. What price should the CEO propose to the customer (AB Degradeant) for the 7,500 MT order?
2. If the customer is looking for low price, what should be the CEO’s counter-offer to the customer (AB Degradeant) for the 7,500 MT order? Is the offer reasonable or too low? Justify your answer.","From: amber@abdegradeant.com

They need it at a particular time of the year when Pakistan can supply the crops that are in season. The peak months would be April to September or so.  As you are in the meat business you may be able to get them deals and bring them in cheaply. The market is big there.

Dear Friends,                    First of all I would like to thank everyone who has expressed their concern with the recent news that appeared in the press on 6th July regarding Mr. Abraham.

Body: Dear Sir,
A recent article by Mr. Eoghan Rice titled 'Abraham wrote of tax fraud after release' published on 6 July, misrepresents facts about Mr. Maurice Abraham, who has been incarcerated in a U.S. federal prison for the past 5 years. The piece inaccurately reported that the person referred as 'H' and 'O’Toole' wrote the last two letters to 'The Irish Independent' just before the murder of Stephen Trew in 1998. These were allegedly from Mr. Abraham. Furthermore, the article mentioned that Mr. Abraham’s communication privileges were revoked by prison authorities upon discovering his plans to write an exposé on tax fraud, which requires verification.
Best Regards.

Body: Dear Sir,
The information published by Mr. Eoghan Rice regarding Mr. Maurice Abraham appears to be partially investigated and potentially misleading. Mr. Rice's article claims activities and correspondences involving 'H' and 'O'Toole' that allegedly took place weeks before Stephen Trew’s 1998 murder, attributed to Mr. Abraham. Additional checks are necessary to validate these claims, especially regarding the alleged restriction of Mr. Abraham’s writing privileges by prison authorities.

Dear Sir,                    First of all, congratulations on your success and new position at Voyaca.com. I came across your profile on LinkedIn and found you very qualified to assist me in a very urgent matter.                    A few years ago, I employed a ship broker by the name of Brian Hopkin from Thomas Hopkin & Co to help charter a vessel to ship my company's produce from Panama to the West Coast of the USA.                    Unfortunately, a few days into the voyage, the vessel ran aground and was a total loss. Not only did Brian misrepresent his ship owner to be a reputable one, he went ahead and used me to sign up an insurance contract for his own personal benefit, under the influence of alcohol.                    He connived with the insurance company to release his profit after the ship sank but my company is still waiting for its share of the payout. Mr. Hopkin,

Dear Sir,                    At the time, I wasn't aware that he had so much experience in ship brokerage. I learned his dishonesty at the expense of my company. He had forged documents showing a photograph of the vessel to the owners before shipping and didn't tell me about his limited experience as an underwriter. Now I am having trouble recovering the costs of the cargo.                    Can you help me find a reliable ship broker to ship a product from Greece to Rotterdam?

Body: Dear Sir,

Congratulations on your recent success and new position at Voyaca.com. I came across your LinkedIn profile and believe you're well-suited to advise me in a pressing matter. Previously, I hired Brian Hopkin of Thomas Hopkin & Co for chartering a vessel to transport produce from Panama to the West Coast of the USA. The vessel unfortunately ran aground shortly after departure, resulting in a total loss. Brian misrepresented the ship owner's reputation and arranged an insurance policy to his advantage while under the influence of alcohol. He colluded with the insurance firm to secure his profit after the incident, but my company has yet to receive its share. 

I wonder if you might help me find a trustworthy ship broker for a new shipment from Greece to Rotterdam, and perhaps advise on the ideal route and legal safeguards to prevent further mishaps.

Thank you for your consideration.
Best regards,
Cieran

Dear <Receiver>,                    Could you please let me know if you have any space in July for 1,400MT of rice from Houston to New York? The actual ETA is open, so I can arrange it in July if there is a possibility.                    Kind regards,                    Sridhar

The agents can respond to each other immediately as they have all the necessary details for the booking in their possession and do not need to go back to their customers.

Since the offers from buyers and sellers are decentralized, they will not be able to negotiate prices and they will have to agree to the market price and then move on to the next negotiation.

If both agents reply to the sender with the same message, there will be an error because a double response is not allowed in TPN. Thus, there is a restriction against these situations to facilitate the tracking of pending operations.

In the third case, it is possible to get a counter-offer or a quote by the other","From: sridhar@example.com

Email 2:
Hi Kristina,                It's in the $90s/ton (FOB Nola) at the moment. Rates are firm at this level, since very few tonnage is being offered. Also, considering the port congestion in Houston, we would only sign a charter party once we have the deal in hand. Should the charter party contain a destination clause, then of course, it could be signed upon final confirmation.               Regards, Alex

Comment:
Notice the commercial terms are spoken in term of shipping industry currency: MT, t, per ton, etc.
Email 3:
Here in Norway, it's our currency, the Krone, that is used. So here goes our deal in the local currency:

3,300,000/MT (FOB Nola)

A charter party may be drawn up to cover our terms. But, if the MEG should arrive a bit early, we could store the cargo until we need it.

Best, Kris.

Comment:
Here we have the commercial terms expressed in terms of ""3,300,000/MT"" instead of ""per ton"". In our example, 3,300,000 is the same as $90. The reason for the discrepancy is that Kristina, the seller, is located in Oslo, Norway, and the selling price is denominated in Norwegian Krone (NOK). One NOK equals 0.16 USD.

Is it possible for you to fix a vessel this Friday for 3,300 MT of lubricants from Genoa to Haifa? Also, by when would you need the charter party signed? Additionally, I am expecting a rate offer for this shipment. The best offer I have so far is $80 per MT from WFS Energy, received just this morning.

Please note that email 3 is in fact email 2 sent from a different sender (Franklin Malone) to Mohammad Ismail from the sender of email 1.

Note that the sender of email 3 is in the CC of the original email, but the email of the sender of email 3 is not included.

Is it likely that email 3 is from the same person (Franklin Malone)?

I suspect that Mohammad Ismail used Franklin Malone's email address in the TO or CC fields of email 2 and did not include the email of the original sender (Mr. Malone).

Hello Capt. Hu,                    We are organizing a 200,000mt cargo of MGO from Gijon, Spain, to Japan. As you know, it’s a big shipment. In your opinion, are all the suppliers out there able to supply such a big order?                    Also, how long will the loading time take?                    Many thanks,                    Timothy
Email 2:
Dear Tim,             I'm going to refer to my first email response and elaborate as requested.             We’ve never sold that quantity of MGO. Our company is a division of a larger company that has supplied 100,000mt+ to major trading companies in the last few years, so we can do this. The time frame can be negotiated between the supplier and buyer. We usually provide the shipping documents within 10-12 days of the shipment and request payment in cash 4 weeks later. The buyer needs to pay the bank documentary charges within 2 weeks of the shipment.             I think the real trick is to find a supplier who is able to supply this quantity. To find a supplier for 200,000mt who is able to deliver such a big order is quite challenging. The order should be split into two parts, each part being around 100,000mt.
Email 3:
I’ve just learned that the delivery vessel has a limit of 130,000mt and two big ships might be needed. So, 100,000mt of the order might be enough to fill one ship, and the other ship will have to be loaded with the other 100,000mt.             There are many shipping vessels available that can take this amount of cargo. The average delivery time for this kind of shipment is around 45 days, although it’s possible to shorten the delivery time. It depends on the cargo vessel’s available route.             The costs for this shipment can vary from USD 10 to USD 20 per mt, depending on the size of the cargo vessel, the route taken, and the distance the cargo will have to travel.             In conclusion, I think the best course of action is to ship the order in two parts, each part being around 100
Email 4:
I will continue to provide information on how to find a supplier and transport and shipping companies for this type of shipment.             The best way to find a supplier is to contact the local trade association or trade missions in your area. They can help you find a local supplier, and if there’s no local supplier, they can refer you to the association or missions in the destination country.             There are several types of shipping vessels that can take this amount of cargo. The most common types are bulk carriers, tankers, container ships, and Ro-Ro (Roll-on/roll-off) vessels. Each type of vessel has its own advantages and disadvantages.             The most common route is from Europe to Japan. The distance between the two countries is around 7,000 nautical miles, and the voyage can take around 30 days, depending on the vessel’s speed and the weather.

The timeframe, including shipping documentation and payment schedules, can be negotiated directly between the supplier and the buyer. A crucial factor is finding a supplier capable of fulfilling such a vast quantity. Regards, Capt. Hu

Body: I’d like to add that the largest vessels available for this route have a capacity limit of 130,000mt, suggesting the necessity for two ships. The average delivery duration is roughly 45 days, although it varies based on the chosen route and vessel availability. Shipping costs are estimated between USD 10 to USD 20 per mt. Splitting the shipment seems the most prudent strategy. Regards, Capt. Hu

Subject: Supplier and Vessel Information
Timestamp: 2023-03-02 10:30
Body: Continuing from our prior exchanges, I recommend contacting local trade associations or missions for supplier references. In the absence of local options, these bodies can also refer to international sources. Multiple vessel types, including bulk carriers and tankers, suit this cargo size. The most traveled route between Europe and Japan spans approximately 7,000 nautical miles, with the typical journey lasting about 30 days depending on maritime conditions. Regards, Capt. Hu"

Hi David,                    Let’s assume our 4,500MT fixture from Hamburg to Aarhus has settled for a free-out rate of $300/MT. So is that an all-in rate?                    Regards,                    Robert

Dear Robert,                     I see what you’re saying, however, while the quotation has settled for $300/MT the vessel owner is willing to accept $250/MT, and if you don’t agree, he’s willing to pay $300/MT. So it’s all good.                     Regards,                     David

Dear David,                  I hope the direction of this conversation is clear?                     As I mentioned, I have no interest in the vessel owner. My position is clear – to hire the vessel owner is an all-in rate of $300/MT and it is all in. If we agree to hire the vessel owner at a lower rate, the vessel owner has no interest in paying an all-in rate of $300/MT and will in no way agree to that.

In any dialogue it is important to state facts and not omit or conceal important information. This gives room for miscommunication as well as mistrust between the two sides. That’s why it is important to understand how to communicate professionally in business correspondence.

## What is Business Correspondence?

A message sent and received via a written form is known as a business correspondence. It is crucial as it provides information on the various activities of an organization. There are several forms of business correspondence. They include formal business letters, e-mails, and memos.

The letter types might be used to communicate with customers, clients, or employees. Some examples of business correspondence include application letters

They show up in email. When you google “ur5 quickbooks” and “quickbooks error 176109”, you’ll find this email. They are low cost replicas of your computer’s typical shipping and air delivery errors. One reason why they’re so effective is because they’re 100% human-friendly, like “Q: When will the goods arrive? A: Today.”

When you send them back, they’ll respond. These two replies will let you know that someone from them (and not a computer, and certainly not an imposter) is in your inbox.

If you’re not going to send them a reply, or if you’re going to turn

Almarakib's Pakistani captain is low on funds and is able to transport items from our port to Pakistan and earn some quick cash. He's a freelancer by nature, and is more than happy to take on whatever job comes his way as long as he gets his money upfront.<br /><br />2. He is asking for $30,000 upfront. We will take out a loan for the money. We cannot afford the loan. I must sell off my share of the ship to pay it back.<br /><br />I am writing this email on my phone from the bank.<br /><br />I have agreed to let the bank have your share of the ship and pay off the loan.<br","From: nada@example.com

Body: Hello Nada,

Here are the latest developments regarding the vessel Almarakib:

The vessel is currently outward bound, and there are two main reasons for this development:
1. The Captain, who is Pakistani, is low on funds. He has decided to transport items from our port to Pakistan as a freelance venture to quickly earn some cash. He insists on receiving $30,000 upfront.
2. To accommodate his upfront payment request, we would need to take out a loan. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to cover this loan on our own. I'm considering selling my share of the ship to repay the loan.

I'm currently at the bank handling these affairs and have agreed to let the bank claim your share of the ship and use it to handle the loan repayment.

Best regards,
Sada"

Mr. Martin,                    Thank you for your quote. Your quote of $7,350 is a great value for a premium wheat like our MG and we were hoping you would have enough of the stock to allow us to charter your vessel to Dalian to load. When is your next voyage to Dalian?                    If we could charter your vessel directly from your current port, perhaps London, then that would greatly reduce our shipping costs and we would definitely prefer to charter with you. We will arrange for our vessel to load with your wheat and deliver it to Dalian where we will book a voyage to Durban.                    We look forward to hearing from you,                    Olivia

Mr. Martin,                    We note your revised quote is less competitive than your original quote of $7,350. As we stated in our first enquiry we are trying to obtain the best value for our shipment of wheat and it would be unwise to have a new agent. We still hold your initial quote of $7,350 open for the time being.                    Regards,                    Olivia

Body: Mr. Martin, Thank you for your quote of $7,350. Considering the premium quality of our MG wheat, this offers great value. I understand your vessel is currently scheduled to head to Australia, but could we arrange for it to load from your current location, possibly London, and then proceed to Dalian? This arrangement could significantly reduce our costs. Look forward to your advice. Regards, Olivia

Great - you book a 50-foot container, which is not in our scope! Are you sure we have a 50-foot container deal with you? If we had a 50-foot container deal with you, I would've thought you would've offered us the container first because we are an origin based company. Also, I'm not sure what 'book' means in this context. There are not many 50-foot container companies in Canada and if we had a deal with you, I would be sure about that.

Hello Vincente,                    Based on the last year's grain harvest, there will be low supply of wheat this year.                                        I can arrange a wheat shipment in early August from Odessa to Barcelona, and my usual demurrage clause is 300,000 USD.                                        Look forward to hearing from you soon,                                        Tom

Tom,                    Good to hear from you.                    Right now I'm expecting the demurrage fee to be higher than usual, and the insurance premium will increase by 5%.                    I believe we can complete the transaction in early August.                                        Waiting for your reply.                                        Eddie

Yes, we can definitely discuss the details further. Meeting at the cargo port in Bordeaux, coordinates 44.8370° N, 0.5980° W, might be beneficial. Would this location work for you?

Once again, my valued guest and the popular ‘humourous’ founder of the humour site Fuleminess  has raised a very important issue. With the growing influence of multinational business and the Internet, there is a danger of being misunderstood. Particularly when it comes to asking someone a question. With the ever growing number of emails and phonecalls being made globally every second of the day, it is important to ensure your request is heard. 

When sending an email with a question, it is also very important to include a sign off such as “Best Regards” or “Kind Regards” this is because at times a person can read the email very fast and can be assumed that the person sending the email is actually sending them

What are some reasons for replying to an email twice?

Explain how this form of explanation might serve to establish greater rapport

Dear Mr. Ferris,                    My name is Samuel. I’m currently the vessel broker of a Chinese bulk carrier currently in Chittagong, Bangladesh.

Dear Samuel,
Thank you for your email. Unfortunately it is not appropriate for you to pass charges like this on to the cargo owners without their consent. If you are able to provide evidence that this is the owners’ responsibility (e.g. a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo), we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses, but if you are just making up charges to pay your agency then it is unethical and we will not pay you.
Thank you,
Alain Ferris

We have been assigned to load 3,800 MT of heavy plates, destined for Port Louis, Mauritius. We were informed of several port dues and fees, including:

- General Cargo Port Dues: USD 3,256.00
- Coast Guard Charges: USD 164.00
- MFAF (Mauritius Free Airport Fee): USD 112.80

- Empty Tank Cleaning: USD 20.00 (USD 10.00 per tank for 2 tanks)

Could you kindly consider this breakdown when submitting your invoice? We'd appreciate acknowledging these charges in our agreement.

Best regards,

Body: Dear Samuel,

Thank you for your detailed email.

It is important to clarify that passing on such charges to the cargo owners requires their prior consent. If there is documentation (e.g., a bill of lading with a specific clause) that assigns these charges to the owners, we can consider these in our rate discussion. Otherwise, unauthorized charge transfers are not permitted.

Additionally, to provide a more accurate freight quote, could you please supply more details regarding the cargo such as its origin, grade, and product code?

The more comprehensive the information you provide, the quicker we can process it, and the smoother our transaction will be.

Kind regards,

Alain Ferris

Body: Dear Sulek,
Unfortunately, the rate you inquired about in July is no longer available. Due to increases in freight costs since your inquiry, the new rate for September would be approximately $12,000 for 30,000MT. This is significantly higher compared to your initial contract price of $1,300 per MT. Selling your soybean meal at this new freight cost may not be economically feasible.

That's unfortunate news. It appears we cannot proceed under these conditions, as the contract price was only $1,300 per MT. Reducing the price further would result in a significant loss.

1. The Suez Canal plays a crucial role in the global shipping industry, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. However, recent events have caused concerns among vessel operators and shipping companies about delays and increased congestion at the canal.
2. Since the closure of the canal in March due to the Ever Given ship blocking it, operators have been expressing fears of congestion and delays. Despite the reopening of the canal in mid-April, vessels are still facing delays as the backlog of shipping containers and other cargo continues to accumulate.
3. As of May 2nd, there are 67 vessels waiting to enter the Suez Canal, while an additional 55 are waiting to exit. This has led to

Dear (Name),
I hope this message finds you well. I understand that you have some questions regarding the Ever Given ship and the backlog of vessels at the Suez Canal. Let me try to address your concerns.
Firstly, the Ever Given ship was successfully dislodged from the Suez Canal on March 29th, after being stuck for almost a week. However, it remains in the canal until it can be re-fueled and towed to another location for repairs. The process of refueling and repairing the ship is expected to take several weeks.
As for the backlog of vessels in the canal, the congestion has","From: donald@example.com

Body: Dear Sarah, Thank you for reaching out. Indeed, the Suez Canal faced severe disruptions due to the Ever Given ship getting stuck in March. While the ship was dislodged on March 29th and cleared from the canal, it is currently being refueled and prepared for towing to another location for repairs. The backlog of vessels has caused some delays, but traffic flow is steadily returning to normal. Please rest assured we are closely monitoring the situation and will keep you updated on any potential impacts on your shipments. Regards, Shipping Company"

Good day Ms. Kelly,                    I’m inquiring about 3,400MT of sulphuric acid from Aqaba to Khor Fakkan. Could you handle a late-July laycan, and are you open to a short load window?                    Best,                    Aqaba
Email 2:
Hi J. Pye,                    I’m writing you about your question. However, due to some problems with confidentiality, I will have to address this email as being from someone other than me.                    I can handle a late July load date, but you must understand that it may take us a few weeks to secure the necessary permits. You can help speed things along by hiring a third party to find out who the permits are issued to, and to pay them for their services. Your cargo is a noxious substance that has been denied to others in the past, so this must be done delicately. The load window can be as short as 3-4 days, but we’ll have to include that in the permits, too.                    Yours,                    Aqaba

Body: Good day Ms. Kelly,

I am inquiring about transporting 3,400MT of sulphuric acid from Aqaba to Khor Fakkan. Are you able to handle a shipment with a late-July laycan? Additionally, please let me know if you can accommodate a short loading window.

Best regards,
J. Pye

Body: Hi J. Pye,

Thank you for reaching out. We can handle the late July load date for your sulphuric acid shipment. Please be aware that securing the necessary permits might take a few weeks. You can expedite the process by engaging a third party to handle permit arrangements on your behalf. Additionally, the substance's noxious nature might have led to previous denials, so this must be approached carefully. The loading window could be limited to 3-4 days, which we'll need to include in the permit applications.

Best,
Kelly

Since I'm currently out of the office, I’ve compiled some interesting projects and news for everyone to look over:

* Learn about the Fertilizer Institute’s new Code of Conduct, featuring nine guiding principles. It's essential for those dealing with anhydrous ammonia or other fertilizers. Director of Regulatory Affairs, Brian Jennings, advises all stakeholders to read this and disseminate it among their teams.

* A recent meeting with the CARB discussed the 2013 Renewable Fuel Standard proposed by the U.S. EPA in California. As a result, a bill was introduced in the state legislature aimed at providing a tax incentive to enhance renewable fuel blending.

Best,
Steve

Body: Hello team,

We've been encountering some logistics issues around our warehouses, primarily due to weather disruptions. We are reevaluating our fall shipping schedules because of these conditions and some recent order cancellations. As a result, we are experiencing delays in shipping our products, which now includes a delay with our 20-inch rocks to the Southeastern states. We will keep everyone updated as we monitor the weather and adjust our plans accordingly.

Best regards,

Good morning Caroline,

I have checked with my Bitumen supplier.

### Answer options

The correct answer is C.   We need 1,300MT of bitumen


  • A.  We need 1,300MT of bitumen to Chicago                    • B.  I have checked with my supplier                    • D.  Could you name some vessels and a laycan?                    • E.  I wanted to see if we could coordinate our movements to Lyon


The best thing to do when faced with answer options is to try and make as few assumptions as possible. Although the words ""we need"" in the original email suggests a second person, you shouldn't immediately assume that there is more than one person at SEEDOR Company.
Try and identify the people who are talking about the 1,300MT.
The correct answer is ""we"".  So, this 1","From: caroline@company.com

                    We’re meeting with one of our biggest clients on Wednesday so I’d like to sort it out in the next day or two. It’s frustrating as I know they rely on our site. Oh and there are two issues, I’ll send you a video showing the second one.

In my previous post I introduced how the transformer can be used to set up a casual model using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. I wanted to apply this methodology to email correspondence analysis but had no good starting points to learn from. So, I decided to have a go at using a large email data set to set up an email correspondence model. In this post, I’ll describe my method and then evaluate it.
## Previous Work
I found two other email correspondence analyses:
Both papers claimed to have a small error rate (below 5%) but no error rate figures were provided. Their methods included analyzing only the destination of emails and ignoring the subjects and whether the email was replied to or not.

I love that you and everyone else on the website have no idea what it takes to run a successful business. You think it’s as easy as going on constructionobserver and asking for bids. Just how much it costs for a quote and if there is a minimum number of products you have to buy.
I’d say it’s an education. Like how the Navy discovered it would lose too many crewmen if they started a major war without undergoing combat training first, so they decided to create such training so that every year they would lose fewer and fewer crews. Combat training also provided the Navy with the opportunity to evaluate newly created equipment and armaments.

Dear Messrs Rettig and Nogales,                    I hear that you are in talks to form a new entity, can you confirm this?                    It will be good news for the industry if you can demonstrate a joint offer that provides real added value.                    If so, I think it would be a good time for us to consider increasing our volume on HUB.

So, there was this corporation who asked about our storage and delivery cost. First question they asked was about storage cost. I made sure to talk about all different prices based on different quantities and then I explained the storage conditions. I never mentioned that in my price I included free delivery to the factory, in my opinion it is better to ask all questions before talking about details. You do not know what questions they can ask.

I would like to share with you a couple of situations I have recently experienced regarding sales. The main factor here is that every port of origin in this region has its own cargo’s name that differs from one port to another. Let me give you an example. Vung Tau’s oil is usually known as “XONE”, for example. If the cargo’s origin was not Vung Tau, it would be known as something different. In the first email, the seller is probably from Vung Tau, the port

We have, however, to be cautious when receiving information from an agent, because often it is not completely correct. If the agent wants to sell his cargo by using an incorrect cargo name, it is much easier for him to trick the buyer by giving a name that has a higher profit for him, or a name that is more familiar for the potential buyer.

They get a reply to only the last email. There are reasons why they could be having difficulty in getting through to their target. This happens frequently when it comes to end-user targets in emerging markets.
I always leave two days in my inbox to send another follow up email after the first one is sent and then at the end of the day send another one. This seems to work better than the more traditional 3-day/3-email rule.

While we see high open rates, it’s possible that the real target isn’t looking for the product at this time and may not have read the email. You don’t really know for sure unless you get a reply from the target","From: donald@example.com

Confirming availability of 6,800MT carrying capacity for delivery to Yokohama on March 6th. The vessel can depart from Vancouver at 01:00 on Wednesday. We expect it to arrive in Yokohama around 03:00 on Thursday, weather permitting.

Currently, the weather forecast around southern British Columbia shows average temperatures with moderate winds, which should not delay our schedule. However, I will keep you updated on any changes.

* Why the captain and other crew leave the bridge, walk away from the wheel, and forget where the wheel is? Is this typical, or is it just human nature?

 It is not typical. Any crew that is leaving the bridge for more than a few minutes will usually assign a watchkeeper and/or specify exactly where the wheel is. If the owner insists on an automatic pilot watchkeeper, it is up to the captain to comply. But that would not be my recommendation.

* If the vessel is in or near a harbor or channel where there are many vessels and navigating is a challenge, why do the ships leave the bridge and let the ship just drift out of control? Would not knowing exactly where the wheel is be a problem? I am talking about not having a person at the helm ready

* Why the captain and other crew leave the bridge, walk away from the wheel, and forget where the wheel is? Is this typical, or is it just human nature?

 It is not typical. Any crew that is leaving the bridge for more than a few minutes will usually assign a watchkeeper and/or specify exactly where the wheel is. If the owner insists on an automatic pilot watchkeeper, it is up to the captain to comply. But that would not be my recommendation.

* If the vessel is in or near a harbor or channel where there are many vessels and navigating is a challenge, why do the ships leave the bridge and let the ship just drift out of control? Would not knowing exactly where the wheel is be a problem? I am talking about not having a person at the helm ready

 Dear Mr. McDonough,
I am studying for my Mates Certificate and trying to learn more about maritime business. It seems to me that the ""spot cargo"" rates are too low to operate and make money. How do you deal with the low rates?

Thanks!

Timestamp: 2019-07-13 11:45
Body: On Mon, May 20, 2019 at 05:54 PM,

Why do the captain and crew occasionally leave the bridge, seemingly forgetting the wheel's location? Is this a common practice, or just typical human error? It seems crucial especially in busy harbors or channels for a person to always be at the helm.

Thank you for addressing my concerns.

Timestamp: 2023-03-01 10:00
Body: Hi Joe,

Thank you for the update. Can you please provide the ETA of the next vessel into Huizhou following CNJU 0801? If the next vessel is also too full to load our cargo, we need to plan accordingly and potentially consider the following ship in line. Additionally, we would like to book 2 more reefer containers for Huizhou on the next available vessel, possibly on CJP 23002, if it has capacity.

Thanks,
Elliot"

Yours sincerely,                    Margot

Regarding your request, I've checked with an IPA trader here in Houston. He was surprised by the requested tonnage; typically he deals with much larger quantities, like 10,000 tonnes. However, we should still be able to arrange something for 80 tonnes.

1) For your other query: Who can prepare an ISCO from Tuxpan to Veracruz promptly?
2) And could you confirm how much per ton you're anticipating for this rate?

Thanks in advance for your responses.

These are some other terms you need to consider:        – guaranteed loading window 5 days (as a rule, we do 10% out of this time if the barge is ready at the quay or 10% per day extra from our client’s terminal if the barge is not ready at the quay).        – rotation time: 24h maximum        – unloading time: 24h maximum        – total transit time: 48h        – all statutory holidays are considered normal workdays for shippers.        – routing: Oslo-Fredericia-Middelfart-Harsholm-Portland-Jakobsen        –","From: abbie@example.com

Our preferred vessel is the same as the one you recommended previously, but you will have to double-check with T-Sea that the ETAs are correct.

They've also requested a change in the sailing dates for the third cargo: Los Angeles on July 23, 2006, to Busan on August 5, 2006. Could you confirm your vessel's availability for these new dates? Please fax me the original L/C as soon as possible.

Looking forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely,
Miguel"

We should consider that the cost to the shipowners for bunkers is generally higher compared to what we make from selling the bunker in VETSA trades. Additionally, keep in mind that our vessel will be involved in transporting products from Daesan to India before loading jet fuel for Daesan. Therefore, the overall cost including bunker for VETSA trades would be $16.74 US/MT.

I hope this information is helpful. Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: Clarification on Bunker Consumption Costs
Timestamp: 2023-03-01 14:45
Body: Hello Eddie,

If I understand correctly, you're suggesting that an estimate of bunker consumption should be made at the load port (Daesan), reflecting usage only until the vessel arrives at the discharge port. However, it's typical practice that most of the bunker is consumed en route from load to discharge port, and payment for bunker should only cover that segment.

Does this align with our usual practices, or are there adjustments to be made?

Email 2:
dave,                    look at the surface tanker jet fuel route chart on the www and do the calculations. The distance is only 275 miles and if you cut through the shallows then it's maybe only 250 miles.                    With the shallowest part 43 feet, a 35,000 ton tanker would only use about 16' of water to float. If a tanker could travel through the route, I'm sure that the insurance premiums wouldn't be a major problem.                    I could not find any such tanker out there right now so it's not a matter of just connecting the dots.                    The insurance companies would calculate that if there is a loss, there is no place for the ship to refuel on the route, so the insurance rates might be higher.                    Bob

Subject: Tanker Analysis for Jet Fuel Route
Timestamp: 2023-03-10 10:30
Body: Dave,
Please refer to the surface tanker jet fuel route chart available online and perform the necessary calculations. The route is approximately 275 miles, shortened to about 250 miles if we navigate through the shallows. With the shallowest part being 43 feet deep, a 35,000-ton tanker would require about 16 feet of water to float. An appropriate tanker traveling through this route should not significantly affect the insurance premiums, although the absence of refueling options along the route could potentially raise the rates.
Unfortunately, I couldn't locate any available tankers that meet these specs at the moment.
Best,
Bob

Great news, we have secured the vessels for the two 15,000MT loads and are fully booked from the load port until 2022. We’d like to offer you the low end of the range for the bunkering price. Could you please provide the revised cost?

Thanks,

Unfortunately, both loads are booked to August 2022. We can offer the following rate schedule:
$7.4 per metric ton on stevedore fees.
+ 4% over base rate from bunkers.
+ 3% load / discharge port fees.
We can send the commercial invoice in two weeks.

Thank you,

As additional information, Geary Tankers B.V. has limited experience with HFO cargoes. For your reference, here are some previous case examples:

It’s a fast service, it takes about 14 days from loading in the US to discharging in Turkey. If you’re interested in shipping from Houston, it’s an 11 day trip to Antalya. All of these routes can be served from one of our 3 weekly services. For a monthly schedule, please visit our website. We don’t accept individual bookings, so you would need to find a freight forwarder or consolidator to place your booking.

Hello Owen,                    Our Australian customer wants to ship some powdered milk from Port Botany in Sydney to Tokyo. The contract says 2,500MT, but they might also require 1,500MT of grain. This order will leave in the first week of July. We need your help.                    How much would shipping 4,000MT of both goods together cost, and do you see any risk of port congestion?                    Many thanks,                    Ivy

Hi Ivy,
Good morning.

The order for 2,500MT should be easy to manage.
Regarding the order for 1,500MT of grain, unfortunately, we do not see any vessel available to fit both cargoes in the same vessel. As we are still in June, there are still some free slots available on July, but as the order size is so big, we have limited choices.
That being said, we can manage to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain in the same vessel with the owner of a 10,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge the previous cargo in July. All details about the vessel are as follows:

M/V T1
Type    General Cargo
Flag    Liberia
Call    MOYO
Deadweight    8,600MT
Built    1996
Hold No
Email 3:
Regarding the risk of port congestion in Australia, I'm afraid the situation is getting worse and that it may be difficult to find a slot for such a big order. Also, the railway terminals are overloaded as well.
I know the situation seems very bad. I can only offer you the best available. If you are willing to wait till October, I can offer you a better slot with more space. This way, you will be able to fit more products, or reduce the price.
What do you think?
Email 4:
Thank you for your help. The information you provided is very useful to us. 
We want to ship the 4,000MT cargo in early July. We do not have enough storage capacity, so if we delay the delivery, it may lead to the depreciation of our goods, so I'm afraid we can only choose the original plan.
Also, we will have more orders to deliver in July. Can you please help us?
Waiting for your reply!

Hi Ivy,

I understand that you have to deliver the order at the earliest opportunity, and that you can't wait till October. I'll look for a slot in September for you.

Please find attached a quotation for 3,000MT and 4,000MT. We can ship 1,000MT in July and 2,000MT or 3,000MT in August. I can fit 2,000MT on a 6,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September and 3,000MT on a 6,500dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September as well.

Hello, George
I have received your e-mail. Thanks for asking us for this enquiry.
This is my first reply to you.

First of all, can you give me the type of coal you plan to ship (NSC, ARA, etc.) and also the port of loading at Barry (BPT, UKCOAL, etc.)

The best way is to proceed with time charter.
Most of shipping companies are hard to find the right vessel because of a lack of high specification open cargo handlings. However, I can check and suggest you to you.
I will try to provide you the following details:
1. The vessel that is available in market
2. The cost estimate

Please feel free to contact me anytime and I will be delighted to be of assistance.
Thank you very much.

Thank you for your reply.

Currently, there is a lot of vessels available in the market. But most of them are low specification and the area of coverage can't fit with your requirement.

If it is no problem, can you give me the delivery port of discharge (namely, the name of the country of discharge).

Dear Ms. Ghosh,                    My group is sourcing 25,000MT of rubber from Shanghai to Salem. We can be very flexible on loading, but need to know your thoughts on two possible shipping methods:                    1. 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. How much extra would be this compared to a typical voyage at your current market price?                    2. 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev. Is there any discount available if we book these voyages for 2016 as well?                    Sincerely,                    Sarah

Dear Sarah,                        Glad to get your inquiry. Actually, I have just sent an email regarding the new liner service through Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode to VRS China. Let me know if you get that. I am not sure about the sea transport to India since I am not from that dept. But I would like to go for the FCL rate of Hoegh Autoliner as there is an attractive rate by these carriers.                    One of my friends of Taiwan is also very interested in this carrier. She will go for 10/20 cbm containers. But they were waiting for the government’s final approval. Anyway, please wait for our China dept’s advice.                    Any other queries please contact me at any time.                    Have a nice day!                    Yours faithfully,                    Rita Lee

Subject: 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode?
Rita,   I got your message about Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. Thank you for the offer! Do you have any indication on the timing of the service? In addition, do you think I should consider 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev as well? I did not include those carriers in the original email because my thinking was that they are more suitable for 2016. Still, the volumes will be the same for both years. Sarah


In this email exchange, Sarah was mainly interested in the future developments of Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. She also mentioned that she wanted to discuss an alternative carrier, Golden Highway and Damleev.

Body: Dear Ms. Ghosh,

My group is currently looking to source 25,000MT of rubber from Shanghai to Salem. We are quite flexible on the loading schedule but are exploring two possible shipping methods:
1. A 50/50 split shipment via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. Could you please provide how much extra this option would cost compared to a typical voyage at your current market rate?
2. A 33/67 split shipment via Golden Highway and Damleev. Can we avail any discount if we opt for this for 2016 as well?

Looking forward to your guidance.

Sincerely,
Sarah

Body: Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your inquiry. I have forwarded your request to our China department for detailed advice as it pertains to the use of Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode, as I recently handled a similar query for another client. As for the sea transport to India, although it's not my direct area, I would recommend considering the Hoegh Autoliner for competitive rates.

I shall update you once I receive a response from our China department. Feel free to reach out with any additional queries in the meantime.

Have a great day!
Yours faithfully,
Rita Lee

I received your message and appreciate the update on Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. Could you also let me know the anticipated timing for this service? Additionally, should I also consider the Golden Highway and Damleev routes for both 2015 and 2016, given that the volume requirements would remain the same for both years?

Thanks,

Hi Jeremy,                   Thank you for the detailed information. The Port of Elizabeth is basically a bit “rustic”. Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h. We can also do up to 2,000 mt/h if the coal can be delivered to the berth quickly and easily.

Be advised that in March, the water in the port will be very low. Because of","From: brian@example.com

Hi Edward,
What about using a multi-purpose dock, such as Port Natal?
They have the most advanced docking equipment and their crews are very experienced.
They are also one of the fastest ports in the world and have an average unloading time of 15 minutes per ship.
The other option is to go for the third-party port.
I know a company called “Aloha Stevedoring” who can handle your requirements.
It is the best port in the world, with the best ships and docks.
All the best,
Cory

Hi Cory,
I have been discussing this matter with a friend who lives near our terminal.
They have just opened a new terminal that can handle 2,600 meters and 6,500m³ cargo capacity.
They are looking to expand, so they are trying to get some quality help.
I think they would be interested in doing some work for you.
The only problem is that their terminal is in the Philippines.
If you would like to speak to them directly, then just let me know.
Best regards,
Edward

Subject: Inquiry about Crane Capacity and Service Time
Timestamp: 2022-10-14 10:59
Body: Dear Ms. Bennett, As a stevedore, you have access to ample cranes and loading equipment. I'm aware that most shipping companies prefer to hire their own personnel for discharge operations. Our company is known for efficient berthing and cargo handling, ensuring smooth operations. Could you share your experience with crane capacities at your ports and provide an estimate on service time for ships with dimensions of 2,600 meters and a cargo capacity of 6,500m³? Thank you, Edward

Body: Hi Edward, Thank you for reaching out. Unfortunately, neither our terminal nor yours has cranes capable enough for such large ships. However, we do share common interests with the island of Grande Comore, benefiting from a reputable port with quality equipment and avoiding overloading. Shall we explore third-party companies with the capability to handle these large ships? Looking forward to your suggestions. Best regards, Cory

I have a ship available.           36,000 MT = 36,000 ton x 1,000 kg/ton = 36,000,000 kg = 3,600 m3 at a density of 1 ton/m3                    The ship can carry 5,500,000 litres.                    5,500,000 litres x 1 m3/1,000 litres = 5,500 m3                    Let me know if this is suitable.                    The shipment costs US$100,000 (can be deducted from the commission that you pay to me)                   36,000 MT = 36,000 ton x 1,000 kg/ton = 36,000,000 kg = 3,600 m3

The price per litre is $10, so 5,500 m3 of ethanol is worth US$55,000.
The net profit for the shippers is US$55,000 - US$100,000 = US$55,000.
Let me know how you feel about this arrangement. 
Best regards,

If this offer from the shippers is accepted, I will issue a commission invoice to you (as agent) as follows:

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. We’ve been dealing with an issue concerning the vessels’ bills of lading. 
I understand your cargo will be subject to an inspection at the port of discharge.  Since this is out of our control, you should contact your 
broker or agent to determine the inspection’s requirements, including duration and time of day for the inspection.  The bill of lading, while you 
were out, contained a statement stating we were responsible for the inspection's duration.  We subsequently deleted that paragraph.
We understand your client will be taking full responsibility for their merchandise at the port of discharge. Therefore, they should assume responsibility 
for ensuring that their merchandise clears customs.  We understand that you are working with our agent at the port of discharge to file the necessary documents

discharge to make sure all of the necessary documents are filed in order to clear the cargo.
                 As requested, I will also forward a copy of the bill of lading to you and hope to have a firm confirmation of the inspection schedule

Hello Sir,                    Do you think a big container ship will be built in China? Is it better to own a small ship or to own an interest in a large container ship?                    Thank you,                    Andre

Dear Sir,
Since my last letter, I have been reading a
book on Containership Business and i have a
lot of ideas.
Here is one of them. Will a large container
ship be built in China? Is it a good
investment to own a small container ship or
to own an interest in a large ship? I
believe that the container shipping industry
will get better and better. At this time, the
shipping market is very strong.
Here is the conclusion:
It is better to own a small container ship
than to own an interest in a large container
ship. We should stick to our belief.
Thank you,
Andre

I hope this message finds you well. I am curious about the construction of large container ships in China and wish to understand the better investment option between owning a small container ship and owning a partial interest in a larger one.

Subject: Further Insights on Container Ship Investments
Timestamp: 2023-01-22 09:15
Body: Dear Sir,

Following our previous correspondence, I have further educated myself by reading more on the container ship business. This research leads me to ask whether you think a significant container ship project is underway in China. Considering the robust state of the shipping market, I am evaluating the merits of differing investment scales in this industry.

From my readings and current market analysis, I lean towards the recommendation that owning a small container ship is more advantageous than holding an interest in a large vessel. Our strategic focus should continue to rest on this belief.

Thank you,
Andre

Subject: Conclusion on Container Ship Investment Strategy
Timestamp: 2023-01-29 10:20
Body: Dear Sir,

Further contemplation and research on our discussion about container ship investments have solidified my viewpoint. Holding ownership of a small container ship presents a more stable, long-term benefit compared to a partial stake in a larger ship. This conclusion stems from both market trends and the strategic positioning it offers.

Please consider my advice as you make future investment decisions in this area. I look forward to your thoughts or any decisions you might lean towards.

Hi Mia,

Thank you for writing to us. However, I am sorry to say that we cannot offer you freight estimate for this shipment. It is best if you can first talk to your supplier to get the CIF price of this shipment. Then we can offer you freight estimate.

You can use PNP to shorten the time for expression. For example, to say

""we are thinking of shipping X amount of crude oil from A to B"", ""We'd like to buy X amount of crude oil from A to B"", etc.

The PNP here is the “thinking of shipping”, “wanting to buy”, and the rest of the action words.

When to use balticdirties ? Use balticdirties only if no other time charter data is available (e.g. in freight rate calculations). Typically, the day and time you check are important (e.g. if there is a tidal window). Do not use balticdirties in company charter party clauses if you have a term charter party clause. Use balticdirties at all other times. For example, if you are estimating spot freight rates between two ports and two locations, and you only

Let me make sure I'm understanding you correctly. Are you requesting that we **decompose** two decades of the same dataset into a much more manageable number of, say, three to four *decades*, so that I can apply this new algorithm to the entire dataset with more manageable storage?

I'm not quite sure what you mean by **""decompose** the first 10 years,"" but I'll guess that you are asking me to compress the first 10 years of data down to a smaller amount. If that is your request, I'll note that the changes in the dataset have slowed considerably, so I would expect that the 11th decade would have a smaller compression than the 10th decade.

Thanks for your email and apologies for my delay in replying. I don’t think that there is an issue with the cargo in Liberia, it is no longer onboard the vessel but I have sent you a scan of a document from the shipping line saying that they can assist with releasing the cargo. It’s my feeling that there is a bureaucratic delay in Liberia and you might have to employ a solicitor to assist, do you have any ideas about that? Best regards, Scott

Don’t worry about the rest, I’ll handle it.

The expressions and sentences in each of the four emails are different and so the email might not be a good example of phishing attack.

=> i removed the word 4 after 1,000 MT in the email
After doing so, the two first emails have a similar structure and are difficult to distinguish.
=> Could you explain why?
=> Since 4 was removed, the emails could be written by two different persons. So 1,000 MT was not indicative of who wrote the email.

If you are in direct contact with the buyer, please try to get the material specification. In this case, you need to be direct and say that you cannot send a freight quotation without that document. If they ask about the freight quotation first, share a rough estimate with a mention that it will be updated when you have the material specification. The buyer should realize that this is the only way for you to take an offer. It is your first line of defense against waste of time. Other brokers might not understand that they need to ask for the material specification because they do not have a ""ship"" yet, so they can only discuss price and laycan. This is very wrong, but I am sure it happens.  If you are an agent, you should receive the material specification from the buyer. If you don't have it, call your counterpart to discuss this.

Thanks Pauline,

I checked the schedules and I think you mean the Commodore. This is our weekly spot cargo service, loading containers for France.

The Commodore berths at the South Container Terminal but we can't berth there this week. There are no slots available and the berths have to be occupied in a particular order.

South Container Terminal berths are occupied in this order:
5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 6

This week we have the Commodore coming in from Kingston on Wednesday. This is the first available berth for that vessel so we are expecting her to be berthed at 6 South. The ship is due to sail to Cherbourg on Friday night.

I hope this helps.

Dear Mr. Ernest,
                    The ""Coastline"" is currently berthed at Kakinada on Indian coast and I expect to receive her draft survey report on or about the 25th. Her charterers are currently assessing the bunkers required by the vessel for Singapore, however, we may be able to depart the previous fixture for Singapore as early as the 26th March.
                    As far as ballast conditions are concerned, your charterers could also try ""Coastline's"" current charterers (i.e. ""Sambalino"" of the same owners) as they will be arriving from a short haul fixture at the moment and may be in a position to proceed immediately to the loading port in ballast. Alternatively, you may wish to proceed ballast and obtain fuel in advance of loading.

Her charterers are assessing the bunkers needed for the voyage to Singapore, but we might be able to depart for Singapore as early as March 26th.

Please visit our website at http://www.singarama.com.sg for more information, or send me an email with further details of the cargo and ship so we can proceed.

A short while ago you offered to carry goods in my behalf to Durban, I was to pay you US$2800. Well I did but have never heard from you or your company. Now I'd like to get your response please? Have you received the money, is it in my favour? I'd really appreciate your swift response, thanks.

Rudi, thanks for your patience. A certain cargo of ours failed to get through customs in South Africa, as a result I could not send you the money. We tried the next day but the problem persisted. I have only just spoken to the customs people, they've agreed to do me a favour - the cargo in question is ours, but the papers are in the name of a different company. They've agreed to let the goods out so I can get hold of my money. If I can get my money in a few days, I'll send you the money and make arrangements for it to reach you.

Hello,                                        There is a problem with the roof of my house and I'm not sure what to do about it. When it rains, the water leaks through the roof into my bedroom. We had a leak a few years ago when it rained really hard, and our home insurance paid for a new roof. However, the leaky roof was not included in our insurance policy. I am wondering if I should hire someone to fix the roof or if there is some other way that I could fix it myself. I am not a professional, but I am fairly handy and I am not afraid of doing a bit of hard work.

Hi Lyle,                    We’re considering shipping 35,000 metric tons of lumber from Vancouver to Inverness. Can you advise us about the import restrictions for pine?                    Warmly,                    Logan

Hi Logan.                    Thanks for your email.                    Unfortunately, the shipping of pine from Vancouver to Inverness is banned by law. I’m afraid we’re going to have to pass on your shipment.                    Lyle

### ID or OID for the Importer?

Actually, there’s an alternative – the business needn’t try to find out whether the lumber is in compliance with U.S. law, but simply can certify to that effect. A problem arises in distinguishing between logs and lumber, and lumber that has been cut and sawn and lumber that is not sawn. And even a commitment to pay for a formal inspection would not be sufficient to get past U.S. Customs’ questions. So, when the importing country wishes to assure itself that U.S. law is being complied with, the issuing country may provide an assurance in the form of an import certificate, an export certificate,","From: logan@example.com

Body: Following up on our earlier email, there is an alternative approach. Your business could certify compliance with the import regulations without explicit inspection from U.S. authorities, though it requires careful documentation. Common issues arise in distinguishing between logs and processed lumber. Even a commitment to pay for a formal inspection might not suffice to clear U.S. Customs without such certificates. An import or export certificate issued by the country of origin could be a viable way to demonstrate legal compliance. Let me know if you would like more details on this approach. Best, Lyle"

Dear Ms. Manwell,                    Thank you for your enquiry. We have provided you with a proposal for the movement of 6,000MT of LNG from the US Gulf to Antwerp in July. The price for the cargo at the level mentioned in the proposal is on the basis of a fixed FOB rate. We can also offer this cargo with a FCN, however, this is calculated on the basis of a CBM charge of 1.20 per CBM based on the CBM declared on the cargo. In both scenarios the CIF rate is fixed, and cargo would be delivered to the discharge port on the same day.

Thank you for your enquiry. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the availability of tugboats at Muara Berau due to limited resources. However, our vessel is currently en route from Muara Berau towards Pulau Belawan and we estimate its arrival back at Muara Berau on May 13.

There are no vessels immediately available at Muara Berau for the next few days. To minimize your waiting time, we have identified a tugboat service company near Jakarta, approximately 12 hours from Muara Berau. Their rates are higher than our usual services but they can guarantee availability within 48 hours. Would you like us to proceed with this option? Please confirm your decision.

Thank you for your offer. Could we have a formal charter party agreement in place by this Friday? Additionally, we need to finalize cargo operations by next Tuesday. I was also able to secure various other shipments: 20,000MT of methanol from Jubail, 3,500MT of jatoba planned for delivery by June 7th, and 5,000MT of caustic soda expected by May 23rd.

However, for this charter, I can only commit to 7,000MT and propose a one-year agreement with a 60% hold option. Also, please note the vessel's credit rating will improve sequentially from 4 to 6, and then stepwise from 7 up to 12. I'll endeavor to adjust the credit rating from 10 to 6, coordinating with a colleague.

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you so we can proceed to formalize it.

Notice how the email itself doesn't go into the input? That's where everything gets tricky. If you're using input with the type of email, then you should just do the following:

For starters, if you're using Angular 2, you'll want to import FormsModule.

Like so: import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
Next, you'll need to add FormsModule to the imports array in the @NgModule declaration.

Like so: imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule ],

And you'll need to add [email] to the input tag.

This will give you an input that looks something like this:

Finally, ensure your input tag is correctly formatted, for example, <input type='email'> which sets the input’s type to email.

Body: Dear Phyllis, It appears you are seeking quotes for the shipment of 30,000MT of gasoil from Houston to Singapore. The most suitable vessel type would be a Suezmax due to size constraints, which we can arrange from Houston. The latest quotation for a Suezmax vessel from Houston to Singapore as of April 28, 2005, is as follows: Vessel holds up to 130,000 m3, with a deadweight tonnage at 0.8 Tpc, sulphur content of 4.2% and a maximum of 130 ppm S, viscosity not exceeding 60 ppm. Residue must not exceed 2% of cargo by weight, with an additional maximum of 0.5% for other elements. Please confirm whether this meets your requirements. Sincerely, Vladimir

I was interested in your article about refelective materials in Nature.                                         You had two equations for refractive index in the article.                                         I am trying to find a proof or derivation of one of those (the one that uses lambda and n) and wanted to see if you knew of a reference for it.

Hi!

Thank you for your message. The equation n=1-sqrt(1-f)/2 is a very general one. It can be found in most books on electromagnetism and optics. I wrote down the reference where I first came across this equation in my Nature paper. Have a look at page 3. But you can also find it in more recent books on plasmonics. For example in a book by Jain.

Hello.

Do you have any notes or references for derivation of the equation, f2=1-2n, when n=4*Pi/lambda*d*n*d?

Hi Daniel,

Your question is not directly related to this particular website, therefore I think I'll reply in an email.

The only literature I can think of are two references you probably already have found yourself:

(1)  P. Drude, Handbuch der Radiologie, Leipzig: Barth, 1922 (p. 369)

(2)  N. Jain, C. J. Kryzhanovsky, and C. H. Chen, Excitation and Detection of Surface Plasmons on Gold Films. In: T. Zimmermann, and A. Berger, eds., Coherence, Statistics, and Quantum Optics IV (Springer, 2005) 146-165

Drude's book is basically the bible on metallic materials in

Subject:  Re: f2=1-2n

Hi Wim.

Thanks for your reply. I found that references and have already read them but I was looking for a clearer derivation that shows how the refractive index in that form, d*n/d, gets related to the frequency, lambda, and amplitude of the refractive index.

Thanks.

Daniel

Hi Daniel,

I am not sure that there is a clear derivation that you are looking for. You can find it in some other books, but I doubt that you will be very happy with it, since the derivation would be so clear.

I would be very happy if someone from the audience of this website can help you by giving a clear derivation of f2=1-2n.

RE: [ANOTHER EMAIL OF THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER] - REMOVAL OF ASSETS FROM CONTROLS OF ABC

Dear Ms. Flippo,

I was copied on your email yesterday to Mr. Frank and Messrs. Calloway and Vaughn. Please be advised that pursuant to Section 14.4 of the Purchase Agreement dated November 4, 2004, we have placed certain assets that are subject to the asset transfer agreement that you recently sent over to us in our depository at 15 York St., in Toronto, to await the return of those assets to ABC. These assets are detailed in a list attached to our email of December 14, 2004, (see attachment A). I assume these are the assets that are under your custody. If you have any objections to this deposit, you must advise us

[RECEIVED AT TIME OF EMAIL]
Dear Mr. McGroarty,
Thank you for your email. Please be advised that we have no objections to the list you provided to us. However, the list in question has not been previously reviewed by the Board of Directors of ABC and therefore we are unable to provide you with any information regarding the specific assets. It is our understanding that our list does not conform to the requirements of the Sale Agreement, particularly since the list reflects that we are permitted to retain certain files and information despite the fact that we are prohibited from using or retaining any ABC Confidential Information, as set out in the Sale Agreement. This is a concern to our Board of Directors.

Please be advised that your proposal to place certain of our assets in a depository pending return to ABC is inappropriate and contrary to the terms of the Sale Agreement. Specifically, Section 2.1(a)

I just spoke with Martin but I was copied on the email below. 
    Today is December 17th, 2004 and we continue to have no approved and executed sale agreement. In the meantime, ABC is purging all of our assets and information, and sending same to various unidentified third parties and law firms. 
     We simply cannot accept these proposals in light of ABC's wrongful purging of our assets. All of the discussion contained in your email is irrelevant in light of the purging. Please provide us with a confirmed list of all assets that have been sent to third parties and their names.

Hi Hugo,                    I've found some documentation from the 1970s that state there was still a fair amount of containers transported by steam ship, despite being a less economical way to transport containers.

Hi Christa,                    That is no doubt true. Steam ships are extremely dangerous for the containers, even the newest containers.

If I recall correctly, the original contract specified only containers shipped by steam ship.

Indeed, this is a valid concern. I've reviewed some historical documentation from the 1970s that states steam ships were still a common mode of container transport, despite their inefficiencies and higher operation costs. It's an important aspect to consider.

What do you think?

That observation is accurate. The operation of steam ships, especially the vibrations from steam engines and potential leaks from the boilers, presents a high risk of damage to most containers in transit. This underlines the necessity of transitioning to modern container ships for better safety and efficiency.

               I will call you later today to discuss this and to arrange for a flight to Mumbai. As you know, we need to be flexible on the types of urea and quantities, but please feel free to send a list of your requirements. We are anticipating that we may receive it in three or four shipments, so that may be something to consider. Please also provide us with a list of the vessels that you have available.

We have a cargo of 12,000MT of urea that needs shipping from Pengerang to Las Palmas in September. Historically, the Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF) was around $120/MT, but due to recent changes, we expect variances. Please be advised that if a vessel with high Gross DeadWeight (GdW) is used, it will likely impact the schedule and might cause delays.

Dear <MANUEL>,
I have good news and bad news. The good news is that I have the freight prices
for Miami to Aruba, and the bad news is that the prices are sky high.
I'll be happy to help with the planning of the move, but I'm afraid that there is
no way that you can make that transport by boat. Unless you want to take a
steamer to South America and leave your lumber there, I would suggest that you
wait until the next hurricane season, when you'll find the rate a little bit lower.
Good luck with the move.
Best wishes,
Paul

Body: Hello Noa,

Thank you for reaching out with your questions.

Regarding your query about the vessel's operations from Gdynia to Liverpool, it is generally not feasible for a vessel to complete both loading in Gdynia and unloading in Liverpool on the same day due to the transit time required. Please let us know if there are specific dates or arrangements you are considering.

As for the pilot services, it is correct that pilots are mandatory for tankers in Sulzheim and Ettlingen. Additionally, in all Rhine region terminals, pilot services are required for vessels over a certain draft or without a canal-certified ship's master. Regarding the EUROTUG pilotage fees, they vary based on the draft length of the vessel. We suggest contacting EUROTUG directly for the most accurate fee estimate.

Please do not hesitate to get back to us with any further queries or specific vessel details.

Dear Mr. Gianfranco,                    The staff has been working hard to find out if we can get you the vessel for the required time.

Thank you for your email. We can indeed deliver the import cargo under EXW terms, though our suppliers can also handle CIF terms. However, since our cargo is already loaded and considering the potential increase in transportation costs under CIF, we prefer EXW for this shipment.

Regarding the bill of lading, could you specify whether providing a copy before the cargo's arrival poses any issues? Additionally, as we are supplying high-technology components and your export will be the final user, we are unsure about how to complete the other documentation.

If the next trip is too late, please consider the Tuna/Excelsior/Metal which are not ideal but are at least 3/4 capacity as we have yet to book Africa with Metocean.                    Regards,                    Tim
                    
This email was handed to me on my second day working in the Middle East. It was by far the biggest amount of confusion and annoyance that I had to deal with. I was originally meant to receive the request and push the execution to the Trade desk. However, I thought this was a time sensitive request and without any knowledge of weather and Middle Eastern conditions, I decided to respond via email. This was my first mistake.
            Considering that the deadline was mid-April, 6 weeks away","From: jeremy@tradingco.com

Body: Hello Gloria,

Upon reviewing your options, could we explore a routing that includes a stopover in Honolulu on the return trip? Previously, you mentioned the limitation of stops. Please confirm if this is a possibility or suggest any alternative with a new quote.

Best regards,

As per airline regulations, the maximum number of stops allowed is two. Unfortunately, incorporating Honolulu as a stopover is not possible under the current policies. If you are considering different options, I would be happy to assist further.

Dear Mr. Gary,                       Unfortunately, the charter company was unable to transport your oil. Since most of the tankers are currently transporting oil for themselves, there are only a few ships available. Please be patient, and I'll get you a quote by the middle of next week.                    Best wishes,                    Ms. Liang

Hello X,                    We want to charter a vessel to transport 2k MT of petroleum coke from Baku to Qingdao, China. Do you have any ship open in November?                    Regards,                    [name]

What is the task?                    The task is to find an empty container, go to China (pay 0.19$/MT + 0.05$/MT bunker) and bring petroleum coke to Azerbaijan (20k MT, 100% B/L paid, sailing in November).

The main question for this task is, does the company have a vessel available to take the cargo?

What technique(s)
Email 3:
The main trick is to make this task look like it is for open charter. This makes the victim pay attention to the price, believing it is actually lower than the price of the chartered ship (by the way, let's make it 0.19$). By saying that you will pay 0.05$/MT for bunker, the victim thinks you are buying bunker, while you are actually renting the vessel.

    Also note that the shipping cost (0.19$) is given to the nearest part of the fourth decimal place, which might look suspicious if the sender and receiver have different countries. It is a very good trick to make such mistakes, as I did in email 2, or even in email 1 if the victim is inexperienced. It makes the victim think he is comparing two similar offers, which they are not, and look bad for not noticing it. Finally","From: client@example.com

If you have space for bitumen, this is a good email to reply to, but don’t offer any products you don’t have or you won’t have space for. Any mention of bitumen is a potential client.
If you don’t have space but can offer bitumen, this is good too.

In response, Phil suggests a better ETA of 7-9 months, which is much longer than what Muffy wants. However, she is also aware that they are trying to work with Luen Marine and suggests that they wait until they have a better ETA before proceeding with Luen Marine.

What is the cargo size on barge. Is there any chance it could fit the 2100Te vessels for Colombo. Can you send the gear? In the meantime, I tried to find some data, but couldn’t. I remember that you told me the bitumen will be shipped at 5MT, 6MT 7MT & 8MT in drums of 220L and 200L. Is it like that? If yes, could you confirm with the client that it can be shipped at 6MT per drum.

Dear Sir/Madam,                    We’d like to transport 2,900MT of cotton to Ghent from Huangpu. Could you let us know your best available rate, and do you work on a FCA basis?                    Thank you for your time,                    Henry

Dear Clark Chen,                     I am glad to hear from you. You could try any carrier please. If they have empty sailings, they would be happy to carry our goods, for our cargo is different from other goods, we transport it through containers instead of using trucks, so our goods are more sensitive.                     Let me know if you have questions or suggestions.                     Thank you!                     Henry

Dear Clark Chen,                     Thanks for your reply. Could you tell me which is the best choice? Our cargo usually transports at least 100,000 tons at a time. Is it better to transport by the whole container or shipper’s owned container?                     Please let me know if you have questions or suggestions.                     Thanks for your time!                     Henry

Just to clarify, we typically transport our cotton in containers rather than using conventional trucking methods, due to the sensitive nature of the goods.

Thanks for your quote. Some further information:                    The rice would be shipped over a number of months but we would like the price to be fixed for all of the months.

         What is your port name?
         _________________________
         How many m3 of crude oil will you send? 250 m3
         _________________________

I would like to know that the distance between New York and London by water is around 4550 miles. From your blanks, you will need about 64 hours to reach London if the ship moves 100 miles per day. In this case, we can conclude that if the ship arrives in 65 hours, it will be one hour late.

Based on the data provided, the distance from New York to London by water is approximately 4550 miles. If the vessel travels at a speed of 100 miles per day, it would typically require about 64 hours to reach London. Consequently, a delay of one hour would result in an arrival time of 65 hours.

The problem is at both ports but the previous schedule is for Ubon Ratchathani, Muang district Chiang Rai, and on July 10th Busan and Yangon with repositioning fees due to charterer.  This vessel is sub chartered out to another charterer.

This was flagged by email as it was coming from an unknown sender. User profile was inspected and found to be empty. It was sent through Rapid Mailer (Mandrill)

However, it did contain a tracking number to an item that the sender said had been sent from the USA, which has led to this email. So this would likely come from some sort of automated mailer.

The files appear to be some sort of ""GET mail spambot"" or maybe a B2B mailer system.

As requested, I am including a snapshot of our web portal as it appears today. It contains information about the markets in which Karen trades, and the freight rates for each trade. The portal also shows how certain factors, such as market volatility, can affect rates. Each sector displays a current snapshot of freight rates for each of the areas that Karen can trade, and a visual map indicating rate fluctuations. Also, freight rates appear in a moving graph which shows trends over the last 30 days. This is quite beneficial for traders who have to make decisions based on live market conditions. 

Another important function is the ship and route selector. When a ship trader selects a specific ship, the system shows in green or red the rates and savings for that specific ship on each route. This helps traders determine which ship and which route to select.

Finally, a major aspect of the technology is the asset manager,

Thank you very much for the quick response and information.
How do I understand this correctly? The screenshot shows the C/P from Damietta to Koper. The C/P for the voyage Damietta -> Koper is 3.25/3.70 points less compared to the CP for the same route from Rotterdam -> Damietta. This makes a total difference of 3.625 to 5.375 $/day (depending on the grade). Since the ship owner is not willing to fix the voyage for the entire laycan, but only until next week, I can't make any changes to the CP.

That's good news. 15,000MT of EVA resin from India to Taiwan. It sounds much better.

But we have a problem: I just learned that the customer in Turkey and the customer in Taiwan are the same. It's just a customer's secondary office. I don't think they will need that much EVA resin in both places at the same time. If it's like 15,000MT, I'm afraid they will cancel the order.

But we have a problem: I just learned that the customer in Turkey and the customer in Taiwan are the same. It's just a customer's secondary office. I don't think they will need that much EVA resin in both places at the same time. If it's like 15,000MT, I'm afraid they will cancel the order.

Nick,

I have talked to my customer and I was right: The secondary office is an independent operation. There is a limit of 10,000MT per office. We'll need to divide the shipment between the two offices. Can we split it? And can we lower the freight rate? This would help us get a better offer.

<Email 3>:
Email 1:
Nick,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate your ideas.

We're going to divide the shipment between the two offices. This means we'll need two ships and twice as many containers. I think it would be better to get a better freight rate. Is $10.5 per MT too much? <Email 3>:
Email 1: Nick,

That's a relief, the 10,000MT limit per office. I'm thinking 7,000MT to Taiwan

Hi Nick,

That sounds much better. We're going to change the quantity to 7,000MT. Let's see what your customer says. The last time, he wasn't convinced.

<Email 4>:
Email 1:
Nick,

Great! 7,000MT. But one more question. The buyer in Taiwan doesn't need to take the full 7,000MT. He has the room for just 6,000MT. Can we get a better rate with just 6,000MT?

<Email 4>:
 Email 1: Nick, Yes, let's talk about freight rate. We're on the same page. We're talking about 6,000MT of EVA resin from India to Taiwan. One more thing: Our shipper needs to know the port. <Email 4>:

The letter writer is trying to establish the availability of a service from a potential supplier. To do so, she needs to ask questions.
If you choose the service, the supplier may not think that you are interested in the product.  That is why Ms. Klein tells you that ships are expensive to operate and, thus, puts you in a more interested position.  On the other hand, you may not think that the service is suitable for your product.  This is why Ms. Klein suggests that you could provide the food.  In this case, the product is the food.  The product is the basis for the discussion.

Moving the deal forward would make us an attractive proposition.                     3) Finally, in relation to the rate you quoted for the electronics firm, I

Answer 1:
Subject: RE: (RE: TENDER FOR 6000MT MALABO TO CAPE TOWN)                    The rate is okay with us, but there is a problem with the transit time. Could you check your ETA for my customer? We are willing to pay more, if it will arrive earlier. Thanks

Answer 2:
Dear Alice,                    Unfortunately, we are not sure if we can achieve the ETA. Our vessel has a good speed, but if it is ballast in Malabo, it will take at least 16 days. If the cargo is loaded in Malabo, it will have to wait for our ship","From: kris@example.com

I suspect we will have to hire a cargo lawyer. I think you should make the accusation of discrimination then. See if the Secretary of State for Transport will provide a legal opinion. Or failing that then get a private firm to challenge the 'owners' of the canal in their own backyard.  With a guaranteed doubling of the revenue they should have no interest in the details.
As a minimum get them to explain the 'adjusted and equitable tolls' arrangement.

This would be an easy detection system for anyone who was trying to determine if an email reply was generated by a human or by a bot. It's not perfect (or rather, it's not ""perfectly perfect""), but it is a way to detect spam bots.

However, what we're looking for is not just whether an email reply is generated by a bot, but whether the person that sent the email actually wrote that reply. Or in other words: Is the email genuine? Does this person exist? Is it really my friend or colleague that's sending me these messages?

2. Is there any other information in the email that could be used to validate that it's really the person sending it?

To start with, you should look for:

This is a topic that I cover in more detail in my article on spotting bots.

The key here is that you can't just rely on one factor to validate whether an email is genuine. You have to combine multiple factors together.

We urgently require a ship, around 50,000 DWT, experienced with dry bulk or ore, for transportation of 20,000 to 25,000 MT of iron ore from Dampier to Yuan Island.

I hope this message finds you well. We have noticed that the shipment of coffee beans ordered from Mexico, which was expected to arrive at your store by mid-October, has still not been paid for. Could you please confirm if you have received the shipment? Additionally, could you inform us about your plans regarding the payment?

Looking forward to your prompt response.

What's up folks,                    I have a question about shipping 25,000MT of scrap metal from Zeebrugge to Rotterdam. Could we arrange daily demurrage under $10k?                    Thanks,                    Sherry

Thanks for your responses, and yes I've already found carriers who have the Russian language skills to handle this deal. I'm just trying to price out the shipping and what it's going to take to get the demurrage under $10k. Will have to email you again on this.

I'm not sure of the specification of the material that you want to be shipped. I'm guessing it's a high-density product that won't require much space to contain. In this case, the charges should be low. 25,000 MT isn't really that much for a vessel. Maybe the best way to do this

<Email 4>:
 Dear Frank,                 Yes, there have been some modifications made to the vessel since it was built in 1995. The first modification was in 2010 when a new engine was installed. This new engine has increased the vessel’s cargo capacity to 7000MT and increased its efficiency. In 2017, the vessel underwent another modification in which its six layers were lined with waterproof cloth and epoxy. This modification has improved the vessel’s ability to carry cargo without leaking and increased its durability. We believe that these modifications have improved the vessel’s performance and made it a better choice for shipping iron ore.                    Regards,                    Scott

I apologize, but our budget constraints won't allow us to go beyond US$60 per metric ton. Would you be interested in increasing the volume to 10,000MT instead of 7,000MT? This may justify the lower price per ton.

Let me know your thoughts.

Lifting at US$60 per metric ton would not be financially viable for us. Adjusting the cargo size does not offset the reduced rate sufficiently. We might need to explore alternative arrangements if the price cannot be adjusted higher.

I concur with Mr. Detrick's decision to uphold the bankruptcy court's ruling with regards to the findings and sanctions, with an addition of noting the lack of cooperation with the trustee. I do not think it is appropriate that there was no interview done to this company and I have the utmost concern of how can one do a complete review on a company without speaking to that company. For that reason, I will advise to bring this matter up during the oral argument of Mr. Detrick. Since he is hearing the matter, I think it would be proper to ask if a quick interview with the representatives of Hartley Crane Company, Inc. will be a consideration for the trustee.","From: charles.denton@email.com

Thank you for the update. Could you please confirm your position regarding the loading schedule? Also, if the loading can commence before the 25th August, please advise as we have yet to secure a vessel.

We have to insist that the sugar loading cannot commence later than the 25th August. Please ensure that your vessel is provided in time to meet this schedule, otherwise loading at this port won't be possible and you would need to consider an alternative loading port.

|        we are watching the market closely.   |
|        The naphtha market is hard to         |
|        predict. We are all at the mercy       |
|        of the OPEC production decisions.     |

|        long term or short term, or maybe     |
|        even store. Which one is your          |

That sounds like a misunderstanding. I'm not aware of any plans for Chemical Inc. to target us for acquisition. About the naphtha market, we continue to closely monitor it as OPEC decisions largely influence the predictions.

Hi,
        This is probably the most cost-effective way to sell our surplus palm oil to the buyer in Panama.
        Our company has more than 100,000 tons of palm oil from Bintulu available, and we would like to sell the 5,000 tons to this buyer as well as the rest.
        We are willing to give you $1 per ton of palm oil, which means that if you are able to sell the 5,000 tons at $9.95 per ton, you will earn $4.95 per ton.
        Please let me know if you are interested.
