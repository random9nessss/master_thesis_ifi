This is why there are six key elements to an email.\n            The First Element - Greetings\n            Emails are business documents, so you should use formal language. This includes starting the email with a formal greeting. Formal greetings can be used with someone who you are not familiar with. Some formal greetings include:\n            Dear Mr Xander,\n            Greetings Ms. Anderson,\n            To whom it may concern.\n            The Second Element - Subject Line\n            Use a descriptive subject line. One you give your email a descriptive subject line, you will increase your chances of being read. It will also prevent your emails from being mistaken for spam or getting lost in your recipient\nEmail 2:\nDear Mr. Simon,                      The vessel will leave Porto Velho on 24th April.

If it is your first time contacting the recipient, introduce yourself in your first email. An introduction should include:\n    Why are you writing?\n    Why do you think the recipient would be interested in your email?\n    Include an appropriate closing for your email. To find a list of appropriate closings, see below.\n    Sincerely,\n    Cordially,\n    Regards,\n    Best regards,\n    Kind regards,\n    Best,\n    Finally, it is recommended that you proofread your email before you send it.

Can you advise how the refrigeration is done in the holds.                    Cheers,                    Mona\nEmail 2:\nDear Mona,        The refrigeration is done by ventilation - the holds are ventilated by system that draws air through ice cold seawater. The air is then used to keep the goods at right temperature. There is no refrigeration in the holds of our ships. In between, there are rooms for packages of bulk goods.                    We could load the PKE in these rooms. It should fit in one or two such rooms. The loading rate would be 7-8t per hour.                    The max weight per carcase is 1.500kg. The container could not handle heavier carcases.                    To prevent damage of the PKE during loading, we have made special arrangements for the loading. The shell of the PKE must be closed after being loaded and we suggest using special sealing material for this purpose. A sample of this material can be sent if you wish.                    Should you\nEmail 3:\nHi James,                    That sounds good. I can arrange the product to arrive in 20 ft containers. The dimensions are as follows:                    The biggest one is 140cm x 75cm x 37cm and the heaviest is 1270kgs. We need 5 containers.                    I can arrange the sealing material, do you have the dimensions of the rooms you have in mind?                    Thanks again.                    Mona\nEmail 4:\nDear Mona,        The rooms are about 8,5m by 2,9m, 2,8m high. That should be sufficient. A container is the best to move it. We have also made arrangements for transporting the PKE in ISO containers.                    If you have difficulties to do so, we could also load the goods at our port in Port Klang, moving the goods in our own trucks from there.                    Should you have further questions, please let me know.

It is important that you communicate with me and we have plenty of time to revise and respond.

The agreement said 3,000 tons of Liquefied Petroleum Gas, with a total of 5,000 tons of oil. I'm looking at the cargo space of the GDDT-101 vessel for 7,800 tons. How come you've shipped so much cargo? The remaining space should have been filled with some rice, but I see none in the photos you sent.\n                    Weigh the hull and contact me right away. Do you have any idea what your vessel will be rated? Do you want to remove some of the oil? Your vessel is large, the last time I was in an all-oil ship was in 2003.\n                    Best regards,                    Camille\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

The sentiment analysis can be achieved by applying a process which determines whether the tone of a piece of text is positive, negative or neutral. The email sentiment analysis API is an application programming interface (API) used to determine the sentiment of a piece of text by returning a number between 0 and 1, where 1 is positive and 0 is negative. The output of this API can be either 1, 0 or 0.5, which implies either positive, negative or neutral sentiment respectively. The input of the API is text and the output can be used in\nEmail 3:\nGood afternoon Emmanuel,                 Yes, the vessels are expected at 1300/1400.

The positive sentiment is determined from the use of words such as \"Good\" and \"Regards\", while the negative sentiment is determined from the use of words such as \"still\" and \"need\". The last email is neutral and contains no sentiment. However, the sentiment score of the first email is higher than that of the second one because it contains more positive words. The neutral sentiment is determined from the use of words such as \"best\", \"please\", \"thank\", \"\nEmail 4:\nGood afternoon Emmanuel,                 I have checked with the terminal and they are expecting the vessel at 1300 hours and they require the following details:                       1.

This means that the email contains more positive words and phrases than negative ones. The positive words include \"I\", \"can\", \"very\", \"all\", while the negative ones include \"isn't\". However, there is a high frequency of positive words in this email, which means that it has a higher score than the other emails\nEmail 5:\nDear Ms Maya,                     Can I please clarify when our vessel will be expected to arrive at Lagos terminal?

This means that the email contains more negative words and phrases than positive ones. The negative words include \"I\", \"can't\", \"haven't\", \"still\", while the positive ones include \"can\", \"clarify\", \"when\", \"correct\".
