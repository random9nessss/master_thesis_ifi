I do not anticipate any berth congestion in either port, but would you still please confirm that?                    Many thanks,                    Michael\nEmail 2:\nHi Michael,                  Hope you are well.                      As far as Mundra is concerned, there will be no berth congestion (whether it be monthly or weekly) in any month of this year.                 Regarding the port of Long Beach, the container volume is consistently increasing month on month. It will also increase in the coming month. However, we can see that in February 2019, there were 8 ETDs, whereas in January 2019 there were 7 ETDs. The transhipment movement from West Africa & other major US destinations to Long Beach will increase by more than 10% this year. Hence we may see less berth congestion in the months of January, February & March 2019. However, the probability of berth congestion in April and onward months is very high as long as the CBP do not relax any of their existing regulations to reduce the dwell\nEmail 3:\nHi Michael, \n    Here is a comparison between January to December 2018 and January to December 2017. \n    To view this email on the web, go to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=605746.\n\n\n8 I D        ARRIVAL TYPE         VOLUME (LCL/FCL/EMPTY) JAN 2017   JAN 2018   DIF \nTLG327      OFFD ANCHOR         LCL           185         445     140 \nTLG062      OFFD ANCHOR         LCL           112         235     123 \nTLG188      OFFD ANCHOR         LCL           100         165     65 \nCMACTI      OFFD ANCHOR         LCL           151         165     14 \nTML 45      OFFD ANCHOR         L\nEmail 4:\nHi\nKindly note the following changes in view of the proposed cut off \n\u00b7 All STS, which were used in the past to eliminate congestion, will cease by end of March 2019. \n\u00b7 Due to many more factors like larger volume, berth congestion & diversification, the terminal now prefers containers which are loaded on to wagons, trucks, rail heads, special containers (Transponders, Chilled, Refrigerated, etc.) as well as containers which are to be exported via Ocean Terminal, Pier 400, Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT), \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 the list goes on. \n\u00b7 Longer term (year on year), terminal hopes that terminal will be able to achieve more in terms of more Gate out/container return, which is the only way the terminal will be able to handle more volume. \n\u00b7 With the above changes, the terminal will be able to\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Can you give us a berth congestion forecast and how does your laytime allowance work in case of port delays?                    Many thanks,                    Robert\nEmail 2:\nMatadi is a very busy port with cargoes often backed up at berth. There is no guaranteed transit time to discharge ships. It is typical for ships to be waiting in line from 2-4 days to get to berth and there is not a predictable number of ships in line to discharge as ships can come at any time without warning.\n                \n                It is typical to run back up and sometimes 2 berths simultaneously. When two berths are available, the berthing order is typically handled by the Terminal based on when the ship can reach the berth. In the event that your vessel can reach the berth on the day that is scheduled for your vessel, your berth time will likely be honored. If you are late due to port congestion and cannot reach the berth that is reserved for you, your berth may be given to another ship and you will have to wait in line for the next\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Unfortunately, the Yemen Embassy in Malta does not accept any application. For a visa application, you must go through the company you are working for or a company that will sponsor your trip.                    Yours sincerely,                    Yasmina\nEmail 3:\n```Hi,             \n\nThanks for the info about the company but there are only two people in Malta and they are both married. For the company, what if I am not working for it? But the company can be the sponsor for me to get the Yemen visa. Can you tell me who to get in contact with? Do you know any sponsor company that I can contact?                    Yours sincerely,                    Mabena\n```\nEmail 4:\nThanks for the info, I\u2019ll go there today and I will also go to the embassy to make some enquiries.

They have informed me that I don\u2019t need any sponsor. But to get a visa it costs 118 USD.                            Hope this information helps you.
