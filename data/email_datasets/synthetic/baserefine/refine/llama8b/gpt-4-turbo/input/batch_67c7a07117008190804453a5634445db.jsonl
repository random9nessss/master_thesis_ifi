When many people read an email, they don't think too much about it. They just get the information they need to keep doing their jobs.\n\nHowever, if you put the same information into a 'smartcard', suddenly it becomes very interesting. A Smartcard can contain information, documents, images, videos and even music. It can also include online links and information that can be downloaded from the Internet, as well as many other things. Smartcards can be sent as gifts\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

Regards, Charles Denton\n\nCannon\n\nI concur with Mr. Detrick's decision to uphold the bankruptcy court's ruling with regards to the findings and sanctions, with an addition of noting the lack of cooperation with the trustee. I do not think it is appropriate that there was no interview done to this company and I have the utmost concern of how can one do a complete review on a company without speaking to that company. For that reason, I will advise to bring this matter up during the oral argument of Mr. Detrick. Since he is hearing the matter, I think it would be proper to ask if a quick interview with the representatives of Hartley Crane Company, Inc. will be a consideration for the trustee.\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.
