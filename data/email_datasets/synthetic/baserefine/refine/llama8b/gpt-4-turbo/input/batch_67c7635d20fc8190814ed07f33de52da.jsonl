We would like to book cargo as you mentioned in your email 2.                        The information you need is as follows:                        Quantity: 30,000MT (weight)                        Type: Soybean meal                        Packed in 50kg jumbo bags                        Packed in 1,200 bags per 40'HC container                        Destination: Shantou                        Port of loading: Chongqing                        In the end of June this year, my company and a dealer made an agreement of selling and buying the above soybean meal at the agreed price of 1,300USD per MT.                        I'm wondering if I can still make the shipment at such price even now it's September.                        Thanks in advance.

I'm afraid the above rate is no longer available.                        It seems that after your July inquiry, the freight cost has been rising continuously. In September, the rate could be around 12,000USD/30,000MT. It's quite expensive compared with your original contract of 1,300USD per MT.                        I'm afraid your soybean meal could be sold at a lower price now.

At that time we agreed the contract price was only 1,300USD per MT. If we reduce the price further, we'll definitely lose some money.                        I don't know how to explain this to the client.                        I'd better tell him to take some other cargo.                        I will close this deal with the seller now.                        Thanks.                        Sulek\n<Email 6>:\n Dear Suheki,                        It's a pity.

The Suez Canal plays a crucial role in the global shipping industry, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. However, recent events have caused concerns among vessel operators and shipping companies about delays and increased congestion at the canal.\n2. Since the closure of the canal in March due to the Ever Given ship blocking it, operators have been expressing fears of congestion and delays. Despite the reopening of the canal in mid-April, vessels are still facing delays as the backlog of shipping containers and other cargo continues to accumulate.\n3. As of May 2nd, there are 67 vessels waiting to enter the Suez Canal, while an additional 55 are waiting to exit. This has led to\nEmail 3:\nCan you tell me what is the status of the Ever Given ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal in March? Is it still there? Also, I've heard about the backlog of vessels in the canal. Do you know if that might affect my shipment?\nDear (Name),\nI hope this message finds you well. I understand that you have some questions regarding the Ever Given ship and the backlog of vessels at the Suez Canal. Let me try to address your concerns.\nFirstly, the Ever Given ship was successfully dislodged from the Suez Canal on March 29th, after being stuck for almost a week. However, it remains in the canal until it can be re-fueled and towed to another location for repairs. The process of refueling and repairing the ship is expected to take several weeks.\nAs for the backlog of vessels in the canal, the congestion has\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Could you handle a late-July laycan, and are you open to a short load window?                    Best,                    Aqaba\nEmail 2:\nHi J. Pye,                    I\u2019m writing you about your question. However, due to some problems with confidentiality, I will have to address this email as being from someone other than me.                    I can handle a late July load date, but you must understand that it may take us a few weeks to secure the necessary permits. You can help speed things along by hiring a third party to find out who the permits are issued to, and to pay them for their services. Your cargo is a noxious substance that has been denied to others in the past, so this must be done delicately. The load window can be as short as 3-4 days, but we\u2019ll have to include that in the permits, too.

We can accommodate a shipment of 3000MT of rubbish, but I'm concerned by your use of a boxship. Sure, it'll transport the garbage, but you're going to have to pay out the wazoo to get one. My advice is to go the less expensive route and use your neighbor's trash cans for the operation. Those are typically made of cheap plastic that is easy to transport by land. I wish you the best of luck!            James               ----- Original Message -----               To: James S.

We'd be happy to take on your job! We're going to need to know a few things before we can proceed though:               What is your trade?               How far do you need to go?               What are you going to do with all of that garbage in the end? (toxic waste? Trash that will just be dumped into the ocean somewhere?)               This is actually the largest cargo ship in the world. But yes, I guess you could consider it a \"boxship.\" Oh but don't worry! We'll make sure to go easy on the plastic that way it won't weigh so much and we won't use up too much fuel.

A bill was introduced in the state legislature that would provide a tax incentive to encourage renewable fuel blending\nEmail 3:\nIt\u2019s been busy around the warehouses. We are in the process of getting our Fall products ready. We have had some order cancellations so we will have a few spots open. We are reevaluating our shipping schedules. We are now shipping later than we did last year. It appears that the weather is not cooperating. We will keep you informed as we get better weather conditions. Some 20-inch rocks have not made it to the Southeastern states due to weather conditions and we are not sure when we will get them in.\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

We need 1,300MT of bitumen to Chicago                    \u2022 B.  I have checked with my supplier                    \u2022 D.

Although the words \"we need\" in the original email suggests a second person, you shouldn't immediately assume that there is more than one person at SEEDOR Company.\nTry and identify the people who are talking about the 1,300MT.\nThe correct answer is \"we\".

You think it\u2019s as easy as going on constructionobserver and asking for bids. Just how much it costs for a quote and if there is a minimum number of products you have to buy.\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s an education. Like how the Navy discovered it would lose too many crewmen if they started a major war without undergoing combat training first, so they decided to create such training so that every year they would lose fewer and fewer crews. Combat training also provided the Navy with the opportunity to evaluate newly created equipment and armaments.\n\nIn short, anyone can be an entrepreneur.

First question they asked was about storage cost. I made sure to talk about all different prices based on different quantities and then I explained the storage conditions. I never mentioned that in my price I included free delivery to the factory, in my opinion it is better to ask all questions before talking about details. You do not know what questions they can ask.\n\nWhen I received the email below, I was a bit shocked about the question.

We are only accepting FURNACE OIL.\n\n2) Yes, the cargo will be in good class and condition.

The main factor here is that every port of origin in this region has its own cargo\u2019s name that differs from one port to another. Let me give you an example. Vung Tau\u2019s oil is usually known as \u201cXONE\u201d, for example. If the cargo\u2019s origin was not Vung Tau, it would be known as something different. In the first email, the seller is probably from Vung Tau, the port\nEmail 3:\n<3>\nThanks for your email.                    We have an available vessel.

Best regards,                    [Your name]                    [Your address]\n\nso he doesn\u2019t want to use the common port of origin name, but he wants to use the name of the port where his product originates from.\n\nWe have, however, to be cautious when receiving information from an agent, because often it is not completely correct. If the agent wants to sell his cargo by using an incorrect cargo name, it is much easier for him to trick the buyer by giving a name that has a higher profit for him, or a name that is more familiar for the potential buyer. This issue is something that we have to be aware of. We have to make sure that the cargo is what we think it is, and if we\u2019re sure that we know the exact\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

If you do not have a restaurant can you tell me who does have one in that area?                              With sincere regards,                              Mary\n\n    Have you ever noticed how one day we're in the same room and one day we're on opposite sides of the planet?\nI was sitting here thinking about how life's a cabaret and then you said it. I thought, I can't live without you, then you\nspoke and you broke my heart in two. The world goes round and round and then it ends. What would you say if I told\nyou that I like the way that you lie? If you don't love me, don't come back at all.\n    Life isn't real. Life isn't fair. What do\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.
