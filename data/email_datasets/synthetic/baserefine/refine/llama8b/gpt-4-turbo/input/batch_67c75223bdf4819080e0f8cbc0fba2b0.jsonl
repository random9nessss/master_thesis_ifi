This gives room for miscommunication as well as mistrust between the two sides. That\u2019s why it is important to understand how to communicate professionally in business correspondence.\n\n## What is Business Correspondence?\n\nA message sent and received via a written form is known as a business correspondence. It is crucial as it provides information on the various activities of an organization. There are several forms of business correspondence. They include formal business letters, e-mails, and memos.\n\nThe letter types might be used to communicate with customers, clients, or employees. Some examples of business correspondence include application letters\nEmail 4:\nDear Mr. Kiriil,\nWe are very pleased to hear that you would like to become a regular customer of ours.  It is unfortunate that we have to turn down your offer due to the company policy.  We are not able to issue you with a regular customer card due to the fact that we do not use regular customer cards.  Our company has its own credit rating system which is used for the purpose of establishing customer loyalty.  In future, we would be able to offer you a credit line which we can tailor to your needs.  We would like to assure you of our continuing cooperation.\nYours sincerely,\nMaria\n</Email 4>\n<Email 5>:\nDear Mr. Christopher,\nWe regret to inform you that we cannot continue to do business with your company.

To: Felicia_2_Emails@gmail.com Hello Felicia, I just watched the Hidden Cash series on Netflix, and had to reach out to you. I believe there is a$10 million stash in the Rocky Mountains and I just found the clue to it in the Netflix series. To find the treasure, you must go to Wyoming and take a hike to the summit of the mountain on March 14, and find a rock with a spider web and a spider on it. There is a chunk of stone with the date 2014, then there is a map that was drawn by the Aboriginals in a nearby valley that shows where to go next. It is approximately 2\nEmail 4:\nI will not confirm or deny that the above is related to any TATF clues. I will simply say that your well-constructed TATF clues are, and always have been, your own.  If, in fact, you choose to accept any $10,000,000,000+ treasure, and a check made out to you by the Bounty Board for$10,000,000,000+, be advised that the paperwork includes a clause that neither you nor your heirs can claim any part of that amount again.  Upon confirmation by the Bounty Board of your claim, all of it is gone.  \n\n   Thank you for your interest in my little game.

Your container should arrive on the 29th of June, the demurrage is $500 per day. As for what time, it depends when your truck arrives at the port and the port\u2019s efficiency.

The container is 20 ft, with a weight of 11 MTs. What would the estimated price be? We\u2019d like it to be as cost-effective as possible, but also have a fast transit time. Also, can we get an estimate of the demurrage rate at the destination port? Thanks!                                        Mark Huang, Huawei\n[Response] Hello Mark!
