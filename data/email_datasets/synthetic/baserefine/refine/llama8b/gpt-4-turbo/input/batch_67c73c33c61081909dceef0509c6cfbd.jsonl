Thanks,                    Felipe\nEmail 2:\nDear Felipe,                 25,000 tons of oil from Copenhagen to Lagos in a seven-day freight?                    That's quite a bit of oil, Felipe. I assume you need to ship it by sea.                    You see, the oil trade operates on a just-in-time inventory management model, whereby oil is shipped to tankers as needed. This provides a stable supply and demand, eliminates inventory storage costs and prevents oil from degrading over time.                    Since your request involves shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days, my freight quote estimate would exceed what is available.                    Please confirm that your request is for 25,000 tons of oil in a seven-day freight and I can provide a quote to the maximum that is available to my company.                    Thanks,                    Perry\n\n<Email 3>:\nDear Perry,                 Yes, my request is for 25,000 tons\nEmail 3:\nDear Perry,                 Yes, my request is for 25,000 tons\n\n<Email 3>:\n For shipping in seven days to Lagos in the Nigeria.                 Could you please provide a quote?                    Thanks,                    Felipe\n<Email 4>:\nDear Felipe,                 Again, shipping 25,000 tons in seven days is an unusual request.                    If you are shipping this amount of oil in an outbound tanker, then the only companies capable of doing so are Shell, Chevron and Exxon. I don't have contacts with these companies.                    If you're shipping by sea, then you'll need a port in Copenhagen to load onto a tanker. I've emailed my contacts in the seaport of Copenhagen. They'll be in touch with me in the morning.                    If you're shipping by road, then the quantity would need to be in 45 liter plastic oil drums. The storage space and legal limitations of this option would be impossible to organize in such a short time frame.\nEmail 4:\nDear Felipe,                 Again, shipping 25,000 tons in seven days is an unusual request.

I'm sorry, but I simply don't have the resources to fill your request. I'm going to have to recommend you submit your request to one of the three large oil companies I mentioned before.                    I'd like to thank you for your business.

I will be submitting my request to an oil company.\nEmail 5:\nDear Felipe,                 Yes, I've contacted the Copenhagen seaport. They say you're 'absolutely okay' with me contacting them? You see, the contact I've made at the seaport of Copenhagen is the Director. He's a very important person who receives hundreds of emails from oil dealers like yourself, so he just needs to be advised that the shipping in question is okay. He's very busy, but if he doesn't reply within two weeks, please email him directly to remind him. You can just copy me on the email.                 This is your second response that implies you're okay with me contacting the seaport, so I'm sending you a copy of this email for your reference.

You will need to bear this cost in mind when considering the above rates.\n* **Availability of vessels**: I'm afraid, the vessel availability may be very limited in this trade during April-May 2023 due to busy Season. We have a few vessels that we can offer at the above rates but they are all loaded already in their previous trades and are due to return to Russia after discharging and we'll require 20-30 days notice from you to fit a ballast leg. Hence, you may consider booking a vessel now at the above rates\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

However, this process could take a few weeks to several months.

The church history museum is actually     constructing a rock wall with hand hewn     timbers for the base to hold up the rocks.     This entire wall will be constructed inside    the museum to display this room. They will     then hang two of our timbers from the inside    of this rock wall with chain. The nailing    requirement for these timbers will be strictly    adhered to in the construction of the     display. The museum has asked that the side    facing the rock wall be prepared to display     it with some sort of protective material for     display. But it would be the museum that would    decide on the type of protective coating that    would be used. The only nailing that would    have to be done at the Museum\nEmail 3:\nWe are taking the timber to Denmark. I was wondering about shipping them?

We have included some additional information below in hopes of answering some of the questions you have sent us in email.  We need to know if you are interested in the display materials we have available for your timber and also the additional display material that your representative from us in Denmark has recommended.\n\nYou can find our current brochure at the following website.  This has all of the prices and descriptions.  Also in the attachments you will find a form you can fill out and return to us with payment.  One of the timbers can be sent via FedEx which will cost approximately 1,000 Danish Kron\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

And can you please confirm your clients are looking for a Chinese registry vessel, or if they are open to other registries.
