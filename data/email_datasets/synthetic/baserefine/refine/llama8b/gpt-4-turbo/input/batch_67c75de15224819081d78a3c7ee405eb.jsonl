Your quote of $7,350 is a great value for a premium wheat like our MG and we were hoping you would have enough of the stock to allow us to charter your vessel to Dalian to load. When is your next voyage to Dalian?                    If we could charter your vessel directly from your current port, perhaps London, then that would greatly reduce our shipping costs and we would definitely prefer to charter with you. We will arrange for our vessel to load with your wheat and deliver it to Dalian where we will book a voyage to Durban.

I\u2019m currently the vessel broker of a Chinese bulk carrier currently in Chittagong, Bangladesh.                    We have 3,800MT of heavy plates to load. Destination is Port Louis, Mauritius. We have been given the following port dues and fees to be deducted from the cargo:                    * General Cargo Port Dues: USD 3,256.00                    * Coast Guard Charges: USD 164.00                    * MFAF (Mauritius Free Airport Fee): USD 112.80                    * Port Corporation: USD 159.84                    * Generator Rental: USD 0.16/ Hour * 12 Hours = USD 1.92                    * Empty Tank Cleaning: USD 10.00 * 2 Tanks = USD 20.00                    Could you kindly take this into account when submitting\nEmail 2:\nDear Samuel,\nThank you for your email. Unfortunately it is not appropriate for you to pass charges like this on to the cargo owners without their consent. If you are able to provide evidence that this is the owners\u2019 responsibility (e.g. a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo), we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses, but if you are just making up charges to pay your agency then it is unethical and we will not pay you.\nThank you,\nAlain Ferris\nPS: We also need a few more details on the cargo (origin, grade, product code), which will enable us to get a more accurate quote for the freight.\nPPS: The more information you are able to provide in your emails, the faster we can give you an answer, and the less likely it is that you will have\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.
