He doesn't want to name the buyer or the seller but he said that the price and the amount he told me is correct. The price and the amount are both based on the contract. I told him about the buyer's and the seller's interests and that he should give the buyer's company's address because the buyer is overseas. I asked him why he wouldn't send you the address because you didn't want to give you his address. He said\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

There is a limit of 10,000MT per office. We'll need to divide the shipment between the two offices. Can we split it? And can we lower the freight rate? This would help us get a better offer.\n\n<Email 3>:\nEmail 1:\nNick,\n\nThank you for your response. I appreciate your ideas.\n\nWe're going to divide the shipment between the two offices. This means we'll need two ships and twice as many containers. I think it would be better to get a better freight rate. Is $10.5 per MT too much? <Email 3>:\nEmail 1: Nick,\n\nThat's a relief, the 10,000MT limit per office. I'm thinking 7,000MT to Taiwan\nEmail 4:\nEmail 1:\nHi Nick,\n\nThat sounds much better.

The buyer in Taiwan doesn't need to take the full 7,000MT. He has the room for just 6,000MT. Can we get a better rate with just 6,000MT?\n\n<Email 4>:\n Email 1: Nick, Yes, let's talk about freight rate. We're on the same page. We're talking about 6,000MT of EVA resin from India to Taiwan.

To do so, she needs to ask questions.\nIf you choose the service, the supplier may not think that you are interested in the product.  That is why Ms. Klein tells you that ships are expensive to operate and, thus, puts you in a more interested position.  On the other hand, you may not think that the service is suitable for your product.  This is why Ms. Klein suggests that you could provide the food.  In this case, the product is the food.  The product is the basis for the discussion.\nEither Ms. Klein\nEmail 3:\nDear Ms. Smith,\nAt the moment, our vessel is not ready for transport, and we\u2019re afraid that it won\u2019t be until the 10th of next month.

Could you check your ETA for my customer? We are willing to pay more, if it will arrive earlier. Thanks\n\nAnswer 2:\nDear Alice,                    Unfortunately, we are not sure if we can achieve the ETA. Our vessel has a good speed, but if it is ballast in Malabo, it will take at least 16 days. If the cargo is loaded in Malabo, it will have to wait for our ship\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.
