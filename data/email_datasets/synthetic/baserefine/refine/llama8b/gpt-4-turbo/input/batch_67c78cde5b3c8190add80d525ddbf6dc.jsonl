Do you have any ship open in November?                    Regards,                    [name]\nEmail 2:\nHello,                    Best Price on spot by sea transport:                0,19 $/MT + 0,05$/MT bunker.

The task is to find an empty container, go to China (pay 0.19$/MT + 0.05$/MT bunker) and bring petroleum coke to Azerbaijan (20k MT, 100% B/L paid, sailing in November).\n\nThe main question for this task is, does the company have a vessel available to take the cargo?\n\nWhat technique(s)\nEmail 3:\nThe main trick is to make this task look like it is for open charter. This makes the victim pay attention to the price, believing it is actually lower than the price of the chartered ship (by the way, let's make it 0.19$). By saying that you will pay 0.05$/MT for bunker, the victim thinks you are buying bunker, while you are actually renting the vessel.\n\n    Also note that the shipping cost (0.19$) is given to the nearest part of the fourth decimal place, which might look suspicious if the sender and receiver have different countries. It is a very good trick to make such mistakes, as I did in email 2, or even in email 1 if the victim is inexperienced. It makes the victim think he is comparing two similar offers, which they are not, and look bad for not noticing it. Finally\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Neither?\n[2] Is the behavior of these two parties consistent with what you've learned about negotiation?\n[3] How could a technology such as one from IBM Watson Trader help these two parties negotiate better and faster?\nEmail 4:\nAs requested, I am including a snapshot of our web portal as it appears today. It contains information about the markets in which Karen trades, and the freight rates for each trade. The portal also shows how certain factors, such as market volatility, can affect rates. Each sector displays a current snapshot of freight rates for each of the areas that Karen can trade, and a visual map indicating rate fluctuations. Also, freight rates appear in a moving graph which shows trends over the last 30 days. This is quite beneficial for traders who have to make decisions based on live market conditions. \n\nAnother important function is the ship and route selector. When a ship trader selects a specific ship, the system shows in green or red the rates and savings for that specific ship on each route. This helps traders determine which ship and which route to select.\n\nFinally, a major aspect of the technology is the asset manager,\nEmail 5:\nThank you very much for the quick response and information.\nHow do I understand this correctly? The screenshot shows the C/P from Damietta to Koper. The C/P for the voyage Damietta -> Koper is 3.25/3.70 points less compared to the CP for the same route from Rotterdam -> Damietta. This makes a total difference of 3.625 to 5.375 $/day (depending on the grade). Since the ship owner is not willing to fix the voyage for the entire laycan, but only until next week, I can't make any changes to the CP. \nRegards,\nKaren\n<Email 6>:\n\u00a0 Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately, the outlook is not good. The market for ammonium sulfate went down again yesterday, although Ammonium Nitrate, the rival product, has gone up significantly.
