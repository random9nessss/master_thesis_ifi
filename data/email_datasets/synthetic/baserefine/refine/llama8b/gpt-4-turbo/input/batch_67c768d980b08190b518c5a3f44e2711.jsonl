There are reasons why they could be having difficulty in getting through to their target.

Any ideas on extra insurance premiums for weeknd deliveries?                    Thanks,                    Vitoria\nEmail 2:\ndave,                    look at the surface tanker jet fuel route chart on the www and do the calculations. The distance is only 275 miles and if you cut through the shallows then it's maybe only 250 miles.                    With the shallowest part 43 feet, a 35,000 ton tanker would only use about 16' of water to float. If a tanker could travel through the route, I'm sure that the insurance premiums wouldn't be a major problem.                    I could not find any such tanker out there right now so it's not a matter of just connecting the dots.                    The insurance companies would calculate that if there is a loss, there is no place for the ship to refuel on the route, so the insurance rates might be higher.

If you know anyone that has a 250K bbl tanker (for about 12M gallons) that wants to go to Brazil, I would like to talk to them.
