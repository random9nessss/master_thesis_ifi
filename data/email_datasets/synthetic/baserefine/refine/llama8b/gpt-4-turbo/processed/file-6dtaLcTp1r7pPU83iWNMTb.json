Seablue is a crude vessel and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers from Chinese yards. As I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not resume operations in China, other tankers would compensate by departing Chinese docks. These tankers would operate at a price level set by the most competitive time charter, which is the drydocked Seablue. Therefore, the price level at which cargoes are fixed in China would not differ even if Seablue was operational. LPG cargoes are different since we cannot use crude tankers for them, and crude cargoes are more complex to arrange as many producers have set contracted prices.
