The Port of Elizabeth is basically a bit “rustic”. Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h. We can also do up to 2,000 mt/h if the coal can be delivered to the berth quickly and easily.\\n\\nBe advised that in March, the water in the port will be very low.\\n\\nRegards,\\nBrian\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"broker\": \"\",\n    \"commodity\": \"Coal\",\n    \"load_port\": \"Port Elizabeth\",\n    \"discharge_port\": \"Venice\",\n    \"cargo_size\": \"5,000MT\",\n    \"incoterm\": \"\",\n    \"vessel\": \"MV WIDE BEAM 01\",\n    \"dwt\": \"\",\n    \"loa\": \"\",\n    \"starting_freight_quote_currency\": \"\",\n    \"starting_freight_quote\": \"\",\n    \"final_freight_quote_currency\": \"\",\n    \"final_freight_quote\": \"\",\n    \"laytime_start_date\": \"2023-03-10\",\n    \"laytime_end_date\": \"2023-03-12\",\n    \"demurrage_currency\": \"\",\n    \"demurrage\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```","tool_calls":null}}]}},"error":null}

Regarding the port of Long Beach, the container volume is consistently increasing month on month. It will also increase in the coming month. However, we can see that in February 2019, there were 8 ETDs, whereas in January 2019 there were 7 ETDs. The transshipment movement from West Africa & other major US destinations to Long Beach will increase by more than 10% this year. Hence we may see less berth congestion in the months of January, February & March 2019. However, the probability of berth congestion in April and onward months is very high as long as the CBP do not relax any of their existing regulations to reduce the dwell time.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nPeter\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"from\": \"peter.example@logistics.com\",\n      \"to\": \"michael.example@shippingco.com\",\n      \"subject\": \"Re: Inquiry on Berth Congestion for Cargo Shipment\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2019-01-17 09:15\",\n      \"body\": \"Hi Michael,\\n\\nHere is a comparison between January to December 2018 and January to December 2017.\\n\\nTo view this email on the web, go to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=605746.\\n\\n8 I D        ARRIVAL TYPE         VOLUME (LCL/FCL/EMPTY) JAN 2017   JAN 2018   DIF\\nTLG327      OFFD ANCHOR         LCL           185         445     140\\nTLG062      OFFD ANCHOR         LCL           112         235     123\\nTLG188      OFFD ANCHOR         LCL           100         165     65\\nCMACTI      OFFD ANCHOR         LCL           151         165     14\\nTML 45      OFFD ANCHOR         L\\n\\nBest regards,\\nPeter\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"from\": \"peter.example@logistics.com\",\n      \"to\": \"michael.example@shippingco.com\",\n      \"subject\": \"Re: Inquiry on Berth Congestion for Cargo Shipment\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2019-01-18 11:45\",\n      \"body\": \"Hi Michael,\\n\\nKindly note the following changes in view of the proposed cut off:\\n\\n- All STS, which were used in the past to eliminate congestion, will cease by end of March 2019.\\n- Due to many more factors like larger volume, berth congestion & diversification, the terminal now prefers containers which are loaded onto wagons, trucks, rail heads, special containers (Transponders, Chilled, Refrigerated, etc.) as well as containers which are to be exported via Ocean Terminal, Pier 400, Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT), ...\\n- Longer term (year on year), the terminal hopes that it will be able to achieve more in terms of more Gate out/container return, which is the only way the terminal will be able to handle more volume.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nPeter\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"broker\": \"\",\n    \"commodity\": \"\",\n    \"load_port\": \"Mundra\",\n    \"discharge_port\": \"Long Beach\",\n    \"cargo_size\": \"\",\n    \"incoterm\": \"\",\n    \"vessel\": \"\",\n    \"dwt\": \"\",\n    \"loa\": \"\",\n    \"starting_freight_quote_currency\": \"\",\n    \"starting_freight_quote\": \"\",\n    \"final_freight_quote_currency\": \"\",\n    \"final_freight_quote\": \"\",\n    \"laytime_start_date\": \"\",\n    \"laytime_end_date\": \"\",\n    \"demurrage_currency\": \"\",\n    \"demurrage\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```","tool_calls":null}}]}},"error":null}

We’ve never sold that quantity of MGO. Our company is a division of a larger company that has supplied 100,000mt+ to major trading companies in the last few years, so we can do this. The time frame can be negotiated between the supplier and buyer. We usually provide the shipping documents within 10-12 days of the shipment and request payment in cash 4 weeks later. The buyer needs to pay the bank documentary charges within 2 weeks of the shipment. I think the real trick is to find a supplier who is able to supply this quantity.

There are many shipping vessels available that can take this amount of cargo. The average delivery time for this kind of shipment is around 45 days, although it’s possible to shorten the delivery time. It depends on the cargo vessel’s available route. The costs for this shipment can vary from USD 10 to USD 20 per mt, depending on the size of the cargo vessel, the route taken, and the distance the cargo will have to travel. In conclusion, I think the best course of action is to ship the order in two parts, each part being around 100,000mt.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"from\": \"capt.hu@example.com\",\n      \"to\": \"timothy@example.com\",\n      \"subject\": \"Re: Inquiry for 200,000mt MGO Shipment from Spain to Japan\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2023-10-03 09:00\",\n      \"body\": \"I will continue to provide information on how to find a supplier and transport and shipping companies for this type of shipment.

Also, freight rates appear in a moving graph which shows trends over the last 30 days. This is quite beneficial for traders who have to make decisions based on live market conditions. Another important function is the ship and route selector. When a ship trader selects a specific ship, the system shows in green or red the rates and savings for that specific ship on each route.

In 2017, the vessel underwent another modification in which its six layers were lined with waterproof cloth and epoxy.

This has forced Mrs. Glenda and Mr. Michael Wilson to incur huge demurrage and storage fees which they cannot afford to pay now.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"from\": \"steve.smith@example.com\",\n      \"to\": \"scott.johnson@example.com\",\n      \"subject\": \"Re: Vessel Availability and Demurrage Rates\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2023-07-25 12:00\",\n      \"body\": \"Thanks for your email and apologies for my delay in replying.
