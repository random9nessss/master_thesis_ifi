Seablue is a crude vessel and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers coming out of Chinese yards.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not come out in China, other tankers would come out of the dock and China would be fixed. These tankers would operate at a price level set by the most competitive time charter tanker which is the drydocked Seablue and therefore the price level at which China is fixed would not be different even if Seablue was out of the drydock.\n\nLPG cargoes are different since we cannot use LPG in the crude tankers and crude cargoes are not as easy to fix as LPG, since many producers are contracted and certain prices are set.\n\nThe next drydocked Seablue is in\n\nBest regards,\nKathy"

I assume you need to ship it by sea.\n\nYou see, the oil trade operates on a just-in-time inventory management model, whereby oil is shipped to tankers as needed. This provides a stable supply and demand, eliminates inventory storage costs and prevents oil from degrading over time.\n\nSince your request involves shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days, my freight quote estimate would exceed what is available.\n\nPlease confirm that your request is for 25,000 tons of oil in a seven-day freight and I can provide a quote to the maximum that is available to my company.\n\nThanks,\nPerry"

If you are shipping this amount of oil in an outbound tanker, then the only companies capable of doing so are Shell, Chevron, and Exxon. I don't have contacts with these companies.\n\nIf you're shipping by sea, then you'll need a port in Copenhagen to load onto a tanker. I've emailed my contacts in the seaport of Copenhagen. They'll be in touch with me in the morning.\n\nIf you're shipping by road, then the quantity would need to be in 45 liter plastic oil drums. The storage space and legal limitations of this option would be impossible to organize in such a short time frame.\n\nI'm going to have to say 'no' to your request for shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days. I'm also saying 'no' to your request to contact the seaport in Copenhagen. If you insist, I'll let my seaport contacts know to contact you, but don't expect a reply.\n\nI'm sorry, but I simply don't have the resources to fill your request. I'm going to have to recommend you submit your request to one of the three large oil companies I mentioned before.\n\nI'd like to thank you for your business.\n\nRegards,\nPerry"

You will need to bear this cost in mind when considering the above rates.\n\n* **Availability of vessels**: I'm afraid vessel availability may be very limited in this trade during April-May 2023 due to the busy season. We have a few vessels that we can offer at the above rates, but they are all loaded already in their previous trades and are due to return to Russia after discharging. We'll require 20-30 days' notice from you to fit a ballast leg. Hence, you may consider booking a vessel now at the above rates.\n\nRegards,\nMr. Lewis"

The museum has asked that the side facing the rock wall be prepared to display it with some sort of protective material.

Almarakib's Pakistani captain is low on funds and is able to transport items from our port to Pakistan to earn some quick cash. He's a freelancer by nature and is more than happy to take on whatever job comes his way as long as he gets his money upfront.\n\n2. He is asking for $30,000 upfront. We will take out a loan for the money. We cannot afford the loan. I must sell off my share of the ship to pay it back.\n\nI am writing this email on my phone from the bank.\n\nI have agreed to let the bank have your share of the ship and pay off the loan.\n\nBest,\nSada"

In any case, please send me a copy of the B/L or OBL as soon as we have completed shipment. The original B/L or OBL to go to our agent at Haifa for delivery to buyer. I look forward to your reply, thanks. Best regards, Fred"

With the growing influence of multinational business and the Internet, there is a danger of being misunderstood. Particularly when it comes to asking someone a question. With the ever-growing number of emails and phone calls being made globally every second of the day, it is important to ensure your request is heard.\n\nWhen sending an email with a question, it is also very important to include a sign-off such as 'Best Regards' or 'Kind Regards.'

Please contact us for further details and your approval.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please note that the charterer may choose between TCE only or TCE+P&I, both of which can be offered to you.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.\n\nWith Best Regards,\nAmr El-Garhy\nSales Department\nGlobmarine Chartering Limited"

If you are able to provide evidence that this is the owners\u2019 responsibility (e.g., a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo), we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses. However, if you are just making up charges to pay your agency, it is unethical, and we will not pay you. \n\nThank you, \nAlain Ferris \n\nPS: We also need a few more details on the cargo (origin, grade, product code), which will enable us to get a more accurate quote for the freight. \n\nPPS: The more information you are able to provide in your emails, the faster we can give you an answer, and the less likely it is that you will have delays."

Since the closure of the canal in March due to the Ever Given ship blocking it, operators have been expressing fears of congestion and delays. Despite the reopening of the canal in mid-April, vessels are still facing delays as the backlog of shipping containers and other cargo continues to accumulate.\n3. As of May 2nd, there are 67 vessels waiting to enter the Suez Canal, while an additional 55 are waiting to exit. This has led to..."

Those are typically made of cheap plastic that is easy to transport by land. I wish you the best of luck! James"

'Anyone who works with anhydrous ammonia or other fertilizers must read this, and they must share it with their teams,' says Director of Regulatory Affairs Brian Jennings.\n\n* When a group of California manufacturers and distributors went before the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss the 2013 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) proposed by the U.S. EPA, they did not leave empty-handed. A bill was introduced in the state legislature that would provide a tax incentive to encourage renewable fuel blending.\n\nBest,\nAdmin"

Like how the Navy discovered it would lose too many crewmen if they started a major war without undergoing combat training first, so they decided to create such training so that every year they would lose fewer and fewer crews. Combat training also provided the Navy with the opportunity to evaluate newly created equipment and armaments.\n\nIn short, anyone can be an entrepreneur. You don\u2019t need to be the richest."

If a tanker could travel through the route, I'm sure that the insurance premiums wouldn't be a major problem.\n\nI could not find any such tanker out there right now so it's not a matter of just connecting the dots.

We can be very flexible on loading, but need to know your thoughts on two possible shipping methods:\n1. 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. How much extra would this be compared to a typical voyage at your current market price?\n2. 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev. Is there any discount available if we book these voyages for 2016 as well?\n\nSincerely,\nSarah"

Let me know if you receive that. I am not sure about the sea transport to India since I am not from that department. However, I would recommend the FCL rate of Hoegh Autoliner as they have an attractive rate by these carriers.\n\nOne of my friends in Taiwan is also very interested in this carrier. She plans to go for 10/20 cbm containers, but they are waiting for the government\u2019s final approval. Please wait for advice from our China department.\n\nAny other queries, please contact me at any time.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\nYours faithfully,\nRita Lee"

Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h. We can also do up to 2,000 mt/h if the coal can be delivered to the berth quickly and easily.\n\nBe advised that in March, the water in the port will be very low.\n\nRegards,\nBrian"

But we do have a lot of common interests with the island of Grande Comore. For example, we can both benefit from using a reputable port with quality equipment and speedy service, as well as avoiding overloading. The solution is to find a company that can efficiently load the cargo. Most shipping companies prefer to hire their own personnel for discharge because their ships require a high level of attention. The only problem is that many stevedoring companies are not experienced in unloading large ships. And that\u2019s why we need your help. Would you be interested in becoming a member of our team and working with us on this? Best regards, Edward"

I know a company called 'Aloha Stevedoring' who can handle your requirements. It is one of the best ports in the world, with excellent ships and docks. All the best, Cory Bennett"

The air is then used to keep the goods at the right temperature. There is no refrigeration in the holds of our ships. In between, there are rooms for packages of bulk goods.\n\nWe could load the palm kernel oil in these rooms. It should fit in one or two such rooms. The loading rate would be 7-8 tons per hour.\n\nThe max weight per package is 1,500kg. The container could not handle heavier packages.\n\nTo prevent damage of the palm kernel oil during loading, we have made special arrangements for the loading. The shell of the palm kernel oil must be closed after being loaded and we suggest using special sealing material for this purpose. A sample of this material can be sent if you wish.\n\nShould you have any further questions, please let me know.\n\nBest regards,\nJames Kleine\nManaging Director, Kleine Business Consultancy\nMaritima Massey Building\n41 Massey Road\nSandton\n2196\nJohannesburg\n+27 (11) 684-3387\n+27 (83) 322-5294 (mobile)\nkleine@net"

One must use the passive for this sentence. We have the object in the sentence - voyage. This can be changed to object of the preposition for - voyage for. This change turns the whole sentence into the passive sentence. The subject will be the preposition. We know this because the preposition for comes before the subject. We can make it a voyage.

We do not use the active form when there is a preposition after the subject. It should be He is looking for a house. We have the active form He is looking, but for comes after it. We change the active form to the passive form, thus creating the passive form. There is looking for a house. 2. Removing the article. The article a is required to make the sentence active. He is looking for a house. If you remove a, you have created a passive sentence. Who is looking?"

Why has it been deleted?\n\nI thought I said that I would not use a loaded container to transport coal, because it would not be able to fit everything that was needed to be transported. So I asked for a container with nothing in it, to be used for coal. The cargo manifest is a copy of the order. I do not need a container number, just the description of what is in the cargo.\n\nThe cargo manifest lists cargoes that are not in the containers you have sent. You must supply the correct containers.\n\nHow can you ask for cargoes if they have already been sent? I will check the numbers, but the cargo manifest has not been updated since you received it.\n\nThe cargo manifest has been updated. Please"

Unfortunately, a few days into the voyage, the vessel ran aground and was a total loss. Not only did Brian misrepresent his ship owner to be a reputable one, he went ahead and used me to sign up an insurance contract for his own personal benefit, under the influence of alcohol. He connived with the insurance company to release his profit after the ship sank but my company is still waiting for its share of the payout.\n\nBest regards,\nCieran"

Regarding the port of Long Beach, the container volume is consistently increasing month on month. It will also increase in the coming month. However, we can see that in February 2019, there were 8 ETDs, whereas in January 2019 there were 7 ETDs. The transshipment movement from West Africa & other major US destinations to Long Beach will increase by more than 10% this year. Hence we may see less berth congestion in the months of January, February & March 2019. However, the probability of berth congestion in April and onward months is very high as long as the CBP do not relax any of their existing regulations to reduce the dwell time.\n\nBest regards,\nPeter"

It is typical for ships to be waiting in line from 2-4 days to get to berth, and there is not a predictable number of ships in line to discharge as ships can come at any time without warning.\n\nIt is typical to run back up and sometimes 2 berths simultaneously. When two berths are available, the berthing order is typically handled by the Terminal based on when the ship can reach the berth. In the event that your vessel can reach the berth on the day that is scheduled for your vessel, your berth time will likely be honored. If you are late due to port congestion and cannot reach the berth that is reserved for you, your berth may be given to another ship and you will have to wait in line for the next.\n\nBest regards,\nEmma Morris"

The extra charge for the insurance is $3 per tonne. You also need to deposit $20,000 into our account before we start shipping cement to you.

Our company is a division of a larger company that has supplied 100,000mt+ to major trading companies in the last few years, so we can do this. The time frame can be negotiated between the supplier and buyer. We usually provide the shipping documents within 10-12 days of the shipment and request payment in cash 4 weeks later. The buyer needs to pay the bank documentary charges within 2 weeks of the shipment. I think the real trick is to find a supplier who is able to supply this quantity. To find a supplier for 200,000mt who is able to deliver such a big order is quite challenging. The order should be split into two parts, each part being around 100,000mt."

So, 100,000mt of the order might be enough to fill one ship, and the other ship will have to be loaded with the other 100,000mt. There are many shipping vessels available that can take this amount of cargo. The average delivery time for this kind of shipment is around 45 days, although it\u2019s possible to shorten the delivery time. It depends on the cargo vessel\u2019s available route. The costs for this shipment can vary from USD 10 to USD 20 per mt, depending on the size of the cargo vessel, the route taken, and the distance the cargo will have to travel. In conclusion, I think the best course of action is to ship the order in two parts, each part being around 100,000mt."

The best way to find a supplier is to contact the local trade association or trade missions in your area. They can help you find a local supplier, and if there\u2019s no local supplier, they can refer you to the association or missions in the destination country. There are several types of shipping vessels that can take this amount of cargo. The most common types are bulk carriers, tankers, container ships, and Ro-Ro (Roll-on/roll-off) vessels. Each type of vessel has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common route is from Europe to Japan. The distance between the two countries is around 7,000 nautical miles, and the voyage can take around 30 days, depending on the vessel\u2019s speed and the weather."

This makes the victim pay attention to the price, believing it is actually lower than the price of the chartered ship (by the way, let's make it 0.19 $/MT). By saying that you will pay 0.05 $/MT for bunker, the victim thinks you are buying bunker, while you are actually renting the vessel.\n\nAlso note that the shipping cost (0.19 $/MT) is given to the nearest part of the fourth decimal place, which might look suspicious if the sender and receiver have different countries. It is a very good trick to make such mistakes, as I did in email 2, or even in email 1 if the victim is inexperienced. It makes the victim think he is comparing two similar offers, which they are not, and look bad for not noticing it.\n\nBest Regards,\nBob"

The portal also shows how certain factors, such as market volatility, can affect rates. Each sector displays a current snapshot of freight rates for each of the areas that Karen can trade, and a visual map indicating rate fluctuations. Also, freight rates appear in a moving graph which shows trends over the last 30 days. This is quite beneficial for traders who have to make decisions based on live market conditions. Another important function is the ship and route selector. When a ship trader selects a specific ship, the system shows in green or red the rates and savings for that specific ship on each route. This helps traders determine which ship and which route to select. Finally, a major aspect of the technology is the asset manager."

This makes a total difference of 3.625 to 5.375 $/day (depending on the grade).

This new engine has increased the vessel\u2019s cargo capacity to 7000MT and increased its efficiency. In 2017, the vessel underwent another modification in which its six layers were lined with waterproof cloth and epoxy. This modification has improved the vessel\u2019s ability to carry cargo without leaking and increased its durability.

If that is your request, I'll note that the changes in the dataset have slowed considerably, so I would expect that the 11th decade would have a smaller compression than the 10th decade.

Therefore I will have to rely on the quoted charges of your company to compare.\n\nThe proposal for your company includes the following information. Could you please confirm if this information is accurate?\n\na. Your company will pick up the container from our premises, pack it according to our requirement and consolidate other shipments as necessary for us. All this will be done at no extra cost, plus the freight charges, as quoted in your proposal.\n\nb.
