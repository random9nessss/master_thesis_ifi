Analyzing data from early 2019, we observed 7 Estimated Times of Departure (ETDs) in January and 8 in February. Transhipment movement from West Africa and other major US destinations to Long Beach is projected to increase by over 10% this year.\n\nTherefore, we anticipate lower berth congestion in January, February, and March 2019.

Following this, I will compensate you as per our pre-agreed compensation arrangement.\n\nYour options for sourcing a vessel:\n\n(1) Approach the market through the ship's broker directly. Be aware that given the potentially competitive pricing I'm aiming for, securing an immediate response might be challenging.\n(2) Include the following information (presumably a rate or offering) on your sales sheet and send it to my agents:\n\n[Further details expected here - this email is cut off]\n"

Typically, ships experience waiting times of 2-4 days to secure a berth. The number of vessels awaiting discharge is unpredictable, as ships can arrive without prior notice.\n\nIt's common for the terminal to work multiple berths simultaneously when possible. When two berths are available, the Terminal typically prioritizes vessels based on their Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). If your vessel arrives on the scheduled date for its berth, it will likely be honored. However, if your vessel is delayed due to port congestion and misses its reserved berth, it may be assigned to another vessel, and your vessel will have to join the queue for the next available berth.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnna Morris"

This email appears to be related to a separate matter concerning a delayed cargo and a query about insurance on a different shipment. The included captain's feedback doesn't seem relevant to your current inquiry about the butter shipment to New York.\n\nTo clarify, are you also inquiring about a separate shipment where cargo was delayed? If so, please provide the relevant details (Bill of Lading number, etc.) so I can investigate. Regarding insurance on that shipment, please check the Bill of Lading. If insurance was not requested, it won't be included. You would need to contact the relevant parties regarding that.\n\nRegarding your inquiry for the 2,000 MT butter to New York, I am forwarding your request to our quotes department for a response.\n\nBest Regards,\nMr."

I had understood this to mean a 'vannie' (van), with a total length of 26 meters, including the cab and space for cars. However, you are referring to a RORO truck.\n\nRORO trucks are typically around 28 tons in weight capacity. Since the empty weight of the container plus the centrifuge system amounts to 30.8 tons (2.8 + cargo weight), and even though 4 axle vannies can go up to 40 tons, the issue would be fitting it into an enclosed van.\n\nAs this exceeds the typical RORO truck capacity and cannot be placed in a van, we cannot fulfill this request.\n\nThank you for contacting us.\n\nSincerely,\nOperations Team\nShipping Company"

We'd like to suggest an alternative transportation method which could be much more cost-effective for you.\n\nHere's the technical background:\n\nAs you likely know, several passenger ships travel between South America and the Caribbean. One such ship is the MS Francy, which typically operates between Brazil and Venezuela. This ship was recently chartered by a tour operator from Dubai, who has also requested our assistance with logistics.\n\nBest regards,\nJoseline Rodriguez"

The vessel was used by a tour operator from Dubai, and they are looking to finalize the operation. I will ask them to contact you directly to provide further details.\n\nInitially, the operator was seeking containerized solutions. However, after careful calculation, we've determined that using containers would significantly increase costs relative to the cargo volume. Therefore, the most viable option would be to utilize 20' pallets, loaded using forklifts.\n\nBest regards,\nJoseline Rodriguez"

This vessel will be chartered by the tour operator for this voyage.\n\nWe suggest utilizing 20' flat racks (pallets) loaded on the decks of the vessel, and potentially using trucks driven aboard and carried in the hold of the vessel.

While we can handle smaller shipments, we can offer a significantly better rate if you commit to an annual contract of 100,000 tonnes.\n\nFor an annual commitment of 100,000 tonnes, our best rate would be $60 per tonne, plus an additional $5 per tonne. This $5 surcharge reflects a discount we receive from the Ashdod Port Authority for high-volume shippers, which we pass on to our clients.\n\nWe also offer shipping insurance for an additional $3 per tonne. Please note that a deposit of $20,000 is required before we commence shipping. The freight will be FOB (Free On Board), meaning you are responsible for all costs associated with transporting the cement from the terminal in Bombay to your desired location.\n\nI am preparing a contract form for your review. Please let me know if you are interested in pursuing the annual contract.\n\nYours truly,\nHa Jang"

The Seablue is a crude vessel, and almost all our recent crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers coming out of Chinese yards.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, even if the Seablue wasn't grounded and was available out of China, other tankers would still come out of the dock and be fixed for China.\n\nThese tankers would likely operate at a price level influenced by the most competitive time charter tanker (which, in this scenario, would have been the drydocked Seablue). Therefore, the price level at which China is fixed wouldn't be significantly different even if Seablue was out of the drydock and operational.\n\nLPG cargoes are different, since we can't use LPG tankers for crude, and crude cargoes aren't as easily fixed as LPG, as many producers are contracted with set prices.

We primarily handle bulk containers (20 and 40 feet) but can consider other vessel types for larger volumes. Our typical minimum shipment size for these routes is 15,000 tons.\n2.  We can accept transshipments of grain from European ports (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany).\n3.  We offer service roughly every two weeks from Europe, with onward transshipment to Vladivostok approximately once per month. We can also arrange for grain to be sourced from these European ports for transshipment in the United States.\n4.  Our services include transshipment of grain from the United States to Vladivostok and transshipment from Europe to Vladivostok.\n\nI will provide additional information in a separate email.\n\nRegards,\n\n<Redacted>"

I assume you're planning on shipping it by sea.\n\nThe oil trade often relies on a just-in-time inventory management model, where oil is shipped as needed. This approach aims for stable supply and demand, reduces inventory storage costs, and minimizes degradation.\n\nGiven the scale and urgency of your request (25,000 MT in seven days), my initial freight quote estimate would likely exceed available capacity. To clarify, are you certain about the 7-day timeframe? If so, I can provide a quote based on the maximum volume my company can handle within that constraint.\n\nThanks,\nPerry"

If you require a full outbound tanker, the only companies with the capacity to manage that directly are generally major players like Shell, Chevron, or Exxon. I unfortunately do not have contacts at those companies.\n\nIf shipping by sea is indeed the plan, you'll need access to a suitable port in Copenhagen for loading onto a tanker. I've reached out to my contacts at the Port of Copenhagen to inquire about availability and options. I anticipate hearing back from them tomorrow morning.\n\nMoving that quantity by road, using 45-liter drums, would present significant storage, logistical, and legal challenges, making it essentially impossible to coordinate within seven days.\n\nI'm inclined to decline your request for shipping 25,000 MT of oil in seven days due to these constraints. I'm also hesitant to involve my contacts at the Port of Copenhagen further, given the unlikelihood of success. However, if you insist, I can inform them you'll be contacting them directly, though I cannot guarantee a prompt response.\n\nRegrettably, I lack the resources to fulfill your request within the specified timeframe. I strongly recommend submitting your inquiry directly to one of the large oil companies I mentioned earlier. Thank you for considering my company. \n\nRegards,\nPerry"

They will then hang two of our timbers from the inside of this rock wall with chain.\n\nThe nailing requirement for these timbers will be strictly adhered to in the construction of the display. The museum has asked that the side facing the rock wall be prepared to display it, potentially with some sort of protective material.

The estimated loading rate would be approximately 7-8 MT per hour.\n\nIf you are packaging the PKE, please note the maximum weight per package should not exceed 1,500 kg, as our handling equipment is limited to this weight.\n\nTo prevent damage to the PKE during loading, we have implemented special procedures. We recommend ensuring the outer shell of the packaging is securely closed after loading and suggest using a sealing material. We can send you a sample of the material we recommend if you wish.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nJames"

This can be changed to object of the preposition for - voyage for.\nThis change turns the whole sentence into the passive sentence.\n\nThe subject will be the preposition.\nWe know this because the preposition for comes before the subject. We can make it a voyage.\n\nWe are looking for a voyage\n\nThe question is\nWho are looking for a voyage\n\nAnswer They are looking for a voyage.\n\nCommon mistake in student papers\n\n1. Using the active form for these sentences.\n\nWe do not use the active form when there is a preposition after the subject.\nIt should be\nHe is looking for a house.\nWe have the active form He is looking, but for comes after it.\nWe change the active form to the passive form, thus creating the passive form.\n\nThere is looking for a house.\n\n2. Removing the article.\n\nThe article a is required to make the sentence active.\nHe is looking for a house.\nIf you remove a, you have created a passive sentence.\n\nWho is looking"

However, I understand the GDDT-101 has a cargo capacity of only 7,800 tons.\n\nHow did you manage to load so much cargo? Furthermore, the remaining space was intended for a rice shipment, which is not visible in the photos you sent.\n\nPlease weigh the hull immediately and contact me with the updated figures. What is your estimated vessel draft? Are you considering removing some of the oil to comply with the vessel's capacity? This vessel is considerably large for the LPGs, the last time I was in an all-oil ship was in 2003, and I have concerns for stability\n\nBest regards,\n\nCamille Leclerc"

It's a bit of a story, but I'll keep it short.\n\nBasically, I've always been fascinated by how things move around the world. I mean, think about it \u2013 everything you own, from your phone to your coffee, probably spent some time on a ship. That's pretty cool.\n\nI started out as an intern at a freight forwarding company and got hooked. The fast pace, the problem-solving, the international aspect \u2013 it all clicked for me. There's always something new to learn, some new challenge to tackle. One day you are figuring out how to secure the best freight, the next you are dealing with a global crisis, like the Suez Canal blockage. It\u2019s never boring.\n\nIt can be stressful, sure. Lots of late nights, and keeping track of cargo across different time zones takes its toll. But at the end of the day, I feel like I\u2019m actually contributing to something important. I am helping businesses to grow and consumers to get the product they need.\n\nSo yeah, that's the gist of it. No grand plan or anything, just stumbled into it and fell in love with the chaos!\n\nCheers,\nJohn"

My company is still attempting to recover costs from that incident.\n\nCould you assist me in finding a reputable ship broker to arrange a shipment of goods from Greece to Rotterdam?

While we haven't personally supplied a single order of that magnitude (200,000 MT MGO), our parent company has supplied 100,000 MT+ quantities to major trading companies previously, indicating the capability exists.\n\nLoading time is negotiable between the supplier and buyer, depending on their facilities and available infrastructure. We typically provide shipping documents within 10-12 days of shipment and request payment in cash 4 weeks later. The buyer is responsible for the bank documentary charges within 2 weeks of the shipment date.\n\nThe primary challenge will be identifying a supplier capable of delivering this quantity in one go.

Therefore, two vessels would indeed be required. Splitting the order into two 100,000 MT shipments, as previously suggested, would align well with available vessel capacity.\n\nThere are numerous vessels available that can accommodate this cargo volume. The average delivery time for this type of shipment is approximately 45 days, though this can vary depending on the vessel's route and speed.\n\nShipping costs can range from USD 10 to USD 20 per MT, influenced by the size of the vessel, the chosen route, and the overall distance.\n\nIn summary, splitting the order into two shipments of around 100,000 MT each appears to be the most practical approach.\n\nBest regards,\nCapt.

Each type has specific advantages and disadvantages, which should be considered based on your needs.\n\nThe most common route is indeed from Europe to Japan.

To find the treasure, you must go to Wyoming and take a hike to the summit of the mountain on March 14, and find a rock with a spider web and a spider on it. There is a chunk of stone with the date 2014, then there is a map that was drawn by the Aboriginals in a nearby valley that shows where to go next. It is approximately 2 [units missing]."

The Almarakib's Pakistani captain is looking to supplement his income. He's offering transport from our port to Pakistan to earn some quick cash. He's acting as a freelancer and is willing to take on extra jobs if the price is right, as long as he receives payment upfront.\n\n2. He's asking for $30,000 upfront for this additional run. We can only cover this by taking out a loan, which we realistically can't afford. I'm forced to sell my share of the ship to repay it.\n\nI'm writing this from the bank on my phone. I've unfortunately had to agree to let the bank have your share of the ship as well to completely cover the loan.\n\nRegards,\nSada"

I am a vessel broker and currently representing a Chinese bulk carrier positioned in Chittagong, Bangladesh.\n\nWe have approximately 3,800 MT of heavy steel plates available for loading. The intended discharge port is Port Louis, Mauritius.\n\nOur agents have provided a breakdown of anticipated port dues and fees in Port Louis, which they intend to deduct from the cargo. These include:\n\n*   General Cargo Port Dues: USD 3,256.00\n*   Coast Guard Charges: USD 164.00\n*   Mauritius Free Airport Fee (MFAF): USD 112.80\n*   Port Corporation Fees: USD 159.84\n*   Generator Rental: USD 0.16/Hour * 12 Hours = USD 1.92\n*   Empty Tank Cleaning: USD 10.00 * 2 Tanks = USD 20.00\n\nCould you kindly take these anticipated deductions into account when preparing your freight quote? I can provide further documentation as required.\n\nThank you,\nSamuel"

        "body": "Dear Samuel,\n\nThank you for your email.\n\nRegarding the port charges, it is generally not standard practice to pass these costs directly onto the cargo owners unless explicitly agreed upon in the terms of carriage. If you can provide documentation demonstrating that the carrier is entitled to deduct these charges from the cargo value (e.g., a relevant clause in the Bill of Lading or a prior agreement), we can consider adjusting our freight rate to compensate.\n\nHowever, if these charges are solely intended to cover agency fees or other operational costs not directly related to the cargo, we cannot accommodate them within our quote.\n\nTo provide you with a more accurate freight quote, could you please provide the following information:\n\n*   Cargo Origin\n*   Steel Grade\n*   Product Code (if applicable)\n\nThe more details you can provide upfront, the quicker we can process your request and minimize potential delays.\n\nThank you,\n\nAlain Ferris\n"

You are correct; there has been congestion and delays experienced since the Ever Given incident in March. While the canal was reopened in mid-April, a backlog of vessels accumulated, causing some continued delays.\n\nAs of May 2nd, we observed a significant number of vessels experiencing delays.\n\nRegarding the Ever Given, the vessel was successfully refloated on March 29th. It was then held under arrest in the Canal Zone for several months before being released. \n\nWe are actively monitoring the situation and will provide updates as they become available. To best assess the potential impact on your specific shipments, please provide your booking references or container numbers so we can check the status.\n\nSincerely,\nThe Shipping Updates Team"

Just how much it costs for a quote and if there is a minimum number of products you have to buy.\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s an education. Like how the Navy discovered it would lose too many crewmen if they started a major war without undergoing combat training first, so they decided to create such training so that every year they would lose fewer and fewer crews. Combat training also provided the Navy with the opportunity to evaluate newly created equipment and armaments.\n\nIn short, anyone can be an entrepreneur. You don\u2019t need to be the richest"

The main factor here is that every port of origin in this region has its own cargo\u2019s name that differs from one port to another. Let me give you an example. Vung Tau\u2019s oil is usually known as \u201cXONE\u201d, for example. If the cargo\u2019s origin was not Vung Tau, it would be known as something different. In the first email, the seller is probably from Vung Tau, the port so he doesn\u2019t want to use the common port of origin name, but he wants to use the name of the port where his product originates from. We have, however, to be cautious when receiving information from an agent, because often it is not completely correct. If the agent wants to sell his cargo by using an incorrect cargo name, it is much easier for him to trick the buyer by giving a name that has a higher profit for him, or a name that is more familiar for the potential buyer. This issue is something that we have to be aware of. We have to make sure that the cargo is what we think it is, and if we\u2019re sure that we know the exact"

If the owner insists on an automatic pilot watchkeeper, it is up to the captain to comply.

The distance is approximately 275 miles, possibly shortening to 250 miles if you cut through the shallows.\n\nWith the shallowest part being 43 feet, a 35,000 DWT tanker would need about 16' of draft. If a tanker suitable for this route existed, insurance premiums shouldn't be a major hurdle.\n\nHowever, I'm not aware of any tankers currently operating that are designed for this specific shallow-water route. It's not a simple matter of 'connecting the dots'.\n\nInsurance companies might also consider the lack of refueling points along the route, potentially leading to higher rates in case of a loss.\n\nBob"

One was for delivery of oil from Curacao to Pointe-a-Pitre in Guadeloupe. The other was for sale of oil from Fort-de-France in Martinique to Pointe-a-Pitre.\n\nAccording to our records, the former involved the sale of 2,000 mt HFO to the M/S Mayflower Bayside owned by Epsilon Tankers Corporation, T/A Mayflower Shipping Ltd. under terms CIF (with additional provisos, and legal issues) for delivery to Port Louis in Guadeloupe, to a named buyer (Epsilon Tankers Corporation). The Master (unnamed) sailed from Rotterdam on 9/--/----, however, due to legal and other issues, this sale was never delivered. I am unsure of the exact date they sailed from Rotterdam.\n\nLarry"

While we are still in June and there are some slots available in July, the combined volume limits our options.\n\nWe could potentially fit 1,000 MT of milk powder and the 1,500 MT of grain on the same vessel.

While vessels with the required specifications for this type of cargo can be limited, I will investigate availability and provide you with the following details:\n\n1.

Most of the coal is stored at berths that are either elevated or located away from the water, requiring side-loading. These berths are essentially ash ponds filled from barges, stockpiles, or rail. The coal needs to be transported to the vessel. The actual loading process will depend on the specific coal berth.\n\nThe average loading rate is usually between 600-800 MT/hour. However, given the absence of draft restrictions and berthing limitations, we anticipate an average loading rate of around 1500 MT/hour. We might even reach 2,000 MT/hour if the coal can be delivered to the berth efficiently.\n\nAlso, be advised that water levels in the port tend to be low in March.\n\nRegards,\nBrian"

The goods, comprising one Rolls Royce and four pieces of household goods, have been detained by the Liberian authorities for the past three years.

This rate was introduced to reflect the charterer's ability to make a simple and accurate calculation based on the CBM's stated on their cargo. Our customer, Shell, has explained to us that they will not proceed with this arrangement for their LNG shipments unless the CBM charge is less than 90 cents/cbm.\n\nWe are also requesting that BIMCO changes the wording of the applicable provision of the GCM/Voyage Charterparty to ensure...\n"

The vessel should be available for loading up to April 25th.\n\nTo proceed with a voyage quotation, our ethylene specialists require the following documents:\n\n- Bunker Delivery Note (for any recent bunkering)\n- Documentation authorizing bunkering at Houston (if required)\n- Vessel Details for identification (IMO number, full name)\n- Recent Dry Dock Certificate\n- Current SGS Dry Cargo Logbook\n\nPlease provide these documents at your earliest convenience, so we can expedite your quotation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Edmonds"

We are anticipating a firm price by the end of next week for up to 20,000 MT of various urea types.\n\nAs the available quantities can fluctuate daily, we would appreciate receiving a list of your specific urea requirements, including types and quantities, as soon as possible. We anticipate that the shipment may be split into three or four tranches.\n\nI will call you later today to discuss this further and potentially arrange a trip to Mumbai to finalize the details. Please also provide a list of vessels you have available that are suitable for these types of shipments.\n\nWe look forward to speaking with you soon.\n\nRegards,\nJane Doe"

It is currently in Lasbela (Mub) and is expected to complete discharge on the 11th of July (this is an example using date in base text, please ignore this). It can be ready to load around the 13th or 14th of July, with availability until the 17th of July. As it's currently under charter, a minimum berth time of 10 days would apply.\n\nThe vessel is currently loading cargo in Tamil Nadu. After discharge in Mumbai, it *could* theoretically sail directly to Mathura, avoiding a second call at Mumbai, if that simplifies things for your delivery. However, realistically, expect 1-2 days at anchor in Mumbai, plus time waiting for berth availability.\n\nBest Regards,\nLiam"

The portal also shows how certain factors, such as market volatility, can affect rates. Each sector displays a current snapshot of freight rates for each of the areas that you can trade, and a visual map indicating rate fluctuations. Also, freight rates appear in a moving graph which shows trends over the last 30 days. This is quite beneficial for traders who have to make decisions based on live market conditions.\n\nAnother important function is the ship and route selector. When a ship trader selects a specific ship, the system shows in green or red the rates and savings for that specific ship on each route. This helps traders determine which ship and which route to select.\n\nFinally, a major aspect of the technology is the asset manager,"

I do not think it is appropriate that there was no interview done to this company and I have the utmost concern of how can one do a complete review on a company without speaking to that company. For that reason, I will advise to bring this matter up during the oral argument of Mr. Detrick. Since he is hearing the matter, I think it would be proper to ask if a quick interview with the representatives of Hartley Crane Company, Inc. will be a consideration for the trustee."
