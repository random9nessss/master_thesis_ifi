After-hours berthing is an option, but we\u2019re flexible. Could you get back to me with some options for the next week and next month?                    Thanks,                    Susanna\nEmail 2:\nJust to follow up, we're still in need of options from Turkey. What do you suggest for a daily service to Turkey, starting next week? This is urgent.\n    Dear Susanna,  \n        Our liners operate out of Virginia, Houston and Long Beach, and to Istanbul, \u0130zmir, K\u00fctahya, and Antalya. We also have a weekly direct service to \u0130zmir from Savannah. It\u2019s a fast service, it takes about 14 days from loading in the US to discharging in Turkey. If you\u2019re interested in shipping from Houston, it\u2019s an 11 day trip to Antalya. All of these routes can be served from one of our 3 weekly services. For a monthly schedule, please visit our website. We don\u2019t accept individual bookings, so you would need to find a freight forwarder or consolidator to place your booking.\n    Jack\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

The contract says 2,500MT, but they might also require 1,500MT of grain. This order will leave in the first week of July. We need your help.                    How much would shipping 4,000MT of both goods together cost, and do you see any risk of port congestion?                    Many thanks,                    Ivy\nEmail 2:\nHi Ivy,\nGood morning.\n\nThe order for 2,500MT should be easy to manage.\nRegarding the order for 1,500MT of grain, unfortunately, we do not see any vessel available to fit both cargoes in the same vessel. As we are still in June, there are still some free slots available on July, but as the order size is so big, we have limited choices.\nThat being said, we can manage to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain in the same vessel with the owner of a 10,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge the previous cargo in July. All details about the vessel are as follows:\n\nM/V T1\nType    General Cargo\nFlag    Liberia\nCall    MOYO\nDeadweight    8,600MT\nBuilt    1996\nHold No\nEmail 3:\nRegarding the risk of port congestion in Australia, I'm afraid the situation is getting worse and that it may be difficult to find a slot for such a big order. Also, the railway terminals are overloaded as well.\nI know the situation seems very bad. I can only offer you the best available. If you are willing to wait till October, I can offer you a better slot with more space. This way, you will be able to fit more products, or reduce the price.\nWhat do you think?\nEmail 4:\nThank you for your help. The information you provided is very useful to us. \nWe want to ship the 4,000MT cargo in early July. We do not have enough storage capacity, so if we delay the delivery, it may lead to the depreciation of our goods, so I'm afraid we can only choose the original plan.\nAlso, we will have more orders to deliver in July. Can you please help us?\nWaiting for your reply!\nRegards,\nIvy\nBest regards,\nMartin\nEmail 5:\nHi Ivy,\n\nI understand that you have to deliver the order at the earliest opportunity, and that you can't wait till October. I'll look for a slot in September for you.\n\nPlease find attached a quotation for 3,000MT and 4,000MT. We can ship 1,000MT in July and 2,000MT or 3,000MT in August. I can fit 2,000MT on a 6,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September and 3,000MT on a 6,500dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September as well.\n\nDo you have a choice of milk powder or grain as the cargo to be shipped in August?\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\nMartin\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

My barge can only carry 1,400 mt.\nFor freight rate we have three rate contracts, these are for 6 months and 3 months and 1 month. So no fixed rate and no bunker escalation clause.\n\nBest regards,\nKwan Wai Lim\n                    Global Sea Trade Pte Ltd\n\n                    7 Scotts Road #14-02 Shaw Centre 228210\n                    Tel: (65) 6733 6385 | Fax:\nEmail 3:\nKwan Wai Lim, \n                    Ms. [namew@bizsouthasia.com]                    Sent: 3 June 2020 2:25 PM\n                    To: Paula Tan [peTan@ch7.com.sg]                    Subject: RE: Coal barge freight rate from Kuantan to Johor\n\nHi Paula, \n\nSince you have more questions, please let me know in advance when you want to meet up so I can work out a suitable date and time for both of us.\nPlease let me know the number of mt we are discussing.\n\nWarm regards,\nKwan Wai Lim\n\nFrom: Paula Tan\n                    Sent: 3 June 2020 9:56 AM\n                    To: Kwan Wai Lim\n                    Cc: Glenn Tan\n                    Subject: FW: Coal barge freight rate from Kuantan to Johor\n\nKwan\nEmail 4:\nI have a requirement to ship 3,400 mt of coal from Kuantan to Johor on June 7.

We can be very flexible on loading, but need to know your thoughts on two possible shipping methods:                    1. 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. How much extra would be this compared to a typical voyage at your current market price?                    2. 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev. Is there any discount available if we book these voyages for 2016 as well?                    Sincerely,                    Sarah\nEmail 2:\nDear Sarah,                        Glad to get your inquiry. Actually, I have just sent an email regarding the new liner service through Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode to VRS China. Let me know if you get that. I am not sure about the sea transport to India since I am not from that dept. But I would like to go for the FCL rate of Hoegh Autoliner as there is an attractive rate by these carriers.                    One of my friends of Taiwan is also very interested in this carrier. She will go for 10/20 cbm containers. But they were waiting for the government\u2019s final approval. Anyway, please wait for our China dept\u2019s advice.                    Any other queries please contact me at any time.                    Have a nice day!                    Yours faithfully,                    Rita Lee\n\n\nThis email exchange reveals the organizational culture at logistics\nEmail 3:\nSubject: 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode?\nRita,   I got your message about Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. Thank you for the offer! Do you have any indication on the timing of the service? In addition, do you think I should consider 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev as well? I did not include those carriers in the original email because my thinking was that they are more suitable for 2016. Still, the volumes will be the same for both years. Sarah\n\n\nIn this email exchange, Sarah was mainly interested in the future developments of Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. She also mentioned that she wanted to discuss an alternative carrier, Golden Highway and Damleev.\n\n<Email 4>:\nSubject\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

The Port of Elizabeth is basically a bit \u201crustic\u201d. Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h. We can also do up to 2,000 mt/h if the coal can be delivered to the berth quickly and easily.\n\nBe advised that in March, the water in the port will be very low.

It looks like neither your terminal nor mine has cranes strong enough to handle such large ships. But we do have a lot of common interests with the island of Grande Comore. For example, we can both benefit from using a reputable port with quality equipment and speedy service, as well as avoiding overloading.                    The solution is to find a company that can efficiently load the cargo. Most shipping companies prefer to hire their own personnel for discharge because their ships require a high level of attention. The only problem is that many stevedoring companies are not experienced in unloading large ships. And that\u2019s why we need your help.
