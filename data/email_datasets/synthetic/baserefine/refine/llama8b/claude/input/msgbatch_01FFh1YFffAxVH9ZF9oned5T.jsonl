As a financial advisor to the Wilson family, I am pleased to introduce this matter to you, especially since you have proven your ability to carry out your operations without much delay.

I wish to inform you that the goods which comprises of one piece of one Rolls Royce and four pieces of Household goods have been detained by the Librerian authorities for the past three years as they claim that the customs documents were not properly filled.

Do you have a representative there who will be able to pick it up on your behalf?

In this case, you need to be direct and say that you cannot send a freight quotation without that document. If they ask about the freight quotation first, share a rough estimate with a mention that it will be updated when you have the material specification. The buyer should realize that this is the only way for you to take an offer. It is your first line of defense against waste of time. Other brokers might not understand that they need to ask for the material specification because they do not have a \"ship\" yet, so they can only discuss price and laycan. This is very wrong, but I am sure it happens.  If you are an agent, you should receive the material specification from the buyer. If you don't have it, call your counterpart to discuss this.

It\u2019s very impressive, and the navigation is very convenient. The layout is very intuitive, and all sections are very well organized.
