When it rains, the water leaks through the roof into my bedroom. We had a leak a few years ago when it rained really hard, and our home insurance paid for a new roof. However, the leaky roof was not included in our insurance policy. I am wondering if I should hire someone to fix the roof or if there is some other way that I could fix it myself. I am not a professional, but I am fairly handy and I am not afraid of doing a bit of hard work.\nEmail 4:\n1\nEmail 1:\n1\n2\nEmail 1:\n1\n2\nEmail 2:\nThank you for your email.

A problem arises in distinguishing between logs and lumber, and lumber that has been cut and sawn and lumber that is not sawn. And even a commitment to pay for a formal inspection would not be sufficient to get past U.S. Customs\u2019 questions. So, when the importing country wishes to assure itself that U.S. law is being complied with, the issuing country may provide an assurance in the form of an import certificate, an export certificate,\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

This charterparty refers to a CBM charge of $1.20 per CBM as the basis of calculation for a FCN charter.

Our customer, Shell, has explained to us that they will not proceed with this arrangement for their LNG shipments unless the CBM charge is less than 90 cbm.
