Verifying the Product\n1. Using the Web\nFind the product name: vanadium pentoxide\nUsing Google, find the definition:\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/vanadium+pentoxide\nThe definition is:\n\u201cVanadium(V) oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula V2O5. It is used industrially as a catalyst for sulfuric acid production and as a catalyst in the exhaust systems of motor vehicles. It is a brown/yellow solid, although when freshly precipitated from aqueous solution, its colour is deep orange. The molecular and crystal structure of V2O5 has been intensively studied by many techniques. The structure of the bulk is well understood\nEmail 4:\nReply from Ms. Sylvia to Mr. Jean-Christophe Constantinou\nDear Mr. Jean-Christophe Constantinou,\nThank you for the inquiry about vanadium pentoxide. As requested by your customer we could offer you Fos Sur Mer for loading late-July. The port of loading is Secunda, South Africa. We can load 3,500MT in bulk, packed in 25kg bags. We will then be able to provide the following documents: the Proforma Invoice, the Commercial Invoice, the Bill of Lading, and the Packing List. The payment will be done by the term L/C at sight.\nWe are a successful chemical wholesaler, representing many companies, from producers, traders and brokers. We specialize in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, minerals, fertilizer, additives and intermediates, such as Vanadium Pentoxide.

It\u2019s just that we have multiple shipments of this cargo, and it would be really helpful to negotiate rates with you once. Thank you!\n\n<Email 4>:\nI\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re on the same page, so I\u2019ll clarify. For that fixture, there\u2019s no way to accommodate a lower rate. So to be clear, I\u2019m just curious whether or not you\u2019re willing to let us know if any other future fixtures might have space for our product. That\u2019s all! Thanks.\n<Email 5>:\nHi Ivy, We\u2019re happy to set up a meeting for you to discuss with our business manager. When can you fit this into your schedule?\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

Chuck has asked about the airfreight and insurance costs, and Chris has said he'll get back to Chuck about the cost details. Chuck, however, is impatient, and he asks again for the details. Chuck's questions assume that Chris can find the details easily.

We have arranged\nwith a very good cargo vessel which will be leaving from the port of Valparaiso\non 24 July and arriving in Isla Margarita on 27 July. This cargo vessel will be\nchartered by the tour operator for this voyage. We suggest the option by 20' flat\nracks (pallets) to be loaded on the decks of the vessel and also by trucks to\nbe driven aboard and carried in the hold of the vessel. This will be the cheapest\nway to move your cargo. Please let me know if you would like us to quote on this\nproposal. The itinerary of the ship is as follows:\n*Dep.

He had offered an alternative product for the price you had provided.\nThe supplier is directly from the US and I think there is no reason for any third party to be involved in the transaction.\nTo be honest with you, the suppliers are not even prepared to sell the product at the prices you had quoted. For this reason, I don\u2019t think we will be able to do business with you and appreciate if you will be kind enough to refund the advance payment of 1,200USD.\nThank you for your assistance in this matter.\nBest Regards,\nMahesh Nambiar\nEmail 4:\n---------- Forwarded message ----------                     From: John <xxxxxxxx@*****.com>                     To: Mahesh Nambiar <mahesh.nambiar@*****.com>                     Sent: Thu, Oct 21, 2021 at 4:13 PM                     Subject: Isopropanol quote for Houston to Cartagena                     Hi Mahesh,                     Please see below quote from us as requested.

What is the base FOB rate for this shipment?                    Kind regards,                    Matt\nEmail 2:\nSubject: Re: Cement Transport                    Hey Matt,                    We can do 100,000 tonnes a year for you, if you agree on an annual contract. The best rate for you will be $60 per tonne + $5 in extra charges. The extra charges is because the port authority in Israel gives us that discount if we ship at least 100,000 tonnes per year.                      I also have a discount if you take shipping insurance. The extra charge for the insurance is$3 per tonne. You also need to deposit $20,000 into our account before we start shipping cement to you. The freight will be FOB, which means that you pay all the charges to move the cement from the terminal to the warehouse, or any location you want. Let me know if you are interested. I'm just preparing a form for you to sign.                    Yours truly,                    Ha\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

When I asked about what their specific needs were, the agent replied:                    We need to sail from this port to that port with 10,000MT of this cargo in this season at a reasonable price.

We have only a few items of general cargo of 15 tons or less. The cargo is to be delivered to Shanghai by container for $US 2,500. The total price of the container and insurance will be $US 1,100. The additional expenses are as follows:\n                    1.     All documents including the Bill of Lading will be delivered to the ship owner by e-mail.\n                    2.     There is no cargo already in the container. The seller will provide the container at their own cost and liability.\n                    3.
