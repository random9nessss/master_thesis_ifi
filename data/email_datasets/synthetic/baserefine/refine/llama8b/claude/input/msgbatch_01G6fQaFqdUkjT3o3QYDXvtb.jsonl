BAF should be around $120/mt (based on old fix as BAF has changed dramatically), however if a GdW is used please be aware the vessel will likely be late when BAF is calculated. \nAbout this post:                   It\u2019s useful to think about what someone needs to know (what information they need) and how you can present it to them (the style you can use).                    This helps you to produce emails that are both concise and comprehensive.                    It helps you to be consistent in your writing, and the person receiving your email will feel reassured by the consistency of style (if you can remember to use it!)                    And, if you use the same style for several emails to the same person, it\nEmail 2:\nDear Mrs. Walters, \n               We are still in contact with our vendors in Nanded and are anticipating a price at the end of next week for up to 20,000MT of various types of urea. As the quantities can change daily, we would like you to provide the last two digits of your credit card number. \n               I will call you later today to discuss this and to arrange for a flight to Mumbai. As you know, we need to be flexible on the types of urea and quantities, but please feel free to send a list of your requirements. We are anticipating that we may receive it in three or four shipments, so that may be something to consider. Please also provide us with a list of the vessels that you have available. \n               We are looking forward to seeing you. \n               Hope this helps, thanks, Jane \nAbout this post:\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Best regards,                    Ben\nYou will see that in the first two emails, Ben goes a little off track. In the first email he doesn\u2019t send the fcl rate and ETA. In the second email, he starts to talk about letters of credit when Grace never asked about that.\n\nBack to the example in Ben\u2019s favour\n\n<Email 1>:\nHello Grace,                    We\u2019re looking to ship 20,000MT of steel from Paldock\nEmail 5:\nHello Grace,                    We\u2019re looking to ship 20,000MT of steel from Paldock\n\n<Email 2>:\nHi Grace,                    Attached you will find our quotations for Paldock to Monrovia for your steel cargo.                    We will send your cargo within three days of receipt of your irrevocable letter of credit in our account in London.                    Could you confirm that the steel can be shipped in containers? If not, do you have other requirements (such as barge?); and do you have any requirements for the steel?                    We can carry the bill of lading either to bearer or to the order of your bank, as you require.                    If you would like us to carry the bill of lading to bearer, please let us know when to expect the irrevocable letter of credit in our London account.
