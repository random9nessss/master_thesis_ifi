Susan\n\nThis would be an easy detection system for anyone who was trying to determine if an email reply was generated by a human or by a bot. It's not perfect (or rather, it's not \"perfectly perfect\"), but it is a way to detect spam bots.\n\nHowever, what we're looking for is not just whether an email reply is generated by a bot, but whether the person that sent the email actually wrote that reply. Or in other words: Is the email genuine? Does this person exist? Is it really my friend or colleague that's sending me these messages?\n\nWhat you should do to test if the email is genuine\n\nTo test whether an email is genuine, you should check two things:\n\n1.

Is there any other information in the email that could be used to validate that it's really the person sending it?\n\nTo start with, you should look for:\n\nThis is a topic that I cover in more detail in my article on spotting bots.\n\nThe key here is that you can't just rely on one factor to validate whether an email is genuine. You have to combine multiple factors together. You have to ask yourself: How strong is each of these factors? How confident am I that this email is genuine?

The first modification was in 2010 when a new engine was installed. This new engine has increased the vessel\u2019s cargo capacity to 7000MT and increased its efficiency. In 2017, the vessel underwent another modification in which its six layers were lined with waterproof cloth and epoxy. This modification has improved the vessel\u2019s ability to carry cargo without leaking and increased its durability. We believe that these modifications have improved the vessel\u2019s performance and made it a better choice for shipping iron ore.
