The description was a mistake, I apologize.  It will take some time to rectify, as the program is not flexible. We are working on it.  I have noticed that the cargo manifest lists a number of containers and cargoes.  Would it be too much trouble to have your engineering team create a list of the contents of\n\n<Email 4>:\n These replies were received:\n\nThe container number is not a mistake. It has been deleted from the manifest. Do you understand this?\n\nNo, I do not understand. Why has it been deleted?\n\nI thought I said that I would not use a loaded container to transport coal, because it would not be able to fit everything that was needed to be transported. So I asked for a container with nothing in it, to be used for coal. The cargo manifest is a copy of the order. I do not need a container number, just the description of what is in the cargo.\n\nThe cargo manifest lists cargoes that are not in the containers you have sent. You must supply the correct containers.\n\nHow can you ask for cargoes if they have already been sent? I will check the numbers, but the cargo manifest has not been updated since you received it.\n\nThe cargo manifest has been updated. Please\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

According to him this guy in Pakistan can get any commodities from Pakistan as they can buy them from factory (must be from buyer) and ship them to the middle east countries. My question is how safe is it for us to run a commission business as we don't know this person from Pakistan.                    You are more experienced than I am regarding that. I guess as long as we sign an agreement with the seller then we are covered.                    Can you advise me on that please?

Basically, they are looking to bring the fresh produce in from Pakistan to Jeddah and pay the charges to us.  They need it at a particular time of the year when Pakistan can supply the crops that are in season. The peak months would be April to September or so.  As you are in the meat business you may be able to get them deals and bring them in cheaply. The market is big there. I will contact you through Facebook as it will be better and you can find them in my friends list.\n\n                            Do you have a suitable vessel for 5,000MT of DAP fertilizer from Karachi to Jeddah next week?\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Could you provide a sample contract with your typical terms and conditions?                    Thank you,                    Hector\nEmail 2:\nDear Sir,                    First of all, congratulations on your success and new position at Voyaca.com. I came across your profile on LinkedIn and found you very qualified to assist me in a very urgent matter.                    A few years ago, I employed a ship broker by the name of Brian Hopkin from Thomas Hopkin & Co to help charter a vessel to ship my company's produce from Panama to the West Coast of the USA.                    Unfortunately, a few days into the voyage, the vessel ran aground and was a total loss. Not only did Brian misrepresent his ship owner to be a reputable one, he went ahead and used me to sign up an insurance contract for his own personal benefit, under the influence of alcohol.                    He connived with the insurance company to release his profit after the ship sank but my company is still waiting for its share of the payout. Mr. Hopkin,\nEmail 3:\nDear Sir,                    At the time, I wasn't aware that he had so much experience in ship brokerage. I learned his dishonesty at the expense of my company. He had forged documents showing a photograph of the vessel to the owners before shipping and didn't tell me about his limited experience as an underwriter. Now I am having trouble recovering the costs of the cargo.                    Can you help me find a reliable ship broker to ship a product from Greece to Rotterdam? Can you advise on the best route, avoid legal and insurance mishaps, and ensure my company is protected against mishaps and liabilities?                    Thank you in advance for your assistance.\n            Best regards,            Cieran\nResponse:\nHello Hector and Cieran,            Thank you for your enquiry.            Please find a draft of our Charter Party Terms & Conditions.            I would also like to suggest that Cieran contact a Ship Ins\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

Thus, there is a restriction against these situations to facilitate the tracking of pending operations.\n\nIn the third case, it is possible to get a counter-offer or a quote by the other\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.
