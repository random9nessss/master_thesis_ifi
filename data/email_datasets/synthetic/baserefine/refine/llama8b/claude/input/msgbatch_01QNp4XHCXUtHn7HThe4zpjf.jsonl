Cheers,                    Kristina\nEmail 2:\nHi Kristina,                It's in the $90s/ton (FOB Nola) at the moment. Rates are firm at this level, since very few tonnage is being offered. Also, considering the port congestion in Houston, we would only sign a charter party once we have the deal in hand. Should the charter party contain a destination clause, then of course, it could be signed upon final confirmation.               Regards, Alex\n\nComment:\nNotice the commercial terms are spoken in term of shipping industry currency: MT, t, per ton, etc.\nEmail 3:\nHere in Norway, it's our currency, the Krone, that is used. So here goes our deal in the local currency:\n\n3,300,000/MT (FOB Nola)\n\nA charter party may be drawn up to cover our terms. But, if the MEG should arrive a bit early, we could store the cargo until we need it.\n\nBest, Kris.\n\nComment:\nHere we have the commercial terms expressed in terms of \"3,300,000/MT\" instead of \"per ton\". In our example, 3,300,000 is the same as $90. The reason for the discrepancy is that Kristina, the seller, is located in Oslo, Norway, and the selling price is denominated in Norwegian Krone (NOK). One NOK equals 0.16 USD.\nEmail 4:\nHello Mr. Harris,                    It's you again.

I wonder if you know anything about cargo?  It seems to us that most of the big ships do not have their cargo listed on your online service.  I was just wondering if you might have information on shipping agencies that might be able to provide that information?\n\n                     Yours,                    Jessica\n\n<Email 4>:\nDear Mr. Richards\n\n<Email 3>:\n Dear Mr. Richards,\n\n                     I just received word that our project has been canceled.

It seems that most of the vessels under 20,000 tons are not available to carry cargo, even when they are tied up at the docks.  Do you know anyone who might be able to help us?  The ships listed in the Maritime Datebase are not for sale, although some shipyards are listed.  Are there any shipowners who have vessels for sale?  Are they listed in the Maritime Datebase?\n\n                     Yours,                    Jessica\n\n<Email 4>:\n  Dear Mr. Richards,\n\n                     I just received word that our project has been canceled.

Hu,                    We are organizing a 200,000mt cargo of MGO from Gijon, Spain, to Japan. As you know, it\u2019s a big shipment. In your opinion, are all the suppliers out there able to supply such a big order?                    Also, how long will the loading time take?                    Many thanks,                    Timothy\nEmail 2:\nDear Tim,             I'm going to refer to my first email response and elaborate as requested.             We\u2019ve never sold that quantity of MGO. Our company is a division of a larger company that has supplied 100,000mt+ to major trading companies in the last few years, so we can do this. The time frame can be negotiated between the supplier and buyer. We usually provide the shipping documents within 10-12 days of the shipment and request payment in cash 4 weeks later. The buyer needs to pay the bank documentary charges within 2 weeks of the shipment.             I think the real trick is to find a supplier who is able to supply this quantity. To find a supplier for 200,000mt who is able to deliver such a big order is quite challenging. The order should be split into two parts, each part being around 100,000mt.\nEmail 3:\nI\u2019ve just learned that the delivery vessel has a limit of 130,000mt and two big ships might be needed. So, 100,000mt of the order might be enough to fill one ship, and the other ship will have to be loaded with the other 100,000mt.             There are many shipping vessels available that can take this amount of cargo. The average delivery time for this kind of shipment is around 45 days, although it\u2019s possible to shorten the delivery time. It depends on the cargo vessel\u2019s available route.             The costs for this shipment can vary from USD 10 to USD 20 per mt, depending on the size of the cargo vessel, the route taken, and the distance the cargo will have to travel.             In conclusion, I think the best course of action is to ship the order in two parts, each part being around 100\nEmail 4:\nI will continue to provide information on how to find a supplier and transport and shipping companies for this type of shipment.             The best way to find a supplier is to contact the local trade association or trade missions in your area. They can help you find a local supplier, and if there\u2019s no local supplier, they can refer you to the association or missions in the destination country.             There are several types of shipping vessels that can take this amount of cargo. The most common types are bulk carriers, tankers, container ships, and Ro-Ro (Roll-on/roll-off) vessels. Each type of vessel has its own advantages and disadvantages.             The most common route is from Europe to Japan. The distance between the two countries is around 7,000 nautical miles, and the voyage can take around 30 days, depending on the vessel\u2019s speed and the weather.
