I don't think we've spoken at any point since. I am writing because I am concerned about the current state of my company.                     As you may know, our CEO, Mr. Smith is leaving, and is rumored to be heading for JPS. The news had a significant impact on the market cap. Our stock was down 8 percent on the day of the announcement.                     The plan is to name an interim replacement while a search is conducted to find a successor. Obviously this is not the best time to be making a change but it seems that this is unavoidable.                     With that said I'm looking for advice on how to turn this situation around.

You had two equations for refractive index in the article.                                         I am trying to find a proof or derivation of one of those (the one that uses lambda and n) and wanted to see if you knew of a reference for it.

It can be found in most books on electromagnetism and optics. I wrote down the reference where I first came across this equation in my Nature paper. Have a look at page 3. But you can also find it in more recent books on plasmonics. For example in a book by Jain.\nEmail 3:\nHello.\n\nDo you have any notes or references for derivation of the equation, f2=1-2n, when n=4*Pi/lambda*d*n*d?\n\nThanks.\n\nDaniel\nEmail 4:\nSubject: \u00a0Re: f2=1-2n\n\nHi Daniel,\n\nYour question is not directly related to this particular website, therefore I think I'll reply in an email.\n\nThe only literature I can think of are two references you probably already have found yourself:\n\n(1)  P.\u00a0Drude, Handbuch der Radiologie, Leipzig: Barth, 1922 (p. 369)\n\n(2)  N.\u00a0Jain, C.\u00a0J.\u00a0Kryzhanovsky, and C.\u00a0H.\u00a0Chen, Excitation and Detection of Surface Plasmons on Gold Films.

I found that references and have already read them but I was looking for a clearer derivation that shows how the refractive index in that form, d*n/d, gets related to the frequency, lambda, and amplitude of the refractive index.\n\nThanks.\n\nDaniel\n<Email 6>:\nSubject: \u00a0Re: f2=1-2n\n\nHi Daniel,\n\nI am not sure that there is a clear derivation that you are looking for. You can find it in some other books, but I doubt that you will be very happy with it, since the derivation would be so clear.\n\nI would be very happy if someone from the audience of this website can help you by giving a clear derivation of f2=1-2n.\n<Email 7>:\nSubject\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Calloway and Vaughn. Please be advised that pursuant to Section 14.4 of the Purchase Agreement dated November 4, 2004, we have placed certain assets that are subject to the asset transfer agreement that you recently sent over to us in our depository at 15 York St., in Toronto, to await the return of those assets to ABC. These assets are detailed in a list attached to our email of December 14, 2004, (see attachment A). I assume these are the assets that are under your custody. If you have any objections to this deposit, you must advise us\nEmail 4:\n[RECEIVED AT TIME OF EMAIL]\nDear Mr. McGroarty,\nThank you for your email. Please be advised that we have no objections to the list you provided to us. However, the list in question has not been previously reviewed by the Board of Directors of ABC and therefore we are unable to provide you with any information regarding the specific assets. It is our understanding that our list does not conform to the requirements of the Sale Agreement, particularly since the list reflects that we are permitted to retain certain files and information despite the fact that we are prohibited from using or retaining any ABC Confidential Information, as set out in the Sale Agreement. This is a concern to our Board of Directors.\n\nPlease be advised that your proposal to place certain of our assets in a depository pending return to ABC is inappropriate and contrary to the terms of the Sale Agreement. Specifically, Section 2.1(a)\nEmail 5:\nI just spoke with Martin but I was copied on the email below. \n    Today is December 17th, 2004 and we continue to have no approved and executed sale agreement. In the meantime, ABC is purging all of our assets and information, and sending same to various unidentified third parties and law firms. \n     We simply cannot accept these proposals in light of ABC's wrongful purging of our assets. All of the discussion contained in your email is irrelevant in light of the purging. Please provide us with a confirmed list of all assets that have been sent to third parties and their names. \n<Email 6>:\nDear Mr. McGroarty,\n\n<Body>: You must withdraw any claim that ABC has breached the purchase agreement. You are not our trading partner; you are our custodian, holding assets that belong to ABC until such time as the transaction is closed\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Steam ships are extremely dangerous for the containers, even the newest containers. The vibrations produced by the steam engines, and the leaks from the boilers, damage most of the containers in transit.
