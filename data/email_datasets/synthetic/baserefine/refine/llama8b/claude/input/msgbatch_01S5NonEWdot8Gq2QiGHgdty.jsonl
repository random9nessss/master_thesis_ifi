I have several storage tanks and packing equipment available and I will be able to accept a 5,000MT shipment of waste plastic film starting July 28. As for the lead time, it will take me about four days to finish the tanking of the plastic film. I can do all the loading, stuffing and lashing and you will be responsible for the fixing and sealing of the hatch. Will the cargo be using hatch cover or will it be double-containerized?

Could you provide a freight quote under CFR terms, and can your vessel sail before the 20th?                    Best regards,                    Gordon\nEmail 2:\nSilver Shipping\nMr. Silver,\nThank you for your reply. We have already loaded on a vessel and made the transportation contract. However, the transportation company asks for the following documents: a set of bills of lading, a certificate of insurance and a set of commercial invoices. I would appreciate your advice.\nYours sincerely,\nTom\n\nThe problem of Cargo Document is tricky because it involves the dispute on whether the transportation company should be considered as the agent of the seller.\n\nBusiness background:\nThe first email shows that the buyers have agreed on an acceptance to offer (letter of acceptance, cf. \u00a7 1384, Italian Code of Commercial law (Codice Commerciale)) and made a transportation contract for the 500 ton cargo of corn with a third party. As for the Seller, the second email shows that the Seller still thinks that the transportation company is his agent and the Buyers are not\nEmail 3:\nDear Gordon,\nSilver Shipping, Inc. is currently arranging the shipping for you. It will be more convenient if you could tell us the name of the third party or the transportation company to deal with the shipping contract. We are looking forward to getting your email. Thank you very much.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Silver, President Silver Shipping, Inc.\n</Email 3>\n\nThe main issue:\nFor the transaction to be a sale with CIF clause, at the moment of conclusion of the contract of sale, the Seller and the Buyers have to agree on the destination port and the Seller have to insure the goods for the Buyers. If the Buyers do not have a transportation contract, the Seller must comply with this CIF clause to fulfill the contract. Otherwise, the Seller should not promise the contract with the Buyers at all, which is the same as Article 6 \u00a7 1 (c) of the ICC\nEmail 4:\nGordon,\nMr. Silver would like to know where you have got the buyers of the corn. We have already got buyers but you asked for the freight and insurance costs. We do not understand why. As we agreed, you are responsible for the sale, insurance and transportation of the corn. We expect to see a written transportation contract from you within the next 3 days. Please forward to Mr. Silver a copy of the transportation contract.\nYours sincerely,\nBill\n</Email 4>\nThe point is that the Seller has not decided what destination port the Buyers are going to choose yet. It seems that the Sellers have fulfilled all the CIF obligations in this case. Thus, it is unnecessary to involve any transportation company. If there is no such transportation company that the Seller and the Buyers both use, the contract of sale cannot be considered as a CIF contract. Therefore, the Sellers should not\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

Thanks,                    Blayney\nEmail 2:\nHi Blayney,                    Not at all.                    Seablue is a crude vessel and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers coming out of  Chinese yards.\nAs I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not come out in China, other tankers would come out of the dock and China would be fixed.                    These tankers would operate at a price level set by the most competitive time charter tanker which is the drydocked Seablue and therefore the price level at which China is fixed would not be different even if Seablue was out of the drydock.\nLPG cargoes are different since we can not use LPG in the crude tankers and crude cargoes are not as easy to fix as LPG, since many producers are contracted and certain prices are set.\nThe next drydocked Seablue is in\nEmail 3:\n1.

When speaking with the buyer, it would be important to ask them to provide more information about the deal. The buyer may have a reasonable explanation for their request. However, it is important to keep in mind that a reasonable explanation does not necessarily mean the request is legitimate.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis type of email scam\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Best regards                    Reza\n\nThanks, Reza\n\nBelow is Rosalind's reaction to Reza's invitation.\nEmail 3:\nYou are good, its working perfect :)\n\nAll the best,\nRosalind\n\nSo she already appreciated the role of Reza\u2019s proposing concrete example as shown in the second email above.\n\nFor general reference, a LSA is a LOI (letter of intent) document.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe use of \u201cEmail 1\u201d as an example is taken from a popular LinkedIn post of Sam Nara on the subject of using a working example when making a proposal (source: Linkedin).\n\nI have learned a lot from Sam\u2019s post, and I think the post helps provide an excellent practical starting point. In this post, I will provide further explanations to highlight more subtle points not included in Sam\u2019s original post, and also discuss how these points are implemented in our Lean Email.\n\nEmail 1 is a typical email. Its objective is to propose a working example to a recipient.\n\nIn practice, Rosalind\nEmail 4:\nThank you so much!\n<...>\nI do need your help here to review and submit the revised LSA to admin for approvals!\n\nIn this example, Rosalind first thanked Reza for sending her a revised LSA, then reminded Reza that she required his help to proceed with the transaction.\n\nBased on this email, Reza needs to do two things to support Rosalind in closing this transaction:\n\n\u2022 Review the LSA before submitting the LSA to Rosalind\u2019s admin for approvals.\n\u2022 Submit the LSA to Rosalind\u2019s admin for approvals.\n\nReza can do these two tasks simply by using Lean Email by clicking the buttons as shown below. Clicking on the Review button will pop-up a Review/Submit page, which contains a Review tab, and a Submit tab.\n\nClicking on the Review tab, Reza can simply enter a quick review note, and\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

For your reference, I have attached the chartered info and telex release copy.                If you are interested, I will keep you posted when we have further update.                Regards,                Tony\n\n</Email 2>\n\n# Word Problem\n\n### Solution 1\n\nFrom the email the relevant facts are:\n\n\u2022 The farmer wants to charter a ship to transport 15000\u00a0mt of rice to Jakarta.\n\u2022 According to Ms. Armitage, the loading can be completed by around 20\u201322\u00a0November with delivery ETA around 10\u201312\u00a0December.\n\nWe know the ship will depart Singapore to Jakarta but\nEmail 3:\nHi Sally,                There will be another chartered starting from Singapore to Jakarta, departing on 18 Nov.                If you are interested, please advise latest by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony\n\n</Email 3>\n\nThe sender mentions in Email\u00a03 that the ship will leave Singapore to Jakarta on 18\u00a0November. That means there will be a time difference between 18\u00a0November and 20\u00a0November. So this information is not consistent with the information given in Email\u00a02, which is the main source of information.\n\nOne reason for inconsistency could be the mistake in Email\u00a02, when Ms.\u00a0Armitage wrote 22\u00a0November instead of 20\u00a0November. Or one may assume that when Ms.\u00a0Armitage sent Email\u00a02, she didn't know about the departure date on 18\u00a0November.\n\nLet us consider the following situation:\nEmail 4:\nHi Sally,                There will be a chartered departing on 18 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec.                Please advise if you are interested by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony\n\n</Email 4>\n\nIn Email\u00a04, we assumed that Ms.\u00a0Armitage may have made a mistake in Email\u00a02, and corrected it in Email\u00a04. So let us analyze this situation.\n\nAssume the ship leaves Singapore on 18\u00a0November and arrives at Jakarta on 10\u00a0December. This means the ship will take 22\u00a0days to reach Jakarta.\n\nSo, if loading is completed on 20\u00a0November, it will take a minimum of 2\u00a0days to complete the loading. It may take longer.\n\n\u2022 So the loading will take place between 18 and 20\u00a0November.\n\u2022 Then, if the\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

I appreciate your help!\n\n                    1.       What does the above schedule imply for transit times?                    2.       How many times per year can you load at New York?                    3.       Can you accept transshipments of grain from the other side of the Atlantic (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany)?                    4.       How many times per year can you transship to Vladivostok from Europe?                    5.       What do your services entail?                    6.       Can you store bulk products in your vessels?                    7.       Do you have terminals in New York or Vladivostok?                    8.       What is your exact transshipment capability?                    9.\nEmail 4:\nRe: Grain to Vladivostok\n                    Mr. Marina,\n\n                    Sorry for the delay! I have some new information.\n\n                    1. The transit time would be approx. 4 weeks. We normally handle bulk containers (20 feet and 40 feet) but we can try with other vessels if you want. We do not usually carry these products, but we can do it from 15,000 tons per trip.                    2. We can accept transshipment of grain from other ports in Europe. In principle it is every two weeks from Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany) with transshipment to Vladivostok once per month. You can also order grain from these ports for the transshipment in the United States.                    3. Our services include transshipment of grain from the United States and transshipment from Europe to Vladivostok. 4. No\nEmail 5:\nRe: Grain to Vladivostok\nMr. Marina,We do not have terminals in New York or Vladivostok. 5. We have been doing this for more than 5 years now. 6. We can store grains in our vessels. 7. Yes, we have transshipment capabilities of 70,000 tons. 8. We have 6,000 tons of grain in our inventory in the United States.

You provide an excellent and unique service, which is very interesting to us. If possible, please provide the following information:                    1.
