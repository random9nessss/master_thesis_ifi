Thanks,

I still want you to do the deal, but if you want, I can be a silent partner until things get going, and I can purchase you out later.                   I want to see a mutual benefit, not just an increase in the sales. Can you give me some more numbers, so we can do our first evaluation?                   Thanks again                   George

I've heard rumors that you are in talks to merge with Brooker Inc. We at our company have been following your success for a while now, and we're very interested in potentially acquiring your brokerage. I believe you could be an excellent addition to our organization.

Would you be open to discussing this opportunity?

Best regards,

Regarding compensation, could you give me an idea of what kind of fee structure you're considering? I'd like to ensure we're working toward a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Also, I'm curious about your assessment of the local market conditions. We've been hearing concerns about a potential market correction in the near future.

Best regards,
Rob

Body: Rob,

I've reviewed the numbers again, and while they're not quite where we'd like them to be, I still see great potential in this deal. As an alternative approach, I could come in as a silent partner initially, with the option to complete a full buyout later.

Could you share more detailed financial data for our first proper evaluation? I'm looking for a structure that ensures mutual benefit, not just increased sales figures.

Thanks again,
Jorge"

Barter or similar type of shipping would be another way to get product, basically you are trading something for the shipping, typically a product that the shipper wants. 
I have not used this type of transaction so I don't know about the legalities or security in terms of the recipient. 
There are companies that specialize in these types of transactions so I would not recommend going it alone.

Hi Michael,                  Hope you are well.                      As far as Mundra is concerned, there will be no berth congestion (whether it be monthly or weekly) in any month of this year.                 Regarding the port of Long Beach, the container volume is consistently increasing month on month. It will also increase in the coming month. However, we can see that in February 2019, there were 8 ETDs, whereas in January 2019 there were 7 ETDs. The transhipment movement from West Africa & other major US destinations to Long Beach will increase by more than 10% this year. Hence we may see less berth congestion in the months of January, February & March 2019. However, the probability of berth congestion in April and onward months is very high as long as the CBP do not relax any of their existing regulations to reduce the dwell

Hope you are well.

As far as Mundra is concerned, there will be no berth congestion throughout this year.

Regarding Long Beach, container volume is increasing month on month. We've seen improvement in vessel turnaround with 8 ETDs in February compared to 7 in January 2019. While transhipment movement from West Africa & other major US destinations to Long Beach will increase by >10% this year, we expect minimal congestion in Q1 2019. However, starting April, congestion probability is high unless CBP relaxes current regulations affecting dwell times.

All of these routes can be served from one of our 3 weekly services. For a monthly schedule, please visit our website.

This order will leave in the first week of July. We need your help.                    How much would shipping 4,000MT of both goods together cost, and do you see any risk of port congestion?                    Many thanks,                    Ivy

Hi Ivy,
Good morning.

The order for 2,500MT should be easy to manage.
Regarding the order for 1,500MT of grain, unfortunately, we do not see any vessel available to fit both cargoes in the same vessel. As we are still in June, there are still some free slots available on July, but as the order size is so big, we have limited choices.
That being said, we can manage to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain in the same vessel with the owner of a 10,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge the previous cargo in July. All details about the vessel are as follows:

M/V T1
Type    General Cargo
Flag    Liberia
Call    MOYO
Deadweight    8,600MT
Built    1996
Hold No
Email 3:
Regarding the risk of port congestion in Australia, I'm afraid the situation is getting worse and that it may be difficult to find a slot for such a big order. Also, the railway terminals are overloaded as well.
I know the situation seems very bad. I can only offer you the best available. If you are willing to wait till October, I can offer you a better slot with more space. This way, you will be able to fit more products, or reduce the price.
What do you think?
Email 4:
Thank you for your help. The information you provided is very useful to us. 
We want to ship the 4,000MT cargo in early July. We do not have enough storage capacity, so if we delay the delivery, it may lead to the depreciation of our goods, so I'm afraid we can only choose the original plan.
Also, we will have more orders to deliver in July. Can you please help us?
Waiting for your reply!

Ivy

Hi Ivy,

I understand that you have to deliver the order at the earliest opportunity, and that you can't wait till October. I'll look for a slot in September for you.

Do you have a choice of milk powder or grain as the cargo to be shipped in August?

The order for 2,500MT should be manageable. However, regarding the combined shipment with 1,500MT of grain, we cannot find a vessel available to accommodate both cargoes together. While there are still some free slots in July, the total order size limits our options.

We can offer to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain on a 10,000dwt vessel that will complete its previous cargo discharge in July. The vessel details are:

I should add that port congestion in Australia is worsening, and securing a slot for such a large order may be challenging. The railway terminals are also experiencing overload.

If you can wait until October, I can offer a better slot with more space, which would allow for more cargo capacity or a reduced price.

Hi Bhanu,                        Please find my freight estimate attached.                    All the best.                        Bob.


Did it involve any ethical issues?

Yes

Why?

Yes

Why?

If Mr Smith was aware that the number of bags ordered was too many for the vessel to carry then he would have mentioned it

Therefore you may want to include something in your email about the number of bags of cement and how this will impact on your freight estimate

Dear Bhanu,                        Regarding the quantity of bags of cement I will need to charge more for delivery to Petromax.                    Please confirm you are happy with the 1,000 bags.                    Kind regards,                    Bob.

Did it involve any ethical issues?

Yes

Why?

The goods could be delivered via a ship that was carrying more bags, therefore you may want to suggest in your email that you will charge

Regarding the quantity of bags of cement, I will need to revise the freight charges for delivery to Petromax. There seems to be a discrepancy in my earlier estimate - I had calculated for 1,000 bags instead of 1,500.

Please confirm if you'd like me to provide an updated quote for the full 1,500 bags.

One of my workmates asked me how to answer this email. I am not sure myself. I've answered questions like these one here, but they were much more easy:

1)  Say good night to Mommy!
2)  Well, take your time!
3)  Of course I'll help you. When and where?
4)  That sounds great! I'll bring the umbrella.
5)  I know. It is not important.

What is the correct way to answer to Nastya in this email?

There is a pattern for this type of 2-part email that I've observed in some specific contexts:

1. The first part is like a sign-off: ""Sincerely, Nastya"". 2. The second part is the

Hello, George
I have received your e-mail. Thanks for asking us for this enquiry.
This is my first reply to you.

First of all, can you give me the type of coal you plan to ship (NSC, ARA, etc.) and also the port of loading at Barry (BPT, UKCOAL, etc.)

The best way is to proceed with time charter.
Most of shipping companies are hard to find the right vessel because of a lack of high specification open cargo handlings. However, I can check and suggest you to you.
I will try to provide you the following details:
1. The vessel that is available in market
2. The cost estimate

Please feel free to contact me anytime and I will be delighted to be of assistance.
Thank you very much.

Hello George,
Thank you for your reply.

Currently, there is a lot of vessels available in the market. But most of them are low specification and the area of coverage can't fit with your requirement.
However, we may be able to find a vessel that suits your requirement.

If it is no problem, can you give me the delivery port of discharge (namely, the name of the country of discharge).

And also, can you specify the size of the vessel you are looking for?

Waiting for your reply.                            Noah

For freight rate we have three rate contracts, these are for 6 months and 3 months and 1 month. So no fixed rate and no bunker escalation clause.

Dear Ms. Ghosh,                    My group is sourcing 25,000MT of rubber from Shanghai to Salem. We can be very flexible on loading, but need to know your thoughts on two possible shipping methods:                    1. 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. How much extra would be this compared to a typical voyage at your current market price?                    2. 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev. Is there any discount available if we book these voyages for 2016 as well?                    Sincerely,                    Sarah

Dear Sarah,                        Glad to get your inquiry. Actually, I have just sent an email regarding the new liner service through Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode to VRS China. Let me know if you get that. I am not sure about the sea transport to India since I am not from that dept. But I would like to go for the FCL rate of Hoegh Autoliner as there is an attractive rate by these carriers.                    One of my friends of Taiwan is also very interested in this carrier. She will go for 10/20 cbm containers. But they were waiting for the government’s final approval. Anyway, please wait for our China dept’s advice.                    Any other queries please contact me at any time.                    Have a nice day!                    Yours faithfully,                    Rita Lee

Rita,   I got your message about Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. Thank you for the offer! Do you have any indication on the timing of the service? In addition, do you think I should consider 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev as well? I did not include those carriers in the original email because my thinking was that they are more suitable for 2016. Still, the volumes will be the same for both years. Sarah


In this email exchange, Sarah was mainly interested in the future developments of Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. She also mentioned that she wanted to discuss an alternative carrier, Golden Highway and Damleev.

Glad to get your inquiry. I have just sent an email regarding the new liner service through Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode to our VRS China office. I should note that I'm not directly handling sea transport to India, as that's managed by a different department. However, I can say that Hoegh Autoliner is currently offering attractive FCL rates.

One of our contacts in Taiwan is also interested in this carrier, looking at 10/20 CBM containers, pending government approval. Please wait for our China department's feedback regarding your specific requirements.

Don't hesitate to contact me with any other queries.

Have a nice day!

Regarding the Golden Highway and Damleev option (33/67 split), I initially considered this more suitable for 2016. However, since our volumes will be consistent across both years, should I consider this option for the current shipment as well?

Hi Ms. Morris,                    We have an enquiry for 13,000MT of rice from Colombo to Matadi. Can you give us a berth congestion forecast and how does your laytime allowance work in case of port delays?                    Many thanks,                    Robert
Email 2:
Matadi is a very busy port with cargoes often backed up at berth. There is no guaranteed transit time to discharge ships. It is typical for ships to be waiting in line from 2-4 days to get to berth and there is not a predictable number of ships in line to discharge as ships can come at any time without warning.
                
                It is typical to run back up and sometimes 2 berths simultaneously. When two berths are available, the berthing order is typically handled by the Terminal based on when the ship can reach the berth. In the event that your vessel can reach the berth on the day that is scheduled for your vessel, your berth time will likely be honored. If you are late due to port congestion and cannot reach the berth that is reserved for you, your berth may be given to another ship and you will have to wait in line for the next","From: robert.smith@tradingco.com

Subject: Re: Rice Shipment to Matadi - Berth Congestion Query
Timestamp: 2024-02-15 11:45
Body: Dear Robert,

Matadi is currently experiencing high congestion levels. Please note the following:

- Typical waiting time for berth is 2-4 days
- No guaranteed transit time to discharge
- Berth queue is unpredictable as vessels can arrive without prior notice
- Terminal operates up to 2 berths simultaneously
- Berthing priority is assigned by the Terminal based on vessel readiness
- Reserved berth slots may be reassigned if vessel arrival is delayed due to congestion

I recommend factoring these conditions into your laytime calculations.

Hi Jeremy,                   Thank you for the detailed information. The Port of Elizabeth is basically a bit “rustic”. Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h. We can also do up to 2,000 mt/h if the coal can be delivered to the berth quickly and easily.

Be advised that in March, the water in the port will be very low. Because of","From: brian.smith@trader.com

Body: Hi Jeremy,

Thank you for the details. Regarding Port Elizabeth terminal requirements: The port is quite basic, with coal stored at berths up the hill or in side-loading facilities. Loading is done via ash ponds filled from barges, stockpiles, or rail. Average loading rate is 600-800 mt/h, but we can achieve up to 1,500 mt/h under optimal conditions, potentially reaching 2,000 mt/h if coal delivery to berth is efficient.

Please note that March will have low water levels in the port.

In response to your earlier query, the freight is in the range of USD 3.50 - USD 3.75 per metric ton. It depends on the equipment chosen. We will need to know your ship and its specifications to provide a confirmed rate. Also, would you be able to charter the ship for a period of two weeks, perhaps to Rijeka (Croatia) for loading or discharge?

Let us know and we will follow up on this further.

Best regards,
Trading Team

They are also one of the fastest ports in the world and have an average unloading time of 15 minutes per ship.

The answer from someone on the ship side will be most welcomed (current laycan for oil 40k Haldia-Sing). In the meantime, and not to put any undue pressure on the person, but I need an answer by 20:00 Hong Kong time on the 12th. No pressure I just need an answer by then.
This is especially important because the vessel concerned has to clear their port of 90,000 tonnes of cargo at the same time as loading the product in question.
As such, it is best to keep the loading plan as close to the current laycan as possible for reasons of space and availability.
That's why I would be keen to get your laycan in a day or so.
Thank you again for your assistance.

Hi Don,                 The laycan for the oil was to be between 12-16 Aug. The opening/closing date of the laycan as well as the ETA for Singapore are critical, therefore it's best that you let me know the exact ETA for Singapore.

Yesterday you were looking for suitable vessels for 36,000 metric tonnes of glycol from Mexico to Luanda in Angola.                    I have a ship available.           36,000 MT = 36,000 ton x 1,000 kg/ton = 36,000,000 kg = 3,600 m3 at a density of 1 ton/m3                    The ship can carry 5,500,000 litres.                    5,500,000 litres x 1 m3/1,000 litres = 5,500 m3                    Let me know if this is suitable.                    The shipment costs US$100,000 (can be deducted from the commission that you pay to me)                   36,000 MT = 36,000 ton x 1,000 kg/ton = 36,000,000 kg = 3,600 m3
Email 3:
The price per litre is $10, so 5,500 m3 of ethanol is worth US$55,000.
The net profit for the shippers is US$55,000 - US$100,000 = US$55,000.
Let me know how you feel about this arrangement.

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. We’ve been dealing with an issue concerning the vessels’ bills of lading. 
I understand your cargo will be subject to an inspection at the port of discharge.  Since this is out of our control, you should contact your 
broker or agent to determine the inspection’s requirements, including duration and time of day for the inspection.  The bill of lading, while you 
were out, contained a statement stating we were responsible for the inspection's duration.  We subsequently deleted that paragraph.
We understand your client will be taking full responsibility for their merchandise at the port of discharge. Therefore, they should assume responsibility 
for ensuring that their merchandise clears customs.  We understand that you are working with our agent at the port of discharge to file the necessary documents 
to clear the cargo.  However, if you encounter any problems, please feel

discharge to make sure all of the necessary documents are filed in order to clear the cargo.
                 As requested, I will also forward a copy of the bill of lading to you and hope to have a firm confirmation of the inspection schedule 
for the cargo.

Apologies for the delay. We've been addressing issues with bills of lading.

Regarding the cargo inspection at discharge port, this will need to be arranged through your broker or agent. We've removed the clause making us responsible for inspection duration from the bill of lading.

Dear Sir,
Since my last letter, I have been reading a
book on Containership Business and i have a
lot of ideas.
Here is one of them. Will a large container
ship be built in China? Is it a good
investment to own a small container ship or
to own an interest in a large ship? I
believe that the container shipping industry
will get better and better. At this time, the
shipping market is very strong.
Here is the conclusion:
It is better to own a small container ship
than to own an interest in a large container
ship. We should stick to our belief.

Since my last email, I've been studying a comprehensive book on the container shipping business and have developed some additional insights.

The shipping market is currently very strong, and I believe the container shipping industry will continue to grow. After analyzing the options, I'm leaning towards a specific conclusion: it appears more advantageous to own a small container ship outright rather than holding a partial interest in a large vessel.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this assessment.

This approach offers more stability and control in the long term.

I look forward to your response regarding this decision.

Body: Dear John,

As you are aware, we regularly ship fresh produce from South Africa to Antwerp. We currently have two vessels loading with scheduled departures next week. Should your preferred vessel not be available, we can offer alternatives.

I have attached a charter summary for your reference, including our standard rates as requested.

Additionally, we understand the time-sensitive nature of your cargo. Our office maintains a well-equipped laboratory for testing, and we can arrange for one of our freight inspectors to verify cargo condition in cooperation with our certified biological agency.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Juan Du Preez

We confirm receipt of your inquiry regarding vessel availability for December 1st loading. While we are currently at full capacity, the voyage duration is only 21 days, and we expect our southbound vessel to return promptly for potential charter.

Please contact either Mr. Du Preez or myself to discuss this further.

Body: Dear John,

We regret to inform you that the vessel 'Daanen de Jong' has been detained by USCG in New York. Given the current congestion in Antwerp, we recommend considering an earlier departure.

Unfortunately, our southbound vessel 'Baedeker' has been chartered by our German branch for a US-bound voyage.

The vessel 'Winkelhuis' is loaded and scheduled to depart on December 5th. Our dispatch department is actively seeking temporary alternatives given the urgency. I have attached a chart for your reference.

Please advise on your intentions at your earliest convenience.

When you give an estimate, it will give the exact rate. It is correct if the pickup and delivery dates are the same and the amount of goods shipped is 50 CBM. If your pickup date is July 10, 2017, the delivery date is July 20, 2017, and the amount of goods shipped is 25 CBM, you can click the blue icon in the lower right corner. Change your preferred dates and change the amount of goods shipped.
   Our company charges $0.05 per CBM per day, so the extra cost is $25 ($25 CBM*0.05$ per CBM per day*20 days

I assume this is for shipping to Montevideo, Uruguay?
[Short answer] Considering the cost of Ethanol at USD 700.00/t, loading at Moin and routing via Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, then the FOB Hamburg is USD 420.00/t with a port rotation in Moin, Santos, and Constanza.

[Long answer] We have to send a complete quotation to understand the entire situation and its respective commercial requirements in order to provide a complete and accurate quotation to our client.
Our company can offer competitive shipping costs and services for transporting Ethanol to Montevideo, Uruguay. We are happy to provide more information and a detailed quote upon request.

Based on your information, I can provide you with an estimate for the shipping cost of 250 MT of Ethanol from Moin, Honduras to Montevideo, Uruguay.

Yes, this is for Montevideo, Uruguay. For the Ethanol shipment, considering the cost of USD 700.00/t, loading at Moin and routing via Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, the FOB Hamburg would be USD 420.00/t with port rotation in Moin, Santos, and Constanza.

The timer I chose was 5 minutes. And the prompt was:

You can use PNP to shorten the time for expression. For example, to say

""we are thinking of shipping X amount of crude oil from A to B"", ""We'd like to buy X amount of crude oil from A to B"", etc.

 Sorry, I misunderstood. When you say 26 meters, you have a vans in total of 26 meters of which 2 x 8 meters are used to transport the cars and 2 x 3 meters is the cab that you can't load with anything. The empty weight of the vannies is 2800 kg and your centrifuge system has a total weight of 35000 kg. We have 3 axles vans that are up to 28 tons, but you have a weight of 36 tons that you would need a 4 axles vannie, you would need a 40 ton vannie that we don't have. I'm sorry but it is not possible. Please let me know if you need anything else.

 The RORO trucks are different trucks, not vannies. Vannies and RORO trucks are two different transport methods. The RORO trucks are like open trucks that have a crane to pick up the cars and to put them in the trucks. The weight of the trucks is around 28 tons, which is not enough for the load. So I'm sorry but it is not possible.

Let me make sure I'm understanding you correctly. Are you requesting that we **decompose** two decades of the same dataset into a much more manageable number of, say, three to four *decades*, so that I can apply this new algorithm to the entire dataset with more manageable storage?

I'm not quite sure what you mean by **""decompose** the first 10 years,"" but I'll guess that you are asking me to compress the first 10 years of data down to a smaller amount. If that is your request, I'll note that the changes in the dataset have slowed considerably, so I would expect that the 11th decade would have a smaller compression than the 10th decade. Is that your intent?

Dear Chuck,                    Do you mind if I ask you a question?                    I wonder why there are $1,000 costs for insurance but only $4,000 costs for airfreight.                    Could you tell me the reason?                    Best regards,                    Chris

Dear Chuck,

Please consider this. What is the answer you expect to get if you ask a question like this in a job interview? Just think about it.

Best regards,
Chris

The two parties are negotiating the details of the trade transaction. Chuck has asked about the airfreight and insurance costs, and Chris has said he'll get back to Chuck about the cost details. Chuck, however, is impatient, and he asks again for the details. Chuck's questions assume that Chris can find the details easily. Chuck also does not show much flexibility in accepting a later answer.

I understand the rates should be approximately $4,000 per ton for airfreight and $1,000 per ton for insurance. Can you confirm if these rates are correct and if you have capacity for 50 tons on December 11th?

Please provide the total price including both airfreight and insurance costs.

Let me know if there is any possibility of consolidation.                    Cheers,                    Ariel

Hi Lacey!
I attach the quotation for your review.
Best regards.
You will remember that I sent you a quotation some days ago for
the shipment from Montevideo to the Vargas Free Zone (Isla Margarita,
Venezuela). I attach it for your review.
As I explained to you, your freight forwarder is using the
transportation of a passenger vessel for which they charge you a huge
amount of money (of course with a very high margin of profit for them).
However, we could suggest an alternative which could be very convenient
for you. The following is the technical background:
As you probably know, a number of passenger ships go from South America
to the Caribbean; among them is the MS Francy, which normally operates
between Brazil and Venezuela. This ship was specially chartered by a
tour operator from Dubai who asked us for help

Hi Lacey,
As a follow up of the quotation sent to you yesterday, I attach
here the quotation we did for the voyage from Montevideo to Isla Margarita
for your consideration. This voyage is scheduled to leave on 22 July with
estimated time of arrival 25 July in Isla Margarita, and there is a high
probability that it will be chartered. This vessel was used by a tour
operator from Dubai, who asked us to help them with the organisation of the
operation. I will ask them to contact you to give you all the details. This
operator was looking for containers, but we have done the calculation and
we see that there is no need to use containers, because the cost would be
too high in relation to the volume. So the only way would be by 20' pallets,

Hi Lacey,
the voyage scheduled from Montevideo to Isla Margarita (arrival 27 June) is
sold out and another vessel will be used for this operation. We have arranged
with a very good cargo vessel which will be leaving from the port of Valparaiso
on 24 July and arriving in Isla Margarita on 27 July. This cargo vessel will be
chartered by the tour operator for this voyage. We suggest the option by 20' flat
racks (pallets) to be loaded on the decks of the vessel and also by trucks to
be driven aboard and carried in the hold of the vessel. This will be the cheapest
way to move your cargo. Please let me know if you would like us to quote on this
proposal. The itinerary of the ship is as follows:

I'm following up regarding the shipment from Montevideo to the Vargas Free Zone (Isla Margarita, Venezuela). We've identified that your current freight forwarder is utilizing passenger vessels at premium rates.

We can offer an alternative solution using the MS Francy, which typically operates between Brazil and Venezuela. The vessel was recently chartered by a Dubai-based tour operator who has partnered with us for logistics support.

I've attached the detailed quotation for your review.

I need to inform you that the previously mentioned voyage is now fully booked. However, we've arranged an alternative cargo vessel departing from Valparaiso on July 24th, arriving in Isla Margarita on July 27th. 

We recommend using either 20' flat racks (pallets) for deck loading or truck transport in the vessel's hold, which would be the most cost-effective solution for your cargo.

Please let me know if you'd like a quote for this new arrangement.

Hello Ryan,                    Our current volume to Haldia port is 2000MT.

Hi Markus, I would like to have your assistance on this matter.
I have been in communication with an agent in Cartagena and he had informed me that isopropanol is extremely dangerous to transport and he is trying to deter us. He had offered an alternative product for the price you had provided.
The supplier is directly from the US and I think there is no reason for any third party to be involved in the transaction.
To be honest with you, the suppliers are not even prepared to sell the product at the prices you had quoted. For this reason, I don’t think we will be able to do business with you and appreciate if you will be kind enough to refund the advance payment of 1,200USD.
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Mr. Bluth,
Thank you for your reply. Can you please send an estimated FOB price and any additional information you might have about laycan, ETA, and IFO price? We would like to discuss this shipment, although we might not need it as soon as you mentioned. But we could also be interested in the earlier date, so please send more details. Thank you,                     Sophie

If you are in direct contact with the buyer, please try to get the material specification. In this case, you need to be direct and say that you cannot send a freight quotation without that document. If they ask about the freight quotation first, share a rough estimate with a mention that it will be updated when you have the material specification. The buyer should realize that this is the only way for you to take an offer. It is your first line of defense against waste of time. Other brokers might not understand that they need to ask for the material specification because they do not have a ""ship"" yet, so they can only discuss price and laycan. This is very wrong, but I am sure it happens.  If you are an agent, you should receive the material specification from the buyer. If you don't have it, call your counterpart to discuss this.

Thanks Pauline,

I checked the schedules and I think you mean the Commodore. This is our weekly spot cargo service, loading containers for France.

The Commodore berths at the South Container Terminal but we can't berth there this week. There are no slots available and the berths have to be occupied in a particular order.

South Container Terminal berths are occupied in this order:
5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 6

This week we have the Commodore coming in from Kingston on Wednesday. This is the first available berth for that vessel so we are expecting her to be berthed at 6 South. The ship is due to sail to Cherbourg on Friday night.

I hope this helps.

They would then be able to add this into the system for us, so that we both have fixed dates in place. Let me know if that’s ok?                    Cheers,                    Mark

                    Dear Mr. Bush,
                    Thank you for your inquiry.

                    In order to make an offer we would need to know the date of shipment, vessel, and cargo type. If the vessel is not chartered we can suggest the estimated rates.

                    If the vessel is already on charter and the vessel type is known then we can suggest the freight rate.

                    In the above two cases, an offer is being provided but it is not a fixed rate.

                    If the vessel has already been loaded, then a time charter rate must be negotiated.

                    In the case of a time charter, the vessel owner may expect at least 2 voyages to break even.

Respected all,
Some time we are not getting good sailings of our vessels due to tonnage/delivery date
issues. What should we do in such circumstances, it is important to send our vessels on voyages
or in case of problems related to cargo, it is better to keep vessels waiting for best tonnages/ best

Dear Mr. Cullen,                    I am sorry that we didn’t find a solution for the cargoes on the DFRA vessels.

Good day! Thank you for your inquiry. I must inform you that we currently don't have local agents at Westport. We only operate shipments from LA, Long Beach, or Hueneme ports.

This means we cannot arrange local delivery pickups or handle port activities at Westport. These would need to be arranged by the shipment owner or a third-party company.

For reference, our current rates for similar shipments from our operating ports to Long Beach are:

We're currently offering a 6% discount on our services, which would result in savings of approximately USD 362.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss alternative arrangements through our operating ports.

We had a leak a few years ago when it rained really hard, and our home insurance paid for a new roof. However, the leaky roof was not included in our insurance policy. I am wondering if I should hire someone to fix the roof or if there is some other way that I could fix it myself. I am not a professional, but I am fairly handy and I am not afraid of doing a bit of hard work.

Mr. Silver,
Thank you for your reply. We have already loaded on a vessel and made the transportation contract. However, the transportation company asks for the following documents: a set of bills of lading, a certificate of insurance and a set of commercial invoices. I would appreciate your advice.
Yours sincerely,

The problem of Cargo Document is tricky because it involves the dispute on whether the transportation company should be considered as the agent of the seller.

Business background:
The first email shows that the buyers have agreed on an acceptance to offer (letter of acceptance, cf. § 1384, Italian Code of Commercial law (Codice Commerciale)) and made a transportation contract for the 500 ton cargo of corn with a third party. As for the Seller, the second email shows that the Seller still thinks that the transportation company is his agent and the Buyers are not

</Email 3>

The main issue:
For the transaction to be a sale with CIF clause, at the moment of conclusion of the contract of sale, the Seller and the Buyers have to agree on the destination port and the Seller have to insure the goods for the Buyers. If the Buyers do not have a transportation contract, the Seller must comply with this CIF clause to fulfill the contract. Otherwise, the Seller should not promise the contract with the Buyers at all, which is the same as Article 6 § 1 (c) of the ICC

Gordon,
Mr. Silver would like to know where you have got the buyers of the corn. We have already got buyers but you asked for the freight and insurance costs. We do not understand why.

Please forward to Mr. Silver a copy of the transportation contract.
Yours sincerely,

</Email 4>
The point is that the Seller has not decided what destination port the Buyers are going to choose yet. It seems that the Sellers have fulfilled all the CIF obligations in this case. Thus, it is unnecessary to involve any transportation company. If there is no such transportation company that the Seller and the Buyers both use, the contract of sale cannot be considered as a CIF contract. Therefore, the Sellers should not","From: gordon.smith@tradeco.com

A problem arises in distinguishing between logs and lumber, and lumber that has been cut and sawn and lumber that is not sawn.

So, when the importing country wishes to assure itself that U.S. law is being complied with, the issuing country may provide an assurance in the form of an import certificate, an export certificate,","From: logan.matthews@timberco.com

Dear Lawrence,                  I can suggest you the best, the way to charter is to rely on a good credit insurance to cover all risks.

I am prepared to wire you $100,000 towards the transaction on condition that you forward the other$300,000 (and the ship documents) within 10 days of receiving this deposit. I understand that this is a small amount relative to the transaction, but I am sending you this deposit on the condition that it will be returned within 14 days if you are not able to complete the transaction.

We are extremely interested in moving forward with our transaction. We can finance 50% of the $800,000, and we need to know how you will finance the other $400,000. I am prepared to wire you $100,000 towards the transaction on condition that you forward the other $300,000 (and the shipping documents) within 10 days of receiving this deposit.

I understand that this is a small amount relative to the transaction, but I am sending you this deposit on the condition that it will be returned within 14 days if you are not able to complete the transaction.

Problem

A recent widespread email spam campaign targeted the energy and commodities trading industry with messages claiming that their customers wanted to use their services to buy crude oil and related products from reputable traders in the market. Some traders were approached in a very business-like manner, allegedly by major oil firms. The email subject line would indicate that the email was from a trusted business partner, such as a large energy firm or similar corporate client.

The email requests are easy to read but hard to understand. A foreign sounding person claiming to be an executive from a respectable company in a similar industry wants to “spot” some “margin fee” – what? An explanation for what these terms mean may have come attached

As the requests are unsolicited and we have not received any communication with our buyer in the past, it would be a good idea to contact them directly to confirm their intent. We could ask the buyer for more information and maybe arrange to speak with the buyer directly. When speaking with the buyer, it would be important to ask them to provide more information about the deal. The buyer may have a reasonable explanation for their request. However, it is important to keep in mind that a reasonable explanation does not necessarily mean the request is legitimate.

So she already appreciated the role of Reza’s proposing concrete example as shown in the second email above.

Introduction

The use of “Email 1” as an example is taken from a popular LinkedIn post of Sam Nara on the subject of using a working example when making a proposal (source: Linkedin).

I have learned a lot from Sam’s post, and I think the post helps provide an excellent practical starting point. In this post, I will provide further explanations to highlight more subtle points not included in Sam’s original post, and also discuss how these points are implemented in our Lean Email.

In this example, Rosalind first thanked Reza for sending her a revised LSA, then reminded Reza that she required his help to proceed with the transaction.

Based on this email, Reza needs to do two things to support Rosalind in closing this transaction:

• Review the LSA before submitting the LSA to Rosalind’s admin for approvals.
• Submit the LSA to Rosalind’s admin for approvals.

Reza can do these two tasks simply by using Lean Email by clicking the buttons as shown below. Clicking on the Review button will pop-up a Review/Submit page, which contains a Review tab, and a Submit tab.

Email 2:
Dear Ms. Manwell,                    Thank you for your enquiry. We have provided you with a proposal for the movement of 6,000MT of LNG from the US Gulf to Antwerp in July. The price for the cargo at the level mentioned in the proposal is on the basis of a fixed FOB rate.

```Dear Mr. Dalschaert,                    With reference to our recent e-mail communication, I am writing to inform you that our chartering division has raised an enquiry with London regarding our agreement with their provisions in terms of the GCM/Voyage charterparty (as drafted by BIMCO).                    This charterparty refers to a CBM charge of $1.20 per CBM as the basis of calculation for a FCN charter. This rate was introduced to reflect the charterer's ability to make a simple and accurate calculation based on the CBM's stated on their cargo. Our customer, Shell, has explained to us that they will not proceed with this arrangement for their LNG shipments unless the CBM charge is less than 90 cbm.

Can you please provide a freight estimate for 6,000MT of LNG from Mopan in the US Gulf to Antwerp in July. Is port rotation compulsory for this service?

Body: Dear Ms. Manwell,

Thank you for your enquiry. We have prepared a proposal for the movement of 6,000MT of LNG from the US Gulf to Antwerp in July. The price can be structured in two ways:

1. Fixed FOB rate as detailed in the proposal
2. FCN basis with a CBM charge of $1.20 per CBM based on the cargo declaration

In both scenarios, the CIF rate would be fixed, with cargo delivery to the discharge port on the same day. Regarding port rotation, this would be at the shipper's request and subject to prior agreement between all parties.

Please review the proposal and return a copy of the commercial terms (either C/P or C&F).

Best regards,

Subject: GCM/Voyage Charterparty - CBM Rate Discussion
Timestamp: 2023-07-02 14:20
Body: Dear Mr. Dalschaert,

Regarding our recent communications, our chartering division has consulted with London about the GCM/Voyage charterparty provisions (as drafted by BIMCO).

The current charterparty specifies a CBM charge of $1.20 per CBM for FCN charters. However, our client Shell has indicated they cannot proceed with this arrangement for LNG shipments unless the CBM charge is reduced to below 90 cents per CBM.

We therefore request BIMCO to consider revising the relevant provision in the GCM/Voyage Charterparty accordingly.

Best regards,
David Smith

Good afternoon Terry,                    Just wanted to touch base on the chlorosilane we last spoke about. It’s going to take a little longer to get the ship’s out, and I’m wondering if you might be able to send a few more details of your offer. Specifically, we’re looking at a freight rate between $150-170/MT, and what can you do about the B/L structure?                    Look forward to hearing from you,                    Alan

Hi Alan,             I think you are being too strong in some of your statements regarding the vessel. I saw the clinker/coal traffic, but that was a mix of loaded and empty coming from one shipper.  I’m just trying to help you work your freight rates.                    Below is my question in regard to pricing. When will we hear something back about the freight? We have the timing set for this item at the customer. The timeline could slip a little if we have to adjust.                    -Jonathan

I think we need to be more precise about the vessel requirements. I saw the clinker/coal traffic data, but that was a mix of loaded and empty vessels coming from one shipper. I'm trying to help optimize the freight rates.

When will we hear something back about the freight? We have timing commitments with the customer, though there might be some flexibility if needed.

We really need to get a firm price on the chlorosilane. The customer has indicated they can delay the shipment by a few days, which gives us some room to negotiate the price down. Could you please provide more detailed pricing information?

For your reference, I have attached the chartered info and telex release copy.                If you are interested, I will keep you posted when we have further update.

# Word Problem

### Solution 1

From the email the relevant facts are:

• The farmer wants to charter a ship to transport 15000 mt of rice to Jakarta.
• According to Ms. Armitage, the loading can be completed by around 20–22 November with delivery ETA around 10–12 December.

We know the ship will depart Singapore to Jakarta but
Email 3:
Hi Sally,                There will be another chartered starting from Singapore to Jakarta, departing on 18 Nov.                If you are interested, please advise latest by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony

</Email 3>

The sender mentions in Email 3 that the ship will leave Singapore to Jakarta on 18 November. That means there will be a time difference between 18 November and 20 November. So this information is not consistent with the information given in Email 2, which is the main source of information.

One reason for inconsistency could be the mistake in Email 2, when Ms. Armitage wrote 22 November instead of 20 November. Or one may assume that when Ms. Armitage sent Email 2, she didn't know about the departure date on 18 November.

Let us consider the following situation:
Email 4:
Hi Sally,                There will be a chartered departing on 18 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec.                Please advise if you are interested by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony

</Email 4>

In Email 4, we assumed that Ms. Armitage may have made a mistake in Email 2, and corrected it in Email 4. So let us analyze this situation.

Assume the ship leaves Singapore on 18 November and arrives at Jakarta on 10 December. This means the ship will take 22 days to reach Jakarta.

So, if loading is completed on 20 November, it will take a minimum of 2 days to complete the loading. It may take longer.

• So the loading will take place between 18 and 20 November.

I need to verify the situation urgently. If this is indeed about missing funds rather than just documents, immediate action is required to prevent contract breach. Please note I will be out of office next week.

In principle it is every two weeks from Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany) with transshipment to Vladivostok once per month. You can also order grain from these ports for the transshipment in the United States.                    3.

Hello Jorge,                    I hope you and your family are doing well.                    I've enjoyed working with you over the last couple of years. I am sure that I am not the only one.

Dear Mr. Munoz,                     I hope you are doing well.                     I think we met at the last GM Conference. I don't think we've spoken at any point since. I am writing because I am concerned about the current state of my company.                     As you may know, our CEO, Mr. Smith is leaving, and is rumored to be heading for JPS. The news had a significant impact on the market cap. Our stock was down 8 percent on the day of the announcement.                     The plan is to name an interim replacement while a search is conducted to find a successor. Obviously this is not the best time to be making a change but it seems that this is unavoidable.                     With that said I'm looking for advice on how to turn this situation around.                     Best regards,                     Jeff

Body: Dear Mr. Munoz,

I hope you are doing well. We met briefly at the last GM Conference, though we haven't had the opportunity to speak since then.

I'm writing because I'm concerned about our company's current situation. As you may have heard, our CEO, Mr. Smith, is departing and is reportedly joining JPS. This news has significantly impacted our market performance, with our stock dropping 8 percent on the day of the announcement.

The board plans to appoint an interim CEO while conducting a search for a permanent successor. While the timing is less than ideal, the transition appears unavoidable.

I would greatly appreciate your insights on how we might best navigate this situation.

Dear Felipe,                 25,000 tons of oil from Copenhagen to Lagos in a seven-day freight?                    That's quite a bit of oil, Felipe. I assume you need to ship it by sea.                    You see, the oil trade operates on a just-in-time inventory management model, whereby oil is shipped to tankers as needed. This provides a stable supply and demand, eliminates inventory storage costs and prevents oil from degrading over time.                    Since your request involves shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days, my freight quote estimate would exceed what is available.

Dear Felipe,                 Again, shipping 25,000 tons in seven days is an unusual request.                    If you are shipping this amount of oil in an outbound tanker, then the only companies capable of doing so are Shell, Chevron and Exxon. I don't have contacts with these companies.                    If you're shipping by sea, then you'll need a port in Copenhagen to load onto a tanker. I've emailed my contacts in the seaport of Copenhagen. They'll be in touch with me in the morning.                    If you're shipping by road, then the quantity would need to be in 45 liter plastic oil drums. The storage space and legal limitations of this option would be impossible to organize in such a short time frame.

Body: Dear Jodie,

For bulk liquid cargoes like palm kernel oil, we typically recommend using tanker vessels rather than containers, especially for volumes over 5,000MT. Would you like us to provide specific vessel options for this route?

Best regards,

Using the universal character set( UCS) and big5 characterset to decode, it turns out that the actual claim value is 50,000 RMB, and the status of the case is closed and the email contains a typo (email address should be ruby@clean-energy-future.com).

Dear Ms. Guan,                    We plan to ship 3,000MT of 4% polyurethane for automotive leather from Tianjin to Hamburg. The cargo is marked with “A3” on its marine bills, as well as on B/L and packing list. In addition, there are 7 pieces marked “A1” on both documents. Please note that all these A3 are packed separately from A1 and that “A1” means ordinary polyurethane, as we’ve confirmed with your sales agent. Additionally, we want to tell you that there’s 6 different types of packing boxes for A1 and A3. Each box has a unique paper number. If there are any issues with shipment or delivery, we will need a copy of a report with box numbers clearly visible.

Hello Katherine,                     Thanks for your inquiry and interest in working with us.
I'd like to point out a few things that may be useful for you to consider when doing business with us:
* **Additional charges**: Please note that, the above rates do not include Accelerated discharge charges for +35 days cargo to be paid by Seller.   You will need to bear this cost in mind when considering the above rates.
* **Availability of vessels**: I'm afraid, the vessel availability may be very limited in this trade during April-May 2023 due to busy Season. We have a few vessels that we can offer at the above rates but they are all loaded already in their previous trades and are due to return to Russia after discharging and we'll require 20-30 days notice from you to fit a ballast leg. Hence, you may consider booking a vessel now at the above rates","From: katherine.smith@tradingco.com

Additional important information regarding your inquiry:

1. Accelerated discharge charges for +35 days cargo will be paid by Seller and are not included in the above rates.

2. Due to the busy season, vessel availability is limited during April-May 2023. We have several vessels that could be offered at these rates, but they are currently engaged in previous trades. We would require 20-30 days notice to arrange a ballast leg after their return to Russia.

I recommend booking soon if these terms work for you.

For your information, I have also secured:
- 20,000MT of methanol from Jubail

The vessel's credit rating will progress from 4 to 6, then sequentially through 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. While we typically can't jump from 10 to 6 without formal documentation, I can facilitate this through my industry contact.

Please let me know if these terms are acceptable so we can proceed with formalization.

Are there any grounds on which I could refuse  delivery of non-owned goods from Non U.S. Ports to foreign countries at U.S. terminals? The owners will not grant Title to us. In this case it is possible for us to refuse delivery. The carriers will eventually take possession of the goods and sell them to a salvage company. However, this process could take a few weeks to several months. Are there any U.S. regulations that will speed up this process, forcing the carriers to take possession and transport the goods out of the country immediately?

Body: Dear Scott,

Regarding Montevideo, we can be flexible on the installation methods as long as we meet the church history museum's requirements. They are constructing a rock wall with hand-hewn timber base inside the museum, where two of our timbers will be hung using chains. The nailing specifications for these timbers must be strictly followed for the display setup.

The museum has requested that the side facing the rock wall be treated with a protective coating of their choosing for display purposes.

Best regards,
Min

We're planning to transport the timber to Denmark. Should we arrange shipping or transport them across Europe by truck?

Your advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Body: Dear Bob,

We recommend you bring the timbers personally. I've attached our current brochure with prices and descriptions, plus a payment form for your reference.

One timber can be shipped via FedEx at approximately 1,000 Danish Krone. We also have display materials available, and our representative in Denmark has some additional recommendations.

Please let us know if you're interested in the display materials.

Best regards,

Thanks for your response, but we would require it as 20 foot containers rather than 40 foot containers.  It would be preferable to find a containerized shipping service from Sfax to Hull, but that is not a requirement.  Is it possible to get one containerized shipment to Hull/Bristol, please?

In my opinion, this is a perfect candidate for a fishing operation, whether industrial or commercial, that can use the most effective ship.  In Tunisia, the most effective ship for carrying fruit, vegetable, eggs and other goods is MV Blue Nile, which is actually a hydro ship built in 1967 and has

For starters, if you're using Angular 2, you'll want to import FormsModule.

Next, you'll need to add FormsModule to the imports array in the @NgModule declaration.

Like so: imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule ],

For email validation in Angular 2+, you'll need to:

1. Import FormsModule using: import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'
2. Add FormsModule to the imports array in your @NgModule declaration: imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule ]
3. Add [email] to your input tag

Let me know if you need any clarification.

I was interested in your article about refelective materials in Nature.                                         You had two equations for refractive index in the article.                                         I am trying to find a proof or derivation of one of those (the one that uses lambda and n) and wanted to see if you knew of a reference for it.                                         Thank you,                                         Daniel

Hi!

Thank you for your message. The equation n=1-sqrt(1-f)/2 is a very general one. It can be found in most books on electromagnetism and optics. I wrote down the reference where I first came across this equation in my Nature paper. Have a look at page 3. But you can also find it in more recent books on plasmonics. For example in a book by Jain.

Hello.

Do you have any notes or references for derivation of the equation, f2=1-2n, when n=4*Pi/lambda*d*n*d?

Thanks.

Hi Daniel,

Your question is not directly related to this particular website, therefore I think I'll reply in an email.

The only literature I can think of are two references you probably already have found yourself:

(1)  P. Drude, Handbuch der Radiologie, Leipzig: Barth, 1922 (p. 369)

(2)  N. Jain, C. J. Kryzhanovsky, and C. H. Chen, Excitation and Detection of Surface Plasmons on Gold Films. In: T. Zimmermann, and A. Berger, eds., Coherence, Statistics, and Quantum Optics IV (Springer, 2005) 146-165

Drude's book is basically the bible on metallic materials in

Hi Wim.

Thanks for your reply. I found that references and have already read them but I was looking for a clearer derivation that shows how the refractive index in that form, d*n/d, gets related to the frequency, lambda, and amplitude of the refractive index.

Thanks.

Hi Daniel,

I am not sure that there is a clear derivation that you are looking for. You can find it in some other books, but I doubt that you will be very happy with it, since the derivation would be so clear.

I would be very happy if someone from the audience of this website can help you by giving a clear derivation of f2=1-2n.

I understand your frustration, but I'm not aware of a clearer derivation than what's available in those sources. The relationship you're looking for is complex and the existing derivations tend to be rather dense. Perhaps someone else in the field might have a more accessible explanation.

If your shipment is in such short time we would have to ask for more money because it is a large quantity. But if it's all right with you we can arrange the loading from Singapore within the next three days.

It's all right with us. The reason we are doing this so quickly is that we have another ship waiting at our dock and that's why we need your company to provide the quantity you can deliver so that we can assign it to our ship.

Dear Mr. McGroarty,
Thank you for your email. Please be advised that we have no objections to the list you provided to us. However, the list in question has not been previously reviewed by the Board of Directors of ABC and therefore we are unable to provide you with any information regarding the specific assets. It is our understanding that our list does not conform to the requirements of the Sale Agreement, particularly since the list reflects that we are permitted to retain certain files and information despite the fact that we are prohibited from using or retaining any ABC Confidential Information, as set out in the Sale Agreement. This is a concern to our Board of Directors.

That is no doubt true. However, steam ships proved extremely dangerous for the containers, even the newest ones. The vibrations produced by the steam engines, and the leaks from the boilers, caused significant damage to most containers in transit. This is precisely why modern container ships have completely replaced them.

            The First Element - Greetings

            The Second Element - Subject Line
            Use a descriptive subject line. One you give your email a descriptive subject line, you will increase your chances of being read. It will also prevent your emails from being mistaken for spam or getting lost in your recipient

BAF should be around $120/mt (based on old fix as BAF has changed dramatically), however if a GdW is used please be aware the vessel will likely be late when BAF is calculated. 
About this post:                   It’s useful to think about what someone needs to know (what information they need) and how you can present it to them (the style you can use).                    This helps you to produce emails that are both concise and comprehensive.                    It helps you to be consistent in your writing, and the person receiving your email will feel reassured by the consistency of style (if you can remember to use it!)

Dear Mrs. Walters, 
               We are still in contact with our vendors in Nanded and are anticipating a price at the end of next week for up to 20,000MT of various types of urea. As the quantities can change daily, we would like you to provide the last two digits of your credit card number. 
               I will call you later today to discuss this and to arrange for a flight to Mumbai. As you know, we need to be flexible on the types of urea and quantities, but please feel free to send a list of your requirements. We are anticipating that we may receive it in three or four shipments, so that may be something to consider. Please also provide us with a list of the vessels that you have available. 
               We are looking forward to seeing you. 
               Hope this helps, thanks, Jane

Dear <MANUEL>,
I have good news and bad news. The good news is that I have the freight prices
for Miami to Aruba, and the bad news is that the prices are sky high.
I'll be happy to help with the planning of the move, but I'm afraid that there is
no way that you can make that transport by boat. Unless you want to take a
steamer to South America and leave your lumber there, I would suggest that you
wait until the next hurricane season, when you'll find the rate a little bit lower.
Good luck with the move.

Dear Mona,        The refrigeration is done by ventilation - the holds are ventilated by system that draws air through ice cold seawater. The air is then used to keep the goods at right temperature. There is no refrigeration in the holds of our ships. In between, there are rooms for packages of bulk goods.                    We could load the PKE in these rooms. It should fit in one or two such rooms. The loading rate would be 7-8t per hour.                    The max weight per carcase is 1.500kg. The container could not handle heavier carcases.                    To prevent damage of the PKE during loading, we have made special arrangements for the loading. The shell of the PKE must be closed after being loaded and we suggest using special sealing material for this purpose. A sample of this material can be sent if you wish.                    Should you

Body: Dear Mona,

The refrigeration is done by ventilation - the holds are ventilated by a system that draws air through ice-cold seawater. This air maintains the cargo at the required temperature. We don't have traditional refrigeration in our vessel holds, but we do have specialized rooms for bulk goods packaging.

We could accommodate the PKE in these rooms, likely requiring one or two compartments. The loading rate would be 7-8t per hour, with a maximum weight limit of 1,500kg per unit.

To protect the PKE during loading, we've implemented special handling procedures. The product must be properly sealed after loading, and we recommend specific sealing materials for this purpose. We can provide samples if needed.

Best regards,
James

Dear Madame/Sir
We are looking for a voyage from October 25th to 28th for 26,000MT.

To **be looking** **for** a voyage

To **do** something, the subject is doing, the action. 

Compare:
To **be** waiting for a friend.

We are looking for a voyage means that they need someone to buy their product.  

One must use the passive for this sentence. 
We have the object in the sentence - voyage.  This can be changed to object of the preposition **for** - voyage **for**.  
This change turns the whole sentence into the passive sentence.

The subject will be the preposition. 
We know this because the preposition **for** comes before the subject.  We can make it **a voyage**.

We are **looking** for **a voyage**

The question is
Email 4:
**Who** are **looking** **for** **a voyage**

Answer **They** are looking for a voyage. 

## Common mistake in student papers

1. Using the active form for these sentences.  

We do not use the active form when there is a preposition after the subject.  
It should be  
**He** is looking **for** a house. 
We have the active form **He** is looking, but **for** comes after it.
We change the active form to the passive form, thus creating the passive form.

**There** is looking **for** a house.

2. Removing the article. 

The article **a** is required to make the sentence active.  
**He** is looking **for** a house.  
If you remove **a**, you have created a passive sentence.

There is an obvious difference in intent of these two emails, despite their similar opening lines.

Email 1 is making a clear request, and they go on to add an additional question (""Can you please confirm rate and availability?"").

Email 2 is vague. They want to ""advice"" on shipping charges and how best to deliver to the Mombasa warehouse, but without specifying what the item they want to ship is, or what the conditions are.

They say they have some ""seed crops"", but how can we determine whether this is a valid offer or not without further information?

Body: Hi Mr. Pal,

Could you please advise if we can deliver your import under EXW terms?

If so, could you provide a copy of the bill of lading as soon as it is available, and make sure you've sent a pre-arrival notification of the cargo and owner's details, so that we can facilitate berth preparations and other documentation.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Yi-shen

Body: Hi Yi-shen,

We can deliver your import cargo under EXW terms. While our suppliers can sell our product under CIF terms, our cargo is already loaded, and I believe our transportation cost under CIF may be higher than ex-works.

Regarding the B/L copy before arrival, could you confirm if this will be acceptable?

As for other documentation, we are not sure how to fill it in, as we only supply high technology components, and your export will be the final user.

Many thanks for your kind assistance.

Regards,
Terry

We do require a copy of the bill of lading to be sent to us before arrival. As for the final user, we don't mind, but we will need the information on the final user on the bill of lading, and we would like to know the manufacturer of the products as well, which I will need you to provide us with.

Body: Dear Sir,

Thanks for your email. I don't think we've ever been in direct contact but I'm sure you are probably looking for long-term supply arrangement. If it is the case, we might be able to provide it.

I understand you need to be making a decision, could you tell me what kind of products you are looking for?

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
Inche Lee"

Dear sir,                    My colleague and I just picked the owners of 3 steel vessels from Guangzhou to Ulsan. Can you confirm the cargo space, and if you've already paid the berth dues?                    Cheers,                    Ramón

Dear Mrs. Carter,
                    I am confused about the sea cargo volume of my vessel. The agreement said 3,000 tons of Liquefied Petroleum Gas, with a total of 5,000 tons of oil. I'm looking at the cargo space of the GDDT-101 vessel for 7,800 tons. How come you've shipped so much cargo? The remaining space should have been filled with some rice, but I see none in the photos you sent.
                    Weigh the hull and contact me right away. Do you have any idea what your vessel will be rated? Do you want to remove some of the oil? Your vessel is large, the last time I was in an all-oil ship was in 2003.

There seems to be a discrepancy with the cargo volumes on vessel GDDT-101. The agreement specified 3,000 tons of LPG and 5,000 tons of oil (total 8,000 tons), but the vessel has a cargo space of 7,800 tons. Additionally, the planned rice shipment appears to be missing from the cargo manifest.

Please have the hull weighed and advise on the vessel rating urgently. Would you like to adjust the oil quantity? Given the vessel's size and the full oil cargo, we need to ensure compliance with regulations.

Regards,                    Tim
                    
This email was handed to me on my second day working in the Middle East. It was by far the biggest amount of confusion and annoyance that I had to deal with. I was originally meant to receive the request and push the execution to the Trade desk. However, I thought this was a time sensitive request and without any knowledge of weather and Middle Eastern conditions, I decided to respond via email. This was my first mistake.
            Considering that the deadline was mid-April, 6 weeks away","From: jeremy.smith@tradingco.com

Just to say that I am concerned about our previous shipment not being completed on time due to weather conditions.

For the upcoming mid-April shipment, please consider the vessels Tuna, Excelsior, or Metal. While not ideal, they are operating at least 75% capacity as we haven't yet confirmed our African routes with Metocean.

Hello Ben,                    We’re looking to ship 20,000MT of steel from Paldock to Monrovia. Could you send us your fcl rate and ETA? Also, is it possible to do a post-dated bill of lading?                    Thanks,                    Grace

Hi Grace,                    Attached you will find our quotations for Paldock to Monrovia for your steel cargo.                    We will send your cargo within three days of receipt of your irrevocable letter of credit in our account in London.                    Could you confirm that the steel can be shipped in containers? If not, do you have other requirements (such as barge?); and do you have any requirements for the steel?                    We can carry the bill of lading either to bearer or to the order of your bank, as you require.                    If you would like us to carry the bill of lading to bearer, please let us know when to expect the irrevocable letter of credit in our London account.                    You will find our payment terms at the bottom of the quotations.                    Please confirm your requirements and send us a draft irrevocable letter of credit to enable

Thank you very much.                    The cargo will be shipped in 20 foot containers, with 400 pieces per container. The cargo will be steel bars.                    Please deliver the bill of lading to bearer.                    I have forwarded the irrevocable letter of credit.                    Best regards,                    Grace

Hello,                    We have received your request.                    We will charge you USD 700 per 20 foot container.                    We will deliver the bill of lading as follows:                    We will issue the bill of lading to bearer.

You will see that in the first two emails, Ben goes a little off track. In the first email he doesn’t send the fcl rate and ETA. In the second email, he starts to talk about letters of credit when Grace never asked about that.

The airlines cannot price out with more than 2 stops... when I asked if it was possible to price with 3 they said ""I’m sorry to inform you but all airlines in the U.S. has 2 stops maximum when pricing with multiple stops."" 

Told the man the date and he said ""you can do better with a stop over in Honolulu on the return"" 

but he never sent me any new price?

This is Jian Li of the Shanghai Port Authority. I have been asked by Mr. Meng to contact you with regard to your payment on our shipment of coal. Mr. Meng states that he has forwarded payment to you but you have not yet received it.

We understand that you will be arriving at the port in Shanghai later today, so in order to avoid any problems, could you please let us know the amount that you have been sent to cover our shipment?

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Good Morning,                    Please send an updated cargo manifest for our container No. 07123. It has a cargo description for ""Coal"", but we need to know exactly what kind.                    Yours Sincerely,                    Yve Morgan

 These replies were received:

The container number is not a mistake. It has been deleted from the manifest. Do you understand this?

No, I do not understand. Why has it been deleted?

I thought I said that I would not use a loaded container to transport coal, because it would not be able to fit everything that was needed to be transported. So I asked for a container with nothing in it, to be used for coal. The cargo manifest is a copy of the order. I do not need a container number, just the description of what is in the cargo.

The cargo manifest lists cargoes that are not in the containers you have sent. You must supply the correct containers.

How can you ask for cargoes if they have already been sent? I will check the numbers, but the cargo manifest has not been updated since you received it.

The main question for this task is, does the company have a vessel available to take the cargo?

What technique(s)
Email 3:
The main trick is to make this task look like it is for open charter. This makes the victim pay attention to the price, believing it is actually lower than the price of the chartered ship (by the way, let's make it 0.19$). By saying that you will pay 0.05$/MT for bunker, the victim thinks you are buying bunker, while you are actually renting the vessel.

    Also note that the shipping cost (0.19$) is given to the nearest part of the fourth decimal place, which might look suspicious if the sender and receiver have different countries. It is a very good trick to make such mistakes, as I did in email 2, or even in email 1 if the victim is inexperienced. It makes the victim think he is comparing two similar offers, which they are not, and look bad for not noticing it. Finally","From: trader@buyer-company.com

Presenting as open charter to make rate appear competitive. Actual arrangement is vessel rental. Quote structure (0.19 + 0.05) designed to create impression of separate bunker costs while maintaining total desired rate.

Keeping decimal precision vague to discourage detailed rate comparison."

Hi Dr. Nakamura,
The shipping details we're looking at were for May. Are you looking at other dates?

Hi Gracie,
Thank you for your email. I will wait for your reply.

This snippet represents two separate emails. The first emails are typical types of emails in any trade conversation. They represent the customer asking for the shipping schedule for May and for the best shipping quote for that date. In email 3, the customer sends the complete address.

The customer appears to have followed up again with an email to ask about a different date. Nakamura responds again by asking to wait for
Email 4:
Hi Gracie,

...[while Nakamura leaves for vacation. Nakamura's email box remains empty for a month, and she does not respond to Gracie's email.]

## 1 Answer

Nakamura would have followed up on the request as soon as possible; Nakamura was probably away on vacation for most of that time, so the email system was empty.

I think Nakamura could have sent an auto-responder or had her colleagues respond to email queries for her, while she was on vacation.

My job as a Process Safety Coordinator for a company operating in various Asian countries, I often have to send emails in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai.  I’ve never needed to be away from my job for an extended period of time.

If you have space for bitumen, this is a good email to reply to, but don’t offer any products you don’t have or you won’t have space for. Any mention of bitumen is a potential client.

Body: Good morning Robert,

Just checking in to see how everything is going. Our vessel just arrived in port yesterday and has been off-hire since 2pm. We also hear that other vessels are being loaded in a first-come, first-served basis which may cause a delay in our ETA.

Please advise and let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Stefan

My superior is quite strict about requiring high-quality, current product photos before proceeding with any purchase. Would you please request updated, professional-quality photos from the seller?

I've attached some example photos showing the standard we require.

Thanks for your quote. Some further information:                    The rice would be shipped over a number of months but we would like the price to be fixed for all of the months.                    Also, the port at the destination is likely to change, so we would need the FOB price to be from either Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang or Cai Mep ports (but not Vung Tau port).

Mr. Morgan,                       No worries for the port. However, we need a two day notice before loading so we don’t end up in a crunch.                       Mr. Stanley


                    So in today’s game, no one knows the rules and, in the middle of the game, the rules change and everyone is confused and, as a result, everyone plays like idiots and loses. Therefore, when someone comes into a port, they don’t know if the price for that port is set or floating, and there isn’t anyone on the other side of the table","From: mckenzie.j@tradingco.com

Hey Paul,                    got an offer from this guy who wants us to run a commission business between Pakistan and Jeddah. According to him this guy in Pakistan can get any commodities from Pakistan as they can buy them from factory (must be from buyer) and ship them to the middle east countries. My question is how safe is it for us to run a commission business as we don't know this person from Pakistan.                    You are more experienced than I am regarding that. I guess as long as we sign an agreement with the seller then we are covered.                    Can you advise me on that please?                    BTW, can you put me in touch with him as well so I can get to know him?                    He mentioned that they can ship fresh fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy products.

Basically, they are looking to bring the fresh produce in from Pakistan to Jeddah and pay the charges to us.  They need it at a particular time of the year when Pakistan can supply the crops that are in season. The peak months would be April to September or so.  As you are in the meat business you may be able to get them deals and bring them in cheaply. The market is big there. I will contact you through Facebook as it will be better and you can find them in my friends list.

I got an offer from a contact regarding a commission business between Pakistan and Jeddah. They claim to have direct access to factory supplies for various commodities in Pakistan and can ship to Middle East countries. I need your advice on the safety aspects of running such a commission business with an unknown Pakistani supplier.

Do you think having a signed agreement with the seller would provide sufficient protection? They're offering fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy products.

The person working with Mohammed is indeed professional. I can facilitate an introduction to their Pakistani contact so you can evaluate the opportunity yourself. They're primarily looking to import seasonal fresh produce from Pakistan to Jeddah, with peak operations from April to September. Given your experience in the meat business, you might find good opportunities there, as the market is substantial.

I'll send you more details via Facebook messenger, where you can find their contact in my friends list.

I understand that there is a problem with a Cargotec crane in Busan, and wonder if it will affect your schedule for Mangrovia?                    If not, I need the chartering activity date for this ship to proceed with FCL for the cargo and hire out charterer's agency.                    Thanks for your help.                    Letitia

Dear LETITIA,
Thanks for your follow up.

I was told the lay can will be June 30th which is the same as MVB. The problem is at both ports but the previous schedule is for Ubon Ratchathani, Muang district Chiang Rai, and on July 10th Busan and Yangon with repositioning fees due to charterer.  This vessel is sub chartered out to another charterer.
Yours sincerely, 
Yupaporn

I saw that Chong of ABC Brokerage has emailed his updated laycan window. His vessel is slotting ahead of yours. Do you need the laycan before you inform the charterer?

We are writing regarding the article published by Mr. Eoghan Rice concerning Mr. Maurice Abraham's case. The article contains several misrepresentations regarding Mr. Abraham's correspondence and his time in federal prison.

Specifically, the claims about letters signed as 'H' and 'O'Toole' in relation to the Stephen Trew case of 1998 are unsubstantiated. Furthermore, the statements about prison authorities restricting Mr. Abraham's writing privileges are incorrect.

We request an immediate correction of these inaccuracies.

This was flagged by email as it was coming from an unknown sender. User profile was inspected and found to be empty. It was sent through Rapid Mailer (Mandrill)

However, it did contain a tracking number to an item that the sender said had been sent from the USA, which has led to this email. So this would likely come from some sort of automated mailer.

The files appear to be some sort of ""GET mail spambot"" or maybe a B2B mailer system. 
The zip contains a bunch of folders and files, and does not look executable. Likely some user data.

As requested, I am including a snapshot of our web portal as it appears today. It contains information about the markets in which Karen trades, and the freight rates for each trade. The portal also shows how certain factors, such as market volatility, can affect rates. Each sector displays a current snapshot of freight rates for each of the areas that Karen can trade, and a visual map indicating rate fluctuations. Also, freight rates appear in a moving graph which shows trends over the last 30 days. This is quite beneficial for traders who have to make decisions based on live market conditions. 

Another important function is the ship and route selector. When a ship trader selects a specific ship, the system shows in green or red the rates and savings for that specific ship on each route. This helps traders determine which ship and which route to select.

Finally, a major aspect of the technology is the asset manager,

Thank you very much for the quick response and information.
How do I understand this correctly? The screenshot shows the C/P from Damietta to Koper. The C/P for the voyage Damietta -> Koper is 3.25/3.70 points less compared to the CP for the same route from Rotterdam -> Damietta. This makes a total difference of 3.625 to 5.375 $/day (depending on the grade). Since the ship owner is not willing to fix the voyage for the entire laycan, but only until next week, I can't make any changes to the CP.

Regarding the C/P from Damietta to Koper, I notice the rates are 3.25-3.70 points lower compared to Rotterdam-Damietta route. This creates a difference of $3.625-5.375 per day depending on grade. Since you're only willing to fix until next week rather than the full laycan period, I cannot proceed with any CP amendments at this time.

The agents can respond to each other immediately as they have all the necessary details for the booking in their possession and do not need to go back to their customers.

Since the offers from buyers and sellers are decentralized, they will not be able to negotiate prices and they will have to agree to the market price and then move on to the next negotiation.

If both agents reply to the sender with the same message, there will be an error because a double response is not allowed in TPN. Thus, there is a restriction against these situations to facilitate the tracking of pending operations.

In response to your email, 8,000MT of EVA resin from India to Turkey? No, no, no, we don't have the space, but we are talking about 15,000MT to Taiwan? Yes, yes, yes.

The freight rate? Maybe $10.5, definitely not$11.

That's good news. 15,000MT of EVA resin from India to Taiwan. It sounds much better.

But we have a problem: I just learned that the customer in Turkey and the customer in Taiwan are the same. It's just a customer's secondary office. I don't think they will need that much EVA resin in both places at the same time. If it's like 15,000MT, I'm afraid they will cancel the order.

Nick,

I have talked to my customer and I was right: The secondary office is an independent operation. There is a limit of 10,000MT per office. We'll need to divide the shipment between the two offices. Can we split it? And can we lower the freight rate? This would help us get a better offer.

<Email 3>:
Email 1:
Nick,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate your ideas.

We're going to divide the shipment between the two offices. This means we'll need two ships and twice as many containers. I think it would be better to get a better freight rate. Is $10.5 per MT too much? <Email 3>:

Great! 7,000MT. But one more question. The buyer in Taiwan doesn't need to take the full 7,000MT. He has the room for just 6,000MT. Can we get a better rate with just 6,000MT?

<Email 4>:

Thank you for your kind reply. Unfortunately, I cannot provide you with the port of destination as we are still in the proposal stage. We plan to conduct a survey of our potential customers first before making any commitments.

Good morning Mr. Sardesai,                    We’re hoping to find a vessel to carry 2,000MT of ethylene dichloride from Karasburg to Salalah. Do you think that you can accommodate us on such a tight deadline, or should we look elsewhere?                    Yours truly,                    Karen

Good morning Ms. Klein,                    You made a valid point when you said that ships are very expensive to operate.  So, if we were to provide the food, would that drop the price?                    Your obedient servant,                    Karen
The letter writer is trying to establish the availability of a service from a potential supplier. To do so, she needs to ask questions.
If you choose the service, the supplier may not think that you are interested in the product.  That is why Ms. Klein tells you that ships are expensive to operate and, thus, puts you in a more interested position.  On the other hand, you may not think that the service is suitable for your product.  This is why Ms. Klein suggests that you could provide the food.  In this case, the product is the food.  The product is the basis for the discussion.

Dear Ms. Smith,
At the moment, our vessel is not ready for transport, and we’re afraid that it won’t be until the 10th of next month.  Of course, that will depend on how quickly repairs can be carried out.  Our most recent repairs were completed on the 1st of March.  Ms. Klein, my supervisor, says that we may be able to reschedule for the 12th of next month, but that you must let us know by the 7th of next month.
Yours truly,

Thank you for your inquiry. Given current vessel operating costs, we'd need to quote USD 85 per MT for this route. However, we might be able to adjust the rate if you can provide certain provisions for the crew.

I am glad to hear that you want to work with me.

Please find the following requirements:

- Please go to bank and get these credits asap - US $13.5 million.
- We need around 5 containers of rice in three shipments from one Brazilian company.
- I know we can't finish these at once. We need at least US $1.5 million in one week. We can do this repeatedly with larger amount.
- Please send me the price information before you go to bank.

Best regards,

Email 2:
Hi Kristina,                It's in the $90s/ton (FOB Nola) at the moment. Rates are firm at this level, since very few tonnage is being offered. Also, considering the port congestion in Houston, we would only sign a charter party once we have the deal in hand. Should the charter party contain a destination clause, then of course, it could be signed upon final confirmation.               Regards, Alex

Comment:
Notice the commercial terms are spoken in term of shipping industry currency: MT, t, per ton, etc.
Email 3:
Here in Norway, it's our currency, the Krone, that is used. So here goes our deal in the local currency:

3,300,000/MT (FOB Nola)

A charter party may be drawn up to cover our terms. But, if the MEG should arrive a bit early, we could store the cargo until we need it.

Here we have the commercial terms expressed in terms of ""3,300,000/MT"" instead of ""per ton"". In our example, 3,300,000 is the same as $90. The reason for the discrepancy is that Kristina, the seller, is located in Oslo, Norway, and the selling price is denominated in Norwegian Krone (NOK). One NOK equals 0.16 USD.

My buyer here in Oslo needs 600MT of MEG from Houston. Could you please give me a rate estimate for a spot voyage and advise on the signing of a charter party?

Body: Hi Kristina,

It's in the $90s/ton (FOB NOLA) at the moment. Rates are firm at this level, since very few tonnage is being offered. Also, considering the port congestion in Houston, we would only sign a charter party once we have the deal in hand. Should the charter party contain a destination clause, then of course, it could be signed upon final confirmation.

Regards,
Alex

Here in Norway, it's our currency, the Krone, that is used. So here goes our deal in the local currency:

3,300,000 NOK/MT (FOB NOLA)

A charter party may be drawn up to cover our terms. But, if the MEG should arrive a bit early, we could store the cargo until we need it.

One way to do this is to disable emails from receiving multiple links in Webflow by setting the CSS for the email body element with:

3. Discharge date: no earlier than 22 June.
4. Trade: Genoa to Haifa.
5. Vessel size: What range of vessels are you considering?
6. Is there any flexibility in the loading port or discharge port?

Thanks,

Please note that email 3 is in fact email 2 sent from a different sender (Franklin Malone) to Mohammad Ismail from the sender of email 1.

Note that the sender of email 3 is in the CC of the original email, but the email of the sender of email 3 is not included.

Is it likely that email 3 is from the same person (Franklin Malone)?

I suspect that Mohammad Ismail used Franklin Malone's email address in the TO or CC fields of email 2 and did not include the email of the original sender (Mr. Malone).

Body: Dear Justin,

The University of Chicago does not currently admit graduate students for study abroad programs. However, I recommend first finding a good residential school and then inquiring about credit transfer options. I can send you links to some competitive residential programs that might suit your needs.

You can find a list of potential summer schools here: http://www.thegatewayus.com/Study/Subject/Summer-School.aspx

Regarding credit transfers, while it can be challenging, many universities offer flexible programs that allow summer course credits. The key is finding a suitable residential course first.

Hello Capt. Hu,                    We are organizing a 200,000mt cargo of MGO from Gijon, Spain, to Japan. As you know, it’s a big shipment. In your opinion, are all the suppliers out there able to supply such a big order?                    Also, how long will the loading time take?

Email 2:
Dear Tim,             I'm going to refer to my first email response and elaborate as requested.             We’ve never sold that quantity of MGO. Our company is a division of a larger company that has supplied 100,000mt+ to major trading companies in the last few years, so we can do this. The time frame can be negotiated between the supplier and buyer. We usually provide the shipping documents within 10-12 days of the shipment and request payment in cash 4 weeks later. The buyer needs to pay the bank documentary charges within 2 weeks of the shipment.             I think the real trick is to find a supplier who is able to supply this quantity. To find a supplier for 200,000mt who is able to deliver such a big order is quite challenging. The order should be split into two parts, each part being around 100,000mt.
Email 3:
I’ve just learned that the delivery vessel has a limit of 130,000mt and two big ships might be needed. So, 100,000mt of the order might be enough to fill one ship, and the other ship will have to be loaded with the other 100,000mt.             There are many shipping vessels available that can take this amount of cargo. The average delivery time for this kind of shipment is around 45 days, although it’s possible to shorten the delivery time. It depends on the cargo vessel’s available route.             The costs for this shipment can vary from USD 10 to USD 20 per mt, depending on the size of the cargo vessel, the route taken, and the distance the cargo will have to travel.             In conclusion, I think the best course of action is to ship the order in two parts, each part being around 100
Email 4:
I will continue to provide information on how to find a supplier and transport and shipping companies for this type of shipment.             The best way to find a supplier is to contact the local trade association or trade missions in your area. They can help you find a local supplier, and if there’s no local supplier, they can refer you to the association or missions in the destination country.             There are several types of shipping vessels that can take this amount of cargo. The most common types are bulk carriers, tankers, container ships, and Ro-Ro (Roll-on/roll-off) vessels. Each type of vessel has its own advantages and disadvantages.             The most common route is from Europe to Japan. The distance between the two countries is around 7,000 nautical miles, and the voyage can take around 30 days, depending on the vessel’s speed and the weather.

Body: Dear Tim,

Regarding your query, we've never handled that quantity of MGO in a single shipment. However, our parent company has experience with 100,000mt+ shipments for major trading companies in recent years, so this is feasible.

The timeframe is typically negotiable between supplier and buyer. We normally provide shipping documents within 10-12 days of shipment, with payment terms of cash within 4 weeks. Bank documentary charges should be settled within 2 weeks of shipment.

However, finding a supplier capable of delivering 200,000mt at once would be challenging. I recommend splitting the order into two shipments of approximately 100,000mt each.

I should add that vessel capacity is also a consideration. The maximum capacity for suitable vessels is around 130,000mt, so we would definitely need two ships for this order.

Typical delivery time is approximately 45 days, though this can be optimized depending on vessel availability and routing. Freight costs typically range from USD 10 to USD 20 per mt, varying with vessel size, route, and distance.

Hi Michael,                    We can load 12,000MT in May and 3,000MT in June for delivery to Manila on June 28.                    Best,                    Eva

**Q1** is why did he add ""on June 28"" in his response to her email?
**A:** He's going to make a mistake in the June delivery date. He misremembered the date or didn't pay close enough attention to her original email.

**Q2** Do you need to read all of the emails to make that assumption?
**A:** Yes. You need to see the mistake in order to assume that. What's more, since he said something about June 28, there must have been another email asking about the delivery date.

You can negotiate based on your price

We can begin negotiations based on your offer.

Therefore, if we see text in the email reply that doesn't match what we would expect a human to say in a negotiation reply, that's a good clue that it's a bot.

 From: Dear Mr. Flores, According to your offer for naphtha, if you still have stock, we can negotiate based on your price. Susan

This would be an easy detection system for anyone who was trying to determine if an email reply was generated by a human or by a bot. It's not perfect (or rather, it's not ""perfectly perfect""), but it is a way to detect spam bots.

However, what we're looking for is not just whether an email reply is generated by a bot, but whether the person that sent the email actually wrote that reply. Or in other words: Is the email genuine? Does this person exist? Is it really my friend or colleague that's sending me these messages?

What you should do to test if the email is genuine

To test whether an email is genuine, you should check two things:

1. Does the email reply

If you're sending emails back and forth with a bot, you're probably using some sort of reply template. A human would never send an email back and forth using exactly the same template.

To start with, you should look for:

This is a topic that I cover in more detail in my article on spotting bots.

The key here is that you can't just rely on one factor to validate whether an email is genuine. You have to combine multiple factors together. You have to ask yourself: How strong is each of these factors? How confident am I that this email is genuine? Am I still worried that it might be a","From: susan.martinez@tradenex.com

Ariel,                    We are not familiar with cornstarch cargoes, so I don't know what to survey.                    I recommend that you try to find someone who handles cornstarch cargoes.

We are not familiar with cornstarch cargoes, so I don't know what specific survey requirements would be needed.

I recommend that you try to find someone who specializes in handling cornstarch cargoes. If that fails, you might consider buying insurance on the shipment, though I should note that insurance companies may also have concerns about insuring cargo without proper survey specifications.

In any dialogue it is important to state facts and not omit or conceal important information. This gives room for miscommunication as well as mistrust between the two sides. That’s why it is important to understand how to communicate professionally in business correspondence.

## What is Business Correspondence?

A message sent and received via a written form is known as a business correspondence. It is crucial as it provides information on the various activities of an organization. There are several forms of business correspondence. They include formal business letters, e-mails, and memos.

We have a cargo shipment that we’re looking to send from Pakistan to China, and we were wondering what the best way would be to send it. The container is 20 ft, with a weight of 11 MTs. What would the estimated price be? We’d like it to be as cost-effective as possible, but also have a fast transit time. Also, can we get an estimate of the demurrage rate at the destination port? Thanks!                                        Mark Huang, Huawei

Wonder if you can help with a few quick questions about our June shipment.

We got a 300MT slot from Dhaka to Tejing on 13th June. When should we arrive at Tejing port? Also, what's the daily demurrage rate there?

You rock!

Body: Thanks for reaching out, I'm happy to help.

Your container should arrive on the 29th of June. The demurrage is $500 per day. As for arrival time, it depends when your truck arrives at the port and the port's efficiency. As the summer is very hot in China, the best time is around 10-11am.

Let me know if you need anything else!

Best,
Bruce

With your permission, I enclose an outline of the proposed charter, which covers the period 10th September to 31st October 2011.            In addition, I enclose a Letter of Inquiry, which we have requested from Dampier Iron Ore and from Port Walling.

Dear Richard,            I have reviewed your letter, and I confirm that our vessel will be ready at sea by 15th August, so your preferred dates are acceptable.            With regard to the charter, the only changes that I require are the amounts and unit prices for port, light, and insurance; and the percentage of each these that are to be deducted from the charter.            I trust that these amendments will be acceptable to you.            I will revert with confirmation and insurance policy documents once we have both agreed on the terms.

Timestamp: 2011-08-05 09:30
Body: Dear Ms. Chen,

We have urgent need for a vessel, 50,000dwt size, with good dry-bulk and/or ore carrier experience for transportation of between 20,000 and 25,000 MT of iron ore from Dampier to Yuan Island.

Please confirm your vessel's availability, draft and size, and also availability of existing ballast water. When can you have your vessel at sea, and does it accept 'dumping' of cargo in the event of strike?

We would be most grateful if you could provide a detailed specification of your vessel, including crew, safety records, and insurance policy information, by 7th August.

We will contact you regarding further details after this date.

Yours faithfully,
Richard Vernon

Body: Dear Mr. Vernon,

Thank you for your enquiry.

We are pleased to inform you that we have an 87,000dwt ocean-going ore carrier on our register. The vessel is 12 years old and has passed rigorous safety inspections. She has been chartered to an oil company for the past 3 months and is now available from 15th August.

In the event of a strike, the vessel has the capability of 'dumping' her cargo.

We would be most grateful if you would advise the load port, discharge port, estimated cargo quantity, loading time, and estimated number of loading/discharging crew.

Yours faithfully,
Jin Chen

Hey Aziz,                    Our vessel is scheduled to discharge 11,000MT of methanol in Saudi Arabia. Your FOB looks promising, do you accept CIF as well? Also, are there any charges for net tankering?                    Best,                    Abhiraj

Abe! Greetings from the sea.                    Our agent in Saudi will do a lift-booking and transport methanol from Red Sea to Yanbu. In addition to your FOB price, do you foresee any additional costs such as bunker charges?                    Our priority is safety of the cargo. However, in the unlikely case of any spillage, our liability will be limited to cleaning cost only. Can we discuss?                    Yours,                    Aziz

Hello Aziz! Thank you for your swift response. However, the transit time from Red Sea to Yanbu by road is 3 days and this has added to our costs considerably.

I'm not sure of the specification of the material that you want to be shipped. I'm guessing it's a high-density product that won't require much space to contain. In this case, the charges should be low. 25,000 MT isn't really that much for a vessel. Maybe the best way to do this

They show up in email. When you google “ur5 quickbooks” and “quickbooks error 176109”, you’ll find this email. They are low cost replicas of your computer’s typical shipping and air delivery errors. One reason why they’re so effective is because they’re 100% human-friendly, like “Q: When will the goods arrive? A: Today.”

When you send them back, they’ll respond. These two replies will let you know that someone from them (and not a computer, and certainly not an imposter) is in your inbox.

<Email 4>:
 Dear Frank,                 Yes, there have been some modifications made to the vessel since it was built in 1995. The first modification was in 2010 when a new engine was installed. This new engine has increased the vessel’s cargo capacity to 7000MT and increased its efficiency. In 2017, the vessel underwent another modification in which its six layers were lined with waterproof cloth and epoxy. This modification has improved the vessel’s ability to carry cargo without leaking and increased its durability. We believe that these modifications have improved the vessel’s performance and made it a better choice for shipping iron ore.                    Regards,                    Scott

(lcl or fcl)                    - What is the nature of the cargo?                    - What will be the mode of shipment?                    - When do you expect to move the cargo?                    - Is it an urgent shipment? (please provide the documents)                    Regards,                    Max

Body: Dear Nada,

Here are the latest developments regarding the Almarakib:

The vessel is currently outward bound. There are two important updates:

1. The vessel's Pakistani captain is low on funds and has accepted a cargo transport job from our port to Pakistan to generate immediate income. As a freelancer, he's willing to take on this job with advance payment.

2. The captain is requesting $30,000 upfront for this voyage. We need to take out a bank loan for this amount. Unfortunately, due to our financial situation, I must sell my share of the ship to cover the loan. I'm currently at the bank finalizing arrangements where they will take your share of the vessel as collateral against the loan.

Sada"

Mr. Martin,                    Thank you for your quote.

When is your next voyage to Dalian?                    If we could charter your vessel directly from your current port, perhaps London, then that would greatly reduce our shipping costs and we would definitely prefer to charter with you. We will arrange for our vessel to load with your wheat and deliver it to Dalian where we will book a voyage to Durban.

Body: Mr. Martin,

We note your revised quote is less competitive than your original quote of $7,350. As we stated in our first enquiry we are trying to obtain the best value for our shipment of wheat and it would be unwise to have a new agent. We still hold your initial quote of $7,350 open for the time being.

#Create a Chat Bot

A bot is an automated process that performs an action for you. You can send it a message and it will respond to your message and take action on your behalf. A Chat Bot is an example of a bot.

To create a chat bot we will be making a Github Repository, to use NodeJS, this is because:

• NodeJS is one of the most popular languages used in web development today.
• NodeJS allows you to run your code server-side, which means it can process data and respond to user interactions in real time.
• NodeJS also supports JavaScript, which is a great way to get started with programming. It's an easy language to learn, and many developers already know it.

I think this type of conversation is a sign of a completely new kind of content. When many people read an email, they don't think too much about it. They just get the information they need to keep doing their jobs.

However, if you put the same information into a 'smartcard', suddenly it becomes very interesting. A Smartcard can contain information, documents, images, videos and even music. It can also include online links and information that can be downloaded from the Internet, as well as many other things. Smartcards can be sent as gifts","From: sandra.smith@rotterdamlogistics.com

Thank you for your inquiry. While our port is technically open for business, we are still in the development phase.

We expect to complete the development and have our own local shipping operations established by the end of this year.

Thank you for the proposal. The vessel looks suitable for our cargo, but we need a more competitive rate. Could you check if owners can consider USD 30.00 PMT?

Great - you book a 50-foot container, which is not in our scope! Are you sure we have a 50-foot container deal with you? If we had a 50-foot container deal with you, I would've thought you would've offered us the container first because we are an origin based company. Also, I'm not sure what 'book' means in this context. There are not many 50-foot container companies in Canada and if we had a deal with you, I would be sure about that.

Hi Neeta,
Yes, we will book it as you wish. We will also book the 20ft container for you, however, we need to move it as a OOG from the main line to the OOCL main line. We need to move it to Keelung for OOCL to pick it up from there. We have booked a 20ft container for your company to move from Shanghai to Kaohsiung. We will need the original BL or amendment for the move from Shanghai to Laem Chabang. Thank you,

I am glad that you are still doing well. My family is fine. My children are getting bigger. My oldest is almost 6 years old, and my youngest is 4.

I concur with Mr. Detrick's decision to uphold the bankruptcy court's ruling with regards to the findings and sanctions, with an addition of noting the lack of cooperation with the trustee. I do not think it is appropriate that there was no interview done to this company and I have the utmost concern of how can one do a complete review on a company without speaking to that company. For that reason, I will advise to bring this matter up during the oral argument of Mr. Detrick. Since he is hearing the matter, I think it would be proper to ask if a quick interview with the representatives of Hartley Crane Company, Inc. will be a consideration for the trustee.","From: charles.denton@example.com

Once again, my valued guest and the popular ‘humourous’ founder of the humour site Fuleminess  has raised a very important issue. With the growing influence of multinational business and the Internet, there is a danger of being misunderstood. Particularly when it comes to asking someone a question. With the ever growing number of emails and phonecalls being made globally every second of the day, it is important to ensure your request is heard. 

When sending an email with a question, it is also very important to include a sign off such as “Best Regards” or “Kind Regards” this is because at times a person can read the email very fast and can be assumed that the person sending the email is actually sending them

What are some reasons for replying to an email twice?

The seller is still waiting. I told you not to wait too long to reply to this offer.
If you don’t, someone else will. Who knows where this oil will end up?

Salam,
There is something I haven’t told you. This deal is too good to be true. But, I’m desperate. I need to make a lot of money to start a new business. It’s something I can’t refuse.
I am not a sailor like you. I will deliver the oil to you. I will arrange all the details. You will only have to make the money. You will have to deposit a sum of money in my bank account. My lawyer will prepare the contracts. He will deliver them to you. I will show you my proof that the oil is real. The","From: sid.trader@mail.com

Body: Hello my old friend,

A little birdie tells me you have an urgent need to get 3,000MT of petroleum coke into Cape Town. You don't have space on the F/A ABLYN which is at Latakia? Are you going to wait for her next stop, after a quick turn around in Sudan? Or are you desperate?

Yours,
Sid

Here is the story. I can make you an offer you can't refuse. Remember when I mentioned a quick turn-around in Sudan? Well, the job is not for me. It's for my cousin. He has taken over my business. He is not as nice as me. Don't worry, I can get your oil to South Africa.

Yours,

|        we are watching the market closely.   |
|        The naphtha market is hard to         |
|        predict. We are all at the mercy       |
|        of the OPEC production decisions.     |
|        The question we are facing is         |
|        whether we should buy               |
|        long term or short term, or maybe     |
|        even store. Which one is your          |
|        thinking on this?                      |

I am intrigued by the media reports that you are a potential buy for Chemical Inc. Do you have any comments on this story?

Would also appreciate you forwarding me your internal report on the market impact of U.S. falling naphtha prices.

Cheers,

We are watching the market closely. The naphtha market is hard to predict. We are all at the mercy of the OPEC production decisions. The question we are facing is whether we should buy long term or short term, or maybe even store. Which one is your thinking on this?

Hi,
        This is probably the most cost-effective way to sell our surplus palm oil to the buyer in Panama.
        Our company has more than 100,000 tons of palm oil from Bintulu available, and we would like to sell the 5,000 tons to this buyer as well as the rest.
        We are willing to give you $1 per ton of palm oil, which means that if you are able to sell the 5,000 tons at $9.95 per ton, you will earn $4.95 per ton.

Dear Sirs,       We hereby wish to kindly remind you that after the info shared with you in your first inquiry, We informed you about the available vessel and some alternative vessels as well, after having the availability of both, we can’t get your approval for the vessel S & P. The reason is that the owner does not provide the Vessel’s P&I and therefore you will need to cover the cost. We can find an alternative vessel for you however, therefore please contact us for further details and your approval. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please note, the charterer may choose between TCE only or TCE+P&I that can also be offered to them. Thank you for your cooperation.

Body: Dear Yanyan,

Thank you for your inquiry. Following our previous communications regarding the vessel S & P, we regret to inform you that there is an issue with the vessel's P&I coverage. The owner does not provide the Vessel's P&I insurance, which would need to be covered by the charterer.

We can offer you two options:
1. TCE only
2. TCE + P&I coverage

Alternatively, we can source another suitable vessel for your requirements. Please let us know your preference so we can proceed accordingly.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Dear Samuel,
Thank you for your email. Unfortunately it is not appropriate for you to pass charges like this on to the cargo owners without their consent. If you are able to provide evidence that this is the owners’ responsibility (e.g. a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo), we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses, but if you are just making up charges to pay your agency then it is unethical and we will not pay you.
Thank you,

We also need a few more details on the cargo (origin, grade, product code), which will enable us to get a more accurate quote for the freight.

The more information you are able to provide in your emails, the faster we can give you an answer.

Thank you,
Alain Ferris"

It seems that after your July inquiry, the freight cost has been rising continuously. In September, the rate could be around 12,000USD/30,000MT. It's quite expensive compared with your original contract of 1,300USD per MT.                        I'm afraid your soybean meal could be sold at a lower price now.

I regret to inform you that the previous rates are no longer available. Freight costs have increased significantly since July. The current rate for September delivery would be approximately USD 12,000 per 30,000MT to Shantou.

I understand this may impact your contract at USD 1,300 per MT significantly.

This is very unfortunate news. Given the significant increase in freight costs, we cannot proceed with this shipment as it would result in considerable losses at our contracted price of USD 1,300 per MT.

I will have to cancel this deal with the seller and inform the client accordingly.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Sulek"

1. The Suez Canal plays a crucial role in the global shipping industry, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. However, recent events have caused concerns among vessel operators and shipping companies about delays and increased congestion at the canal.
2. Since the closure of the canal in March due to the Ever Given ship blocking it, operators have been expressing fears of congestion and delays. Despite the reopening of the canal in mid-April, vessels are still facing delays as the backlog of shipping containers and other cargo continues to accumulate.
3. As of May 2nd, there are 67 vessels waiting to enter the Suez Canal, while an additional 55 are waiting to exit. This has led to

Dear (Name),
I hope this message finds you well. I understand that you have some questions regarding the Ever Given ship and the backlog of vessels at the Suez Canal. Let me try to address your concerns.
Firstly, the Ever Given ship was successfully dislodged from the Suez Canal on March 29th, after being stuck for almost a week. However, it remains in the canal until it can be re-fueled and towed to another location for repairs. The process of refueling and repairing the ship is expected to take several weeks.
As for the backlog of vessels in the canal, the congestion has","From: donald.smith@example.com

Body: Dear Valued Customers,

Thank you for your inquiries about the Suez Canal situation. Here are the current facts:

1. The Suez Canal is experiencing significant congestion with 67 vessels waiting to enter and 55 vessels waiting to exit as of May 2nd.

2. This congestion stems from the March incident involving the Ever Given vessel, which has created an ongoing backlog despite the canal's reopening.

3. The Ever Given has been successfully dislodged but remains in the canal pending refueling and repairs.

We recommend factoring in potential delays for any shipments routing through the Suez Canal during this period.

Hi J. Pye,                    I’m writing you about your question. However, due to some problems with confidentiality, I will have to address this email as being from someone other than me.                    I can handle a late July load date, but you must understand that it may take us a few weeks to secure the necessary permits. You can help speed things along by hiring a third party to find out who the permits are issued to, and to pay them for their services. Your cargo is a noxious substance that has been denied to others in the past, so this must be done delicately. The load window can be as short as 3-4 days, but we’ll have to include that in the permits, too.                    Yours,                    Aqaba

Thank you for your inquiry. We can accommodate a late July load date, however please note that securing the necessary permits for hazardous cargo may take several weeks. A load window of 3-4 days is possible, but this will need to be specified in the permits.

We recommend engaging a local agent to expedite the permit process. Given the nature of the cargo, all documentation must be handled with appropriate care and attention.

Hello Patrick,                    Thanks for your reply. We will have approximately 2,700MT of adhesives to send to Liverpool. Do you think you could be available before month’s end? And do you offer a standard dispatch rate if we finish early?                    Regards,                    Roger

Yes, we can arrange it if you can complete it by the end of this week. We have 30 containers per month so you could benefit from our terms, which means we will collect all your adhesives within 4 weeks of the final load. Please find attached our container size chart. 

The next step will be to take an order for your shipment so we can plan the schedule and confirm price. The full details of how to do this can be found at www.ocean-imports.co.uk – please register and follow the instructions.

My advice is to go the less expensive route and use your neighbor's trash cans for the operation. Those are typically made of cheap plastic that is easy to transport by land.

""Anyone who works with anhydrous ammonia or other fertilizers must read this, and they must share it with their teams,"" says Director of Regulatory Affairs Brian Jennings.
* When a group of California manufacturers and distributors went before the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss the 2013 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) proposed by the U.S. EPA, they did not leave empty-handed. A bill was introduced in the state legislature that would provide a tax incentive to encourage renewable fuel blending

Good morning Caroline,

I have checked with my Bitumen supplier.

### Answer options

The correct answer is C.   We need 1,300MT of bitumen


  • A.  We need 1,300MT of bitumen to Chicago                    • B.  I have checked with my supplier                    • D.  Could you name some vessels and a laycan?                    • E.  I wanted to see if we could coordinate our movements to Lyon


The best thing to do when faced with answer options is to try and make as few assumptions as possible. Although the words ""we need"" in the original email suggests a second person, you shouldn't immediately assume that there is more than one person at SEEDOR Company.
Try and identify the people who are talking about the 1,300MT.
The correct answer is ""we"".  So, this 1","From: caroline.smith@trading.com

Hello Scott,                    My name is Stewart and I’m reaching out from Reznor, one of the main vendors of equipment and services for drywall finishing. We’ve just discovered the worksite of the Sillington project on constructionobserver.com, and since this is right in our backyard, I’d love to get a quote for your finishing needs.

I love that you and everyone else on the website have no idea what it takes to run a successful business. You think it’s as easy as going on constructionobserver and asking for bids. Just how much it costs for a quote and if there is a minimum number of products you have to buy.
I’d say it’s an education. Like how the Navy discovered it would lose too many crewmen if they started a major war without undergoing combat training first, so they decided to create such training so that every year they would lose fewer and fewer crews. Combat training also provided the Navy with the opportunity to evaluate newly created equipment and armaments.

In short, anyone can be an entrepreneur. You don’t need to be the richest","From: stewart.vanderbloemen@reznor.com

   _> And who will deliver this quantity to our factory?_ 

So, there was this corporation who asked about our storage and delivery cost. First question they asked was about storage cost. I made sure to talk about all different prices based on different quantities and then I explained the storage conditions. I never mentioned that in my price I included free delivery to the factory, in my opinion it is better to ask all questions before talking about details. You do not know what questions they can ask.

When I received the email below, I was a bit shocked about the question. However I managed to answer it quickly as follows:

With so much missing information, there was no way I could provide an accurate quote at this stage.

Body: Thanks Joanna for your email.

I've spoken to my superiors and we are willing to ship to Singapore if we can get the same price as we are getting for Malaysia.

Are you happy with the price we discussed?

I have a client who is willing to pay more than $550/MT but he can't cover the cost of freight.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Becky

I would like to share with you a couple of situations I have recently experienced regarding sales. The main factor here is that every port of origin in this region has its own cargo’s name that differs from one port to another. Let me give you an example. Vung Tau’s oil is usually known as “XONE”, for example. If the cargo’s origin was not Vung Tau, it would be known as something different. In the first email, the seller is probably from Vung Tau, the port

so he doesn’t want to use the common port of origin name, but he wants to use the name of the port where his product originates from.

We have, however, to be cautious when receiving information from an agent, because often it is not completely correct. If the agent wants to sell his cargo by using an incorrect cargo name, it is much easier for him to trick the buyer by giving a name that has a higher profit for him, or a name that is more familiar for the potential buyer. This issue is something that we have to be aware of. We have to make sure that the cargo is what we think it is, and if we’re sure that we know the exact","From: natalie.wong@trading.com

They get a reply to only the last email. There are reasons why they could be having difficulty in getting through to their target. This happens frequently when it comes to end-user targets in emerging markets.
I always leave two days in my inbox to send another follow up email after the first one is sent and then at the end of the day send another one. This seems to work better than the more traditional 3-day/3-email rule.

 It is not typical. Any crew that is leaving the bridge for more than a few minutes will usually assign a watchkeeper and/or specify exactly where the wheel is. If the owner insists on an automatic pilot watchkeeper, it is up to the captain to comply. But that would not be my recommendation.

Body: Dear Jason,

Unfortunately, my offer is not accepted by my client. My client offers to you an FOB Jeddah price of USD210/MT and the rest USD20/MT will be added as demurrage charge at terminal.

Please let me know if this offer is acceptable to you or if you wish to negotiate further.

Kind regards,

Body: Dear Greg,

Thank you for your offer but I'm afraid our client cannot accept the terms at this moment, as there are some issues on end customer side, and they will be receiving other cargo later in the week so it will be impossible to give me clear instructions before Friday.

Please stay in touch, and I will keep you updated regarding the final confirmation.

Thank you and take care.

Best regards,

I'm not available during weekend but my client has given me positive response. However, my client can confirm your offer only for 2500MT, not 3000MT.

In that case, my FOB price remains USD210/MT and demurrage charge is USD20/MT. Please confirm this offer by the end of today.

Body: Hi Kelly,

On your advice we now have one location for loading and discharging instead of 3 ports. To give you an idea, we will handle 70k MT of Brazilian crude each year for the next 3 years. Could you give us an estimate for these volumes?

Yours sincerely,
Margot

Body: Hi Anna,

I've checked with our IPA trader in Houston regarding your inquiry. They've flagged a concern about the shipment size. Apparently, 80 tonnes is unusually small - they typically deal with much larger volumes (around 10,000 tonnes).

Two questions:
1) Would you have interest in arranging ISCO from Tuxpan to Veracruz?
2) What's your target price per ton?

David,                         We need to add the price of bunker to shipowners is more expensive than selling bunker, since our agent will pay for all bunker in VETSA trades.                    Also please consider the fact that our ship is selling product from Daesan to India before load jet to Daesan.                    So it will be 16.74 US/MT with bunker at VETSA trades.                    Hope this helps.                    Let me know what you think.                    Eddie

We need to consider that the bunker price being charged to shipowners is higher than our selling price for VETSA trades, where our agent covers all bunker costs.

Additionally, please note that the vessel will be delivering product from Daesan to India before loading jet fuel to Daesan.

Therefore, the rate will be 16.74 USD/MT including bunker for VETSA trades.

Let me know your thoughts.

I understand we need to estimate bunker consumption at loading port (Daesan). However, most bunker will be consumed during the voyage from loading to discharge port, and we should only be responsible for bunker consumed from discharge port back to loading port.

Could you please clarify the final calculation based on this?

Hi Carlos,                    Could you take on 11,400MT of kerosene from New Orleans to Jacksonville? Any ideas on extra insurance premiums for weeknd deliveries?                    Thanks,                    Vitoria

dave,                    look at the surface tanker jet fuel route chart on the www and do the calculations. The distance is only 275 miles and if you cut through the shallows then it's maybe only 250 miles.                    With the shallowest part 43 feet, a 35,000 ton tanker would only use about 16' of water to float. If a tanker could travel through the route, I'm sure that the insurance premiums wouldn't be a major problem.                    I could not find any such tanker out there right now so it's not a matter of just connecting the dots.                    The insurance companies would calculate that if there is a loss, there is no place for the ship to refuel on the route, so the insurance rates might be higher.                    Bob

Body: Dave,

I checked the surface tanker jet fuel route chart. The distance is only 275 miles, potentially 250 if cutting through the shallows. With the shallowest part at 43 feet, a 35,000 ton tanker would only need about 16' of water draft.

While vessel passage shouldn't be an issue, insurance premiums might be higher due to limited refueling options along the route. However, I'm not seeing any suitable tankers available at the moment.

Regards,
Bob
