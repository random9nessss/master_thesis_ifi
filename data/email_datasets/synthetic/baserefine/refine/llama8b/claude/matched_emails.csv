Dear Mrs. Scott,                    We have a 5,000MT shipment of waste plastic film from Fuzhou to Tianjin that will be finished by July 28. What is the best lead time you can offer, and will you be able to cover our last two shipments for $2,500?                    Regards,                    Annabelle

Dear Ms. Annabelle,                    Hello. Thank you for your e-mail. I have several storage tanks and packing equipment available and I will be able to accept a 5,000MT shipment of waste plastic film starting July 28. As for the lead time, it will take me about four days to finish the tanking of the plastic film. I can do all the loading, stuffing and lashing and you will be responsible for the fixing and sealing of the hatch. Will the cargo be using hatch cover or will it be double-containerized? Please advise, so I can make the necessary arrangements for the storage. Will you be able to cover the last two shipments for $2,500? We could not accept this kind of condition because the terminal handling fees and port storage costs are already included in the quoted price. I think the best arrangement we could do is to have a rate adjustment

Dear Ms. Scarlett,        It's Scarlett again. Sorry for the late reply. Our cargo will be using hatch cover. The cargo for the past three shipments will arrive in Tianjin tomorrow. We expect the same quality as before. Please have the cargo loaded as soon as possible and arrange for delivery to our designated terminal before August 15. If everything goes as expected, we will make arrangements for the second shipment. Best regards,        Scarlett

Mr. Silver,                    We’re looking for a 500 ton cargo of corn from Quebec to Tokyo. Could you provide a freight quote under CFR terms, and can your vessel sail before the 20th?                    Best regards,                    Gordon

Mr. Silver,
Thank you for your reply. We have already loaded on a vessel and made the transportation contract. However, the transportation company asks for the following documents: a set of bills of lading, a certificate of insurance and a set of commercial invoices. I would appreciate your advice.
Yours sincerely,
Tom

The problem of Cargo Document is tricky because it involves the dispute on whether the transportation company should be considered as the agent of the seller.

Business background:
The first email shows that the buyers have agreed on an acceptance to offer (letter of acceptance, cf. § 1384, Italian Code of Commercial law (Codice Commerciale)) and made a transportation contract for the 500 ton cargo of corn with a third party. As for the Seller, the second email shows that the Seller still thinks that the transportation company is his agent and the Buyers are not
Email 3:
Dear Gordon,
Silver Shipping, Inc. is currently arranging the shipping for you. It will be more convenient if you could tell us the name of the third party or the transportation company to deal with the shipping contract. We are looking forward to getting your email. Thank you very much.
Yours sincerely,
Michael Silver, President Silver Shipping, Inc.
</Email 3>

The main issue:
For the transaction to be a sale with CIF clause, at the moment of conclusion of the contract of sale, the Seller and the Buyers have to agree on the destination port and the Seller have to insure the goods for the Buyers. If the Buyers do not have a transportation contract, the Seller must comply with this CIF clause to fulfill the contract. Otherwise, the Seller should not promise the contract with the Buyers at all, which is the same as Article 6 § 1 (c) of the ICC
Email 4:
Gordon,
Mr. Silver would like to know where you have got the buyers of the corn. We have already got buyers but you asked for the freight and insurance costs. We do not understand why. As we agreed, you are responsible for the sale, insurance and transportation of the corn. We expect to see a written transportation contract from you within the next 3 days. Please forward to Mr. Silver a copy of the transportation contract.
Yours sincerely,
Bill
</Email 4>
The point is that the Seller has not decided what destination port the Buyers are going to choose yet. It seems that the Sellers have fulfilled all the CIF obligations in this case. Thus, it is unnecessary to involve any transportation company. If there is no such transportation company that the Seller and the Buyers both use, the contract of sale cannot be considered as a CIF contract. Therefore, the Sellers should not",,msgbatch_01S5NonEWdot8Gq2QiGHgdty.jsonl,,False

Email 2:
Hi Blayney,                    Not at all.                    Seablue is a crude vessel and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers coming out of  Chinese yards.
As I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not come out in China, other tankers would come out of the dock and China would be fixed.                    These tankers would operate at a price level set by the most competitive time charter tanker which is the drydocked Seablue and therefore the price level at which China is fixed would not be different even if Seablue was out of the drydock.
LPG cargoes are different since we can not use LPG in the crude tankers and crude cargoes are not as easy to fix as LPG, since many producers are contracted and certain prices are set.
The next drydocked Seablue is in

After investigating 82 oil container rates in Balikpapan from February to May 2016, Emma wrote email 1 to request advice on market rates for the 22nd to 23rd of the month. When the suggested rate was below market rate, she accepted the offer via email 2.

Hello Dr Al-Bashir,                    Could you ship 2,000 barrels of gasoline from Genoa to Bridgetown this week? We have recently received market quotation but have no way of verifying its accuracy and wish to discuss it.                    Best,                    Raymond

Dr. Al-Bashir,
             We are extremely interested in moving forward with our transaction. We can finance 50% of the $800,000, and we need to know how you will finance the other$400,000. I am prepared to wire you $100,000 towards the transaction on condition that you forward the other$300,000 (and the ship documents) within 10 days of receiving this deposit. I understand that this is a small amount relative to the transaction, but I am sending you this deposit on the condition that it will be returned within 14 days if you are not able to complete the transaction. Since this is not a substantial amount, I expect that you will not have any difficulty in wiring me back the $100,000. I am sending you this cash transfer request by express courier today. Please send me a confirmation of the receipt of my transfer

<Why haven’t you sent me the deposit?> I am really sorry for the delay on our side. I was out of the office due to personal reasons for a few days. We have paid all our bills and we have enough funds. I just need your Bank’s Swift Code and your Account Number, then we can proceed to making the payment today.

Thank you for your inquiry. I am sending you a quote for your review. We will require a 25% deposit to secure the space.

Once the space is secured, we will provide the details for your local bank to remit payment, as well as the full details of your cargo insurance and bill of lading requirements.

Our next step will be to have our operations department send you the cargo insurance declaration forms to initiate the insurance coverage process. Once the insurance has been set up, we will begin the shipment process and provide you with all necessary documentation.

Problem

A recent widespread email spam campaign targeted the energy and commodities trading industry with messages claiming that their customers wanted to use their services to buy crude oil and related products from reputable traders in the market. Some traders were approached in a very business-like manner, allegedly by major oil firms. The email subject line would indicate that the email was from a trusted business partner, such as a large energy firm or similar corporate client.

The email requests are easy to read but hard to understand. A foreign sounding person claiming to be an executive from a respectable company in a similar industry wants to “spot” some “margin fee” – what? An explanation for what these terms mean may have come attached

Dear John,                    Thank you for your reply.                    Our Singapore client is Singapore Energy, one of the leading trading and logistics companies in Asia Pacific. They represent a major Japanese refiner, Osaka Gas.                    It’s true that this is a complicated trading project and we have to pay a relatively high margin fee of USD 1,000.000.                    If you don’t mind, I can arrange to send you the contract and payment procedure, so that you can fully understand the situation.                    Have a good day.                    Kim

When a business receives a large unsolicited order they often feel obligated to make the sale. In this instance, we can probably deduce that our client is confused as to what the client actually wants and also may be uncomfortable with all the business jargon. In both situations, the client should take a step back and evaluate the order. First, the client should

As the requests are unsolicited and we have not received any communication with our buyer in the past, it would be a good idea to contact them directly to confirm their intent. We could ask the buyer for more information and maybe arrange to speak with the buyer directly. When speaking with the buyer, it would be important to ask them to provide more information about the deal. The buyer may have a reasonable explanation for their request. However, it is important to keep in mind that a reasonable explanation does not necessarily mean the request is legitimate.

So she already appreciated the role of Reza’s proposing concrete example as shown in the second email above.

For general reference, a LSA is a LOI (letter of intent) document.

Introduction

The use of “Email 1” as an example is taken from a popular LinkedIn post of Sam Nara on the subject of using a working example when making a proposal (source: Linkedin).

I have learned a lot from Sam’s post, and I think the post helps provide an excellent practical starting point. In this post, I will provide further explanations to highlight more subtle points not included in Sam’s original post, and also discuss how these points are implemented in our Lean Email.

Email 1 is a typical email. Its objective is to propose a working example to a recipient.

I do need your help here to review and submit the revised LSA to admin for approvals!

In this example, Rosalind first thanked Reza for sending her a revised LSA, then reminded Reza that she required his help to proceed with the transaction.

Based on this email, Reza needs to do two things to support Rosalind in closing this transaction:

• Review the LSA before submitting the LSA to Rosalind’s admin for approvals.
• Submit the LSA to Rosalind’s admin for approvals.

Reza can do these two tasks simply by using Lean Email by clicking the buttons as shown below. Clicking on the Review button will pop-up a Review/Submit page, which contains a Review tab, and a Submit tab.

Hi Alan,             I think you are being too strong in some of your statements regarding the vessel. I saw the clinker/coal traffic, but that was a mix of loaded and empty coming from one shipper.

Email 2:
Ms. Armitage                    Hi Sally,                In reference to your email, we may consider to organize a chartered out of Singapore with loading to be completed by around 20 to 22 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec. For your reference, I have attached the chartered info and telex release copy.                If you are interested, I will keep you posted when we have further update.                Regards,                Tony

</Email 2>

# Word Problem

### Solution 1

From the email the relevant facts are:

• The farmer wants to charter a ship to transport 15000 mt of rice to Jakarta.
• According to Ms. Armitage, the loading can be completed by around 20–22 November with delivery ETA around 10–12 December.

We know the ship will depart Singapore to Jakarta but
Email 3:
Hi Sally,                There will be another chartered starting from Singapore to Jakarta, departing on 18 Nov.                If you are interested, please advise latest by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony

</Email 3>

The sender mentions in Email 3 that the ship will leave Singapore to Jakarta on 18 November. That means there will be a time difference between 18 November and 20 November. So this information is not consistent with the information given in Email 2, which is the main source of information.

One reason for inconsistency could be the mistake in Email 2, when Ms. Armitage wrote 22 November instead of 20 November. Or one may assume that when Ms. Armitage sent Email 2, she didn't know about the departure date on 18 November.

Let us consider the following situation:
Email 4:
Hi Sally,                There will be a chartered departing on 18 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec.                Please advise if you are interested by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony

</Email 4>

In Email 4, we assumed that Ms. Armitage may have made a mistake in Email 2, and corrected it in Email 4. So let us analyze this situation.

Assume the ship leaves Singapore on 18 November and arrives at Jakarta on 10 December. This means the ship will take 22 days to reach Jakarta.

So, if loading is completed on 20 November, it will take a minimum of 2 days to complete the loading. It may take longer.

• So the loading will take place between 18 and 20 November.

                    1. The transit time would be approx. 4 weeks. We normally handle bulk containers (20 feet and 40 feet) but we can try with other vessels if you want. We do not usually carry these products, but we can do it from 15,000 tons per trip.                    2. We can accept transshipment of grain from other ports in Europe. In principle it is every two weeks from Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany) with transshipment to Vladivostok once per month. You can also order grain from these ports for the transshipment in the United States.                    3.

2) Regarding the electronics deal, please consider accelerating the timeline. We've noticed American firms are increasingly looking to work with British firms to access their competitive tax rates. An earlier timeline would make us more attractive.

3) Regarding your quoted rate for the electronics firm deal...

Body: Dear Patrick,

I regret to inform you that we will not be proceeding with the electronics firm deal. Your negotiation approach is pushing the company beyond their current comfort zone and capabilities.

It was a pleasure working with you.

Sincerely,
Felicia

Hello Jorge,                    I hope you and your family are doing well.                    I've enjoyed working with you over the last couple of years. I am sure that I am not the only one.                    Although things are looking good right now I'm afraid we may have to part ways due to merger and alignment talks going on in the background.                    Best wishes,                    Dana

Dear Mr. Munoz,                     I hope you are doing well.                     I think we met at the last GM Conference. I don't think we've spoken at any point since. I am writing because I am concerned about the current state of my company.                     As you may know, our CEO, Mr. Smith is leaving, and is rumored to be heading for JPS. The news had a significant impact on the market cap. Our stock was down 8 percent on the day of the announcement.                     The plan is to name an interim replacement while a search is conducted to find a successor. Obviously this is not the best time to be making a change but it seems that this is unavoidable.                     With that said I'm looking for advice on how to turn this situation around.                     Best regards,                     Jeff

Using the universal character set( UCS) and big5 characterset to decode, it turns out that the actual claim value is 50,000 RMB, and the status of the case is closed and the email contains a typo (email address should be ruby@clean-energy-future.com).

Regarding your email about shipping 1000MT oil seed cake from Mumbai to South Africa - I need to clarify that the clients want the oil seed cake only, not the oil. Could you please confirm that the cargo will include only oil seed cake?

Please advise.

Notice how the email itself doesn't go into the input? That's where everything gets tricky. If you're using input with the type of email, then you should just do the following:

For starters, if you're using Angular 2, you'll want to import FormsModule.

Like so: import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
Next, you'll need to add FormsModule to the imports array in the @NgModule declaration.

Like so: imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule ],

And you'll need to add [email] to the input tag.

This will give you an input that looks something like this:

        Our liners operate out of Virginia, Houston and Long Beach, and to Istanbul, İzmir, Kütahya, and Antalya. We also have a weekly direct service to İzmir from Savannah. It’s a fast service, it takes about 14 days from loading in the US to discharging in Turkey. If you’re interested in shipping from Houston, it’s an 11 day trip to Antalya. All of these routes can be served from one of our 3 weekly services. For a monthly schedule, please visit our website. We don’t accept individual bookings, so you would need to find a freight forwarder or consolidator to place your booking.

I was interested in your article about refelective materials in Nature.

Hi!

Thank you for your message. The equation n=1-sqrt(1-f)/2 is a very general one. It can be found in most books on electromagnetism and optics. I wrote down the reference where I first came across this equation in my Nature paper. Have a look at page 3. But you can also find it in more recent books on plasmonics. For example in a book by Jain.

Your question is not directly related to this particular website, therefore I think I'll reply in an email.

The only literature I can think of are two references you probably already have found yourself:

Hi Wim.

Thanks for your reply. I found that references and have already read them but I was looking for a clearer derivation that shows how the refractive index in that form, d*n/d, gets related to the frequency, lambda, and amplitude of the refractive index.

Thanks.

Hi Daniel,

I am not sure that there is a clear derivation that you are looking for. You can find it in some other books, but I doubt that you will be very happy with it, since the derivation would be so clear.

I would be very happy if someone from the audience of this website can help you by giving a clear derivation of f2=1-2n.

Good morning, Mr. Evin,

How are you today?
Yes, I’m coming to your house to learn. But, it’s raining. My parents and my brother, Arian, can’t come. We’re waiting for a better day.

It’s a big problem.
It’s about rain.
Thank you.

Good afternoon. Glad to hear from you. Hope you are doing fine. Thank you so much for the great video. There is no doubt it is very helpful for us. 
One question I have is when I sent a message by email, can I use ""This is"" to introduce myself? I saw a very interesting movie at the cinema. It is about a cat with a magic ability. What do you think about it? The movie is really enjoyable.
Thanks a lot.

 Hello Kevin, Thank you so much for sending us a lovely song. Your friend Kevin is a great singer. Your English is really good, too. I'm happy you wrote to us. You can use ""This is"" to introduce your message. You can say something like ""This is a song my friend Kevin sings."" ""This is an email I sent my friend Kelly last week."" You can ask a question and talk about a movie like this: ""How was the movie about the cat with a magic ability? It sounds interesting."" Or you can say, ""I'm glad you liked the movie about the cat with a magic ability."" I hope you have a great day. Be well! Olivia and the Yip sisters.

RE: [ANOTHER EMAIL OF THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER] - REMOVAL OF ASSETS FROM CONTROLS OF ABC

Dear Ms. Flippo,

I was copied on your email yesterday to Mr. Frank and Messrs. Calloway and Vaughn. Please be advised that pursuant to Section 14.4 of the Purchase Agreement dated November 4, 2004, we have placed certain assets that are subject to the asset transfer agreement that you recently sent over to us in our depository at 15 York St., in Toronto, to await the return of those assets to ABC. These assets are detailed in a list attached to our email of December 14, 2004, (see attachment A). I assume these are the assets that are under your custody. If you have any objections to this deposit, you must advise us
Email 4:
[RECEIVED AT TIME OF EMAIL]
Dear Mr. McGroarty,
Thank you for your email. Please be advised that we have no objections to the list you provided to us. However, the list in question has not been previously reviewed by the Board of Directors of ABC and therefore we are unable to provide you with any information regarding the specific assets. It is our understanding that our list does not conform to the requirements of the Sale Agreement, particularly since the list reflects that we are permitted to retain certain files and information despite the fact that we are prohibited from using or retaining any ABC Confidential Information, as set out in the Sale Agreement. This is a concern to our Board of Directors.

Please be advised that your proposal to place certain of our assets in a depository pending return to ABC is inappropriate and contrary to the terms of the Sale Agreement. Specifically, Section 2.1(a)
Email 5:
I just spoke with Martin but I was copied on the email below. 
    Today is December 17th, 2004 and we continue to have no approved and executed sale agreement. In the meantime, ABC is purging all of our assets and information, and sending same to various unidentified third parties and law firms. 
     We simply cannot accept these proposals in light of ABC's wrongful purging of our assets. All of the discussion contained in your email is irrelevant in light of the purging. Please provide us with a confirmed list of all assets that have been sent to third parties and their names.

I've talked to the shipping line again, and they have agreed to make the necessary changes to the shipment so it can be delivered to Ho Chi Minh City instead of Haiphong. However, the cost of this change will be substantial.

Good morning Mr. Gonzales,                    Our team has been reviewing the contract for freight containers between Rotterdam and Naples for some weeks now.                    Do you have any further business questions or suggestions to our market analysis?                    Regards,                    Christa

Morning Christa,                    If I remember correctly, that contract included only containers shipped by steam ship, but I now know that steam ships have been replaced by modern container ships.                    I'd like to amend that contract for all types of modern container ships, with an expiration date.                    Regards,                    Hugo

<Email 3>:
Hi Hugo,                    I've found some documentation from the 1970s that state there was still a fair amount of containers transported by steam ship, despite being a less economical way to transport containers.                    What do you think?                    Regards,                    Christa

<Email 4>:
Hi Christa,                    That is no doubt true. Steam ships are extremely dangerous for the containers, even the newest containers. The vibrations produced by the steam engines, and the leaks from the boilers, damage most of the containers in transit.                    That is why we",,msgbatch_01SSM17Py3PVaU6jvDWzJnSN.jsonl,,False

About this post:                   It’s useful to think about what someone needs to know (what information they need) and how you can present it to them (the style you can use).                    This helps you to produce emails that are both concise and comprehensive.                    It helps you to be consistent in your writing, and the person receiving your email will feel reassured by the consistency of style (if you can remember to use it!)                    And, if you use the same style for several emails to the same person, it

Dear Mrs. Walters, 
               We are still in contact with our vendors in Nanded and are anticipating a price at the end of next week for up to 20,000MT of various types of urea. As the quantities can change daily, we would like you to provide the last two digits of your credit card number. 
               I will call you later today to discuss this and to arrange for a flight to Mumbai. As you know, we need to be flexible on the types of urea and quantities, but please feel free to send a list of your requirements. We are anticipating that we may receive it in three or four shipments, so that may be something to consider. Please also provide us with a list of the vessels that you have available. 
               We are looking forward to seeing you. 
               Hope this helps, thanks, Jane

Hi,                    We need 1,200MT of lumber from Miami to Aruba. Can you please get us a price?                    Many thanks,                    Manuel

Dear <MANUEL>,
I have good news and bad news. The good news is that I have the freight prices
for Miami to Aruba, and the bad news is that the prices are sky high.
I'll be happy to help with the planning of the move, but I'm afraid that there is
no way that you can make that transport by boat. Unless you want to take a
steamer to South America and leave your lumber there, I would suggest that you
wait until the next hurricane season, when you'll find the rate a little bit lower.
Good luck with the move.
Best wishes,
Paul

Thank you for your interest. I have since received an enquiry for a different cargo type that the ship could load in Mumbai, so I'm going to offer it to the client in that case.                    Unfortunately, that means it's not available to you.
But please let me know if you are still interested in a ship that could load there, and I will be able to let you know whether the ship is free or not.                    Best Regards,                    Liam

Hello Owen,                    Our Australian customer wants to ship some powdered milk from Port Botany in Sydney to Tokyo. The contract says 2,500MT, but they might also require 1,500MT of grain. This order will leave in the first week of July. We need your help.                    How much would shipping 4,000MT of both goods together cost, and do you see any risk of port congestion?                    Many thanks,                    Ivy

Hi Ivy,
Good morning.

The order for 2,500MT should be easy to manage.
Regarding the order for 1,500MT of grain, unfortunately, we do not see any vessel available to fit both cargoes in the same vessel. As we are still in June, there are still some free slots available on July, but as the order size is so big, we have limited choices.
That being said, we can manage to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain in the same vessel with the owner of a 10,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge the previous cargo in July. All details about the vessel are as follows:

M/V T1
Type    General Cargo
Flag    Liberia
Call    MOYO
Deadweight    8,600MT
Built    1996
Hold No
Email 3:
Regarding the risk of port congestion in Australia, I'm afraid the situation is getting worse and that it may be difficult to find a slot for such a big order. Also, the railway terminals are overloaded as well.
I know the situation seems very bad. I can only offer you the best available. If you are willing to wait till October, I can offer you a better slot with more space. This way, you will be able to fit more products, or reduce the price.
What do you think?
Email 4:
Thank you for your help. The information you provided is very useful to us. 
We want to ship the 4,000MT cargo in early July. We do not have enough storage capacity, so if we delay the delivery, it may lead to the depreciation of our goods, so I'm afraid we can only choose the original plan.
Also, we will have more orders to deliver in July. Can you please help us?
Waiting for your reply!
Regards,
Ivy
Best regards,
Martin
Email 5:
Hi Ivy,

I understand that you have to deliver the order at the earliest opportunity, and that you can't wait till October. I'll look for a slot in September for you.

Please find attached a quotation for 3,000MT and 4,000MT. We can ship 1,000MT in July and 2,000MT or 3,000MT in August. I can fit 2,000MT on a 6,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September and 3,000MT on a 6,500dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September as well.

Do you have a choice of milk powder or grain as the cargo to be shipped in August?
Thank you.

Hi Mr. Pal,                    Could you please advise if we can deliver your import under EXW terms?                   If so, could you provide a copy of the bill of lading as soon as it is available, and make sure you've sent a pre-arrival notification of the cargo and owner's details, so that we can facilitate berth preparations and other documentation.

Hi Yi-shen,                           We can deliver your import cargo under EXW terms, in fact, our suppliers can sell our product under CIF terms, but our cargo are already loaded, and I think our transportation cost under CIF may be higher than ex-works.                           I would like to ask you if we can provide you with a copy of B/L before arrival, could you advise on whether this will be a problem for you.

Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee meeting the May 11 ETA. Our vessel has good speed, but if it needs to sail in ballast to Malabo, it will take at least 16 days for the journey. The vessel would need to wait for loading once in Malabo.

Dear Jeremy,                    Just to say that I am concerned that the trip was not completed on time. The weather seems to have been the issue.                    If the next trip is too late, please consider the Tuna/Excelsior/Metal which are not ideal but are at least 3/4 capacity as we have yet to book Africa with Metocean.

This email was handed to me on my second day working in the Middle East. It was by far the biggest amount of confusion and annoyance that I had to deal with. I was originally meant to receive the request and push the execution to the Trade desk. However, I thought this was a time sensitive request and without any knowledge of weather and Middle Eastern conditions, I decided to respond via email. This was my first mistake.

One of my workmates asked me how to answer this email. I am not sure myself. I've answered questions like these one here, but they were much more easy:

1)  Say good night to Mommy!
2)  Well, take your time!
3)  Of course I'll help you. When and where?
4)  That sounds great! I'll bring the umbrella.
5)  I know. It is not important.

What is the correct way to answer to Nastya in this email?

There is a pattern for this type of 2-part email that I've observed in some specific contexts:

The main question for this task is, does the company have a vessel available to take the cargo?

What technique(s)
Email 3:
The main trick is to make this task look like it is for open charter. This makes the victim pay attention to the price, believing it is actually lower than the price of the chartered ship (by the way, let's make it 0.19$). By saying that you will pay 0.05$/MT for bunker, the victim thinks you are buying bunker, while you are actually renting the vessel.

    Also note that the shipping cost (0.19$) is given to the nearest part of the fourth decimal place, which might look suspicious if the sender and receiver have different countries. It is a very good trick to make such mistakes, as I did in email 2, or even in email 1 if the victim is inexperienced. It makes the victim think he is comparing two similar offers, which they are not, and look bad for not noticing it. Finally",,msgbatch_01MdX424jnMcS4zCRLnv9FM8.jsonl,,False

Please advise me if you have any vessels calling in Asia or Africa ports during the month of May to offer Bitumen/Resin or other products for future shipment. Will look forward to your early reply.

If you have space for bitumen, this is a good email to reply to, but don’t offer any products you don’t have or you won’t have space for. Any mention of bitumen is a potential client.
If you don’t have space but can offer bitumen, this is good too.

In the previous example, we see that Muffy is interested in getting a better ETA so she can work with Luen Marine. In response, Phil suggests a better ETA of 7-9 months, which is much longer than what Muffy wants. However, she is also aware that they are trying to work with Luen Marine and suggests that they wait until they have a better ETA before proceeding with Luen Marine.

Hello, George
I have received your e-mail. Thanks for asking us for this enquiry.
This is my first reply to you.

First of all, can you give me the type of coal you plan to ship (NSC, ARA, etc.) and also the port of loading at Barry (BPT, UKCOAL, etc.)

The best way is to proceed with time charter.
Most of shipping companies are hard to find the right vessel because of a lack of high specification open cargo handlings. However, I can check and suggest you to you.
I will try to provide you the following details:
1. The vessel that is available in market
2. The cost estimate

Please feel free to contact me anytime and I will be delighted to be of assistance.
Thank you very much.

Hello George,
Thank you for your reply.

Currently, there is a lot of vessels available in the market. But most of them are low specification and the area of coverage can't fit with your requirement.
However, we may be able to find a vessel that suits your requirement.

If it is no problem, can you give me the delivery port of discharge (namely, the name of the country of discharge).

And also, can you specify the size of the vessel you are looking for?

Thanks for your quote. Some further information:                    The rice would be shipped over a number of months but we would like the price to be fixed for all of the months.

Mr. Morgan,                       No worries for the port. However, we need a two day notice before loading so we don’t end up in a crunch.                       Mr. Stanley


                    So in today’s game, no one knows the rules and, in the middle of the game, the rules change and everyone is confused and, as a result, everyone plays like idiots and loses. Therefore, when someone comes into a port, they don’t know if the price for that port is set or floating, and there isn’t anyone on the other side of the table",,msgbatch_01MdX424jnMcS4zCRLnv9FM8.jsonl,,False

I would like to know that the distance between New York and London by water is around 4550 miles. From your blanks, you will need about 64 hours to reach London if the ship moves 100 miles per day. In this case, we can conclude that if the ship arrives in 65 hours, it will be one hour late.

Dear LETITIA,
Thanks for your follow up.

I was told the lay can will be June 30th which is the same as MVB. The problem is at both ports but the previous schedule is for Ubon Ratchathani, Muang district Chiang Rai, and on July 10th Busan and Yangon with repositioning fees due to charterer.  This vessel is sub chartered out to another charterer.
Yours sincerely,

This was flagged by email as it was coming from an unknown sender. User profile was inspected and found to be empty. It was sent through Rapid Mailer (Mandrill)

However, it did contain a tracking number to an item that the sender said had been sent from the USA, which has led to this email. So this would likely come from some sort of automated mailer.

The files appear to be some sort of ""GET mail spambot"" or maybe a B2B mailer system. 
The zip contains a bunch of folders and files, and does not look executable. Likely some user data.

If possible, I'd like to ask a question about your voyage SMMACV2749.                    For 2,700MT of ammonium sulfate from Damietta to Koper, do you have capacity next week, and can we finalize a CP with minimal laycan buffer?                    Thanks,                    Karen

Dear Karen,
        On the other side, we already had 2 communications with you, but we didn't receive any proposal from you, even though we offered you our best C/P.

Can someone please send the email thread so I can explain better what is happening? Thanks!
Sincerely,
Karen

The above is a screenshot of an email exchange, used with the recipient's permission, between Karen, a buyer in the global chemicals market, and Farid, the manager of the ship owner, an Arabic company that sails the Suez Canal and trades between the Middle East and Europe, as part of a global trade flow network for various chemicals. The trade between these two entities revolves around Ammonium sulfate, which is used as a soil fertilizer, food additive, and detergent.
Although Ammonium sulfate has historically been traded on the bulk commodity market, recent market

P.S. Please send your proposal as soon as possible, since we want to proceed with the loading of the cargo next week. We don't know the date for the vessel yet, but the date will be available by Monday.

Dear Ms. Lisa,
                Please send us your proposal for the 2,700 MT of Ammonium Sulfate from Damietta to Koper. We already offered you the best C/P on the market for the same voyage.

[1] Who is the better dealmaker? Karen or Farid? Both? Neither?
[2] Is the behavior of these two parties consistent with what you've learned about negotiation?
[3] How could a technology such as one from IBM Watson Trader help these two parties negotiate better and faster?

As requested, I am including a snapshot of our web portal as it appears today. It contains information about the markets in which Karen trades, and the freight rates for each trade. The portal also shows how certain factors, such as market volatility, can affect rates. Each sector displays a current snapshot of freight rates for each of the areas that Karen can trade, and a visual map indicating rate fluctuations. Also, freight rates appear in a moving graph which shows trends over the last 30 days. This is quite beneficial for traders who have to make decisions based on live market conditions. 

Another important function is the ship and route selector. When a ship trader selects a specific ship, the system shows in green or red the rates and savings for that specific ship on each route. This helps traders determine which ship and which route to select.

Finally, a major aspect of the technology is the asset manager,

Thank you very much for the quick response and information.
How do I understand this correctly? The screenshot shows the C/P from Damietta to Koper. The C/P for the voyage Damietta -> Koper is 3.25/3.70 points less compared to the CP for the same route from Rotterdam -> Damietta. This makes a total difference of 3.625 to 5.375 $/day (depending on the grade). Since the ship owner is not willing to fix the voyage for the entire laycan, but only until next week, I can't make any changes to the CP. 
Regards,
Karen

Hi Paula,

My barge can't lift 3,400 mt of coal. My barge can only carry 1,400 mt.
For freight rate we have three rate contracts, these are for 6 months and 3 months and 1 month. So no fixed rate and no bunker escalation clause.

That's good news. 15,000MT of EVA resin from India to Taiwan. It sounds much better.

But we have a problem: I just learned that the customer in Turkey and the customer in Taiwan are the same. It's just a customer's secondary office. I don't think they will need that much EVA resin in both places at the same time. If it's like 15,000MT, I'm afraid they will cancel the order.

I have talked to my customer and I was right: The secondary office is an independent operation. There is a limit of 10,000MT per office. We'll need to divide the shipment between the two offices. Can we split it? And can we lower the freight rate? This would help us get a better offer.

If you choose the service, the supplier may not think that you are interested in the product.  That is why Ms. Klein tells you that ships are expensive to operate and, thus, puts you in a more interested position.  On the other hand, you may not think that the service is suitable for your product.  This is why Ms. Klein suggests that you could provide the food.  In this case, the product is the food.

Dear Ms. Ghosh,                    My group is sourcing 25,000MT of rubber from Shanghai to Salem. We can be very flexible on loading, but need to know your thoughts on two possible shipping methods:                    1. 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. How much extra would be this compared to a typical voyage at your current market price?                    2. 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev. Is there any discount available if we book these voyages for 2016 as well?                    Sincerely,                    Sarah

Dear Sarah,                        Glad to get your inquiry. Actually, I have just sent an email regarding the new liner service through Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode to VRS China. Let me know if you get that. I am not sure about the sea transport to India since I am not from that dept. But I would like to go for the FCL rate of Hoegh Autoliner as there is an attractive rate by these carriers.                    One of my friends of Taiwan is also very interested in this carrier. She will go for 10/20 cbm containers. But they were waiting for the government’s final approval. Anyway, please wait for our China dept’s advice.                    Any other queries please contact me at any time.                    Have a nice day!                    Yours faithfully,                    Rita Lee

Subject: 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode?
Rita,   I got your message about Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. Thank you for the offer! Do you have any indication on the timing of the service? In addition, do you think I should consider 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev as well? I did not include those carriers in the original email because my thinking was that they are more suitable for 2016. Still, the volumes will be the same for both years. Sarah


In this email exchange, Sarah was mainly interested in the future developments of Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. She also mentioned that she wanted to discuss an alternative carrier, Golden Highway and Damleev.

It's become clear to us that American firms are now looking to work with British firms in a bid to access their very competitive tax rates. Moving the deal forward would make us an attractive proposition.                     3) Finally, in relation to the rate you quoted for the electronics firm, I

I just looked up prices for ethanol in Houston from Singapore, Brazil, and Egypt. They are all pretty much the same - only a 3 USD difference. In July, Brazil was cheaper, but now in August, Egypt is slightly cheaper, though that could change quickly.

I'm going to go with the MT readings as shown and work with a delivered price of 1 USD from Maceió. I need this information to estimate the gas requirements for profitability.

Could you estimate freight for 2,500MT from Maceió to Houston in late June/early July? Also, would you be willing to cover the 10% buyer's commission?

Best,
Aimee

Answer 1:
Subject: RE: (RE: TENDER FOR 6000MT MALABO TO CAPE TOWN)                    The rate is okay with us, but there is a problem with the transit time. Could you check your ETA for my customer? We are willing to pay more, if it will arrive earlier. Thanks

Answer 2:
Dear Alice,                    Unfortunately, we are not sure if we can achieve the ETA. Our vessel has a good speed, but if it is ballast in Malabo, it will take at least 16 days. If the cargo is loaded in Malabo, it will have to wait for our ship",,msgbatch_01VhAya2GdcUf4FqRaNmkrjn.jsonl,,False

Dear Sir,                    We have 6,000MT of bitumen from IADC to Maputo. Could you share your available windows and dispatch incentives?                    Best regards,                    Harry

Dear Harry,                    Hi, I'm afraid our trade is more than limited to only a small network of petroleum engineers which are strictly within the company hierarchy. Our website describes the business development we're doing and, since we're not the agents of any refineries, the trucks are not available to carry the goods of other refineries.                    Thank you for your understanding.                    Regards,                    Jelena

<Email 3>:
Dear Jelena,                    Good afternoon, I am sorry if our letter was misunderstood by you. We have not any other refinery that wants to deliver the bitumen to Maputo, therefore the deal is between IADC and us. The CIF price offered is the price for Maputo.                    Sincerely,                    Harry

Dear Jelena,                    Good afternoon, I am sorry if our letter was misunderstood by you. We have not any other refinery that wants to deliver the bitumen to Maputo, therefore the deal is between IADC and us. The CIF price offered is the price for Maputo.

Please kindly check with the vessel for their ETA and if the berth will be available on that date.                                        Regards,     Miss Chi

Can we arrange to load out immediately ? Can you confirm the vessel name and ETA ?                                        Thanks                                        Tony

Hi Seth, 

            If your goods have HS code 3004, we can offer 4 available slots for 3004 products as follows: 

            Feb 28-Mar 03 
            Mar 11-15 
            Mar 18-22 
            Mar 25-29

            For FOB terms, we are open to discuss at commercial terms, but will need a tender with confidential shipping terms to verify if we can commit. Let me know which slot you want to take and if you need confidentiality. Regards, Andres
Email 3:
Hi Andres, 

            I have some clarifying questions about your slot availability. My understanding is the following: 

            1) Your vessel can load 2500MT of general cargo, including the 3004 cargo 
            2) Your vessel can make an East Coast USA call 
            3) Your vessel has laytime, i.e. 3 days of port time to load 2500MT

            Am I correct? 

            Thanks, Seth

Hi Seth,

I haven't seen anything in the canal treaty that mentions anything about a new C/P.  In fact, nothing there at all about rates.  It may have something about how the current method of charging is broken down.  There is an addendum
Email 3:

[Addendum to Panama Canal Treaty]

[Letter of understanding and agreement.][which will I assume be applied to container ships and not to other vessels such as your DWT which sail through. It's not my fault.]  Since the signing of the Neutrality

Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama of 1926, the Panama Canal has been operated as an interoceanic highway in a manner which has been equitable and impartial to all the merchant vessels of all nations, and in a manner consistent with the operation of other interoceanic waterways. The tolls for the use of the waterway have been established in the Treaty at rates which

would be consistent with the tolls charged to vessels
Email 4:
I suspect we will have to hire a cargo lawyer. I think you should make the accusation of discrimination then. See if the Secretary of State for Transport will provide a legal opinion. Or failing that then get a private firm to challenge the 'owners' of the canal in their own backyard.  With a guaranteed doubling of the revenue they should have no interest in the details.
As a minimum get them to explain the 'adjusted and equitable tolls' arrangement.

Hi David,                    Let’s assume our 4,500MT fixture from Hamburg to Aarhus has settled for a free-out rate of $300/MT. So is that an all-in rate?                    Regards,                    Robert

Dear Robert,                     I see what you’re saying, however, while the quotation has settled for $300/MT the vessel owner is willing to accept $250/MT, and if you don’t agree, he’s willing to pay $300/MT. So it’s all good.                     Regards,                     David

Dear David,                  I hope the direction of this conversation is clear?                     As I mentioned, I have no interest in the vessel owner. My position is clear – to hire the vessel owner is an all-in rate of $300/MT and it is all in. If we agree to hire the vessel owner at a lower rate, the vessel owner has no interest in paying an all-in rate of $300/MT and will in no way agree to that.

In any dialogue it is important to state facts and not omit or conceal important information. This gives room for miscommunication as well as mistrust between the two sides. That’s why it is important to understand how to communicate professionally in business correspondence.

## What is Business Correspondence?

A message sent and received via a written form is known as a business correspondence. It is crucial as it provides information on the various activities of an organization. There are several forms of business correspondence. They include formal business letters, e-mails, and memos.

The letter types might be used to communicate with customers, clients, or employees. Some examples of business correspondence include application letters

Billionaire has not changed any of the 9 clues in the poem since 1990 except for the 5 clues in the ninth line.

Is the 9th Line ""trick question"" code?

How can you figure out which of the remaining clues in the poem you need to use to decipher the remaining 2 lines?

No One Except Captain Nemo has ALL the answers to these 3 questions.

Note: If you know the answer to the 9th line, you can find the exit right now without a single travel clue.

Subject: A special $10 million stash Fenn allegedly buried in the Rocky Mountains—and why you might never get to find it.

I believe there is a$10 million stash in the Rocky Mountains and I just found the clue to it in the Netflix series. To find the treasure, you must go to Wyoming and take a hike to the summit of the mountain on March 14, and find a rock with a spider web and a spider on it. There is a chunk of stone with the date 2014, then there is a map that was drawn by the Aboriginals in a nearby valley that shows where to go next. It is approximately 2

If, in fact, you choose to accept any $10,000,000,000+ treasure, and a check made out to you by the Bounty Board for$10,000,000,000+, be advised that the paperwork includes a clause that neither you nor your heirs can claim any part of that amount again.

I know you are very busy but I need to know the port arrival time for June shipment. Could you let me know it for me please? We also need to know how much demurrage will be at Tejing port?

[Response] Thanks for reaching out, I’m happy to help. Your container should arrive on the 29th of June, the demurrage is $500 per day. As for what time, it depends when your truck arrives at the port and the port’s efficiency. As the summer is very hot in China, the best time is around 10-11am. Let me know if you need anything else!

Hi Jeremy,                   Thank you for the detailed information. The Port of Elizabeth is basically a bit “rustic”. Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h. We can also do up to 2,000 mt/h if the coal can be delivered to the berth quickly and easily.

Be advised that in March, the water in the port will be very low. Because of","From: jorge.rodriguez@trading.com

They show up in email. When you google “ur5 quickbooks” and “quickbooks error 176109”, you’ll find this email. They are low cost replicas of your computer’s typical shipping and air delivery errors. One reason why they’re so effective is because they’re 100% human-friendly, like “Q: When will the goods arrive? A: Today.”

When you send them back, they’ll respond. These two replies will let you know that someone from them (and not a computer, and certainly not an imposter) is in your inbox.

I've discovered that the Turkey and Taiwan customers are actually the same company's offices. There's a 10,000MT limit per office. Could we split the shipment between the two locations? Also, is there any flexibility on the freight rate to help us make a better offer?

Let's focus on Taiwan for now. The buyer there can actually only take 6,000MT. Would this smaller quantity help us get a better rate? Also, our shipper needs to know the specific port in Taiwan.

I have some clarifying questions about your slot availability. My understanding is the following:

1) Your vessel can load 2500MT of general cargo, including the 3004 cargo
2) Your vessel can make an East Coast USA call
3) Your vessel has laytime, i.e. 3 days of port time to load 2500MT

Welcome to Sada,<Nada>
Here are the latest developments on Almarakib.<br /><br />Outward bound.<br /><br />Two reasons. 1. Almarakib's Pakistani captain is low on funds and is able to transport items from our port to Pakistan and earn some quick cash. He's a freelancer by nature, and is more than happy to take on whatever job comes his way as long as he gets his money upfront.<br /><br />2. He is asking for $30,000 upfront. We will take out a loan for the money. We cannot afford the loan. I must sell off my share of the ship to pay it back.<br /><br />I am writing this email on my phone from the bank.<br /><br />I have agreed to let the bank have your share of the ship and pay off the loan.<br",,msgbatch_01V2Q1vjuLoveL9xbTq3Goy5.jsonl,,False

Gday Kris. I would like to check if we can sell you a total of 8kmt of sugar for wanganui. With Jan/Feb arrival and FOB USD 345 / mt. Please let me know what you think, and if we can discuss further, or try and sign some PO's.                   Regards,                   Anil

<Email 3>:
Thanks for that kris, I have a great deal for wanganui if you can accept it. May I know if the buyer will accept all shipments? If not we can try and split the sugar for different buyers, so that all shipment is loaded.                   Regards,                   Anil

Mr. Martin,                    Thank you for your quote. Your quote of $7,350 is a great value for a premium wheat like our MG and we were hoping you would have enough of the stock to allow us to charter your vessel to Dalian to load. When is your next voyage to Dalian?                    If we could charter your vessel directly from your current port, perhaps London, then that would greatly reduce our shipping costs and we would definitely prefer to charter with you. We will arrange for our vessel to load with your wheat and deliver it to Dalian where we will book a voyage to Durban.                    We look forward to hearing from you,                    Olivia

A bot is an automated process that performs an action for you. You can send it a message and it will respond to your message and take action on your behalf. A Chat Bot is an example of a bot.

To create a chat bot we will be making a Github Repository, to use NodeJS, this is because:

• NodeJS is one of the most popular languages used in web development today.
• NodeJS allows you to run your code server-side, which means it can process data and respond to user interactions in real time.
• NodeJS also supports JavaScript, which is a great way to get started with programming. It's an easy language to learn, and many developers already know it.

Great - you book a 50-foot container, which is not in our scope! Are you sure we have a 50-foot container deal with you? If we had a 50-foot container deal with you, I would've thought you would've offered us the container first because we are an origin based company. Also, I'm not sure what 'book' means in this context. There are not many 50-foot container companies in Canada and if we had a deal with you, I would be sure about that.

Hi Neeta,
Yes, we will book it as you wish. We will also book the 20ft container for you, however, we need to move it as a OOG from the main line to the OOCL main line. We need to move it to Keelung for OOCL to pick it up from there. We have booked a 20ft container for your company to move from Shanghai to Kaohsiung. We will need the original BL or amendment for the move from Shanghai to Laem Chabang. Thank you,

Hello Vincente,                    Based on the last year's grain harvest, there will be low supply of wheat this year.

Once again, my valued guest and the popular ‘humourous’ founder of the humour site Fuleminess  has raised a very important issue. With the growing influence of multinational business and the Internet, there is a danger of being misunderstood. Particularly when it comes to asking someone a question. With the ever growing number of emails and phonecalls being made globally every second of the day, it is important to ensure your request is heard. 

When sending an email with a question, it is also very important to include a sign off such as “Best Regards” or “Kind Regards” this is because at times a person can read the email very fast and can be assumed that the person sending the email is actually sending them

What are some reasons for replying to an email twice?

Explain how this form of explanation might serve to establish greater rapport

Hi Edward,
What about using a multi-purpose dock, such as Port Natal?
They have the most advanced docking equipment and their crews are very experienced.
They are also one of the fastest ports in the world and have an average unloading time of 15 minutes per ship.
The other option is to go for the third-party port.
I know a company called “Aloha Stevedoring” who can handle your requirements.
It is the best port in the world, with the best ships and docks.

Email 2:
Dear Samuel,
Thank you for your email. Unfortunately it is not appropriate for you to pass charges like this on to the cargo owners without their consent. If you are able to provide evidence that this is the owners’ responsibility (e.g. a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo), we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses, but if you are just making up charges to pay your agency then it is unethical and we will not pay you.
Thank you,
Alain Ferris

The information you need is as follows:                        Quantity: 30,000MT (weight)                        Type: Soybean meal                        Packed in 50kg jumbo bags                        Packed in 1,200 bags per 40'HC container                        Destination: Shantou                        Port of loading: Chongqing                        In the end of June this year, my company and a dealer made an agreement of selling and buying the above soybean meal at the agreed price of 1,300USD per MT.                        I'm wondering if I can still make the shipment at such price even now it's September.                        Thanks in advance.                        Sulek

<Email 4>:
 Dear Suheki,                        I've checked with our freight representative. I'm afraid the above rate is no longer available.                        It seems that after your July inquiry, the freight cost has been rising continuously. In September, the rate could be around 12,000USD/30,000MT. It's quite expensive compared with your original contract of 1,300USD per MT.                        I'm afraid your soybean meal could be sold at a lower price now.

Dear Captain X,                        That's terrible!                        It seems that we can't make it.                        At that time we agreed the contract price was only 1,300USD per MT. If we reduce the price further, we'll definitely lose some money.                        I don't know how to explain this to the client.                        I'd better tell him to take some other cargo.                        I will close this deal with the seller now.                        Thanks.                        Sulek

 Dear Suheki,                        It's a pity.                        I think that if we still insist to take the cargo, we can at least minimize the loss. We can fix the rate for the shipment.                        If we reduce the price further, we'll definitely lose some money.

> Unit of analysis #2: ""What would be the availability"" as the entity (noun) in the second sentence.

For these units of analysis, we have considered:

> Surface rules: They are found on the surface of the sentence as entities that can be mapped onto external data sources.

> Explicit rules: They are not evident from the sentence, and must be explicitly provided by the analyst.

> Implicit rules: They are contained within the linguistic unit that can be extracted from the sentence but require inference to map the linguistic unit onto the external data source.

Hi,                    I have heard of some vessels taking longer than normal to make passage through locks at the Suez Canal. Do you know if this is correct and do you think it might delay my shipment from China to Long Beach.                    Sincerely,                    Donald

1. The Suez Canal plays a crucial role in the global shipping industry, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. However, recent events have caused concerns among vessel operators and shipping companies about delays and increased congestion at the canal.
2. Since the closure of the canal in March due to the Ever Given ship blocking it, operators have been expressing fears of congestion and delays. Despite the reopening of the canal in mid-April, vessels are still facing delays as the backlog of shipping containers and other cargo continues to accumulate.
3. As of May 2nd, there are 67 vessels waiting to enter the Suez Canal, while an additional 55 are waiting to exit. This has led to

Can you tell me what is the status of the Ever Given ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal in March? Is it still there? Also, I've heard about the backlog of vessels in the canal. Do you know if that might affect my shipment?
Dear (Name),
I hope this message finds you well. I understand that you have some questions regarding the Ever Given ship and the backlog of vessels at the Suez Canal. Let me try to address your concerns.
Firstly, the Ever Given ship was successfully dislodged from the Suez Canal on March 29th, after being stuck for almost a week. However, it remains in the canal until it can be re-fueled and towed to another location for repairs. The process of refueling and repairing the ship is expected to take several weeks.
As for the backlog of vessels in the canal, the congestion has",,msgbatch_01P5FSnpGo9FRm9ugB1yoxUN.jsonl,,False

Good day Ms. Kelly,                    I’m inquiring about 3,400MT of sulphuric acid from Aqaba to Khor Fakkan. Could you handle a late-July laycan, and are you open to a short load window?                    Best,                    Aqaba
Email 2:
Hi J. Pye,                    I’m writing you about your question. However, due to some problems with confidentiality, I will have to address this email as being from someone other than me.                    I can handle a late July load date, but you must understand that it may take us a few weeks to secure the necessary permits. You can help speed things along by hiring a third party to find out who the permits are issued to, and to pay them for their services. Your cargo is a noxious substance that has been denied to others in the past, so this must be done delicately. The load window can be as short as 3-4 days, but we’ll have to include that in the permits, too.                    Yours,                    Aqaba

Hello Patrick,                    Thanks for your reply. We will have approximately 2,700MT of adhesives to send to Liverpool. Do you think you could be available before month’s end? And do you offer a standard dispatch rate if we finish early?                    Regards,                    Roger

Yes, we can arrange it if you can complete it by the end of this week. We have 30 containers per month so you could benefit from our terms, which means we will collect all your adhesives within 4 weeks of the final load. Please find attached our container size chart. 

The next step will be to take an order for your shipment so we can plan the schedule and confirm price. The full details of how to do this can be found at www.ocean-imports.co.uk – please register and follow the instructions.

We can accommodate a shipment of 3000MT of rubbish, but I'm concerned by your use of a boxship. Sure, it'll transport the garbage, but you're going to have to pay out the wazoo to get one. My advice is to go the less expensive route and use your neighbor's trash cans for the operation. Those are typically made of cheap plastic that is easy to transport by land. I wish you the best of luck!            James               ----- Original Message -----               To: James S.

We'd be happy to take on your job! We're going to need to know a few things before we can proceed though:               What is your trade?               How far do you need to go?               What are you going to do with all of that garbage in the end? (toxic waste? Trash that will just be dumped into the ocean somewhere?)               This is actually the largest cargo ship in the world. But yes, I guess you could consider it a ""boxship."" Oh but don't worry!

""Anyone who works with anhydrous ammonia or other fertilizers must read this, and they must share it with their teams,"" says Director of Regulatory Affairs Brian Jennings.

Good morning Caroline,

I have checked with my Bitumen supplier.

### Answer options

The correct answer is C.   We need 1,300MT of bitumen


  • A.  We need 1,300MT of bitumen to Chicago                    • B.  I have checked with my supplier                    • D.  Could you name some vessels and a laycan?                    • E.  I wanted to see if we could coordinate our movements to Lyon


The best thing to do when faced with answer options is to try and make as few assumptions as possible. Although the words ""we need"" in the original email suggests a second person, you shouldn't immediately assume that there is more than one person at SEEDOR Company.
Try and identify the people who are talking about the 1,300MT.

I wanted to apply this methodology to email correspondence analysis but had no good starting points to learn from. So, I decided to have a go at using a large email data set to set up an email correspondence model. In this post, I’ll describe my method and then evaluate it.
## Previous Work
I found two other email correspondence analyses:
Both papers claimed to have a small error rate (below 5%) but no error rate figures were provided. Their methods included analyzing only the destination of emails and ignoring the subjects and whether the email was replied to or not.

I love that you and everyone else on the website have no idea what it takes to run a successful business. You think it’s as easy as going on constructionobserver and asking for bids. Just how much it costs for a quote and if there is a minimum number of products you have to buy.
I’d say it’s an education. Like how the Navy discovered it would lose too many crewmen if they started a major war without undergoing combat training first, so they decided to create such training so that every year they would lose fewer and fewer crews. Combat training also provided the Navy with the opportunity to evaluate newly created equipment and armaments.

In short, anyone can be an entrepreneur. You don’t need to be the richest",,msgbatch_01P5FSnpGo9FRm9ugB1yoxUN.jsonl,,False

We are interested in the second shipment of cotton under 50-ton container in direct sail from Santa Cruz to Newark. Will the new Charter Party apply the New Panama Canal toll?

Where can I find this 'new Charter Party' you mention? I have the latest canal treaty with me, but it says nothing about a new C/P. Can you please clarify?

Body: Sam,

Please refer to the canal toll agreement here:
http://www.panamaxmaritime.com/AG/Panama%20Canal%20Tolls%20Agreement.pdf

The addendum discusses toll rates for container vessels. As per the Neutrality Treaty, the Panama Canal should operate equitably for all merchant vessels. The tolls should be consistent with established rates.

Best,
Ian

Body: Ian,

I suspect we will need to hire a cargo lawyer. We should challenge this on grounds of discrimination. We could seek a legal opinion from the Secretary of State for Transport, or alternatively engage a private firm to challenge the canal authorities directly.

At minimum, we need clarification on their 'adjusted and equitable tolls' arrangement. However, I should mention that our principals are generally reluctant to engage in legal proceedings.

Sam

> How much is your storage fee? 


   _> And who will deliver this quantity to our factory?_ 

So, there was this corporation who asked about our storage and delivery cost. First question they asked was about storage cost. I made sure to talk about all different prices based on different quantities and then I explained the storage conditions. I never mentioned that in my price I included free delivery to the factory, in my opinion it is better to ask all questions before talking about details. You do not know what questions they can ask.

When I received the email below, I was a bit shocked about the question. However I managed to answer it quickly as follows:

A: Thanks for the info. It will be around 55.00 cts GTT at your port. Please confirm the vessel is in a condition and class as per samples.                    Nicole

My thoughts
With so much missing information, there was no way I could provide an accurate quote at this stage.

Let’s see how they reply:
<Email 3>:
Hello Nicole,
1) Please confirm that the cargo is gas oil not furnace oil.
2) Please confirm the vessel is in a condition and class as per samples.
Regards,
Liam

Ok, that’s slightly better.

1) We will not accept GAS OIL cargo. We are only accepting FURNACE OIL.

2) Yes, the cargo will be in good class and condition. We only accept high quality petroleum products.

Liam

The shipment costs US$100,000 (can be deducted from the commission that you pay to me)                   36,000 MT = 36,000 ton x 1,000 kg/ton = 36,000,000 kg = 3,600 m3
Email 3:
The price per litre is $10, so 5,500 m3 of ethanol is worth US$55,000.
The net profit for the shippers is US$55,000 - US$100,000 = US$55,000.
Let me know how you feel about this arrangement. 
Best regards,
Email 4:
If this offer from the shippers is accepted, I will issue a commission invoice to you (as agent) as follows:
100% net profit is $55,000
Commission is 5% of net profit is $2,750
The balance of $52,250 is to be deposited by you (the client) in my bank account and you will then get the balance of $100,000 less commission.
Please send a signed copy of the attached contract.  I will provide a copy for you to sign.
If you have any queries about this arrangement, please get back to me.
Email 5:

Body: Greetings Ms. Abukar,

Could your vessel take on 7,500MT of urea from Dubai to Batam on the 20th of next month?

In addition, what is your interest rate and the freight cap (if any) on charters longer than 3 months?

Regards,
Judy

I would like to share with you a couple of situations I have recently experienced regarding sales. The main factor here is that every port of origin in this region has its own cargo’s name that differs from one port to another. Let me give you an example. Vung Tau’s oil is usually known as “XONE”, for example. If the cargo’s origin was not Vung Tau, it would be known as something different. In the first email, the seller is probably from Vung Tau, the port

so he doesn’t want to use the common port of origin name, but he wants to use the name of the port where his product originates from.

We have, however, to be cautious when receiving information from an agent, because often it is not completely correct. If the agent wants to sell his cargo by using an incorrect cargo name, it is much easier for him to trick the buyer by giving a name that has a higher profit for him, or a name that is more familiar for the potential buyer. This issue is something that we have to be aware of.

You might find this article interesting. As mentioned in the article, last week was another historic week in the energy business, where the private equity firm of Apollo acquired The Unical Petroleum Corporation, in the most recent in a series of U.S. companies who’ve been bought by foreign entities. With foreign financial firms having acquired Blythe & Blythe Energy, CITGO, Pacific Gas & Electric, Southwestern Bell, Texas Utilities, among others, it is rather apparent that while the American energy market remains the largest, there are better opportunities elsewhere.

They get a reply to only the last email. There are reasons why they could be having difficulty in getting through to their target. This happens frequently when it comes to end-user targets in emerging markets.
I always leave two days in my inbox to send another follow up email after the first one is sent and then at the end of the day send another one. This seems to work better than the more traditional 3-day/3-email rule.

While we see high open rates, it’s possible that the real target isn’t looking for the product at this time and may not have read the email. You don’t really know for sure unless you get a reply from the target",,msgbatch_01Lhqww96G8VpZu6pWr5bTCf.jsonl,,False

 It is not typical. Any crew that is leaving the bridge for more than a few minutes will usually assign a watchkeeper and/or specify exactly where the wheel is. If the owner insists on an automatic pilot watchkeeper, it is up to the captain to comply. But that would not be my recommendation.

* If the vessel is in or near a harbor or channel where there are many vessels and navigating is a challenge, why do the ships leave the bridge and let the ship just drift out of control? Would not knowing exactly where the wheel is be a problem? I am talking about not having a person at the helm ready

broker or agent to determine the inspection’s requirements, including duration and time of day for the inspection.  The bill of lading, while you

We understand your client will be taking full responsibility for their merchandise at the port of discharge. Therefore, they should assume responsibility 
for ensuring that their merchandise clears customs.  We understand that you are working with our agent at the port of discharge to file the necessary documents

Hi Kelly,                    On your advice we now have one location for loading and discharging instead of 3 ports. To give you an idea, we will handle 70k MT of Brazilian crude each year for the next 3 years. Could you give us an estimate for these volumes?                    Yours sincerely,                    Margot

Our preferred vessel is the same as the one you recommended previously, but you will have to double-check with T-Sea that the ETAs are correct.

Dear Sir,
Since my last letter, I have been reading a

lot of ideas.
Here is one of them. Will a large container
ship be built in China? Is it a good
investment to own a small container ship or
to own an interest in a large ship? I
believe that the container shipping industry
will get better and better. At this time, the
shipping market is very strong.
Here is the conclusion:
It is better to own a small container ship
than to own an interest in a large container
ship. We should stick to our belief.

Dear Daniel,
It was interesting to hear about your last company's approach to negotiating terms of
employment for a new employee.   If I had known about this earlier, I would have suggested
including a similar clause in our employment contract, had I known that we would have reached
this stage of our employment.

Many thanks,          Mark

If you had thought of it earlier, perhaps we could have managed to incorporate the clause into

dave,                    look at the surface tanker jet fuel route chart on the www and do the calculations. The distance is only 275 miles and if you cut through the shallows then it's maybe only 250 miles.                    With the shallowest part 43 feet, a 35,000 ton tanker would only use about 16' of water to float. If a tanker could travel through the route, I'm sure that the insurance premiums wouldn't be a major problem.                    I could not find any such tanker out there right now so it's not a matter of just connecting the dots.                    The insurance companies would calculate that if there is a loss, there is no place for the ship to refuel on the route, so the insurance rates might be higher.                    Bob

Thank you for writing to us. However, I am sorry to say that we cannot offer you freight estimate for this shipment. It is best if you can first talk to your supplier to get the CIF price of this shipment. Then we can offer you freight estimate.

When you give an estimate, it will give the exact rate. It is correct if the pickup and delivery dates are the same and the amount of goods shipped is 50 CBM. If your pickup date is July 10, 2017, the delivery date is July 20, 2017, and the amount of goods shipped is 25 CBM, you can click the blue icon in the lower right corner. Change your preferred dates and change the amount of goods shipped.
   Our company charges $0.05 per CBM per day, so the extra cost is $25 ($25 CBM*0.05$ per CBM per day*20 days

We're hoping to find a vessel to carry 2,000MT of ethylene dichloride from Karasburg to Salalah. Our target loading date would be within the next two weeks. Could you please confirm if you have any suitable vessels available for this route?

Thank you for your inquiry. Given current vessel operating costs, we'd need to quote USD 85 per MT for this route. However, we might be able to adjust the rate if you can provide certain provisions for the crew.

Our rate is USD35 per MT, cargo shall load at Jingtang Oil Terminal on 12/15 Dec, ETA Spain on 17/25 Dec, you could confirm the charter today or not later than tomorrow.  Please email back your interest, thanks!

The timer I chose was 5 minutes. And the prompt was:

How did you come up with the shipping contract?

You can use PNP to shorten the time for expression. For example, to say

""we are thinking of shipping X amount of crude oil from A to B"", ""We'd like to buy X amount of crude oil from A to B"", etc.

The PNP here is the “thinking of shipping”, “wanting to buy”, and the rest of the action words.

I received two emails from different people with the same job and they did not know each other. How do I check the emails to find out the original sender? I wanted to know which quote the original sender wanted. The emails I received did not indicate that it was a reply to a previous email I had sent them.

The emails I received seem to be a reply to a previous email I sent them, but I am not sure because the email headers were empty. How can I know which email was sent to them first?

Use balticdirties at all other times. For example, if you are estimating spot freight rates between two ports and two locations, and you only

So your project is about *Self-Driving Car* project? Does your task is to build a dataset? (like *record all the different driving patterns*) or build an application to help driver?
Email 3:
Let me make sure I'm understanding you correctly. Are you requesting that we **decompose** two decades of the same dataset into a much more manageable number of, say, three to four *decades*, so that I can apply this new algorithm to the entire dataset with more manageable storage?

I'm not quite sure what you mean by **""decompose** the first 10 years,"" but I'll guess that you are asking me to compress the first 10 years of data down to a smaller amount. If that is your request, I'll note that the changes in the dataset have slowed considerably, so I would expect that the 11th decade would have a smaller compression than the 10th decade. Is that your intent?

Hello Ryan,                    Our current volume to Haldia port is 2000MT. The main reason for the high volume is increased industrialization of West Bengal, increased port handling capacity due to new Haldia Dock Complex and increasing port capabilities to handle increase in ship sizes. We intend to further double the volumes for Haldia due to multiple factors including our own expansion at plants on the East Coast of India.                   We currently source the bitumen from Jubail and other origin ports. The proposed volumes and best position for Jubail is Haldia Port as follows.

Thanks for your email and apologies for my delay in replying.

It’s my feeling that there is a bureaucratic delay in Liberia and you might have to employ a solicitor to assist, do you have any ideas about that? Best regards, Scott

The expressions and sentences in each of the four emails are different and so the email might not be a good example of phishing attack.

=> i removed the word 4 after 1,000 MT in the email
After doing so, the two first emails have a similar structure and are difficult to distinguish.
=> Could you explain why?
=> Since 4 was removed, the emails could be written by two different persons. So 1,000 MT was not indicative of who wrote the email.

Thanks Pauline,

I checked the schedules and I think you mean the Commodore. This is our weekly spot cargo service, loading containers for France.

The Commodore berths at the South Container Terminal but we can't berth there this week. There are no slots available and the berths have to be occupied in a particular order.

South Container Terminal berths are occupied in this order:
5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 6

This week we have the Commodore coming in from Kingston on Wednesday. This is the first available berth for that vessel so we are expecting her to be berthed at 6 South. The ship is due to sail to Cherbourg on Friday night.

I hope this helps.

Geraldine

                    As far as ballast conditions are concerned, your charterers could also try ""Coastline's"" current charterers (i.e. ""Sambalino"" of the same owners) as they will be arriving from a short haul fixture at the moment and may be in a position to proceed immediately to the loading port in ballast. Alternatively, you may wish to proceed ballast and obtain fuel in advance of loading.

Hi Mr. Batra,
                    May I request you to assist us in exploring with your owners the following options for our shipment as below:

Hi Jeremy,                    We are working with a Malaysian supplier on this (a large capacity trading house).                    We have sent samples to their own lab to confirm that it meets our specifications.                    We are expecting to place our order shortly.                    All the best,                    Jay
