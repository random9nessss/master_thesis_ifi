Body: Dear John,

Thank you for your inquiry. I am sending you a quote for your review. We will require a 25% deposit to secure the space.

Once the space is secured, we will provide the details for your local bank to remit payment, as well as the full details of your cargo insurance and bill of lading requirements.

Our next step will be to have our operations department send you the cargo insurance declaration forms to initiate the insurance coverage process. Once the insurance has been set up, we will begin the shipment process and provide you with all necessary documentation.

Best regards,
Jonas

2) Regarding the electronics deal, please consider accelerating the timeline. We've noticed American firms are increasingly looking to work with British firms to access their competitive tax rates. An earlier timeline would make us more attractive.

It’s a fast service, it takes about 14 days from loading in the US to discharging in Turkey. If you’re interested in shipping from Houston, it’s an 11 day trip to Antalya. All of these routes can be served from one of our 3 weekly services. For a monthly schedule, please visit our website.

We're having a hard time switching the delivery point. I've talked to the shipping line and their only solution is to send the shipment back to Bangkok so it can be shipped to the correct location. Unfortunately, the cost of this is very high, and I don't think it's a viable option for you.

Hello Owen,                    Our Australian customer wants to ship some powdered milk from Port Botany in Sydney to Tokyo. The contract says 2,500MT, but they might also require 1,500MT of grain. This order will leave in the first week of July. We need your help.                    How much would shipping 4,000MT of both goods together cost, and do you see any risk of port congestion?                    Many thanks,                    Ivy
Email 2:
Hi Ivy,
Good morning.

The order for 2,500MT should be easy to manage.
Regarding the order for 1,500MT of grain, unfortunately, we do not see any vessel available to fit both cargoes in the same vessel. As we are still in June, there are still some free slots available on July, but as the order size is so big, we have limited choices.
That being said, we can manage to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain in the same vessel with the owner of a 10,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge the previous cargo in July. All details about the vessel are as follows:

M/V T1
Type    General Cargo
Flag    Liberia
Call    MOYO
Deadweight    8,600MT
Built    1996
Hold No
Email 3:
Regarding the risk of port congestion in Australia, I'm afraid the situation is getting worse and that it may be difficult to find a slot for such a big order. Also, the railway terminals are overloaded as well.
I know the situation seems very bad. I can only offer you the best available. If you are willing to wait till October, I can offer you a better slot with more space. This way, you will be able to fit more products, or reduce the price.
What do you think?
Email 4:
Thank you for your help. The information you provided is very useful to us. 
We want to ship the 4,000MT cargo in early July. We do not have enough storage capacity, so if we delay the delivery, it may lead to the depreciation of our goods, so I'm afraid we can only choose the original plan.
Also, we will have more orders to deliver in July. Can you please help us?
Waiting for your reply!

Ivy

Hi Ivy,

I understand that you have to deliver the order at the earliest opportunity, and that you can't wait till October. I'll look for a slot in September for you.

Please find attached a quotation for 3,000MT and 4,000MT. We can ship 1,000MT in July and 2,000MT or 3,000MT in August. I can fit 2,000MT on a 6,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September and 3,000MT on a 6,500dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September as well.

Do you have a choice of milk powder or grain as the cargo to be shipped in August?

Hello, George
I have received your e-mail. Thanks for asking us for this enquiry.
This is my first reply to you.

First of all, can you give me the type of coal you plan to ship (NSC, ARA, etc.) and also the port of loading at Barry (BPT, UKCOAL, etc.)

The best way is to proceed with time charter.
Most of shipping companies are hard to find the right vessel because of a lack of high specification open cargo handlings. However, I can check and suggest you to you.
I will try to provide you the following details:
1. The vessel that is available in market
2. The cost estimate

Please feel free to contact me anytime and I will be delighted to be of assistance.
Thank you very much.

Hello George,
Thank you for your reply.

Currently, there is a lot of vessels available in the market. But most of them are low specification and the area of coverage can't fit with your requirement.
However, we may be able to find a vessel that suits your requirement.

If it is no problem, can you give me the delivery port of discharge (namely, the name of the country of discharge).

And also, can you specify the size of the vessel you are looking for?

My barge can't lift 3,400 mt of coal. My barge can only carry 1,400 mt.
For freight rate we have three rate contracts, these are for 6 months and 3 months and 1 month. So no fixed rate and no bunker escalation clause.

I have a requirement to ship 3,400 mt of coal from Kuantan to Johor on June 7. Can you quote me? I have done some internet research and this type of cargo is usually shipped from Kuantan to Port Klang.

Dear Ms. Ghosh,                    My group is sourcing 25,000MT of rubber from Shanghai to Salem. We can be very flexible on loading, but need to know your thoughts on two possible shipping methods:                    1. 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. How much extra would be this compared to a typical voyage at your current market price?                    2. 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev. Is there any discount available if we book these voyages for 2016 as well?                    Sincerely,                    Sarah

Dear Sarah,                        Glad to get your inquiry. Actually, I have just sent an email regarding the new liner service through Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode to VRS China. Let me know if you get that. I am not sure about the sea transport to India since I am not from that dept. But I would like to go for the FCL rate of Hoegh Autoliner as there is an attractive rate by these carriers.                    One of my friends of Taiwan is also very interested in this carrier. She will go for 10/20 cbm containers. But they were waiting for the government’s final approval. Anyway, please wait for our China dept’s advice.                    Any other queries please contact me at any time.                    Have a nice day!                    Yours faithfully,                    Rita Lee

Subject: 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode?
Rita,   I got your message about Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. Thank you for the offer! Do you have any indication on the timing of the service? In addition, do you think I should consider 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev as well? I did not include those carriers in the original email because my thinking was that they are more suitable for 2016. Still, the volumes will be the same for both years. Sarah


In this email exchange, Sarah was mainly interested in the future developments of Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. She also mentioned that she wanted to discuss an alternative carrier, Golden Highway and Damleev.

I just looked up prices for ethanol in Houston from Singapore, Brazil, and Egypt. They are all pretty much the same - only a 3 USD difference. In July, Brazil was cheaper, but now in August, Egypt is slightly cheaper, though that could change quickly.

I'm going to go with the MT readings as shown and work with a delivered price of 1 USD from Maceió. I need this information to estimate the gas requirements for profitability.

Thank you for all your help. You are a great addition to the company.

Hi Jeremy,                   Thank you for the detailed information. The Port of Elizabeth is basically a bit “rustic”. Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h. We can also do up to 2,000 mt/h if the coal can be delivered to the berth quickly and easily.

Be advised that in March, the water in the port will be very low. Because of","From: jorge.rodriguez@trading.com

8,000MT to Turkey isn't possible right now, but we do have space for 15,000MT to Taiwan. The freight rate would be around $10.50/MT, definitely not going above $11.

I've discovered that the Turkey and Taiwan customers are actually the same company's offices. There's a 10,000MT limit per office. Could we split the shipment between the two locations? Also, is there any flexibility on the freight rate to help us make a better offer?

Let's focus on Taiwan for now. The buyer there can actually only take 6,000MT. Would this smaller quantity help us get a better rate? Also, our shipper needs to know the specific port in Taiwan.

I have some clarifying questions about your slot availability. My understanding is the following:

1) Your vessel can load 2500MT of general cargo, including the 3004 cargo
2) Your vessel can make an East Coast USA call
3) Your vessel has laytime, i.e. 3 days of port time to load 2500MT

Am I correct?

Dear Ms. Bennett,                    As a stevedore, you have access to ample cranes and loading equipment, but most shipping companies prefer to hire their own personnel for discharge. For example, we have a reputation for working fast at berthing and cargo operations, ensuring both your berthing rights and a successful shipment.                    What’s your experience with crane capacity at your ports, and can you give an estimate on service time for ships 2,600 meters and 6,500m³ cargo capacity?

From: Edward Subject: Length and Capacity Date: Friday, October 14, 2022 at 10:59 AM To: Ms. Bennett Dear Ms. Bennett,                    Thanks for your reply. It looks like neither your terminal nor mine has cranes strong enough to handle such large ships. But we do have a lot of common interests with the island of Grande Comore. For example, we can both benefit from using a reputable port with quality equipment and speedy service, as well as avoiding overloading.                    The solution is to find a company that can efficiently load the cargo. Most shipping companies prefer to hire their own personnel for discharge because their ships require a high level of attention. The only problem is that many stevedoring companies are not experienced in unloading large ships. And that’s why we need your help.

Hi Edward,
What about using a multi-purpose dock, such as Port Natal?
They have the most advanced docking equipment and their crews are very experienced.
They are also one of the fastest ports in the world and have an average unloading time of 15 minutes per ship.
The other option is to go for the third-party port.
I know a company called “Aloha Stevedoring” who can handle your requirements.
It is the best port in the world, with the best ships and docks.
All the best,

I have been discussing this matter with a friend who lives near our terminal.
They have just opened a new terminal that can handle 2,600 meters and 6,500m³ cargo capacity.
They are looking to expand, so they are trying to get some quality help.
I think they would be interested in doing some work for you.
The only problem is that their terminal is in the Philippines.

We are interested in the second shipment of cotton under 50-ton container in direct sail from Santa Cruz to Newark. Will the new Charter Party apply the New Panama Canal toll?

Where can I find this 'new Charter Party' you mention? I have the latest canal treaty with me, but it says nothing about a new C/P. Can you please clarify?

Body: Sam,

Please refer to the canal toll agreement here:
http://www.panamaxmaritime.com/AG/Panama%20Canal%20Tolls%20Agreement.pdf

The addendum discusses toll rates for container vessels. As per the Neutrality Treaty, the Panama Canal should operate equitably for all merchant vessels. The tolls should be consistent with established rates.

Best,
Ian

Body: Ian,

I suspect we will need to hire a cargo lawyer. We should challenge this on grounds of discrimination. We could seek a legal opinion from the Secretary of State for Transport, or alternatively engage a private firm to challenge the canal authorities directly.

At minimum, we need clarification on their 'adjusted and equitable tolls' arrangement. However, I should mention that our principals are generally reluctant to engage in legal proceedings.

The total capacity required is 36,000 metric tonnes of glycol from Mexico to Luanda in Angola.                    Any suitable vessels?                    Best regards,                    your name
Email 2:
Yesterday you were looking for suitable vessels for 36,000 metric tonnes of glycol from Mexico to Luanda in Angola.                    I have a ship available.           36,000 MT = 36,000 ton x 1,000 kg/ton = 36,000,000 kg = 3,600 m3 at a density of 1 ton/m3                    The ship can carry 5,500,000 litres.                    5,500,000 litres x 1 m3/1,000 litres = 5,500 m3                    Let me know if this is suitable.                    The shipment costs US$100,000 (can be deducted from the commission that you pay to me)                   36,000 MT = 36,000 ton x 1,000 kg/ton = 36,000,000 kg = 3,600 m3
Email 3:
The price per litre is $10, so 5,500 m3 of ethanol is worth US$55,000.
The net profit for the shippers is US$55,000 - US$100,000 = US$55,000.
Let me know how you feel about this arrangement. 
Best regards,
Email 4:
If this offer from the shippers is accepted, I will issue a commission invoice to you (as agent) as follows:
100% net profit is $55,000
Commission is 5% of net profit is $2,750
The balance of $52,250 is to be deposited by you (the client) in my bank account and you will then get the balance of $100,000 less commission.
Please send a signed copy of the attached contract.  I will provide a copy for you to sign.
If you have any queries about this arrangement, please get back to me.
Email 5:
Thank you.  The contract has been signed and returned.
Please open an account for me (in the same bank as the shippers), and I will be happy to deposit the balance of $52,250 and receive the commission of $2,750.
Please send me the bank account details and I will open an account immediately.
Best regards,
