Please note the following:\n\n- Typical waiting time for berth is 2-4 days\n- No guaranteed transit time to discharge\n- Berth queue is unpredictable as vessels can arrive without prior notice\n- Terminal operates up to 2 berths simultaneously\n- Berthing priority is assigned by the Terminal based on vessel readiness\n- Reserved berth slots may be reassigned if vessel arrival is delayed due to congestion\n\nI recommend factoring these conditions into your laytime calculations.\n\nBest regards,\nSarah Morris"

Unfortunately, its ship-to-ship transfer hoses were damaged in a recent collision and the ship's owner does not wish to risk using a new or used set of hoses that might fail again. Instead they have ordered a new set of hoses which will take a couple of weeks to deliver and install.\n\nPlease let me know if there is any alternative means that we can use to load the cargo and I'll try to make the necessary arrangements to comply with your request.\n\nRegards,\nSimon"

Seablue is a crude vessel and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers coming out of Chinese yards.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not come out in China, other tankers would come out of the dock and China would be fixed. These tankers would operate at a price level set by the most competitive time charter tanker which is the drydocked Seablue, and therefore the price level at which China is fixed would not be different even if Seablue was out of the drydock.\n\nLPG cargoes are different since we cannot use LPG in the crude tankers, and crude cargoes are not as easy to fix as LPG, since many producers are contracted and certain prices are set.\n\nRegards,\nKathy"

This provides a stable supply and demand, eliminates inventory storage costs and prevents oil from degrading over time.\n\nSince your request involves shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days, my freight quote estimate would exceed what is available.\n\nPlease confirm that your request is for 25,000 tons of oil in a seven-day freight and I can provide a quote to the maximum that is available to my company.\n\nThanks,\nPerry"

If you are shipping this amount of oil in an outbound tanker, then the only companies capable of doing so are Shell, Chevron and Exxon. I don't have contacts with these companies.\n\nIf you're shipping by sea, then you'll need a port in Copenhagen to load onto a tanker. I've emailed my contacts in the seaport of Copenhagen. They'll be in touch with me in the morning.\n\nIf you're shipping by road, then the quantity would need to be in 45 liter plastic oil drums. The storage space and legal limitations of this option would be impossible to organize in such a short time frame.\n\nI'm sorry, but I simply don't have the resources to fill your request. I recommend you submit your request to one of the three large oil companies I mentioned before.\n\nRegards,\nPerry"

We don't have traditional refrigeration in our vessel holds, but we do have specialized rooms for bulk goods packaging.\n\nWe could accommodate the PKE in these rooms, likely requiring one or two compartments. The loading rate would be 7-8t per hour, with a maximum weight limit of 1,500kg per unit.\n\nTo protect the PKE during loading, we've implemented special handling procedures. The product must be properly sealed after loading, and we recommend specific sealing materials for this purpose. We can provide samples if needed.\n\nBest regards,\nJames"

However, our parent company has experience with 100,000mt+ shipments for major trading companies in recent years, so this is feasible.\n\nThe timeframe is typically negotiable between supplier and buyer. We normally provide shipping documents within 10-12 days of shipment, with payment terms of cash within 4 weeks. Bank documentary charges should be settled within 2 weeks of shipment.\n\nHowever, finding a supplier capable of delivering 200,000mt at once would be challenging.

The vessel's Pakistani captain is low on funds and has accepted a cargo transport job from our port to Pakistan to generate immediate income. As a freelancer, he's willing to take on this job with advance payment.\n\n2. The captain is requesting $30,000 upfront for this voyage. We need to take out a bank loan for this amount. Unfortunately, due to our financial situation, I must sell my share of the ship to cover the loan. I'm currently at the bank finalizing arrangements where they will take your share of the vessel as collateral against the loan.\n\nRegards,\nSada"
