I'm considering an investment in the container shipping industry and would appreciate your thoughts. Do you think a large container ship will be built in China? Additionally, would it be better to own a small container ship outright or to have a partial interest in a large container vessel?

Thank you,

Since my last email, I've been studying a comprehensive book on the container shipping business and have developed some additional insights.

The shipping market is currently very strong, and I believe the container shipping industry will continue to grow. After analyzing the options, I'm leaning towards a specific conclusion: it appears more advantageous to own a small container ship outright rather than holding a partial interest in a large vessel.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this assessment.

Mr. Silver,
Thank you for your reply. We have already loaded on a vessel and made the transportation contract. However, the transportation company asks for the following documents: a set of bills of lading, a certificate of insurance and a set of commercial invoices. I would appreciate your advice.
Yours sincerely,
Tom

The problem of Cargo Document is tricky because it involves the dispute on whether the transportation company should be considered as the agent of the seller.

Business background:
The first email shows that the buyers have agreed on an acceptance to offer (letter of acceptance, cf. § 1384, Italian Code of Commercial law (Codice Commerciale)) and made a transportation contract for the 500 ton cargo of corn with a third party. As for the Seller, the second email shows that the Seller still thinks that the transportation company is his agent and the Buyers are not

Dear Gordon,
Silver Shipping, Inc. is currently arranging the shipping for you. It will be more convenient if you could tell us the name of the third party or the transportation company to deal with the shipping contract. We are looking forward to getting your email. Thank you very much.
Yours sincerely,
Michael Silver, President Silver Shipping, Inc.
</Email 3>

The main issue:
For the transaction to be a sale with CIF clause, at the moment of conclusion of the contract of sale, the Seller and the Buyers have to agree on the destination port and the Seller have to insure the goods for the Buyers. If the Buyers do not have a transportation contract, the Seller must comply with this CIF clause to fulfill the contract. Otherwise, the Seller should not promise the contract with the Buyers at all, which is the same as Article 6 § 1 (c) of the ICC
Email 4:
Gordon,
Mr. Silver would like to know where you have got the buyers of the corn. We have already got buyers but you asked for the freight and insurance costs. We do not understand why. As we agreed, you are responsible for the sale, insurance and transportation of the corn. We expect to see a written transportation contract from you within the next 3 days. Please forward to Mr. Silver a copy of the transportation contract.
Yours sincerely,
Bill
</Email 4>
The point is that the Seller has not decided what destination port the Buyers are going to choose yet. It seems that the Sellers have fulfilled all the CIF obligations in this case. Thus, it is unnecessary to involve any transportation company. If there is no such transportation company that the Seller and the Buyers both use, the contract of sale cannot be considered as a CIF contract. Therefore, the Sellers should not","From: buyer@trading.com

Email 2:
Hi Blayney,                    Not at all.                    Seablue is a crude vessel and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers coming out of  Chinese yards.
As I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not come out in China, other tankers would come out of the dock and China would be fixed.                    These tankers would operate at a price level set by the most competitive time charter tanker which is the drydocked Seablue and therefore the price level at which China is fixed would not be different even if Seablue was out of the drydock.
LPG cargoes are different since we can not use LPG in the crude tankers and crude cargoes are not as easy to fix as LPG, since many producers are contracted and certain prices are set.

The 'Coastline' is currently berthed at Kakinada on Indian coast and I expect to receive her draft survey report around the 25th. Her charterers are currently assessing the bunkers required for Singapore, however, we may be able to depart for Singapore as early as 26th March.

Regarding ballast conditions, you could also consider 'Coastline's' current charterers (i.e. 'Sambalino' of the same owners) as they will be arriving from a short haul fixture and may be able to proceed immediately to the loading port in ballast. Alternatively, you may proceed ballast and obtain fuel in advance of loading.

Please let me know if you require any additional information.

After investigating 82 oil container rates in Balikpapan from February to May 2016, Emma wrote email 1 to request advice on market rates for the 22nd to 23rd of the month. When the suggested rate was below market rate, she accepted the offer via email 2.

Thanks for getting in touch. Yes, we'd be interested in 2,500mt of scrap metal. Our usual suppliers are in Malaysia but you're in the same port and the scrap is going to the same destination so that's good news.

How soon can the cargo be delivered to us?

We need a bit more information to give you an accurate quote. Do you have the total quantity of each grade and length of scrap, or are you able to send us a sample?

I am prepared to wire you $100,000 towards the transaction on condition that you forward the other$300,000 (and the ship documents) within 10 days of receiving this deposit. I understand that this is a small amount relative to the transaction, but I am sending you this deposit on the condition that it will be returned within 14 days if you are not able to complete the transaction.

We only have one vessel in the Gulf that could arrive in Mumbai within your timeframes. It will be in Lasbela (Mub) on 11th July, and can be ready to load on the 13th or 14th July. It is available until 17th July. As it's currently chartered, the berth time will be 10 days at a minimum. The vessel is currently loading cargo in Tamil Nadu due to arrive in Mumbai on July 11th.

Thank you for your interest. I have since received an enquiry for a different cargo type that the ship could load in Mumbai, so I'm going to offer it to the client in that case. Unfortunately, that means it's not available to you.

But please let me know if you are still interested in a ship that could load there, and I will be able to let you know whether the ship is free or not.

We can deliver your import cargo under EXW terms. While our suppliers can sell our product under CIF terms, our cargo is already loaded, and I believe our transportation cost under CIF may be higher than ex-works.

Regarding the B/L copy before arrival, could you confirm if this will be acceptable?

As for other documentation, we are not sure how to fill it in, as we only supply high technology components, and your export will be the final user.

Many thanks for your kind assistance.

Problem

A recent widespread email spam campaign targeted the energy and commodities trading industry with messages claiming that their customers wanted to use their services to buy crude oil and related products from reputable traders in the market. Some traders were approached in a very business-like manner, allegedly by major oil firms. The email subject line would indicate that the email was from a trusted business partner, such as a large energy firm or similar corporate client.

The email requests are easy to read but hard to understand. A foreign sounding person claiming to be an executive from a respectable company in a similar industry wants to “spot” some “margin fee” – what? An explanation for what these terms mean may have come attached

They represent a major Japanese refiner, Osaka Gas.

When a business receives a large unsolicited order they often feel obligated to make the sale.

As the requests are unsolicited and we have not received any communication with our buyer in the past, it would be a good idea to contact them directly to confirm their intent. We could ask the buyer for more information and maybe arrange to speak with the buyer directly. When speaking with the buyer, it would be important to ask them to provide more information about the deal. The buyer may have a reasonable explanation for their request. However, it is important to keep in mind that a reasonable explanation does not necessarily mean the request is legitimate.

So she already appreciated the role of Reza’s proposing concrete example as shown in the second email above.

For general reference, a LSA is a LOI (letter of intent) document.

Introduction

The use of “Email 1” as an example is taken from a popular LinkedIn post of Sam Nara on the subject of using a working example when making a proposal (source: Linkedin).

I have learned a lot from Sam’s post, and I think the post helps provide an excellent practical starting point. In this post, I will provide further explanations to highlight more subtle points not included in Sam’s original post, and also discuss how these points are implemented in our Lean Email.

Email 1 is a typical email. Its objective is to propose a working example to a recipient.

Thank you so much!
<...>
I do need your help here to review and submit the revised LSA to admin for approvals!

In this example, Rosalind first thanked Reza for sending her a revised LSA, then reminded Reza that she required his help to proceed with the transaction.

Based on this email, Reza needs to do two things to support Rosalind in closing this transaction:

• Review the LSA before submitting the LSA to Rosalind’s admin for approvals.
• Submit the LSA to Rosalind’s admin for approvals.

Reza can do these two tasks simply by using Lean Email by clicking the buttons as shown below. Clicking on the Review button will pop-up a Review/Submit page, which contains a Review tab, and a Submit tab.

We have the timing set for this item at the customer. The timeline could slip a little if we have to adjust.                    -Jonathan

Ms. Armitage                    Hi Sally,                In reference to your email, we may consider to organize a chartered out of Singapore with loading to be completed by around 20 to 22 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec. For your reference, I have attached the chartered info and telex release copy.                If you are interested, I will keep you posted when we have further update.

# Word Problem

### Solution 1

From the email the relevant facts are:

• The farmer wants to charter a ship to transport 15000 mt of rice to Jakarta.
• According to Ms. Armitage, the loading can be completed by around 20–22 November with delivery ETA around 10–12 December.

We know the ship will depart Singapore to Jakarta but
Email 3:
Hi Sally,                There will be another chartered starting from Singapore to Jakarta, departing on 18 Nov.                If you are interested, please advise latest by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony

</Email 3>

The sender mentions in Email 3 that the ship will leave Singapore to Jakarta on 18 November. That means there will be a time difference between 18 November and 20 November. So this information is not consistent with the information given in Email 2, which is the main source of information.

One reason for inconsistency could be the mistake in Email 2, when Ms. Armitage wrote 22 November instead of 20 November. Or one may assume that when Ms. Armitage sent Email 2, she didn't know about the departure date on 18 November.

Let us consider the following situation:
Email 4:
Hi Sally,                There will be a chartered departing on 18 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec.                Please advise if you are interested by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony

</Email 4>

In Email 4, we assumed that Ms. Armitage may have made a mistake in Email 2, and corrected it in Email 4. So let us analyze this situation.

Assume the ship leaves Singapore on 18 November and arrives at Jakarta on 10 December. This means the ship will take 22 days to reach Jakarta.

So, if loading is completed on 20 November, it will take a minimum of 2 days to complete the loading. It may take longer.

• So the loading will take place between 18 and 20 November.

                    1. The transit time would be approx. 4 weeks. We normally handle bulk containers (20 feet and 40 feet) but we can try with other vessels if you want.

Subject: Re: Rice Shipment to Matadi - Berth Congestion Query
Timestamp: 2024-02-15 11:45
Body: Dear Robert,

Matadi is currently experiencing high congestion levels. Please note the following:

- Typical waiting time for berth is 2-4 days
- No guaranteed transit time to discharge
- Berth queue is unpredictable as vessels can arrive without prior notice
- Terminal operates up to 2 berths simultaneously
- Berthing priority is assigned by the Terminal based on vessel readiness
- Reserved berth slots may be reassigned if vessel arrival is delayed due to congestion

I recommend factoring these conditions into your laytime calculations.

Best regards,
Sarah Morris

Timestamp: 2024-02-01 10:30
Body: Dear Felipe,

25,000 tons of oil from Copenhagen to Lagos in a seven-day freight? That's quite a bit of oil. I assume you need to ship it by sea.

You see, the oil trade operates on a just-in-time inventory management model, whereby oil is shipped to tankers as needed. This provides a stable supply and demand, eliminates inventory storage costs and prevents oil from degrading over time.

Since your request involves shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days, my freight quote estimate would exceed what is available.

Please confirm that your request is for 25,000 tons of oil in a seven-day freight and I can provide a quote to the maximum that is available to my company.

Thanks,
Perry

Timestamp: 2024-02-01 14:20
Body: Dear Felipe,

Again, shipping 25,000 tons in seven days is an unusual request. If you are shipping this amount of oil in an outbound tanker, then the only companies capable of doing so are Shell, Chevron and Exxon. I don't have contacts with these companies.

If you're shipping by sea, then you'll need a port in Copenhagen to load onto a tanker. I've emailed my contacts in the seaport of Copenhagen. They'll be in touch with me in the morning.

If you're shipping by road, then the quantity would need to be in 45 liter plastic oil drums. The storage space and legal limitations of this option would be impossible to organize in such a short time frame.

I'm sorry, but I simply don't have the resources to fill your request. I recommend you submit your request to one of the three large oil companies I mentioned before.

Regards,
Perry

This product is delivered to customers on barges, so the best method of loading will be to barge the urea to your vessel.                    I am available on phone at the number below.

For starters, if you're using Angular 2, you'll want to import FormsModule.

Next, you'll need to add FormsModule to the imports array in the @NgModule declaration.

        Our liners operate out of Virginia, Houston and Long Beach, and to Istanbul, İzmir, Kütahya, and Antalya. We also have a weekly direct service to İzmir from Savannah. It’s a fast service, it takes about 14 days from loading in the US to discharging in Turkey. If you’re interested in shipping from Houston, it’s an 11 day trip to Antalya. All of these routes can be served from one of our 3 weekly services. For a monthly schedule, please visit our website. We don’t accept individual bookings, so you would need to find a freight forwarder or consolidator to place your booking.

Hi!

Thank you for your message. The equation n=1-sqrt(1-f)/2 is a very general one. It can be found in most books on electromagnetism and optics.

For example in a book by Jain.

Hi Wim.

Thanks for your reply. I found that references and have already read them but I was looking for a clearer derivation that shows how the refractive index in that form, d*n/d, gets related to the frequency, lambda, and amplitude of the refractive index.

Thanks.

I am not sure that there is a clear derivation that you are looking for. You can find it in some other books, but I doubt that you will be very happy with it, since the derivation would be so clear.

I would be very happy if someone from the audience of this website can help you by giving a clear derivation of f2=1-2n.

Yes, I’m coming to your house to learn. But, it’s raining. My parents and my brother, Arian, can’t come. We’re waiting for a better day.

It’s a big problem.
It’s about rain.
Thank you.
Yours,

Good afternoon. Glad to hear from you. Hope you are doing fine. Thank you so much for the great video. There is no doubt it is very helpful for us. 
One question I have is when I sent a message by email, can I use ""This is"" to introduce myself? I saw a very interesting movie at the cinema. It is about a cat with a magic ability. What do you think about it? The movie is really enjoyable.
Thanks a lot.

 Hello Kevin, Thank you so much for sending us a lovely song. Your friend Kevin is a great singer. Your English is really good, too. I'm happy you wrote to us. You can use ""This is"" to introduce your message. You can say something like ""This is a song my friend Kevin sings."" ""This is an email I sent my friend Kelly last week."" You can ask a question and talk about a movie like this: ""How was the movie about the cat with a magic ability? It sounds interesting."" Or you can say, ""I'm glad you liked the movie about the cat with a magic ability."" I hope you have a great day. Be well! Olivia and the Yip sisters.

Dear Mr. McGroarty,
Thank you for your email. Please be advised that we have no objections to the list you provided to us. However, the list in question has not been previously reviewed by the Board of Directors of ABC and therefore we are unable to provide you with any information regarding the specific assets. It is our understanding that our list does not conform to the requirements of the Sale Agreement, particularly since the list reflects that we are permitted to retain certain files and information despite the fact that we are prohibited from using or retaining any ABC Confidential Information, as set out in the Sale Agreement. This is a concern to our Board of Directors.

Hi Christa,                    That is no doubt true. Steam ships are extremely dangerous for the containers, even the newest containers.

Our provider M&N has quoted us 16.74 USD/MT to ship jet fuel from Kaohsiung to Daesan via m/v. Could you please review if this rate is acceptable?

Thank you,

Body: David,

We need to consider that the bunker price being charged to shipowners is higher than our selling price for VETSA trades, where our agent covers all bunker costs.

Additionally, please note that the vessel will be delivering product from Daesan to India before loading jet fuel to Daesan.

Therefore, the rate will be 16.74 USD/MT including bunker for VETSA trades.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards,
Eddie

Body: Eddie,

I understand we need to estimate bunker consumption at loading port (Daesan). However, most bunker will be consumed during the voyage from loading to discharge port, and we should only be responsible for bunker consumed from discharge port back to loading port.

Could you please clarify the final calculation based on this?

Regards,
David

Body: Dave,

I checked the surface tanker jet fuel route chart. The distance is only 275 miles, potentially 250 if cutting through the shallows. With the shallowest part at 43 feet, a 35,000 ton tanker would only need about 16' of water draft.

While vessel passage shouldn't be an issue, insurance premiums might be higher due to limited refueling options along the route. However, I'm not seeing any suitable tankers available at the moment.

Bob

Dear Mr. Walters,                    We have cargo for 12,000MT of urea from Pengerang to Las Palmas in September.                   BAF should be around $120/mt (based on old fix as BAF has changed dramatically), however if a GdW is used please be aware the vessel will likely be late when BAF is calculated. 
About this post:                   It’s useful to think about what someone needs to know (what information they need) and how you can present it to them (the style you can use).                    This helps you to produce emails that are both concise and comprehensive.                    It helps you to be consistent in your writing, and the person receiving your email will feel reassured by the consistency of style (if you can remember to use it!)

Dear Mrs. Walters, 
               We are still in contact with our vendors in Nanded and are anticipating a price at the end of next week for up to 20,000MT of various types of urea. As the quantities can change daily, we would like you to provide the last two digits of your credit card number. 
               I will call you later today to discuss this and to arrange for a flight to Mumbai. As you know, we need to be flexible on the types of urea and quantities, but please feel free to send a list of your requirements. We are anticipating that we may receive it in three or four shipments, so that may be something to consider. Please also provide us with a list of the vessels that you have available. 
               We are looking forward to seeing you.

Dear <MANUEL>,
I have good news and bad news. The good news is that I have the freight prices
for Miami to Aruba, and the bad news is that the prices are sky high.
I'll be happy to help with the planning of the move, but I'm afraid that there is
no way that you can make that transport by boat. Unless you want to take a
steamer to South America and leave your lumber there, I would suggest that you
wait until the next hurricane season, when you'll find the rate a little bit lower.
Good luck with the move.
Best wishes,
Paul

Could you confirm that the shipment will dock on Friday as scheduled?                    I also noticed that the boat made a U-turn and is now heading away from Vigo. Is the boat expected to arrive at Vigo later than 12pm on Friday?                    Would appreciate your reply!                    Thanks,                    Carrie

I'm looking for some help, and I was hoping you could point me in the right direction.

I work for OrthoComfort Manufacturing, and we've been getting a lot of complaints about our orthopedic shoes falling apart. It seems to happen whenever a patient uses our shoes to do a heavy activity, like basketball or soccer.

Our shoes are made with the same materials as the other brands that are out there, so I don't understand why our shoes would be falling apart faster. I'm wondering if there's something wrong with our manufacturing process, or if there's some other reason that our shoes would be breaking more easily.

Can you help me out?

Just a quick note to say thanks for the logistics of arranging the survey in Bimini. My colleague and I will have a flight to Bimini on Thursday and will be staying at the Grand Isle Bimini Bay Resort. We'll be ready to meet the vessel at the survey dock on Friday.

Body: Dear Enzo,

As promised, I have prepared a comprehensive analysis of the ORIFLAMM survey data, along with a list of repairs, ratings, and observations. You may review this document and advise us whether we should proceed to purchase the vessel or not.

There are a few issues with the vessel that are a cause for concern, however it should be possible to address these issues without significantly compromising vessel integrity.

The main concerns are a cracked main engine bearing housing and the state of some of the steering equipment. I recommend having these issues looked at by a professional marine surveyor.

Sincerely,
Stella

I got an offer from a contact regarding a commission business between Pakistan and Jeddah. They claim to have direct access to factory supplies for various commodities in Pakistan and can ship to Middle East countries. I need your advice on the safety aspects of running such a commission business with an unknown Pakistani supplier.

Do you think having a signed agreement with the seller would provide sufficient protection? They're offering fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy products.

Could you also connect me with any reliable contacts you might have in this trade?

Thank you,
Fardos

The person working with Mohammed is indeed professional. I can facilitate an introduction to their Pakistani contact so you can evaluate the opportunity yourself. They're primarily looking to import seasonal fresh produce from Pakistan to Jeddah, with peak operations from April to September. Given your experience in the meat business, you might find good opportunities there, as the market is substantial.

I'll send you more details via Facebook messenger, where you can find their contact in my friends list.

Regarding the fertilizer inquiry: I'll look into vessel availability for the 5,000MT DAP shipment from Karachi to Jeddah.

Hello Owen,                    Our Australian customer wants to ship some powdered milk from Port Botany in Sydney to Tokyo. The contract says 2,500MT, but they might also require 1,500MT of grain. This order will leave in the first week of July. We need your help.                    How much would shipping 4,000MT of both goods together cost, and do you see any risk of port congestion?                    Many thanks,                    Ivy

Hi Ivy,
Good morning.

The order for 2,500MT should be easy to manage.
Regarding the order for 1,500MT of grain, unfortunately, we do not see any vessel available to fit both cargoes in the same vessel. As we are still in June, there are still some free slots available on July, but as the order size is so big, we have limited choices.
That being said, we can manage to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain in the same vessel with the owner of a 10,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge the previous cargo in July. All details about the vessel are as follows:

M/V T1
Type    General Cargo
Flag    Liberia
Call    MOYO
Deadweight    8,600MT
Built    1996
Hold No
Email 3:
Regarding the risk of port congestion in Australia, I'm afraid the situation is getting worse and that it may be difficult to find a slot for such a big order. Also, the railway terminals are overloaded as well.
I know the situation seems very bad. I can only offer you the best available. If you are willing to wait till October, I can offer you a better slot with more space. This way, you will be able to fit more products, or reduce the price.
What do you think?
Email 4:
Thank you for your help. The information you provided is very useful to us. 
We want to ship the 4,000MT cargo in early July. We do not have enough storage capacity, so if we delay the delivery, it may lead to the depreciation of our goods, so I'm afraid we can only choose the original plan.
Also, we will have more orders to deliver in July. Can you please help us?
Waiting for your reply!
Regards,
Ivy
Best regards,
Martin
Email 5:
Hi Ivy,

I understand that you have to deliver the order at the earliest opportunity, and that you can't wait till October. I'll look for a slot in September for you.

Please find attached a quotation for 3,000MT and 4,000MT. We can ship 1,000MT in July and 2,000MT or 3,000MT in August. I can fit 2,000MT on a 6,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September and 3,000MT on a 6,500dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September as well.

Do you have a choice of milk powder or grain as the cargo to be shipped in August?
Thank you.

Unfortunately, the charter company is currently unable to provide immediate transport for your oil. Most tankers are engaged in existing contracts, leaving limited availability. I will work to get you a quote by the middle of next week.

For your reference, the distance between New York and London by water is approximately 4550 miles. At an average speed of 100 miles per day, the journey will take about 64 hours. Therefore, any arrival after 65 hours would incur the demurrage rate.

I'm just following up to see if there is any movement on ETA for MS Mangrovia, and an updated laycan window. I understand that there is a problem with a Cargotec crane in Busan, and wonder if it will affect your schedule for Mangrovia?

If not, I need the chartering activity date for this ship to proceed with FCL for the cargo and hire out charterer's agency.

Thanks for your help.

Thanks for your follow up.

I was told the laycan will be June 30th which is the same as MVB. The problem is at both ports but the previous schedule is for Ubon Ratchathani, Muang district Chiang Rai, and on July 10th Busan and Yangon with repositioning fees due to charterer. This vessel is sub chartered out to another charterer.

Thank you for your inquiry. We can accommodate a shipment of 3000MT, but I should mention that using a container vessel might not be the most cost-effective solution for waste transport. Would you be open to discussing alternative shipping options?

Best regards,
James

Before proceeding with a quote, we need some additional information:
- What type of waste material is being transported?
- Are there any hazardous materials involved?
- Can you confirm the final destination and intended disposal method?

Please note that we must ensure compliance with all relevant regulations.

The cargo will be transported to Lome. We will handle all necessary documentation and permits. We're looking at a laycan period from May 19 to May 23. Could you please provide the total cost for shipping 3000MT to Lome?

I must inform you that we cannot accommodate shipment to Lome. Our organization operates under specific humanitarian guidelines and is limited to certain European ports including Belgium, Austria, and Switzerland. Additionally, I'm becoming concerned about the nature of this shipment and must ensure all operations comply with international waste management regulations.

Email 3:
The main trick is to make this task look like it is for open charter. This makes the victim pay attention to the price, believing it is actually lower than the price of the chartered ship (by the way, let's make it 0.19$). By saying that you will pay 0.05$/MT for bunker, the victim thinks you are buying bunker, while you are actually renting the vessel.

    Also note that the shipping cost (0.19$) is given to the nearest part of the fourth decimal place, which might look suspicious if the sender and receiver have different countries. It is a very good trick to make such mistakes, as I did in email 2, or even in email 1 if the victim is inexperienced. It makes the victim think he is comparing two similar offers, which they are not, and look bad for not noticing it. Finally","From: caroline.smith@trading.com

If you have space for bitumen, this is a good email to reply to, but don’t offer any products you don’t have or you won’t have space for. Any mention of bitumen is a potential client.

Hello, George
I have received your e-mail. Thanks for asking us for this enquiry.
This is my first reply to you.

First of all, can you give me the type of coal you plan to ship (NSC, ARA, etc.) and also the port of loading at Barry (BPT, UKCOAL, etc.)

The best way is to proceed with time charter.
Most of shipping companies are hard to find the right vessel because of a lack of high specification open cargo handlings. However, I can check and suggest you to you.
I will try to provide you the following details:
1. The vessel that is available in market
2. The cost estimate

Please feel free to contact me anytime and I will be delighted to be of assistance.

The vessel Sun Dragon that we have arranged the charter for to deliver the parcel of oil that you requested has taken on the cargo at the Panama Canal. It is currently waiting for a berth at Port Qasim. Unfortunately, its ship-to-ship transfer hoses were damaged in a recent collision and the ship's owner does not wish to risk using a new or used set of hoses that might fail again. Instead they have ordered a new set of hoses which will take a couple of weeks to deliver and install.

Please let me know if there is any alternative means that we can use to load the cargo and I'll try to make the necessary arrangements to comply with your request.

Laycan wise this vessel is always flexible and will try to accommodate as much as possible. Berths are not usually allocated until 24-30hrs prior to arrival, more so during peak season.

Thanks for your quote. Some further information:                    The rice would be shipped over a number of months but we would like the price to be fixed for all of the months.                    Also, the port at the destination is likely to change, so we would need the FOB price to be from either Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang or Cai Mep ports (but not Vung Tau port).                    The dates are subject to change but we would probably want to start loading in September and the rice will be delivered over a number of months.

         Thanks for your email. Please fill in the following blanks and then return to me.
         What is your port name?
         _________________________
         How many m3 of crude oil will you send? 250 m3
         _________________________
         Where is your loading date? July 25th
         _________________________
         What is your discharge port? London
         _________________________
         If the ship is one hour late, how much do you have to pay?
         ______________________
Email 3:
I would like to know that the distance between New York and London by water is around 4550 miles. From your blanks, you will need about 64 hours to reach London if the ship moves 100 miles per day. In this case, we can conclude that if the ship arrives in 65 hours, it will be one hour late.
Regards,
Mark

Hi Ms. Vargas,                    I'm just following up to see if there is any movement on ETA for MS Mangrovia, and an updated laycan window.

Dear LETITIA,
Thanks for your follow up.

I was told the lay can will be June 30th which is the same as MVB. The problem is at both ports but the previous schedule is for Ubon Ratchathani, Muang district Chiang Rai, and on July 10th Busan and Yangon with repositioning fees due to charterer.  This vessel is sub chartered out to another charterer.
Yours sincerely,

This was flagged by email as it was coming from an unknown sender. User profile was inspected and found to be empty. It was sent through Rapid Mailer (Mandrill)

However, it did contain a tracking number to an item that the sender said had been sent from the USA, which has led to this email. So this would likely come from some sort of automated mailer.

The files appear to be some sort of ""GET mail spambot"" or maybe a B2B mailer system.

As requested, I am including a snapshot of our web portal as it appears today. It contains information about the markets in which Karen trades, and the freight rates for each trade. The portal also shows how certain factors, such as market volatility, can affect rates. Each sector displays a current snapshot of freight rates for each of the areas that Karen can trade, and a visual map indicating rate fluctuations. Also, freight rates appear in a moving graph which shows trends over the last 30 days. This is quite beneficial for traders who have to make decisions based on live market conditions. 

Another important function is the ship and route selector. When a ship trader selects a specific ship, the system shows in green or red the rates and savings for that specific ship on each route. This helps traders determine which ship and which route to select.

Finally, a major aspect of the technology is the asset manager,

Thank you very much for the quick response and information.
How do I understand this correctly? The screenshot shows the C/P from Damietta to Koper. The C/P for the voyage Damietta -> Koper is 3.25/3.70 points less compared to the CP for the same route from Rotterdam -> Damietta. This makes a total difference of 3.625 to 5.375 $/day (depending on the grade). Since the ship owner is not willing to fix the voyage for the entire laycan, but only until next week, I can't make any changes to the CP.

Hi Paula,

My barge can't lift 3,400 mt of coal. My barge can only carry 1,400 mt.
For freight rate we have three rate contracts, these are for 6 months and 3 months and 1 month. So no fixed rate and no bunker escalation clause.

Body: Dear Ms. Annabelle,

Thank you for your email. We have storage tanks and packing equipment available to accept your 5,000MT shipment of waste plastic film starting July 28. The lead time will be approximately four days for completing the tanking process.

We can handle the loading, stuffing, and lashing, while you will be responsible for fixing and sealing the hatch. Please confirm if the cargo will be using hatch cover or double-containerization so we can prepare accordingly.

Regarding the $2,500 rate for the last two shipments, we cannot accept this condition as terminal handling fees and port storage costs are included in the quoted price. We would need to discuss a rate adjustment.

Best regards,

10 tons of cargo were loaded yesterday, but we still have remaining cargo. Please note that our available forklifts can only lift a maximum of 10 tons at a time. We currently have limited space due to ongoing building works, which affects truck maneuverability around the storage tanks.

Please advise the final loading date required for our storage tanks. We expect the cargo to maintain good condition and hope the terminal waiting time won't affect your schedule.

I have talked to my customer and I was right: The secondary office is an independent operation. There is a limit of 10,000MT per office. We'll need to divide the shipment between the two offices. Can we split it? And can we lower the freight rate? This would help us get a better offer.

At the moment, our vessel is not ready for transport, and we’re afraid that it won’t be until the 10th of next month.  Of course, that will depend on how quickly repairs can be carried out.  Our most recent repairs were completed on the 1st of March.  Ms. Klein, my supervisor, says that we may be able to reschedule for the 12th of next month, but that you must let us know by the 7th of next month.
Yours truly, 
   Krishna

Dear Mr. Balasubramaniam,
Thank you for the speedy reply!  We’re hoping that repairs can be completed as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, we’re working with very tight deadlines and can’t afford to wait until March.

Subject: Fuel Oil Shipment Inquiry - MV Freedom
Timestamp: 2021-09-01 10:30
Body: Hello Adi,

My client is exploring booking for the September loading of a 15kt shipment of fuel oil from Antwerp to Dubai. We understand that you have a charter opportunity with the following vessel:

MV Freedom
Vessel Type: LPG-Tank
Load Port: Antwerp
Discharge Port: Dubai
Estimated Laycan: 20-Sep-21
Deadweight: 60000MT (Max)
Term: CFR
ETA: 10-Oct-21

The reefer holds space but the owner needs some time to make the offer on the weekly fixture rate. Can you follow up and let me know if it can still be arranged?

Many thanks,
Sophia

We can be very flexible on loading, but need to know your thoughts on two possible shipping methods:                    1. 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. How much extra would be this compared to a typical voyage at your current market price?                    2. 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev. Is there any discount available if we book these voyages for 2016 as well?                    Sincerely,                    Sarah

Dear Sarah,                        Glad to get your inquiry. Actually, I have just sent an email regarding the new liner service through Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode to VRS China. Let me know if you get that. I am not sure about the sea transport to India since I am not from that dept. But I would like to go for the FCL rate of Hoegh Autoliner as there is an attractive rate by these carriers.                    One of my friends of Taiwan is also very interested in this carrier. She will go for 10/20 cbm containers. But they were waiting for the government’s final approval. Anyway, please wait for our China dept’s advice.                    Any other queries please contact me at any time.                    Have a nice day!                    Yours faithfully,                    Rita Lee

Rita,   I got your message about Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. Thank you for the offer! Do you have any indication on the timing of the service? In addition, do you think I should consider 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev as well? I did not include those carriers in the original email because my thinking was that they are more suitable for 2016. Still, the volumes will be the same for both years. Sarah


In this email exchange, Sarah was mainly interested in the future developments of Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. She also mentioned that she wanted to discuss an alternative carrier, Golden Highway and Damleev.

Dear Roger,
                   Thank you for your email on March 22, 2006. I agree to your prices at USD 3.40/MT only.

Also we have another similar shipment at the same time with same rate as above to FRSA, Hook with FOB of May 29th 2006. Please advise.

Hi Ms. Li,                    We have a cargo of 6,000MT to be loaded in Malabo. It must be delivered in Cape Town by 11 May. Would your company be interested in tendering?                    Thanks,                    Kris

Answer 1:
Subject: RE: (RE: TENDER FOR 6000MT MALABO TO CAPE TOWN)                    The rate is okay with us, but there is a problem with the transit time. Could you check your ETA for my customer? We are willing to pay more, if it will arrive earlier. Thanks

Answer 2:
Dear Alice,                    Unfortunately, we are not sure if we can achieve the ETA. Our vessel has a good speed, but if it is ballast in Malabo, it will take at least 16 days. If the cargo is loaded in Malabo, it will have to wait for our ship","From: claudio.martinez@trading.com

Timestamp: 2024-02-14 08:15
Body: Dear Ms. Nakayama,

The tanker SP33 was scheduled to arrive this morning at 7am, but she could not berth because of the insufficient ship's hook capacity. As a result, she will have to stay at anchorage until the next high tide.

Could you make an exception and let her berth?

Thank you very much,

With regard to the SP33, as the berthing hook capacity is insufficient, I'm afraid we cannot accept her today. This is a safety requirement that we cannot waive.

Body: Hi John,

For email validation in Angular 2+, you'll need to:

1. Import FormsModule using: import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'
2. Add FormsModule to the imports array in your @NgModule declaration: imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule ]
3. Add [email] to your input tag

Let me know if you need any clarification.

Best,
Angular Support Team

I implemented the changes as suggested. The FormsModule integration was indeed quite straightforward. At the end of the day, it was more trivial than I expected.

Hi Seth,

Hi Andres, 

            I have some clarifying questions about your slot availability. My understanding is the following: 

            1) Your vessel can load 2500MT of general cargo, including the 3004 cargo 
            2) Your vessel can make an East Coast USA call 
            3) Your vessel has laytime, i.e. 3 days of port time to load 2500MT

            Am I correct?

Thank you for your email. While we have no objections to the list provided, it has not been previously reviewed by ABC's Board of Directors. The list appears to conflict with the Sale Agreement requirements, particularly regarding retention of files and ABC Confidential Information. Your proposal to place our assets in a depository pending return is inappropriate and contrary to the terms of the Sale Agreement, specifically Section 2.1(a).

If I remember correctly, that contract included only containers shipped by steam ship, but I now know that steam ships have been phased out in favor of modern container ships.

I've found some documentation from the 1970s that shows there was still a significant number of containers transported by steam ship, despite being a less economical transportation method.

That is no doubt true. However, steam ships proved extremely dangerous for the containers, even the newest ones. The vibrations produced by the steam engines, and the leaks from the boilers, caused significant damage to most containers in transit. This is precisely why modern container ships have completely replaced them.

Dear Mr. Boss,
I am a salesperson from Alibaba.com. I have a customer in your region interested in shipping items to China.
They are in a bit of a rush, so the expected delivery date is around the middle of May.
They need to move 20 containers and would like a direct shipper on a week's notice to a week after.
The majority of the cargo is in large pieces, so it must be shipped in 40' HQ containers.
The weight is about 21kg each.
The HS Codes are 701814, 950210, 4811.
Please advise when you can offer us the capacity.
Looking forward to hearing from you,","From: regina.martinez@trading.com

Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama of 1926, the Panama Canal has been operated as an interoceanic highway in a manner which has been equitable and impartial to all the merchant vessels of all nations, and in a manner consistent with the operation of other interoceanic waterways. The tolls for the use of the waterway have been established in the Treaty at rates which

would be consistent with the tolls charged to vessels

I suspect we will have to hire a cargo lawyer. I think you should make the accusation of discrimination then. See if the Secretary of State for Transport will provide a legal opinion. Or failing that then get a private firm to challenge the 'owners' of the canal in their own backyard.  With a guaranteed doubling of the revenue they should have no interest in the details.
As a minimum get them to explain the 'adjusted and equitable tolls' arrangement.

Hi David,                    Let’s assume our 4,500MT fixture from Hamburg to Aarhus has settled for a free-out rate of $300/MT. So is that an all-in rate?                    Regards,                    Robert

My position is clear – to hire the vessel owner is an all-in rate of $300/MT and it is all in. If we agree to hire the vessel owner at a lower rate, the vessel owner has no interest in paying an all-in rate of $300/MT and will in no way agree to that.

In any dialogue it is important to state facts and not omit or conceal important information. This gives room for miscommunication as well as mistrust between the two sides. That’s why it is important to understand how to communicate professionally in business correspondence.

## What is Business Correspondence?

A message sent and received via a written form is known as a business correspondence. It is crucial as it provides information on the various activities of an organization. There are several forms of business correspondence. They include formal business letters, e-mails, and memos.

The letter types might be used to communicate with customers, clients, or employees. Some examples of business correspondence include application letters

FYI: The price of FERT today is 2875/2845 with the last done deal at 2870 for 6000mt x 4mth fixed delivered to Tubarao.

Recent market activity:
- 2865 for 6000mt (Oct 5)

- 2850 for 6000mt (Oct 10)

As these deals were made well in time, we believe the market is on the rise. We would like to confirm our offer at 2770.

In reference to our email regarding your offer of 2770:

You confirmed to us that your sales team confirmed the deals in place were between 2845 to 2870 for the 1st of November delivery. Yet you are demanding we confirm your offer of 2770.

I am not sure why this is so, but it is clear the market price is closer to 2870. At this point, we would rather make our arrangements for 1st of Nov delivery when we know the market has risen, rather than when it is sitting at its low.

Please advise what exactly you expect from us.

Mr. Santos,                    It’s becoming increasingly difficult to organize vessel space on the Senegal to Cameroon route. Could you send your current schedule in PDF format, and include your rates for moving 2,500MT of bauxite ore?                    I’ll forward this request to my colleague as well, and we’ll call you after the weekend.                    Best regards,                    Hameedah

It's been 6 years since we saw each other. Are you still in Hong Kong? I am now a captain in the army. I can't believe how fast the time has gone by.

I was glad to get your email. Yes, I am still in Hong Kong, but I will be moving to Beijing soon. Please don't worry. I am very well, and I hope you are as well. Now you can tell me about your life. Where are you stationed? And where are your wife and children? How old are they?

I am glad that you are still doing well. My family is fine. My children are getting bigger. My oldest is almost 6 years old, and my youngest is 4. I will have to wait a little longer until I can send you pictures of them. I am stationed near Guangzhou. My wife and I don't see each other very often, so I guess you could say that we are basically divorced.

Take care,
Jun

I know you are very busy but I need to know the port arrival time for June shipment. Could you let me know it for me please? We also need to know how much demurrage will be at Tejing port?

[Response] Thanks for reaching out, I’m happy to help. Your container should arrive on the 29th of June, the demurrage is $500 per day. As for what time, it depends when your truck arrives at the port and the port’s efficiency. As the summer is very hot in China, the best time is around 10-11am. Let me know if you need anything else!

Hi Jeremy,                   Thank you for the detailed information. The Port of Elizabeth is basically a bit “rustic”. Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h. We can also do up to 2,000 mt/h if the coal can be delivered to the berth quickly and easily.

Be advised that in March, the water in the port will be very low. Because of","From: james.ford@shiptrade.com

Body: Mr. Sood,

We're moving a shipment of 30,000MT of iron ore fines from Richards Bay to Pipavav. Given the current coal prices in Pipavav, we've identified a good opportunity for a vessel with 20,000MT of cargo that's under charter and heading to Cochin. Do you think this opportunity is worthwhile?

Would love to hear your thoughts on this!

Best,
Nupur

Subject: Vessel Inquiry - Iron Ore Transport Dampier to Yuan Island
Timestamp: 2011-08-05 09:30
Body: Dear Ms. Chen,

We have urgent need for a vessel, 50,000dwt size, with good dry-bulk and/or ore carrier experience for transportation of between 20,000 and 25,000 MT of iron ore from Dampier to Yuan Island.

Please confirm your vessel's availability, draft and size, and also availability of existing ballast water. When can you have your vessel at sea, and does it accept 'dumping' of cargo in the event of strike?

We would be most grateful if you could provide a detailed specification of your vessel, including crew, safety records, and insurance policy information, by 7th August.

We will contact you regarding further details after this date.

Yours faithfully,
Richard Vernon

Body: Dear Mr. Vernon,

Thank you for your enquiry.

We are pleased to inform you that we have an 87,000dwt ocean-going ore carrier on our register. The vessel is 12 years old and has passed rigorous safety inspections. She has been chartered to an oil company for the past 3 months and is now available from 15th August.

In the event of a strike, the vessel has the capability of 'dumping' her cargo.

We would be most grateful if you would advise the load port, discharge port, estimated cargo quantity, loading time, and estimated number of loading/discharging crew.

Yours faithfully,
Jin Chen

Thank you for your swift reply.

With your permission, I enclose an outline of the proposed charter, which covers the period 10th September to 31st October 2011. In addition, I enclose a Letter of Inquiry, which we have requested from Dampier Iron Ore and from Port Walling.

I would be grateful if you would check these and advise on any corrections that you require.

Yours faithfully,

Body: Dear Richard,

I have reviewed your letter, and I confirm that our vessel will be ready at sea by 15th August, so your preferred dates are acceptable.

With regard to the charter, the only changes that I require are the amounts and unit prices for port, light, and insurance; and the percentage of each these that are to be deducted from the charter.

I trust that these amendments will be acceptable to you. I will revert with confirmation and insurance policy documents once we have both agreed on the terms.

Yours faithfully,
Jin Chen

NJ is not a problem. The vessel leaves from Rotterdam, then stops in Houston and NJ, before going to Boston. The final destination for the cargo is Boston, and you will clear the cargo in Boston, so that is fine.

The carrier for this shipment will be ZIM Lines. They will export from Rotterdam, and stop in Houston, before sailing to Boston. All shipments are delivered FCA (Free Carrier). This means the carrier will deliver the cargo at their warehouse in Rotterdam, from where you will be responsible for paying for the cargo and the customs duties. You will also be responsible for unloading the cargo, or arranging for that to be done.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

They show up in email. When you google “ur5 quickbooks” and “quickbooks error 176109”, you’ll find this email. They are low cost replicas of your computer’s typical shipping and air delivery errors. One reason why they’re so effective is because they’re 100% human-friendly, like “Q: When will the goods arrive? A: Today.”

When you send them back, they’ll respond. These two replies will let you know that someone from them (and not a computer, and certainly not an imposter) is in your inbox.

I was just wondering if you could give us a rough idea of how much shipping from Hamburg to Aarhus by sea would cost, probably 200MT - 300MT. I understand it is difficult to be precise at this stage, but would be useful for our financial people to have some idea of ballpark amounts.

Many thanks,

I'm following up regarding the shipment from Montevideo to the Vargas Free Zone (Isla Margarita, Venezuela). We've identified that your current freight forwarder is utilizing passenger vessels at premium rates.

We can offer an alternative solution using the MS Francy, which typically operates between Brazil and Venezuela. The vessel was recently chartered by a Dubai-based tour operator who has partnered with us for logistics support.

I've attached the detailed quotation for your review.

I need to inform you that the previously mentioned voyage is now fully booked. However, we've arranged an alternative cargo vessel departing from Valparaiso on July 24th, arriving in Isla Margarita on July 27th. 

We recommend using either 20' flat racks (pallets) for deck loading or truck transport in the vessel's hold, which would be the most cost-effective solution for your cargo.

Please let me know if you'd like a quote for this new arrangement.

I will have our brokerage agreement drafted and sent to you within the next 3 days. We haven't discussed compensation yet, but I'm confident we can find terms that work for both parties.

Thanks for your prompt reply.

Best regards,

Body: Jorge,

Regarding compensation, could you give me an idea of what kind of fee structure you're considering? I'd like to ensure we're working toward a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Also, I'm curious about your assessment of the local market conditions. We've been hearing concerns about a potential market correction in the near future.

Best regards,
Rob

Body: Rob,

I've reviewed the numbers again, and while they're not quite where we'd like them to be, I still see great potential in this deal. As an alternative approach, I could come in as a silent partner initially, with the option to complete a full buyout later.

Could you share more detailed financial data for our first proper evaluation? I'm looking for a structure that ensures mutual benefit, not just increased sales figures.

Thanks again,
Jorge

Our liners operate out of Virginia, Houston and Long Beach, and to Istanbul, İzmir, Kütahya, and Antalya. We also have a weekly direct service to İzmir from Savannah. It's a fast service, taking about 14 days from loading in the US to discharging in Turkey. If you're interested in shipping from Houston, it's an 11 day trip to Antalya.

All of these routes can be served from one of our 3 weekly services. For a monthly schedule, please visit our website. We don't accept individual bookings, so you would need to find a freight forwarder or consolidator to place your booking.

Subject: Shipping Query - Milk Powder & Grain from Sydney to Tokyo
Timestamp: 2023-06-25 09:15
Body: Hello Owen,

Our Australian customer wants to ship some powdered milk from Port Botany in Sydney to Tokyo. The contract says 2,500MT, but they might also require 1,500MT of grain. This order will need to leave in the first week of July.

How much would shipping 4,000MT of both goods together cost, and do you see any risk of port congestion?

Many thanks,
Ivy

Body: Hi Ivy,

The order for 2,500MT should be manageable. However, regarding the combined shipment with 1,500MT of grain, we cannot find a vessel available to accommodate both cargoes together. While there are still some free slots in July, the total order size limits our options.

We can offer to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain on a 10,000dwt vessel that will complete its previous cargo discharge in July. The vessel details are:

M/V T1
Type: General Cargo
Flag: Liberia
Call Sign: MOYO
Deadweight: 8,600MT
Built: 1996

Best regards,
Owen

Body: Ivy,

I should add that port congestion in Australia is worsening, and securing a slot for such a large order may be challenging. The railway terminals are also experiencing overload.

If you can wait until October, I can offer a better slot with more space, which would allow for more cargo capacity or a reduced price.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,
Owen

Body: Dear Owen,

Thank you for the detailed information. We need to proceed with shipping the 4,000MT cargo in early July as we don't have sufficient storage capacity. Delaying the delivery could lead to product depreciation, so we'll need to stick with the original timeline.

Additionally, we will have more orders to deliver in July. Can you please assist with those as well?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Ivy

Body: Hi Ivy,

I understand your urgency and inability to wait until October. I can propose the following solution:

- Ship 1,000MT in July
- Ship either 2,000MT or 3,000MT in August

We can accommodate 2,000MT on a 6,000dwt vessel due for September discharge, or 3,000MT on a 6,500dwt vessel also due for September discharge.

Could you specify whether you prefer to ship the milk powder or grain portion in August?

Owen

Email 4 is a slight variation on the same topic: iron ore charter. In email 4, we’ve received an inquiry on a different vessel, that is, the “TIGER LILY”, a bulk carrier, and the laycan is now set at 15th July.

Welcome to Sada,<Nada>
Here are the latest developments on Almarakib.<br /><br />Outward bound.<br /><br />Two reasons. 1. Almarakib's Pakistani captain is low on funds and is able to transport items from our port to Pakistan and earn some quick cash. He's a freelancer by nature, and is more than happy to take on whatever job comes his way as long as he gets his money upfront.<br /><br />2. He is asking for $30,000 upfront. We will take out a loan for the money. We cannot afford the loan. I must sell off my share of the ship to pay it back.<br /><br />I am writing this email on my phone from the bank.<br /><br />I have agreed to let the bank have your share of the ship and pay off the loan.<br","From: harvey.smith@trading.com

Mr. Anderson,                    Would you please provide a quote for our shipment of 10,000MT of M.G. wheat from Dalian to Durban. Can you include any extra charges for overweight or additional services?                    Thank you,                    Olivia
Email 2:
Mr. Martin,                    Thank you for your quote. Your quote of $7,350 is a great value for a premium wheat like our MG and we were hoping you would have enough of the stock to allow us to charter your vessel to Dalian to load. When is your next voyage to Dalian?                    If we could charter your vessel directly from your current port, perhaps London, then that would greatly reduce our shipping costs and we would definitely prefer to charter with you. We will arrange for our vessel to load with your wheat and deliver it to Dalian where we will book a voyage to Durban.                    We look forward to hearing from you,                    Olivia

In response to your earlier query, the freight is in the range of USD 3.50 - USD 3.75 per metric ton. It depends on the equipment chosen. We will need to know your ship and its specifications to provide a confirmed rate. Also, would you be able to charter the ship for a period of two weeks, perhaps to Rijeka (Croatia) for loading or discharge?

Let us know and we will follow up on this further.

Best regards,

Timestamp: 2022-10-14 09:30
Body: Dear Ms. Bennett,

As a stevedore, you have access to ample cranes and loading equipment, but I understand most shipping companies prefer to hire their own personnel for discharge. We have a reputation for working fast at berthing and cargo operations, ensuring both berthing rights and successful shipments.

What's your experience with crane capacity at your ports, and can you give an estimate on service time for ships 2,600 meters and 6,500m³ cargo capacity?

Thank you,
Edward

Body: Dear Ms. Bennett,

Thanks for your reply. It appears neither your terminal nor mine has cranes strong enough to handle such large ships. However, we share common interests regarding Grande Comore operations. We both prioritize using reputable ports with quality equipment and speedy service while avoiding overloading.

We need to find a company that can efficiently handle the cargo, as most shipping companies prefer their own discharge personnel due to specialized requirements. Would you be interested in collaborating with our team to find a solution?

Best regards,
Edward

What about using a multi-purpose dock, such as Port Natal? They have the most advanced docking equipment and their crews are very experienced. They are also one of the fastest ports in the world with an average unloading time of 15 minutes per ship.

Alternatively, we could consider a third-party port. I know a company called 'Aloha Stevedoring' who can handle your requirements. They have an excellent reputation with top-tier facilities.

All the best,
Cory

I've been discussing this with a contact near our terminal. They've just opened a new facility in the Philippines that can handle vessels of 2,600 meters and 6,500m³ cargo capacity. They're looking to expand operations and are seeking quality partnerships.

I believe they would be interested in working with you. If you'd like to speak with them directly, please let me know.

Body: Hi David,

Let's assume our 4,500MT fixture from Hamburg to Aarhus has settled for a free-out rate of $300/MT. I just want to confirm - is that an all-in rate?

I understand your question, however, while the quotation has settled at $300/MT, the vessel owner has indicated flexibility to accept $250/MT. This could present an opportunity for negotiation.

I need to be very clear about this. The agreed rate is $300/MT all-in. If we were to negotiate a lower rate with the vessel owner, they would have no obligation to maintain the $300/MT all-in terms. My position remains firm on the original agreement.

To be clear, I'm not proposing or assuming anything specific. I'm simply suggesting that taking such a rigid approach might be limiting from a business perspective, even if it makes sense legally.

If you'd like to discuss this further, I'm happy to schedule a call to talk through the various options.

Great - you book a 50-foot container, which is not in our scope! Are you sure we have a 50-foot container deal with you? If we had a 50-foot container deal with you, I would've thought you would've offered us the container first because we are an origin based company. Also, I'm not sure what 'book' means in this context. There are not many 50-foot container companies in Canada and if we had a deal with you, I would be sure about that.

Your container should arrive on the 29th of June. The demurrage is $500 per day. As for arrival time, it depends when your truck arrives at the port and the port's efficiency. As the summer is very hot in China, the best time is around 10-11am.

Let me know if you need anything else!

Once again, my valued guest and the popular ‘humourous’ founder of the humour site Fuleminess  has raised a very important issue. With the growing influence of multinational business and the Internet, there is a danger of being misunderstood. Particularly when it comes to asking someone a question. With the ever growing number of emails and phonecalls being made globally every second of the day, it is important to ensure your request is heard. 

When sending an email with a question, it is also very important to include a sign off such as “Best Regards” or “Kind Regards” this is because at times a person can read the email very fast and can be assumed that the person sending the email is actually sending them

Hello my old friend,                                        A little birdie tells me you have an urgent need to get 3,000MT of petroleum coke into Cape Town. You don’t have space on the F/A ABLYN which is at Latakia? Are you going to wait for her next stop, after a quick turn around in Sudan? Or are you desperate?

Hi again,
Here is the story. I can make you an offer you can’t refuse. Remember when I mentioned a quick turn-around in Sudan? Well, the job is not for me. It’s for my cousin. He has taken over my business. He is not as nice as me. Don’t worry, I can get your oil to South Africa.                                         Yours,                                 Sid

Dear Ms. Bennett,                    As a stevedore, you have access to ample cranes and loading equipment, but most shipping companies prefer to hire their own personnel for discharge. For example, we have a reputation for working fast at berthing and cargo operations, ensuring both your berthing rights and a successful shipment.

What about using a multi-purpose dock, such as Port Natal?
They have the most advanced docking equipment and their crews are very experienced.
They are also one of the fastest ports in the world and have an average unloading time of 15 minutes per ship.
The other option is to go for the third-party port.

It is the best port in the world, with the best ships and docks.

Dear Mr. Ferris,                    My name is Samuel. I’m currently the vessel broker of a Chinese bulk carrier currently in Chittagong, Bangladesh.                    We have 3,800MT of heavy plates to load. Destination is Port Louis, Mauritius. We have been given the following port dues and fees to be deducted from the cargo:                    * General Cargo Port Dues: USD 3,256.00                    * Coast Guard Charges: USD 164.00                    * MFAF (Mauritius Free Airport Fee): USD 112.80                    * Port Corporation: USD 159.84                    * Generator Rental: USD 0.16/ Hour * 12 Hours = USD 1.92                    * Empty Tank Cleaning: USD 10.00 * 2 Tanks = USD 20.00                    Could you kindly take this into account when submitting

Dear Samuel,
Thank you for your email. Unfortunately it is not appropriate for you to pass charges like this on to the cargo owners without their consent. If you are able to provide evidence that this is the owners’ responsibility (e.g. a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo), we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses, but if you are just making up charges to pay your agency then it is unethical and we will not pay you.
Thank you,
Alain Ferris
PS: We also need a few more details on the cargo (origin, grade, product code), which will enable us to get a more accurate quote for the freight.

Dear Captain X,                        Thank you for your prompt reply.                        We would like to book cargo as you mentioned in your email 2.                        The information you need is as follows:                        Quantity: 30,000MT (weight)                        Type: Soybean meal                        Packed in 50kg jumbo bags                        Packed in 1,200 bags per 40'HC container                        Destination: Shantou                        Port of loading: Chongqing                        In the end of June this year, my company and a dealer made an agreement of selling and buying the above soybean meal at the agreed price of 1,300USD per MT.                        I'm wondering if I can still make the shipment at such price even now it's September.                        Thanks in advance.                        Sulek

 Dear Suheki,                        I've checked with our freight representative. I'm afraid the above rate is no longer available.                        It seems that after your July inquiry, the freight cost has been rising continuously. In September, the rate could be around 12,000USD/30,000MT. It's quite expensive compared with your original contract of 1,300USD per MT.                        I'm afraid your soybean meal could be sold at a lower price now.                        Regards,                        Captain X

Dear Captain X,                        That's terrible!                        It seems that we can't make it.                        At that time we agreed the contract price was only 1,300USD per MT. If we reduce the price further, we'll definitely lose some money.                        I don't know how to explain this to the client.                        I'd better tell him to take some other cargo.                        I will close this deal with the seller now.                        Thanks.                        Sulek

 Dear Suheki,                        It's a pity.                        I think that if we still insist to take the cargo, we can at least minimize the loss. We can fix the rate for the shipment.                        If we reduce the price further, we'll definitely lose some money.

1. The Suez Canal plays a crucial role in the global shipping industry, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. However, recent events have caused concerns among vessel operators and shipping companies about delays and increased congestion at the canal.
2. Since the closure of the canal in March due to the Ever Given ship blocking it, operators have been expressing fears of congestion and delays. Despite the reopening of the canal in mid-April, vessels are still facing delays as the backlog of shipping containers and other cargo continues to accumulate.
3. As of May 2nd, there are 67 vessels waiting to enter the Suez Canal, while an additional 55 are waiting to exit. This has led to

Dear (Name),
I hope this message finds you well. I understand that you have some questions regarding the Ever Given ship and the backlog of vessels at the Suez Canal. Let me try to address your concerns.
Firstly, the Ever Given ship was successfully dislodged from the Suez Canal on March 29th, after being stuck for almost a week. However, it remains in the canal until it can be re-fueled and towed to another location for repairs. The process of refueling and repairing the ship is expected to take several weeks.
As for the backlog of vessels in the canal, the congestion has","From: arik.shipping@example.com

Good day Ms. Kelly,                    I’m inquiring about 3,400MT of sulphuric acid from Aqaba to Khor Fakkan. Could you handle a late-July laycan, and are you open to a short load window?                    Best,                    Aqaba
Email 2:
Hi J. Pye,                    I’m writing you about your question. However, due to some problems with confidentiality, I will have to address this email as being from someone other than me.                    I can handle a late July load date, but you must understand that it may take us a few weeks to secure the necessary permits. You can help speed things along by hiring a third party to find out who the permits are issued to, and to pay them for their services. Your cargo is a noxious substance that has been denied to others in the past, so this must be done delicately. The load window can be as short as 3-4 days, but we’ll have to include that in the permits, too.                    Yours,                    Aqaba

Body: Dear Nada,

Here are the latest developments regarding the Almarakib:

The vessel is currently outward bound. There are two important updates:

1. The vessel's Pakistani captain is low on funds and has accepted a cargo transport job from our port to Pakistan to generate immediate income. As a freelancer, he's willing to take on this job with advance payment.

2. The captain is requesting $30,000 upfront for this voyage. We need to take out a bank loan for this amount. Unfortunately, due to our financial situation, I must sell my share of the ship to cover the loan. I'm currently at the bank finalizing arrangements where they will take your share of the vessel as collateral against the loan.

Sada

We can accommodate a shipment of 3000MT of rubbish, but I'm concerned by your use of a boxship. Sure, it'll transport the garbage, but you're going to have to pay out the wazoo to get one. My advice is to go the less expensive route and use your neighbor's trash cans for the operation. Those are typically made of cheap plastic that is easy to transport by land.

Body: Mr. Martin,

Thank you for your quote. Your quote of $7,350 is a great value for a premium wheat like our MG and we were hoping you would have enough of the stock to allow us to charter your vessel to Dalian to load. When is your next voyage to Dalian?

If we could charter your vessel directly from your current port, perhaps London, then that would greatly reduce our shipping costs and we would definitely prefer to charter with you. We will arrange for our vessel to load with your wheat and deliver it to Dalian where we will book a voyage to Durban.

We look forward to hearing from you,

We note your revised quote is less competitive than your original quote of $7,350. As we stated in our first enquiry we are trying to obtain the best value for our shipment of wheat and it would be unwise to have a new agent. We still hold your initial quote of $7,350 open for the time being.

Hey All,                     Because I’m out of the office this week, I’m sending you some interesting projects and news to check out while I’m away!  Here are a few highlights:
* Click here to learn about the Fertilizer Institute’s new Code of Conduct, which includes nine guiding principles for good behavior, including the encouragement of a culture of safety and compliance with the law. ""Anyone who works with anhydrous ammonia or other fertilizers must read this, and they must share it with their teams,"" says Director of Regulatory Affairs Brian Jennings.
* When a group of California manufacturers and distributors went before the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss the 2013 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) proposed by the U.S. EPA, they did not leave empty-handed. A bill was introduced in the state legislature that would provide a tax incentive to encourage renewable fuel blending

It’s been busy around the warehouses. We are in the process of getting our Fall products ready. We have had some order cancellations so we will have a few spots open. We are reevaluating our shipping schedules. We are now shipping later than we did last year. It appears that the weather is not cooperating. We will keep you informed as we get better weather conditions. Some 20-inch rocks have not made it to the Southeastern states due to weather conditions and we are not sure when we will get them in.","From: carina.martinez@trading.com

Body: Dear Ms. Violet,

Our C-Flex 1100 vessels have indeed arrived. They can be chartered for your next shipment of cargo from Ningbo to Hai Phong. What is the shipment's ETA?

I'll need you to give us more information about the shipment, like:
* The cargo's name, weight, and volume (in cubic meters)
* Any hazardous materials on board
* Cargo description
* Cargo price
* Lashing for securing the cargo
* More requirements (like reefer containers for cargoes that need a particular temperature for preservation, etc.)

We can make a quotation when we have all the required details.

I'll be waiting for your reply.

Regards,
Alwin

Good morning Caroline,

I have checked with my Bitumen supplier.

### Answer options

The correct answer is C.   We need 1,300MT of bitumen


  • A.  We need 1,300MT of bitumen to Chicago                    • B.  I have checked with my supplier                    • D.  Could you name some vessels and a laycan?                    • E.  I wanted to see if we could coordinate our movements to Lyon


The best thing to do when faced with answer options is to try and make as few assumptions as possible. Although the words ""we need"" in the original email suggests a second person, you shouldn't immediately assume that there is more than one person at SEEDOR Company.
Try and identify the people who are talking about the 1,300MT.

If we had a 50-foot container deal with you, I would've thought you would've offered us the container first because we are an origin based company.

Sorry for the late reply, but I have just checked on my freight department and would be delighted to provide you with a quote, I believe I will be able to pass you on to a consultant who will be able to confirm with you over a phone call or email all information you might require in this respect.

Body: Hey Matt,

We can do 100,000 tonnes a year for you if you agree on an annual contract. The best rate will be $60 per tonne plus $5 in extra charges. This special rate is available because the port authority in Israel offers us a discount for shipping volumes of 100,000 tonnes or more annually.

We also offer shipping insurance at $3 per tonne. A security deposit of $20,000 would be required before commencing shipments. As this is FOB, you will be responsible for all charges related to moving the cement from the terminal to your desired location.

Let me know if you're interested, and I can prepare the necessary documentation for your signature.

Yours truly,
Ha

In my previous post I introduced how the transformer can be used to set up a casual model using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. I wanted to apply this methodology to email correspondence analysis but had no good starting points to learn from. So, I decided to have a go at using a large email data set to set up an email correspondence model. In this post, I’ll describe my method and then evaluate it.
## Previous Work
I found two other email correspondence analyses:
Both papers claimed to have a small error rate (below 5%) but no error rate figures were provided. Their methods included analyzing only the destination of emails and ignoring the subjects and whether the email was replied to or not.
## Data

I love that you and everyone else on the website have no idea what it takes to run a successful business. You think it’s as easy as going on constructionobserver and asking for bids. Just how much it costs for a quote and if there is a minimum number of products you have to buy.
I’d say it’s an education. Like how the Navy discovered it would lose too many crewmen if they started a major war without undergoing combat training first, so they decided to create such training so that every year they would lose fewer and fewer crews. Combat training also provided the Navy with the opportunity to evaluate newly created equipment and armaments.

Thanks for your email about the transport of wood panels from Bordeaux to Bilbao. What is the weight of the panels? If they are 1.6 cubic meters (a typical wood pallet size) with a panel thickness of about 2.5cm, that's approximately 1,000kg/m³ with a density of 1.7. Do you have any other measurements?

Yes, all panels are 1.6 cubic meters and 2.5cm thick, so I can use your equation to find the weight (1,000kg/m³ * 1.6 cubic meters = 1,600kg).

How about this deal? How many cubic meters can your truck transport from Bordeaux to Bilbao? How many total trips will the vehicle make? What is the total cost for transport?

I can confirm that the rate I quoted you earlier still stands: US$2.00 per ton FOB Antwerp, plus US$10 per package in case the packages are of different dimensions.

Should you require additional details please let me know.

Why don't you just offer the rate per ton and let David accept it or suggest alternatives?

Do you remember in our training course, we learnt that the purpose of most email communications is not just to reply with 'yes' or 'no', but to help others make a decision?

David's just a little reluctant, but he will accept it and agree to it if you can help him to make a decision by making your rate specific enough.

Best wishes,
Betsy

> How much is your storage fee? 


   _> And who will deliver this quantity to our factory?_ 

So, there was this corporation who asked about our storage and delivery cost. First question they asked was about storage cost. I made sure to talk about all different prices based on different quantities and then I explained the storage conditions. I never mentioned that in my price I included free delivery to the factory, in my opinion it is better to ask all questions before talking about details. You do not know what questions they can ask.

When I received the email below, I was a bit shocked about the question. However I managed to answer it quickly as follows:

With so much missing information, there was no way I could provide an accurate quote at this stage.

Let’s see how they reply:

Hello Nicole,
1) Please confirm that the cargo is gas oil not furnace oil.
2) Please confirm the vessel is in a condition and class as per samples.

Ok, that’s slightly better.

1) We will not accept GAS OIL cargo. We are only accepting FURNACE OIL.

2) Yes, the cargo will be in good class and condition. We only accept high quality petroleum products.

Hi Kari,                      I'm on the west coast in Adelaide.              Here's a little more info on the shipment:                    The product is packed in a rectangular container that's about 1 cubic meter. It's pretty light, about 30 kgs.           There's a second product in this shipment, made of paper, that's heavier, about 30 kilos.            In total, the shipment is about 2 x 1m long.           I'd like to quote for air freight, and 

I can also show the floor, first 2 rows of long pics are cross-campus, next 2 rows are by class.

Body: Dear Yanyan,

Thank you for your inquiry. Following our previous communications regarding the vessel S & P, we regret to inform you that there is an issue with the vessel's P&I coverage. The owner does not provide the Vessel's P&I insurance, which would need to be covered by the charterer.

We can offer you two options:
1. TCE only
2. TCE + P&I coverage

Alternatively, we can source another suitable vessel for your requirements. Please let us know your preference so we can proceed accordingly.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

The total capacity required is 36,000 metric tonnes of glycol from Mexico to Luanda in Angola.                    Any suitable vessels?                    Best regards,                    your name

Yesterday you were looking for suitable vessels for 36,000 metric tonnes of glycol from Mexico to Luanda in Angola.                    I have a ship available.           36,000 MT = 36,000 ton x 1,000 kg/ton = 36,000,000 kg = 3,600 m3 at a density of 1 ton/m3                    The ship can carry 5,500,000 litres.                    5,500,000 litres x 1 m3/1,000 litres = 5,500 m3                    Let me know if this is suitable.                    The shipment costs US$100,000 (can be deducted from the commission that you pay to me)                   36,000 MT = 36,000 ton x 1,000 kg/ton = 36,000,000 kg = 3,600 m3
Email 3:
The price per litre is $10, so 5,500 m3 of ethanol is worth US$55,000.
The net profit for the shippers is US$55,000 - US$100,000 = US$55,000.
Let me know how you feel about this arrangement. 
Best regards,
Email 4:
If this offer from the shippers is accepted, I will issue a commission invoice to you (as agent) as follows:
100% net profit is $55,000
Commission is 5% of net profit is $2,750
The balance of $52,250 is to be deposited by you (the client) in my bank account and you will then get the balance of $100,000 less commission.
Please send a signed copy of the attached contract.  I will provide a copy for you to sign.
If you have any queries about this arrangement, please get back to me.

Thank you.  The contract has been signed and returned.
Please open an account for me (in the same bank as the shippers), and I will be happy to deposit the balance of $52,250 and receive the commission of $2,750.

* General Cargo Port Dues: USD 3,256.00
* Coast Guard Charges: USD 164.00
* MFAF (Mauritius Free Airport Fee): USD 112.80
* Port Corporation: USD 159.84
* Generator Rental: USD 0.16/Hour * 12 Hours = USD 1.92
* Empty Tank Cleaning: USD 10.00 * 2 Tanks = USD 20.00

Could you kindly take this into account when submitting your freight quote?

Best regards,
Samuel

Body: Dear Samuel,

Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, it is not appropriate for you to pass charges like this on to the cargo owners without their consent. If you are able to provide evidence that this is the owners' responsibility (e.g. a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo), we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses, but if you are just making up charges to pay your agency then it is unethical and we will not pay you.

We also need a few more details on the cargo (origin, grade, product code), which will enable us to get a more accurate quote for the freight.

The more information you are able to provide in your emails, the faster we can give you an answer.

Thank you,
Alain Ferris

Good Morning,                    We have a load of 150k MT of crude oil coming out of Vung Tau on 22nd September.

Dear [Your name],                    Our cargo of crude oil “XONE” will come out of Vung Tau in Vietnam on the 20th of September on board the Hapag Lloyd vessel “Venezuela”.

I would like to share with you a couple of situations I have recently experienced regarding sales. The main factor here is that every port of origin in this region has its own cargo’s name that differs from one port to another. Let me give you an example. Vung Tau’s oil is usually known as “XONE”, for example. If the cargo’s origin was not Vung Tau, it would be known as something different. In the first email, the seller is probably from Vung Tau, the port

We have, however, to be cautious when receiving information from an agent, because often it is not completely correct. If the agent wants to sell his cargo by using an incorrect cargo name, it is much easier for him to trick the buyer by giving a name that has a higher profit for him, or a name that is more familiar for the potential buyer. This issue is something that we have to be aware of. We have to make sure that the cargo is what we think it is, and if we’re sure that we know the exact","From: lorraine.smith@tradingco.com

In total, the cost would be as follows:                    R/T cargo handling fee: $480/mt                       Storage and demurrage: $4,500                   Handling for Monrovia: $100/mt                   In total, $8,580                   If you like, I can prepare the documents and send them to you.

They get a reply to only the last email. There are reasons why they could be having difficulty in getting through to their target. This happens frequently when it comes to end-user targets in emerging markets.
I always leave two days in my inbox to send another follow up email after the first one is sent and then at the end of the day send another one. This seems to work better than the more traditional 3-day/3-email rule.

While we see high open rates, it’s possible that the real target isn’t looking for the product at this time and may not have read the email. You don’t really know for sure unless you get a reply from the target","From: maya.wong@chinafishing.com

 It is not typical. Any crew that is leaving the bridge for more than a few minutes will usually assign a watchkeeper and/or specify exactly where the wheel is. If the owner insists on an automatic pilot watchkeeper, it is up to the captain to comply. But that would not be my recommendation.

I received the proposal from Paul Spangler's firm. As discussed, please find my comments below:

1) We would like to reduce the number of projects for which we plan to broker deals with you. This isn't due to concerns about your capabilities, but rather to start with a focused approach. The deal with the American electronics firm is our first priority.

2) Regarding the electronics deal, please consider accelerating the timeline. We've noticed American firms are increasingly looking to work with British firms to access their competitive tax rates. An earlier timeline would make us more attractive.

3) Regarding your quoted rate for the electronics firm deal...

Regarding your email about shipping 1000MT oil seed cake from Mumbai to South Africa - I need to clarify that the clients want the oil seed cake only, not the oil. Could you please confirm that the cargo will include only oil seed cake?

Please advise.

We're having a hard time switching the delivery point. I've talked to the shipping line and their only solution is to send the shipment back to Bangkok so it can be shipped to the correct location. Unfortunately, the cost of this is very high, and I don't think it's a viable option for you.

Dear Greg,
Thank you for your email.                It is acceptable for our side to receive the cargo under such conditions.                Thanks for your effort and cooperation, I look forward to receiving the detail.

Thank you for your offer but I’m afraid our client cannot accept the terms at this moment, as there are some issues on end of customer side, and they will be receiving other cargo later in the week so it will be impossible to give me clear instructions before Friday.                Please stay in touch, so I will keep in touch with you regarding the final confirmation.                Thank you and take care.

Dear Jason,
I’m not available during weekend but my client has given me positive response. However, my client can confirm your offer only for 2500MT, not 3000MT.                In that case, my FOB price remains USD210/MT and demurrage charge is USD20/MT. Please confirm this offer by the end of today.

To give you an idea, we will handle 70k MT of Brazilian crude each year for the next 3 years. Could you give us an estimate for these volumes?                    Yours sincerely,                    Margot

Timestamp: 2023-08-15 10:45
Body: Hi Jane,

Are you sure of your MT readings? These seem to be off by a lot. It will probably be several months until the ethanol has finished being stored in the tanks. Could you please verify the quantities and let me know?

Thanks,
Zoe

Body: Hi Zoe,

I just looked up prices for ethanol in Houston from Singapore, Brazil, and Egypt. They are all pretty much the same - only a 3 USD difference. In July, Brazil was cheaper, but now in August, Egypt is slightly cheaper, though that could change quickly.

I'm going to go with the MT readings as shown and work with a delivered price of 1 USD from Maceió. I need this information to estimate the gas requirements for profitability.

Thank you for all your help. You are a great addition to the company.

Could you estimate freight for 2,500MT from Maceió to Houston in late June/early July? Also, would you be willing to cover the 10% buyer's commission?

Thanks, Abbie,        Here are some details.        Please do your calculations assuming a spread of 5 to 15 days for loading. If you use 10 days, please note that it will make your calculation more conservative.        These are some other terms you need to consider:        – guaranteed loading window 5 days (as a rule, we do 10% out of this time if the barge is ready at the quay or 10% per day extra from our client’s terminal if the barge is not ready at the quay).        – rotation time: 24h maximum        – unloading time: 24h maximum        – total transit time: 48h        – all statutory holidays are considered normal workdays for shippers.        – routing: Oslo-Fredericia-Middelfart-Harsholm-Portland-Jakobsen        –","From: jorge.rodriguez@trading.com

I have some clarifying questions about your slot availability. My understanding is the following:

1) Your vessel can load 2500MT of general cargo, including the 3004 cargo
2) Your vessel can make an East Coast USA call
3) Your vessel has laytime, i.e. 3 days of port time to load 2500MT

Am I correct?

Hello Sir,                    Do you think a big container ship will be built in China? Is it better to own a small ship or to own an interest in a large container ship?                    Thank you,                    Andre

Dear Sir,
Since my last letter, I have been reading a
book on Containership Business and i have a
lot of ideas.
Here is one of them. Will a large container
ship be built in China? Is it a good
investment to own a small container ship or
to own an interest in a large ship? I
believe that the container shipping industry
will get better and better. At this time, the
shipping market is very strong.
Here is the conclusion:
It is better to own a small container ship
than to own an interest in a large container
ship. We should stick to our belief.
Thank you,
Andre

Body: Hi Adam,

Good day! Thank you for your inquiry. I must inform you that we currently don't have local agents at Westport. We only operate shipments from LA, Long Beach, or Hueneme ports.

This means we cannot arrange local delivery pickups or handle port activities at Westport. These would need to be arranged by the shipment owner or a third-party company.

For reference, our current rates for similar shipments from our operating ports to Long Beach are:
- Ocean Freight: USD 1,862
- Port Charges: USD 1,858

We're currently offering a 6% discount on our services, which would result in savings of approximately USD 362.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss alternative arrangements through our operating ports.

Best regards,
Ms. Helberg

David,                         We need to add the price of bunker to shipowners is more expensive than selling bunker, since our agent will pay for all bunker in VETSA trades.                    Also please consider the fact that our ship is selling product from Daesan to India before load jet to Daesan.

Please refer to the canal toll agreement here:
http://www.panamaxmaritime.com/AG/Panama%20Canal%20Tolls%20Agreement.pdf

The addendum discusses toll rates for container vessels. As per the Neutrality Treaty, the Panama Canal should operate equitably for all merchant vessels. The tolls should be consistent with established rates.

I suspect we will need to hire a cargo lawyer. We should challenge this on grounds of discrimination. We could seek a legal opinion from the Secretary of State for Transport, or alternatively engage a private firm to challenge the canal authorities directly.

At minimum, we need clarification on their 'adjusted and equitable tolls' arrangement. However, I should mention that our principals are generally reluctant to engage in legal proceedings.

When you give an estimate, it will give the exact rate. It is correct if the pickup and delivery dates are the same and the amount of goods shipped is 50 CBM. If your pickup date is July 10, 2017, the delivery date is July 20, 2017, and the amount of goods shipped is 25 CBM, you can click the blue icon in the lower right corner. Change your preferred dates and change the amount of goods shipped.
   Our company charges $0.05 per CBM per day, so the extra cost is $25 ($25 CBM*0.05$ per CBM per day*20 days

When to use balticdirties ? Use balticdirties only if no other time charter data is available (e.g. in freight rate calculations). Typically, the day and time you check are important (e.g. if there is a tidal window). Do not use balticdirties in company charter party clauses if you have a term charter party clause. Use balticdirties at all other times. For example, if you are estimating spot freight rates between two ports and two locations, and you only

Timestamp: 2023-07-01 11:45
Body: Dear Ms. Manwell,

Thank you for your enquiry. We have prepared a proposal for the movement of 6,000MT of LNG from the US Gulf to Antwerp in July. The price can be structured in two ways:

1. Fixed FOB rate as detailed in the proposal
2. FCN basis with a CBM charge of $1.20 per CBM based on the cargo declaration

In both scenarios, the CIF rate would be fixed, with cargo delivery to the discharge port on the same day. Regarding port rotation, this would be at the shipper's request and subject to prior agreement between all parties.

Please review the proposal and return a copy of the commercial terms (either C/P or C&F).

Timestamp: 2023-07-02 14:20
Body: Dear Mr. Dalschaert,

Regarding our recent communications, our chartering division has consulted with London about the GCM/Voyage charterparty provisions (as drafted by BIMCO).

The current charterparty specifies a CBM charge of $1.20 per CBM for FCN charters. However, our client Shell has indicated they cannot proceed with this arrangement for LNG shipments unless the CBM charge is reduced to below 90 cents per CBM.

We therefore request BIMCO to consider revising the relevant provision in the GCM/Voyage Charterparty accordingly.

I need your urgent help regarding a situation. We received notification that some delivery documents have gone missing, and this is holding up our invoice payment.

So your project is about *Self-Driving Car* project? Does your task is to build a dataset? (like *record all the different driving patterns*) or build an application to help driver?
Email 3:
Let me make sure I'm understanding you correctly. Are you requesting that we **decompose** two decades of the same dataset into a much more manageable number of, say, three to four *decades*, so that I can apply this new algorithm to the entire dataset with more manageable storage?

I'm not quite sure what you mean by **""decompose** the first 10 years,"" but I'll guess that you are asking me to compress the first 10 years of data down to a smaller amount. If that is your request, I'll note that the changes in the dataset have slowed considerably, so I would expect that the 11th decade would have a smaller compression than the 10th decade. Is that your intent?

Hello Ryan,                    Our current volume to Haldia port is 2000MT. The main reason for the high volume is increased industrialization of West Bengal, increased port handling capacity due to new Haldia Dock Complex and increasing port capabilities to handle increase in ship sizes. We intend to further double the volumes for Haldia due to multiple factors including our own expansion at plants on the East Coast of India.                   We currently source the bitumen from Jubail and other origin ports. The proposed volumes and best position for Jubail is Haldia Port as follows.

The expressions and sentences in each of the four emails are different and so the email might not be a good example of phishing attack.

(You are to decide)
=> i removed the word 4 after 1,000 MT in the email

=> Could you explain why?
=> Since 4 was removed, the emails could be written by two different persons. So 1,000 MT was not indicative of who wrote the email.

Mr. Bluth,
Thank you for your reply. Can you please send an estimated FOB price and any additional information you might have about laycan, ETA, and IFO price? We would like to discuss this shipment, although we might not need it as soon as you mentioned. But we could also be interested in the earlier date, so please send more details. Thank you,                     Sophie

If you are in direct contact with the buyer, please try to get the material specification. In this case, you need to be direct and say that you cannot send a freight quotation without that document. If they ask about the freight quotation first, share a rough estimate with a mention that it will be updated when you have the material specification. The buyer should realize that this is the only way for you to take an offer. It is your first line of defense against waste of time. Other brokers might not understand that they need to ask for the material specification because they do not have a ""ship"" yet, so they can only discuss price and laycan. This is very wrong, but I am sure it happens.  If you are an agent, you should receive the material specification from the buyer. If you don't have it, call your counterpart to discuss this.

Thanks Pauline,

I checked the schedules and I think you mean the Commodore. This is our weekly spot cargo service, loading containers for France.

The Commodore berths at the South Container Terminal but we can't berth there this week. There are no slots available and the berths have to be occupied in a particular order.

South Container Terminal berths are occupied in this order:
5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 6

This week we have the Commodore coming in from Kingston on Wednesday. This is the first available berth for that vessel so we are expecting her to be berthed at 6 South. The ship is due to sail to Cherbourg on Friday night.

I hope this helps.

Hi Vidyasagar,                    I was wondering if you could help us charter a vessel to carry 24,000MT of animal feed from Mukah to Iloilo next month?                    We’re in a bit of a rush, so please let us know if you have anything open.                    Also, what are your rates and what’s your usual demurrage rate?                    Many thanks,                    Laura
