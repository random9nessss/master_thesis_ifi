What is the best lead time you can offer, and will you be able to cover our last two shipments for $2,500?                    Regards,                    Annabelle\nEmail 2:\nDear Ms. Annabelle,                    Hello. Thank you for your e-mail. I have several storage tanks and packing equipment available and I will be able to accept a 5,000MT shipment of waste plastic film starting July 28. As for the lead time, it will take me about four days to finish the tanking of the plastic film. I can do all the loading, stuffing and lashing and you will be responsible for the fixing and sealing of the hatch. Will the cargo be using hatch cover or will it be double-containerized? Please advise, so I can make the necessary arrangements for the storage. Will you be able to cover the last two shipments for $2,500? We could not accept this kind of condition because the terminal handling fees and port storage costs are already included in the quoted price. I think the best arrangement we could do is to have a rate adjustment\nEmail 3:\nDear Ms. Scarlett,        It's Scarlett again. Sorry for the late reply. Our cargo will be using hatch cover. The cargo for the past three shipments will arrive in Tianjin tomorrow. We expect the same quality as before.

If everything goes as expected, we will make arrangements for the second shipment. Best regards,        Scarlett\n\n<Email 4>:\n Dear Ms. Scarlett,        Thank you for your e-mail.

Could you provide a freight quote under CFR terms, and can your vessel sail before the 20th?                    Best regards,                    Gordon\nEmail 2:\nSilver Shipping\nMr. Silver,\nThank you for your reply. We have already loaded on a vessel and made the transportation contract. However, the transportation company asks for the following documents: a set of bills of lading, a certificate of insurance and a set of commercial invoices. I would appreciate your advice.\nYours sincerely,\nTom\n\nThe problem of Cargo Document is tricky because it involves the dispute on whether the transportation company should be considered as the agent of the seller.\n\nBusiness background:\nThe first email shows that the buyers have agreed on an acceptance to offer (letter of acceptance, cf. \u00a7 1384, Italian Code of Commercial law (Codice Commerciale)) and made a transportation contract for the 500 ton cargo of corn with a third party. As for the Seller, the second email shows that the Seller still thinks that the transportation company is his agent and the Buyers are not\nEmail 3:\nDear Gordon,\nSilver Shipping, Inc. is currently arranging the shipping for you. It will be more convenient if you could tell us the name of the third party or the transportation company to deal with the shipping contract. We are looking forward to getting your email. Thank you very much.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Silver, President Silver Shipping, Inc.\n<\/Email 3>\n\nThe main issue:\nFor the transaction to be a sale with CIF clause, at the moment of conclusion of the contract of sale, the Seller and the Buyers have to agree on the destination port and the Seller have to insure the goods for the Buyers. If the Buyers do not have a transportation contract, the Seller must comply with this CIF clause to fulfill the contract. Otherwise, the Seller should not promise the contract with the Buyers at all, which is the same as Article 6 \u00a7 1 (c) of the ICC\nEmail 4:\nGordon,\nMr. Silver would like to know where you have got the buyers of the corn. We have already got buyers but you asked for the freight and insurance costs. We do not understand why. As we agreed, you are responsible for the sale, insurance and transportation of the corn. We expect to see a written transportation contract from you within the next 3 days. Please forward to Mr. Silver a copy of the transportation contract.\nYours sincerely,\nBill\n<\/Email 4>\nThe point is that the Seller has not decided what destination port the Buyers are going to choose yet. It seems that the Sellers have fulfilled all the CIF obligations in this case. Thus, it is unnecessary to involve any transportation company. If there is no such transportation company that the Seller and the Buyers both use, the contract of sale cannot be considered as a CIF contract. Therefore, the Sellers should not",

Seablue is a crude vessel and almost all crude cargoes have been fixed by the other time-chartered tankers coming out of  Chinese yards.\nAs I mentioned previously, if Seablue did not come out in China, other tankers would come out of the dock and China would be fixed.                    These tankers would operate at a price level set by the most competitive time charter tanker which is the drydocked Seablue and therefore the price level at which China is fixed would not be different even if Seablue was out of the drydock.\nLPG cargoes are different since we can not use LPG in the crude tankers and crude cargoes are not as easy to fix as LPG, since many producers are contracted and certain prices are set.\nThe next drydocked Seablue is in\nEmail 3:\n1.

Hope you can spot my answer.                 John\n\nProblem\n\nA recent widespread email spam campaign targeted the energy and commodities trading industry with messages claiming that their customers wanted to use their services to buy crude oil and related products from reputable traders in the market. Some traders were approached in a very business-like manner, allegedly by major oil firms. The email subject line would indicate that the email was from a trusted business partner, such as a large energy firm or similar corporate client.\n\nThe email requests are easy to read but hard to understand. A foreign sounding person claiming to be an executive from a respectable company in a similar industry wants to \u201cspot\u201d some \u201cmargin fee\u201d \u2013 what? An explanation for what these terms mean may have come attached\nEmail 3:\nDear John,                    Thank you for your reply.                    Our Singapore client is Singapore Energy, one of the leading trading and logistics companies in Asia Pacific. They represent a major Japanese refiner, Osaka Gas.                    It\u2019s true that this is a complicated trading project and we have to pay a relatively high margin fee of USD 1,000.000.                    If you don\u2019t mind, I can arrange to send you the contract and payment procedure, so that you can fully understand the situation.                    Have a good day.                    Kim\n\nWhen a business receives a large unsolicited order they often feel obligated to make the sale. In this instance, we can probably deduce that our client is confused as to what the client actually wants and also may be uncomfortable with all the business jargon. In both situations, the client should take a step back and evaluate the order. First, the client should\nEmail 4:\nDear John,                    Thank you for your reply.

Best regards,                    Kim\n\nAs the requests are unsolicited and we have not received any communication with our buyer in the past, it would be a good idea to contact them directly to confirm their intent. We could ask the buyer for more information and maybe arrange to speak with the buyer directly. When speaking with the buyer, it would be important to ask them to provide more information about the deal. The buyer may have a reasonable explanation for their request. However, it is important to keep in mind that a reasonable explanation does not necessarily mean the request is legitimate.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis type of email scam",

We\u2019re open to spot charterers, but this cargo may require some creativity in terms of planning. Could you please let me know if you are open to this size charter?                    Thank you,                    Rosalind\nEmail 2:\nHi Rosalind                    Just sent you a revised LSA with the same details.                    Best regards                    Reza\n\nThanks, Reza\n\nBelow is Rosalind's reaction to Reza's invitation.\nEmail 3:\nYou are good, its working perfect :)\n\nAll the best,\nRosalind\n\nSo she already appreciated the role of Reza\u2019s proposing concrete example as shown in the second email above.\n\nFor general reference, a LSA is a LOI (letter of intent) document.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe use of \u201cEmail 1\u201d as an example is taken from a popular LinkedIn post of Sam Nara on the subject of using a working example when making a proposal (source: Linkedin).\n\nI have learned a lot from Sam\u2019s post, and I think the post helps provide an excellent practical starting point. In this post, I will provide further explanations to highlight more subtle points not included in Sam\u2019s original post, and also discuss how these points are implemented in our Lean Email.\n\nEmail 1 is a typical email. Its objective is to propose a working example to a recipient.\n\nIn practice, Rosalind\nEmail 4:\nThank you so much!\n<...>\nI do need your help here to review and submit the revised LSA to admin for approvals!\n\nIn this example, Rosalind first thanked Reza for sending her a revised LSA, then reminded Reza that she required his help to proceed with the transaction.\n\nBased on this email, Reza needs to do two things to support Rosalind in closing this transaction:\n\n\u2022 Review the LSA before submitting the LSA to Rosalind\u2019s admin for approvals.\n\u2022 Submit the LSA to Rosalind\u2019s admin for approvals.\n\nReza can do these two tasks simply by using Lean Email by clicking the buttons as shown below. Clicking on the Review button will pop-up a Review\/Submit page, which contains a Review tab, and a Submit tab.\n\nClicking on the Review tab, Reza can simply enter a quick review note, and",

Thanks,                    Sally\nEmail 2:\nMs. Armitage                    Hi Sally,                In reference to your email, we may consider to organize a chartered out of Singapore with loading to be completed by around 20 to 22 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec. For your reference, I have attached the chartered info and telex release copy.                If you are interested, I will keep you posted when we have further update.                Regards,                Tony\n\n<\/Email 2>\n\n# Word Problem\n\n### Solution 1\n\nFrom the email the relevant facts are:\n\n\u2022 The farmer wants to charter a ship to transport 15000\u00a0mt of rice to Jakarta.\n\u2022 According to Ms. Armitage, the loading can be completed by around 20\u201322\u00a0November with delivery ETA around 10\u201312\u00a0December.\n\nWe know the ship will depart Singapore to Jakarta but\nEmail 3:\nHi Sally,                There will be another chartered starting from Singapore to Jakarta, departing on 18 Nov.                If you are interested, please advise latest by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony\n\n<\/Email 3>\n\nThe sender mentions in Email\u00a03 that the ship will leave Singapore to Jakarta on 18\u00a0November. That means there will be a time difference between 18\u00a0November and 20\u00a0November. So this information is not consistent with the information given in Email\u00a02, which is the main source of information.\n\nOne reason for inconsistency could be the mistake in Email\u00a02, when Ms.\u00a0Armitage wrote 22\u00a0November instead of 20\u00a0November. Or one may assume that when Ms.\u00a0Armitage sent Email\u00a02, she didn't know about the departure date on 18\u00a0November.\n\nLet us consider the following situation:\nEmail 4:\nHi Sally,                There will be a chartered departing on 18 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec.                Please advise if you are interested by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony\n\n<\/Email 4>\n\nIn Email\u00a04, we assumed that Ms.\u00a0Armitage may have made a mistake in Email\u00a02, and corrected it in Email\u00a04. So let us analyze this situation.\n\nAssume the ship leaves Singapore on 18\u00a0November and arrives at Jakarta on 10\u00a0December. This means the ship will take 22\u00a0days to reach Jakarta.\n\nSo, if loading is completed on 20\u00a0November, it will take a minimum of 2\u00a0days to complete the loading. It may take longer.\n\n\u2022 So the loading will take place between 18 and 20\u00a0November.\n\u2022 Then, if the",

How many times per year can you load at New York?                    3.       Can you accept transshipments of grain from the other side of the Atlantic (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany)?                    4.       How many times per year can you transship to Vladivostok from Europe?                    5.       What do your services entail?                    6.       Can you store bulk products in your vessels?                    7.       Do you have terminals in New York or Vladivostok?                    8.

I have some new information.\n\n                    1. The transit time would be approx. 4 weeks. We normally handle bulk containers (20 feet and 40 feet) but we can try with other vessels if you want. We do not usually carry these products, but we can do it from 15,000 tons per trip.                    2. We can accept transshipment of grain from other ports in Europe. In principle it is every two weeks from Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany) with transshipment to Vladivostok once per month. You can also order grain from these ports for the transshipment in the United States.                    3. Our services include transshipment of grain from the United States and transshipment from Europe to Vladivostok. 4. No\nEmail 5:\nRe: Grain to Vladivostok\nMr. Marina,We do not have terminals in New York or Vladivostok. 5. We have been doing this for more than 5 years now. 6. We can store grains in our vessels. 7.

That's quite a bit of oil. I assume you need to ship it by sea.\n\nYou see, the oil trade operates on a just-in-time inventory management model, whereby oil is shipped to tankers as needed. This provides a stable supply and demand, eliminates inventory storage costs and prevents oil from degrading over time.\n\nSince your request involves shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days, my freight quote estimate would exceed what is available.\n\nPlease confirm that your request is for 25,000 tons of oil in a seven-day freight and I can provide a quote to the maximum that is available to my company.\n\nThanks,\nPerry\n\n---\nFrom: felipe.martinez@tradeco.com\nTo: perry.woo@freightservices.com\nSubject: Re: Freight Quote Request - Copenhagen to Lagos\nTimestamp: 2024-02-01 11:45\nBody: Dear Perry,\n\nYes, my request is for 25,000 tons for shipping in seven days to Lagos in Nigeria.

If you are shipping this amount of oil in an outbound tanker, then the only companies capable of doing so are Shell, Chevron and Exxon. I don't have contacts with these companies.\n\nIf you're shipping by sea, then you'll need a port in Copenhagen to load onto a tanker. I've emailed my contacts in the seaport of Copenhagen. They'll be in touch with me in the morning.\n\nIf you're shipping by road, then the quantity would need to be in 45 liter plastic oil drums. The storage space and legal limitations of this option would be impossible to organize in such a short time frame.\n\nI'm sorry, but I simply don't have the resources to fill your request.

I am sure that I am not the only one.

I don't think we've spoken at any point since. I am writing because I am concerned about the current state of my company.                     As you may know, our CEO, Mr. Smith is leaving, and is rumored to be heading for JPS. The news had a significant impact on the market cap. Our stock was down 8 percent on the day of the announcement.                     The plan is to name an interim replacement while a search is conducted to find a successor. Obviously this is not the best time to be making a change but it seems that this is unavoidable.                     With that said I'm looking for advice on how to turn this situation around.

We also have a weekly direct service to \u0130zmir from Savannah. It\u2019s a fast service, it takes about 14 days from loading in the US to discharging in Turkey. If you\u2019re interested in shipping from Houston, it\u2019s an 11 day trip to Antalya. All of these routes can be served from one of our 3 weekly services. For a monthly schedule, please visit our website. We don\u2019t accept individual bookings, so you would need to find a freight forwarder or consolidator to place your booking.\n    Jack",

It can be found in most books on electromagnetism and optics. I wrote down the reference where I first came across this equation in my Nature paper. Have a look at page 3.

I found that references and have already read them but I was looking for a clearer derivation that shows how the refractive index in that form, d*n\/d, gets related to the frequency, lambda, and amplitude of the refractive index.\n\nThanks.\n\nDaniel\n<Email 6>:\nSubject: \u00a0Re: f2=1-2n\n\nHi Daniel,\n\nI am not sure that there is a clear derivation that you are looking for.

Calloway and Vaughn. Please be advised that pursuant to Section 14.4 of the Purchase Agreement dated November 4, 2004, we have placed certain assets that are subject to the asset transfer agreement that you recently sent over to us in our depository at 15 York St., in Toronto, to await the return of those assets to ABC. These assets are detailed in a list attached to our email of December 14, 2004, (see attachment A). I assume these are the assets that are under your custody. If you have any objections to this deposit, you must advise us\nEmail 4:\n[RECEIVED AT TIME OF EMAIL]\nDear Mr. McGroarty,\nThank you for your email. Please be advised that we have no objections to the list you provided to us. However, the list in question has not been previously reviewed by the Board of Directors of ABC and therefore we are unable to provide you with any information regarding the specific assets. It is our understanding that our list does not conform to the requirements of the Sale Agreement, particularly since the list reflects that we are permitted to retain certain files and information despite the fact that we are prohibited from using or retaining any ABC Confidential Information, as set out in the Sale Agreement. This is a concern to our Board of Directors.\n\nPlease be advised that your proposal to place certain of our assets in a depository pending return to ABC is inappropriate and contrary to the terms of the Sale Agreement. Specifically, Section 2.1(a)\nEmail 5:\nI just spoke with Martin but I was copied on the email below. \n    Today is December 17th, 2004 and we continue to have no approved and executed sale agreement. In the meantime, ABC is purging all of our assets and information, and sending same to various unidentified third parties and law firms. \n     We simply cannot accept these proposals in light of ABC's wrongful purging of our assets. All of the discussion contained in your email is irrelevant in light of the purging. Please provide us with a confirmed list of all assets that have been sent to third parties and their names. \n<Email 6>:\nDear Mr. McGroarty,\n\n<Body>: You must withdraw any claim that ABC has breached the purchase agreement. You are not our trading partner; you are our custodian, holding assets that belong to ABC until such time as the transaction is closed",

Do you have any further business questions or suggestions to our market analysis?                    Regards,                    Christa\nEmail 2:\nMorning Christa,                    If I remember correctly, that contract included only containers shipped by steam ship, but I now know that steam ships have been replaced by modern container ships.

Steam ships are extremely dangerous for the containers, even the newest containers. The vibrations produced by the steam engines, and the leaks from the boilers, damage most of the containers in transit.                    That is why we",

The contract says 2,500MT, but they might also require 1,500MT of grain. This order will leave in the first week of July. We need your help.                    How much would shipping 4,000MT of both goods together cost, and do you see any risk of port congestion?                    Many thanks,                    Ivy\nEmail 2:\nHi Ivy,\nGood morning.\n\nThe order for 2,500MT should be easy to manage.\nRegarding the order for 1,500MT of grain, unfortunately, we do not see any vessel available to fit both cargoes in the same vessel. As we are still in June, there are still some free slots available on July, but as the order size is so big, we have limited choices.\nThat being said, we can manage to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain in the same vessel with the owner of a 10,000dwt M\/V which is due to discharge the previous cargo in July. All details about the vessel are as follows:\n\nM\/V T1\nType    General Cargo\nFlag    Liberia\nCall    MOYO\nDeadweight    8,600MT\nBuilt    1996\nHold No\nEmail 3:\nRegarding the risk of port congestion in Australia, I'm afraid the situation is getting worse and that it may be difficult to find a slot for such a big order. Also, the railway terminals are overloaded as well.\nI know the situation seems very bad. I can only offer you the best available. If you are willing to wait till October, I can offer you a better slot with more space. This way, you will be able to fit more products, or reduce the price.\nWhat do you think?\nEmail 4:\nThank you for your help. The information you provided is very useful to us. \nWe want to ship the 4,000MT cargo in early July. We do not have enough storage capacity, so if we delay the delivery, it may lead to the depreciation of our goods, so I'm afraid we can only choose the original plan.\nAlso, we will have more orders to deliver in July. Can you please help us?\nWaiting for your reply!\nRegards,\nIvy\nBest regards,\nMartin\nEmail 5:\nHi Ivy,\n\nI understand that you have to deliver the order at the earliest opportunity, and that you can't wait till October. I'll look for a slot in September for you.\n\nPlease find attached a quotation for 3,000MT and 4,000MT. We can ship 1,000MT in July and 2,000MT or 3,000MT in August. I can fit 2,000MT on a 6,000dwt M\/V which is due to discharge in September and 3,000MT on a 6,500dwt M\/V which is due to discharge in September as well.\n\nDo you have a choice of milk powder or grain as the cargo to be shipped in August?\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\nMartin",

The task is to find an empty container, go to China (pay 0.19$\/MT + 0.05$\/MT bunker) and bring petroleum coke to Azerbaijan (20k MT, 100% B\/L paid, sailing in November).\n\nThe main question for this task is, does the company have a vessel available to take the cargo?\n\nWhat technique(s)\nEmail 3:\nThe main trick is to make this task look like it is for open charter. This makes the victim pay attention to the price, believing it is actually lower than the price of the chartered ship (by the way, let's make it 0.19$). By saying that you will pay 0.05$\/MT for bunker, the victim thinks you are buying bunker, while you are actually renting the vessel.\n\n    Also note that the shipping cost (0.19$) is given to the nearest part of the fourth decimal place, which might look suspicious if the sender and receiver have different countries. It is a very good trick to make such mistakes, as I did in email 2, or even in email 1 if the victim is inexperienced. It makes the victim think he is comparing two similar offers, which they are not, and look bad for not noticing it. Finally",

Neither?\n[2] Is the behavior of these two parties consistent with what you've learned about negotiation?\n[3] How could a technology such as one from IBM Watson Trader help these two parties negotiate better and faster?\nEmail 4:\nAs requested, I am including a snapshot of our web portal as it appears today. It contains information about the markets in which Karen trades, and the freight rates for each trade. The portal also shows how certain factors, such as market volatility, can affect rates. Each sector displays a current snapshot of freight rates for each of the areas that Karen can trade, and a visual map indicating rate fluctuations. Also, freight rates appear in a moving graph which shows trends over the last 30 days. This is quite beneficial for traders who have to make decisions based on live market conditions. \n\nAnother important function is the ship and route selector. When a ship trader selects a specific ship, the system shows in green or red the rates and savings for that specific ship on each route. This helps traders determine which ship and which route to select.\n\nFinally, a major aspect of the technology is the asset manager,\nEmail 5:\nThank you very much for the quick response and information.\nHow do I understand this correctly? The screenshot shows the C\/P from Damietta to Koper. The C\/P for the voyage Damietta -> Koper is 3.25\/3.70 points less compared to the CP for the same route from Rotterdam -> Damietta. This makes a total difference of 3.625 to 5.375 $\/day (depending on the grade). Since the ship owner is not willing to fix the voyage for the entire laycan, but only until next week, I can't make any changes to the CP. \nRegards,\nKaren\n<Email 6>:\n\u00a0 Thanks for your reply.

The lead time will be approximately four days for completing the tanking process.\n\nWe can handle the loading, stuffing, and lashing, while you will be responsible for fixing and sealing the hatch. Please confirm if the cargo will be using hatch cover or double-containerization so we can prepare accordingly.\n\nRegarding the $2,500 rate for the last two shipments, we cannot accept this condition as terminal handling fees and port storage costs are included in the quoted price.

What\u2019s your freight rate?                    Best,                    Andreas\nEmail 2:\nEmail 1:\nNick,\n\nIn response to your email, 8,000MT of EVA resin from India to Turkey? No, no, no, we don't have the space, but we are talking about 15,000MT to Taiwan? Yes, yes, yes.\n\nThe freight rate? Maybe $10.5, definitely not$11.\n\n<Email 3>:\nEmail 1:\nNick,\n\nThat's good news. 15,000MT of EVA resin from India to Taiwan. It sounds much better.\n\nBut we have a problem: I just learned that the customer in Turkey and the customer in Taiwan are the same. It's just a customer's secondary office. I don't think they will need that much EVA resin in both places at the same time. If it's like 15,000MT, I'm afraid they will cancel the order.\nEmail 3:\nEmail 1:\nNick,\n\nThat's good news. 15,000MT of EVA resin from India to Taiwan. It sounds much better.\n\nBut we have a problem: I just learned that the customer in Turkey and the customer in Taiwan are the same. It's just a customer's secondary office. I don't think they will need that much EVA resin in both places at the same time. If it's like 15,000MT, I'm afraid they will cancel the order.\n\n<Email 3>:\n Email 1:\nNick,\n\nI have talked to my customer and I was right: The secondary office is an independent operation. There is a limit of 10,000MT per office. We'll need to divide the shipment between the two offices. Can we split it? And can we lower the freight rate? This would help us get a better offer.\n\n<Email 3>:\nEmail 1:\nNick,\n\nThank you for your response. I appreciate your ideas.\n\nWe're going to divide the shipment between the two offices. This means we'll need two ships and twice as many containers. I think it would be better to get a better freight rate. Is $10.5 per MT too much? <Email 3>:\nEmail 1: Nick,\n\nThat's a relief, the 10,000MT limit per office. I'm thinking 7,000MT to Taiwan\nEmail 4:\nEmail 1:\nHi Nick,\n\nThat sounds much better. We're going to change the quantity to 7,000MT. Let's see what your customer says. The last time, he wasn't convinced.\n\n<Email 4>:\nEmail 1:\nNick,\n\nGreat! 7,000MT. But one more question. The buyer in Taiwan doesn't need to take the full 7,000MT. He has the room for just 6,000MT. Can we get a better rate with just 6,000MT?\n\n<Email 4>:\n Email 1: Nick, Yes, let's talk about freight rate. We're on the same page. We're talking about 6,000MT of EVA resin from India to Taiwan. One more thing: Our shipper needs to know the port. <Email 4>:\nEmail 1:",

Actually, I have just sent an email regarding the new liner service through Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode to VRS China. Let me know if you get that. I am not sure about the sea transport to India since I am not from that dept. But I would like to go for the FCL rate of Hoegh Autoliner as there is an attractive rate by these carriers.                    One of my friends of Taiwan is also very interested in this carrier. She will go for 10\/20 cbm containers. But they were waiting for the government\u2019s final approval. Anyway, please wait for our China dept\u2019s advice.                    Any other queries please contact me at any time.                    Have a nice day!

Thank you for the offer! Do you have any indication on the timing of the service? In addition, do you think I should consider 33\/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev as well? I did not include those carriers in the original email because my thinking was that they are more suitable for 2016. Still, the volumes will be the same for both years. Sarah\n\n\nIn this email exchange, Sarah was mainly interested in the future developments of Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. She also mentioned that she wanted to discuss an alternative carrier, Golden Highway and Damleev.\n\n<Email 4>:\nSubject",

Moving the deal forward would make us an attractive proposition.                     3) Finally, in relation to the rate you quoted for the electronics firm, I\nEmail 4:\nDear Patrick,                     I am sorry to say that we will not be able to work with you on the electronics firm deal.

It's not my fault.]  Since the signing of the Neutrality\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama of 1926, the Panama Canal has been operated as an interoceanic highway in a manner which has been equitable and impartial to all the merchant vessels of all nations, and in a manner consistent with the operation of other interoceanic waterways. The tolls for the use of the waterway have been established in the Treaty at rates which\n\nwould be consistent with the tolls charged to vessels\nEmail 4:\nI suspect we will have to hire a cargo lawyer. I think you should make the accusation of discrimination then. See if the Secretary of State for Transport will provide a legal opinion. Or failing that then get a private firm to challenge the 'owners' of the canal in their own backyard.  With a guaranteed doubling of the revenue they should have no interest in the details.\nAs a minimum get them to explain the 'adjusted and equitable tolls' arrangement.\n\n- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -                                                                                                                                                 Sam:                      I suspect you are right.

This gives room for miscommunication as well as mistrust between the two sides. That\u2019s why it is important to understand how to communicate professionally in business correspondence.\n\n## What is Business Correspondence?\n\nA message sent and received via a written form is known as a business correspondence. It is crucial as it provides information on the various activities of an organization. There are several forms of business correspondence. They include formal business letters, e-mails, and memos.\n\nThe letter types might be used to communicate with customers, clients, or employees. Some examples of business correspondence include application letters\nEmail 4:\nDear Mr. Kiriil,\nWe are very pleased to hear that you would like to become a regular customer of ours.  It is unfortunate that we have to turn down your offer due to the company policy.  We are not able to issue you with a regular customer card due to the fact that we do not use regular customer cards.  Our company has its own credit rating system which is used for the purpose of establishing customer loyalty.  In future, we would be able to offer you a credit line which we can tailor to your needs.  We would like to assure you of our continuing cooperation.\nYours sincerely,\nMaria\n<\/Email 4>\n<Email 5>:\nDear Mr. Christopher,\nWe regret to inform you that we cannot continue to do business with your company.

There is a chunk of stone with the date 2014, then there is a map that was drawn by the Aboriginals in a nearby valley that shows where to go next.

So, we got a 300MT slot from Dhaka to Tejing on 13th June. When should we arrive at Tejing port? Also, what\u2019s the daily demurrage rate there?                                        You rock!                                        Alex\nEmail 2:\nI know you are very busy but I need to know the port arrival time for June shipment. Could you let me know it for me please? We also need to know how much demurrage will be at Tejing port?\n\n[Response] Thanks for reaching out, I\u2019m happy to help. Your container should arrive on the 29th of June, the demurrage is $500 per day. As for what time, it depends when your truck arrives at the port and the port\u2019s efficiency. As the summer is very hot in China, the best time is around 10-11am. Let me know if you need anything else! Best, Bruce\nEmail 3:\nWe want to send more containers from Dhaka to China but we\u2019re not sure of the best way to do it. Can you send us an email on how to do it? Also, can we send it by air instead of by sea? What\u2019s the difference? I can send you my details so you can get back to me with the best rates.

The container is 20 ft, with a weight of 11 MTs. What would the estimated price be? We\u2019d like it to be as cost-effective as possible, but also have a fast transit time. Also, can we get an estimate of the demurrage rate at the destination port? Thanks!                                        Mark Huang, Huawei\n[Response] Hello Mark! I can do",

The Port of Elizabeth is basically a bit \u201crustic\u201d. Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility.

The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt\/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt\/h.

When is your next voyage to Dalian?                    If we could charter your vessel directly from your current port, perhaps London, then that would greatly reduce our shipping costs and we would definitely prefer to charter with you.

They have the most advanced docking equipment and their crews are very experienced. They are also one of the fastest ports in the world with an average unloading time of 15 minutes per ship.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider a third-party port. I know a company called 'Aloha Stevedoring' who can handle your requirements.

They are also one of the fastest ports in the world with an average unloading time of 15 minutes per ship.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider a third-party port. I know a company called 'Aloha Stevedoring' who can handle your requirements. They have an excellent reputation with top-tier facilities.\n\nAll the best,\nCory"

Are you sure we have a 50-foot container deal with you? If we had a 50-foot container deal with you, I would've thought you would've offered us the container first because we are an origin based company. Also, I'm not sure what 'book' means in this context. There are not many 50-foot container companies in Canada and if we had a deal with you, I would be sure about that.\nRegards,\nNeeta\nNeeta Bhojwani\nPresident\nAsia-USA Logistics Inc\nPh: 604-568\nEmail 4:\nFrom: Cuenca, Paul\nTo: Bhojwani, Neeta\nSubject: Re: Free 50ft Container\nDate: Wednesday, February 17, 2010 11:47:31 AM\nHi Neeta,\nYes, we will book it as you wish. We will also book the 20ft container for you, however, we need to move it as a OOG from the main line to the OOCL main line. We need to move it to Keelung for OOCL to pick it up from there.

Unfortunately it is not appropriate for you to pass charges like this on to the cargo owners without their consent. If you are able to provide evidence that this is the owners\u2019 responsibility (e.g. a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo), we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses, but if you are just making up charges to pay your agency then it is unethical and we will not pay you.\nThank you,\nAlain Ferris\nPS: We also need a few more details on the cargo (origin, grade, product code), which will enable us to get a more accurate quote for the freight.\nPPS: The more information you are able to provide in your emails, the faster we can give you an answer, and the less likely it is that you will have",

Horeb Shipping Captain X\n\nForward to the second email: \"How much is the shipping cost to the same spot, but the destination changed to Shantou?\"                From X's\nEmail 3:\nDear Captain X,                        Thank you for your prompt reply.                        We would like to book cargo as you mentioned in your email 2.                        The information you need is as follows:                        Quantity: 30,000MT (weight)                        Type: Soybean meal                        Packed in 50kg jumbo bags                        Packed in 1,200 bags per 40'HC container                        Destination: Shantou                        Port of loading: Chongqing                        In the end of June this year, my company and a dealer made an agreement of selling and buying the above soybean meal at the agreed price of 1,300USD per MT.                        I'm wondering if I can still make the shipment at such price even now it's September.                        Thanks in advance.                        Sulek\n<Email 4>:\nDear Suheki,                        I've checked with our freight\nEmail 4:\nDear Suheki,                        I've checked with our freight\n\n<Email 4>:\n Dear Suheki,                        I've checked with our freight representative. I'm afraid the above rate is no longer available.                        It seems that after your July inquiry, the freight cost has been rising continuously. In September, the rate could be around 12,000USD\/30,000MT. It's quite expensive compared with your original contract of 1,300USD per MT.                        I'm afraid your soybean meal could be sold at a lower price now.                        Regards,                        Captain X\nEmail 5:\nDear Captain X,                        That's terrible!                        It seems that we can't make it.                        At that time we agreed the contract price was only 1,300USD per MT. If we reduce the price further, we'll definitely lose some money.                        I don't know how to explain this to the client.                        I'd better tell him to take some other cargo.                        I will close this deal with the seller now.                        Thanks.                        Sulek\n<Email 6>:\n Dear Suheki,                        It's a pity.                        I think that if we still insist to take the cargo, we can at least minimize the loss. We can fix the rate for the shipment.                        If we reduce the price further, we'll definitely lose some money.                        I'd better tell him to take some other cargo.

Could you handle a late-July laycan, and are you open to a short load window?                    Best,                    Aqaba\nEmail 2:\nHi J. Pye,                    I\u2019m writing you about your question. However, due to some problems with confidentiality, I will have to address this email as being from someone other than me.                    I can handle a late July load date, but you must understand that it may take us a few weeks to secure the necessary permits. You can help speed things along by hiring a third party to find out who the permits are issued to, and to pay them for their services. Your cargo is a noxious substance that has been denied to others in the past, so this must be done delicately. The load window can be as short as 3-4 days, but we\u2019ll have to include that in the permits, too.                    Yours,                    Aqaba\n\n<Email 3>:\nDear Mr. Zhao,                    This is in response to your message about the grade of sulph",

We can accommodate a shipment of 3000MT of rubbish, but I'm concerned by your use of a boxship. Sure, it'll transport the garbage, but you're going to have to pay out the wazoo to get one. My advice is to go the less expensive route and use your neighbor's trash cans for the operation. Those are typically made of cheap plastic that is easy to transport by land. I wish you the best of luck!            James               ----- Original Message -----               To: James S.

We'd be happy to take on your job! We're going to need to know a few things before we can proceed though:               What is your trade?               How far do you need to go?               What are you going to do with all of that garbage in the end? (toxic waste? Trash that will just be dumped into the ocean somewhere?)               This is actually the largest cargo ship in the world. But yes, I guess you could consider it a \"boxship.\" Oh but don't worry! We'll make sure to go easy on the plastic that way it won't weigh so much and we won't use up too much fuel.

A bill was introduced in the state legislature that would provide a tax incentive to encourage renewable fuel blending\nEmail 3:\nIt\u2019s been busy around the warehouses. We are in the process of getting our Fall products ready. We have had some order cancellations so we will have a few spots open. We are reevaluating our shipping schedules. We are now shipping later than we did last year. It appears that the weather is not cooperating. We will keep you informed as we get better weather conditions. Some 20-inch rocks have not made it to the Southeastern states due to weather conditions and we are not sure when we will get them in.",

You think it\u2019s as easy as going on constructionobserver and asking for bids. Just how much it costs for a quote and if there is a minimum number of products you have to buy.\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s an education. Like how the Navy discovered it would lose too many crewmen if they started a major war without undergoing combat training first, so they decided to create such training so that every year they would lose fewer and fewer crews. Combat training also provided the Navy with the opportunity to evaluate newly created equipment and armaments.\n\nIn short, anyone can be an entrepreneur. You don\u2019t need to be the richest",

First question they asked was about storage cost. I made sure to talk about all different prices based on different quantities and then I explained the storage conditions. I never mentioned that in my price I included free delivery to the factory, in my opinion it is better to ask all questions before talking about details. You do not know what questions they can ask.\n\nWhen I received the email below, I was a bit shocked about the question. However I managed to answer it quickly as follows:\n\nSina\n\nFrom:\nEmail 3:\n> _We can handle your storage in Mombasa. The price is 1.2$\/MT on 1 month with total quantity of 5,400MTs. We can deliver the cargo by truck directly to your factory. But the price depends on the distance._ \n\n\n> _For example, from Mombasa port to Machakos it is 70 Km. The price is 40\/MT. From Mombasa to Athi river it is 50KM. The price is 30\/MT._\n\n\n> _Regards, Basil_ \n\n\nDear Sina, Thank you for your email. We can handle your storage in Mombasa. The price is 1.2$\/MT on 1 month with total quantity of 5,400MTs. We can deliver the cargo by truck directly to your factory. But the price depends on the distance. For",

The main factor here is that every port of origin in this region has its own cargo\u2019s name that differs from one port to another. Let me give you an example. Vung Tau\u2019s oil is usually known as \u201cXONE\u201d, for example. If the cargo\u2019s origin was not Vung Tau, it would be known as something different. In the first email, the seller is probably from Vung Tau, the port\nEmail 3:\n<3>\nThanks for your email.                    We have an available vessel.

Best regards,                    [Your name]                    [Your address]\n\nso he doesn\u2019t want to use the common port of origin name, but he wants to use the name of the port where his product originates from.\n\nWe have, however, to be cautious when receiving information from an agent, because often it is not completely correct. If the agent wants to sell his cargo by using an incorrect cargo name, it is much easier for him to trick the buyer by giving a name that has a higher profit for him, or a name that is more familiar for the potential buyer. This issue is something that we have to be aware of. We have to make sure that the cargo is what we think it is, and if we\u2019re sure that we know the exact",

There are reasons why they could be having difficulty in getting through to their target. This happens frequently when it comes to end-user targets in emerging markets.\nI always leave two days in my inbox to send another follow up email after the first one is sent and then at the end of the day send another one.

Do you think this is acceptable?

However, in reality most of the bunker will be consumed when the vessel travels from load to discharge port and you should pay to us the bunker consumed only from discharge port to load. In this case as we see from the",

For example, to say\n\n\"we are thinking of shipping X amount of crude oil from A to B\", \"We'd like to buy X amount of crude oil from A to B\", etc.\n\nThe PNP here is the \u201cthinking of shipping\u201d, \u201cwanting to buy\u201d, and the rest of the action words.\n\nSince we were looking for clues on who had expressed interest in the cargo (Tim or Spain), this definitely should give you some",

Are you requesting that we **decompose** two decades of the same dataset into a much more manageable number of, say, three to four *decades*, so that I can apply this new algorithm to the entire dataset with more manageable storage?\n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean by **\"decompose** the first 10 years,\" but I'll guess that you are asking me to compress the first 10 years of data down to a smaller amount. If that is your request, I'll note that the changes in the dataset have slowed considerably, so I would expect that the 11th decade would have a smaller compression than the 10th decade.

In this case, you need to be direct and say that you cannot send a freight quotation without that document.

The buyer should realize that this is the only way for you to take an offer. It is your first line of defense against waste of time. Other brokers might not understand that they need to ask for the material specification because they do not have a \"ship\" yet, so they can only discuss price and laycan.
