It is difficult to serve one destination, like Lagos, with one service, since there are a number of ports in Africa, some with different schedules and times. Depending on where your cargo is in India, you may or may not have a vessel coming into the subcontinent to Lagos. You can check the arrival times for Lagos on our website by using the Port Schedule Search Tool here: https://cma-cgmschedules.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/    CMA CGM offers a variety of services which vary by region, sometimes even by port.

Sorry, we just couldn't wait to see the space on the ship. So we just booked from the single importers.                    By the way, we had noticed that 2,000MT of rice has been sold from Vietnam with a coir yarn.                    I have to say, this doesn't make any sense. Who would buy rice from Vietnam when we have the largest yarn production facility in the world just a few miles away?                    I was hoping to find a very good transport deal from Thailand to Malaysia to Hong Kong on a convenient schedule, but I see you just sold the berths.

Do you charge a holding fee for \u2018storing\u2019 the cargo before it\u2019s picked up? How much does your insurance policy cost per container and per mile, and what would be the premium on 1,200 MT of salt?                    Thanks,                    Lloyd\nEmail 2:\nYour e-mail was received on my cell phone at 6:00pm the other day and I phoned you as soon as I arrived home. If I\u2019d not have had your phone number I\u2019d have had no way of calling you back. It\u2019s terrible that our systems don\u2019t communicate with each other. What if you hadn\u2019t been here when I arrived home?                      Is there any way that we can make our email systems speak to each other? At least phone numbers.                      Sincerely, <Name>\nEmail 3:\nSince you received my email yesterday morning at around 7:30am, I figured you\u2019d be able to help me with my salt order. So I phoned your office around 11:00am yesterday. You never answered the phone and I left a message on your machine. Did you get the email and you\u2019re just pretending not to? Or you didn\u2019t even get the email?                      So I phoned you again at 3:30pm. You answered this time. I had to leave a message, which you probably didn\u2019t even bother to listen to. The point of the message was that I\u2019m very, very unhappy that you haven\u2019t returned my emails.                      Just in case you can\u2019t read my mind, the reason I\u2019m so unhappy is because you didn\u2019t even reply to the email, and you took hours to phone me back. I don\u2019t know whether you\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

Please check the weight of other 4,180 tons. In the end the total price should be $682/MT. Can you kindly confirm for me the final price?           Thank you.

The only mistake you made was to address the receiver using their first name rather than the title of their position.

The vessel should have at least 7 km/h to 8 km/h operational speed and a high maneuverability.                Furthermore, if possible, the vessel would be ideal if it was designed to include a furnace for the production of liquefied hydrocarbons.                The Bunker / Chemical carrier should be able to dock at a loading and unloading facility in the Ulsan industrial complex\nEmail 4:\nSubject: FW: Opportunity for solution proposal               Dear Mr. Farrokhi,                We are pleased to be in touch with you and have the pleasure of responding to your initial request from a few days ago.

I am looking for a commitment in August with the possibility to extend in September, and I need to know if this is possible on your end.

B) All other costs, including port charges, mooring costs, fuel, and other costs related to port operations.

Could you share your best offer, and is there any discount if laytime is under 36 hours?                    Best,                    Lisa\nEmail 2:\nHi Amit,                We have 2.5kMT of molasses ready in Sanganeb bound for Angola. We are quoting you $75/MT CFR, but would like to drop the laytime requirement down to 30 hours to encourage fast turnaround.                  What's your best?                   Kind regards,                   Lisa\nEmail 3:\nHi Amit,                Could you please advise me what would be your best quote?                Your last tender was at $60/MT. We are ready to load 25kMT. Could we talk more about possible discounts as we would like to do a minimum order of 100kMT.                 Kind regards,                   Sandhya\nEmail 4:\nAmit - Do you mind not using Araiqi to load as our vessels have 10m beam and we require a FAL (fast anchor light) to handle the width. We can do last minute changes to loading points if need be. Could you offer a FAL discount?\n\n<Email 5>:\nAmit,                    Please give me your best offer for molasses from Angariga - E.g. 30,000 MT x $80 / MT C&F Algeciras . I hope to get a very good deal.                    Kind regards,                    Ralf\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.
