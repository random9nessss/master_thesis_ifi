Those options are unlikely to provide results. A lawsuit is unlikely to provide any meaningful debt relief. The debt collector will still be able to sue you, and the amount the court orders you to pay will be larger than the amount you owe. Your credit will be affected, and a judgment will remain\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

I would like to place this charter order but there are some issues I need to resolve before I can send you payment.\n  The first issue is the floating rate, which appears to have jumped up since your last communication.  I'm worried that the final rate may exceed our budget.  Could you please provide me with the current floating rate, in USD, and the cost of living in the intermediate port?  I would like to know these details before I can give you the final go-ahead.\n  The second issue is the lead time to loading, which is unfortunately too long for my project timeline.  I will need this vessel as soon as possible.

This will allow the vessel to reach maximum draft in Nanjing and improve its discharge efficiency. Since Nanjing has less costs on one side (manpower and cargo handling) and Shanghai on the other (draft and terminal fees), we\u2019d recommend you to start the discharging from Nanjing.

Kolhe would like to offer you a very low price for the new wave of ignition tubes we will have available in March. The current bid that Kolhe has for this particular area is for 1 million kits at $200 each. Kolhe is very willing to cut a deal in which you will get the tubes for $100 per kit if you put the order in now, and will pay 1 million for 500 thousand more kits when you will be ready to place the final order. You will also need to commit to providing us with ten million more tubes a year, each one for $200.                    This plan will insure that Kolhe will have a dependable source of income until we can start producing the tubes ourselves.

Are you willing to work with Alvin or are you insisting that he review the plan?                     I need a definite answer from you.                     Thanks.
