Regards,                    Andrew\nEmail 2:\nDue to the complexity of bulk rates, both simple and indexed escalation clauses are commonly used in the\nsea cargo market. Bulk rates are based on bunker price and tonnage. Escalation clauses are used to\nimplement the benefits of a bunker cost increase and prevent the carrier from changing the contract rate\nand extending it through an escalation clause. Generally, escalation clauses are used when a contract\npurchaser is concerned about the impact of a bunker price increase. Should the bunker price increase,\nbulk rates and contracts are usually adjusted accordingly. A bunker escalation clause allows the parties\nto index their contracts on a timely basis rather than having to wait until a contract is being renewed or\nterminated. In addition, an escalation clause in a contract increases the incentive for the parties to\nachieve cost savings by allowing the buyer to negotiate an adjustment when the seller is benefiting from\na rise in the cost\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

As per our past experiences, most vessels from Antwerp take 10-12 days to arrive Houston. Also, most vessels will be full loaded for India with sulphuric acid as a ballast cargo, which will mean lower revenue for the vessel and therefore higher freight costs. I would recommend using a break-bulk vessel to optimise freight costs, especially given the uncertainty regarding international economic conditions.

However, the weekend rate for a shipment of that size is 120 US$/MT. As you know, this exceeds your Daywork cap of 100US$/MT. Could you please provide more information on the exact timing of this cargo for us to be able to offer a more accurate quote?                    Regards, Jonas\n\nFrom 2:\nHi Le\nEmail 3:\nHi Jonas,                    Sorry about that. We're pretty flexible on this one. We can cut the load by 500MT to a total of 3,500MT and leave from the 19th morning. We also have the capacity for another tanker to come.
