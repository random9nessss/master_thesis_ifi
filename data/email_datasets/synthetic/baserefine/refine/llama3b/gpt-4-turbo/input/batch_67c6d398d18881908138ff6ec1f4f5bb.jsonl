Is it still feasible for us to ship by 19 July? We\u2019re worried about tariff risk due to COP26, so please let us know your best offer.                    Many thanks,                    Adrian\nEmail 2:\nKoen,               I hope you\u2019re well. I\u2019ve read through the COP26 tax proposal with interest. As you are aware, the EDC tax rate will increase to 6% in 2023, which means it could reach $70 / mt if the rate doesn\u2019t rise again in the following years. Therefore, it\u2019s important for us to ship this order before COP26 takes effect, as we\u2019re planning on increasing our exposure to ALUMINIUM. I have a few questions:\n        1. The current EDC tax rate is 3% and there\u2019s an additional 3% tax in 2023 and 4% in 2024. Is there any clarity on what the rate will be in the following years? I know this may change, but it\u2019s difficult to predict. (Answer: In 2024, it may be 4% as\nEmail 3:\n1. We also have a product which is looking to ship in November. Do you think it is worth\nconsidering a new LCOE contract on top of the cost for us? (Answer: Yes, it might be worth it. There\u2019s a good probability of seeing it drop because of the weakening Dalian index. But don\u2019t expect the same discount as in previous deals. It\u2019s quite difficult to find lumps in the market. LCOEs are hard to find.)\nKoen,            I've sent the documentation in the email. Please let me know if there are any issues.

I believe this is for the ELT payment, which was done in May.                    However, I didn\u2019t receive any communication from you about this. I was waiting for an update before making the payment. If it\u2019s ELT payment, it shouldn\u2019t be this high, should it?

Looking forward to your reply,                    Tal\nEmail 2:\nHi Tal,                Thank you for the inquiry. We will be glad to proceed with your inquiry. Our minimum amount of deposit is US$100,000. Since you are requesting 8 shipments, our total minimum amount of deposit would be US$800,000. We will require this amount to be made as 8 instalments of US$100,000 each. This amount will be deducted from the total value of your shipments. For instance, if you are shipping 3,200MT of diesel at US$500 per MT, the total cost of your shipment would be US$1,600,000. US$800,000 will be deducted from this amount making the total cost US$800,000. Our advance payment requirement is for us to guarantee your shipment. This amount will be considered a surety.

Our forwarders are more risk-averse than what most people would think. They have limited resources and they have to spend most of their money on freight.

I have enough capacity to take 20,000MT of goods, and there's nothing here that would make up that amount. However, since you were kind enough to provide the account, I have decided to charge you 2% of the value of what I could have transported (60,000MT of napalm) just for the hell of it. To do this, I will take a 1000 napalm trip, which will cost you: 100000 napalm, 100000 rubber, 200000 rupees, and 1200 napalm/roundtrip.

We're going to need a booking cost of $35 per unit of MT to hold the cargo in Rotterdam, and of course we'll have to pay for delivery to destination.                    Best,                     Dana\n\n<Email 5>:\nCarl,                     That's good news. I'll send you an invoice shortly.
