Thank you,                    Maria\nEmail 2:\nDear Maria,                    Unfortunately I do not ship varnishes to the New Orleans area and would prefer not to. That being said if I do a search of my available inventory and find anything that is suited to your needs, I will contact you immediately.                    If however it's just another product you are shipping that's not on the Hotwire system, I'd be more than happy to assist you. I can make sure you get the correct documentation and arrange for the import.                    In either case, let me know if you have any questions. Have a great day.                    Maria\nEmail 3:\nDear Ms. Wood,\nFirst off I would like to say I appreciate the prompt response in regard to my last email. I see you have some inventory available, but they do not meet my shipment's needs. If I were to contact you about something different would it be a problem? That being said I am a consultant in the logistics industry and my services are always free of charge and as per the contract there is no obligation to you to purchase through my companies.  There are many people out there looking to cut costs in logistics and I can get them better rates than you can. \nThat being said I have contacted a gentleman in New York that could get me the varnishes to Louisiana if needed. Now for my question. I'd like to give you a call sometime next week to review my rates so you know how I can assist you with your shipments. I really want to help,\nEmail 4:\nHi Maria,\nThanks for the call and the offer to help. It is always a good idea to learn from the competition and see if there are ways to improve. Here's the problem though, with someone giving a 'free quote' on a project there is no commitment to us, which means they have to do whatever they have to do to get that deal. I'm sure they're better than Hotwire, but they will lose you and then we have to deal with you again. That's why I'm so hesitant to send quotes to people I don't know.\nI do hope we'll keep in touch and maybe, sometime, we'll see if I can't help you on a project.\nEmail 5:\nMs. Wood,\nDear Ms. Wood,\nI was sorry to hear you are not interested in helping me, but if you are interested in consulting me about any way to improve my shipping cost I am always open to any ideas. I would appreciate if we could at least start off with a friendly email. I am glad you offered help, but you might want to consider to not offer help and save yourself some time. Thank you and have a good day.\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

It seems like you want to get the rice as soon as possible, but I\u2019m not sure that this is the case.                    There are many routes that you can take, but here are the most important factors that will determine the right shipping line for you.                    The length of time from departure to arrival is important because you need to know when the ship will arrive in Qingdao. It\u2019s important to know if the ship is going to arrive in a timely fashion, or if it will be delayed due to weather conditions or other unexpected events. The longer it takes for the ship to arrive, the more money you will have to pay to cover any delays that might occur.

Could you give us an idea of what your freight rate will be, and whether you would be able to move it in time to make our deadlines?                    Thanks,                    Chris\nEmail 2:\nHi Chris,                        Thank you for contacting me. As you\u2019re aware, we do transport steel coils, but have the service down to only a few weekly trips. I will put in a request to see if I can make the next available route to cover your needs.                    If you can hold a few weeks for our service, it will be the most economical. I have included some of our general pricing for similar services so you can understand the value of our services.                    I would highly recommend loading the cargo with the opening side up for more protection from the elements. You can do this with one person as shown in the video.

I believe you know I can guarantee to move the product for them, and you can do so in exchange for a small percentage. Could you let me know if that\u2019s a possibility? I\u2019ll be on vacation until the end of the month, so it may be a little while before you get back to me.                    Please reply to this email if you can. I really need to get this cleared up before my departure.                    Sincerely,                    Sara\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.
