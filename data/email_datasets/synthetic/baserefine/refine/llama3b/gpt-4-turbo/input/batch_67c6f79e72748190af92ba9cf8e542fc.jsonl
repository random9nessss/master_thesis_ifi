Do you foresee any port draft limitations?                    Best regards,                    Mandy\nEmail 2:\nHi Mandy,                         We have three vessels on order to begin operating in Yangon this week, so no doubt there will be port draft restrictions, but we're in no position to commit to a certain percentage.                    We are able to ship your cargo in 25,000 MT increments, and we would be delighted to work on a finalised shipment for you in early October.

We now understand there will be a reduction in capacity at Yangon in early October, and we can definitely accommodate your vessels.  However, we are having trouble finding accurate draft information, and we'd like to make sure we're getting our quotes to our customers as soon as possible.                    I'm assuming there will be no difference in draft requirements for our other vessels, and I'm also assuming the draft is the same for all ships.                    Could you please let me know the information I need to provide to my customers in order to get accurate quotes?                    Thanks,                Mandy\nEmail 4:\nHi Mandy,                      The exact minimum draft will be determined by when each vessel comes into Yangon, as we have a range of charterers and we can't possibly ask for 24 separate quotes. We will try our best to give you quotes, but the degree of variation is dependent on what we are able to procure on the spot.                    It's currently being confirmed that we will not be able to access the shallow draft ports, so that would be off the table for your vessels.  Once we've confirmed what we can provide, we'll get back to you.  Please don't hesitate to contact me directly with any questions.

You can choose how many emails you\u2019d like to get sent in one go, what attachments and links you would like to use in your message, as well as how you want them to be worded. It is easy to set this up and use, and it's completely free. Here's a link: https://trytemplate.xyz</p>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<p>Or you could also use our live chat feature, where\n\n<Email 5>:\n </p>\n\n<a href=\"#html_injection\">go back to text</a>\n\n</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h4>Live chat</h4>\n\n<p>Another way to send email and get a response quickly is by using live chat. This is an instant messaging service that allows you to send messages to people who are online at the same time as you. This is especially helpful when you need to quickly get a response from someone but don't have time to wait for them to get back to you via email.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<p>To use live chat, you'll need to download a client like WhatsApp or Google Hangouts. Once installed, simply click on the 'Chat' button and enter the person's username or phone number into the 'Chat with' field. You'll then be able to type out a message and send it off.</\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

The Weather in the NE is terrible right now and will be for a while. All the Metro stations in the NE are shutdown due to the adverse weather. Not only has the weather impacted my ability to access my e-mail but it also adversely affected my laycan estimates.                   Many of the hubs have changed their flight schedules to allow for extra time and I will have to update those same laycan estimates as well as many of our other hubs. I will send you a brief report of those adjustments soon. However, in the meantime, I just wanted to let you know that the extra time needed to get these estimates to you by today is due to the weather situation.

But I must tell you, the payments for these cargoes are yet to arrive. I will advise you as soon as I have further news.
