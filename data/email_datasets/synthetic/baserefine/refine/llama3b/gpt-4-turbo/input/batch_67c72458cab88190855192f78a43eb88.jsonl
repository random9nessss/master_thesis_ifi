Best regards,                    Penny\nEmail 2:\nHello Penny,\n    It depends on the vessel being used and the type of material being loaded.\n    When you move 12500mt in a single shipment, there are some factors that affect this amount as well:\n    1) Max. Weight of each vessel, which depends on the type of vessel (tanker, lighthouse, etc.)\n    2) The \u201ctype\u201d of material that you are transporting and their density.\n    3) The amount of space you are occupying in each \u201cstack\u201d (which can range from one to five depending on the type of vessel and its design)\n    So, basically, you should consider that for every ton of material you move you can load a specific amount of empty spaces available (which is determined by the vessel\u2019s design and type) in order to have a full \u201cload\u201d but it\u2019s not a guarantee that you will fill all\nEmail 3:\nI\u2019m glad to know that you\u2019re interested in this topic.

I'm currently considering the transportation of Pallets from China to a location in North America. However, before I proceed with the order, I need to know how much it will cost per shipment. Could you help me with that?                    Thank you,                    Mika\nEmail 5:\nThanks Mika for your message.            Shipping  Pallets from China to North America can vary depending on the country of origin and destination. The most common route would be a maritime vessel travelling through the Panama Canal and being loaded onto a container ship.            For a start, here's an estimate for shipping a pallet of 4 m2 from China to Los Angeles: US$200 per shipment (equivalent to US$80 per cubic metre).

This section examines a sample of email threads between buyers and sellers. In many ways, email resembles face-to-face conversations, which were analyzed in the last section.\n\nEmails are more asynchronous than face-to-face conversations. While email conversations allow for a lot of discussion, they are also prone to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and misinterpretation. Email users can only respond to a message when they receive it, but in the process of email composition, it takes a lot of time before a response is sent. Communication between two email users is often delayed and incomplete. Also, email messages are prone to re-read\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Unfortunately, the price for CFCL is not the only reason we decided to stop importing this material.                    As you know, with the growing production of carbon fiber products, the supply of CFCL has become more limited, and it has become more difficult to secure it.                    Also, there are no warehouses in the USA that are licensed to store this product.                    Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of this material, and not to damage it during transportation, we have stopped importing CFCL.                    On the other hand, the price of other types of composites is increasing, and CFCL has become relatively more expensive.                    Nevertheless, you are always welcome to reach out to us with your requirements, and we will be more than happy to help you find the best alternative for your project.\nEmail 4:\nDear Mr. Tanoov.                 I will start my project this Monday and would like to place an order immediately for the quantities I need. Could you please provide an updated price list, as well as the specifications for CFCL 54/55 and 56?                    I have a question for you. Where can I get technical data sheets for these materials? As I understand it, CFCL 55 and 56 are available in two variants, with a different thickness. Is it correct?                    Thank you for your attention.                    Lucie\n\nEmail 4:\nGood day, Lucea                    Thank you for reaching out to us.                    Regarding the price, it remains unchanged as stated on our website:                      https://www.canamyte.com/pages/carbon-fiber-composite-materials                      We have updated the prices on the website for our customers and you should see the latest prices\nEmail 5:\nDear Mr. Tanoov.                  Thank you very much for the quick response and updating the prices.                  CFCL 54/55 has 5mm, 7mm and 10mm thicknesses, while CFCL 56 has 10mm and 12mm thickness.                  Is this correct?                   Can you please provide me with technical data sheets for these materials? I understand that you are manufacturing the composites but I would like to have data sheets in case you stop production, and I have to switch to another manufacturer.                    Please find attached images of the product and the technical data sheet for CFCL 55 and 56.                    Thank you for your attention.                    Lucie\n Email 5:\nHi Lucea                    Thank you for your message.                    The quantities of CFCL 55/56 are correct.
