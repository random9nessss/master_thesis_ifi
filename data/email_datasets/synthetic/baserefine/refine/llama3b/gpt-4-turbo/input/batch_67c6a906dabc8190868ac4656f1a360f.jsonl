I just wanted to give you an update on our side: \nWe are expecting to receive the shipment by Saturday, March 19. \nWe also want to give you a special request for the unloading. We would like to unblock your warehouse and then use a forklift to pick up the cargo. After that, you can close the warehouse for the spring. I believe the steamroller is operating right now. We will gladly pay for any extra costs. \nWith great appreciation, \nMr. Zhang\n[VP Sales]\n\n\n<Email 4>:\nHi Mr. Porter,\nWe are pleased to receive the update from [Department removed] about the Bill of Lading number.

I understand that we are only in week 2, but the writing in email 1 isn't as good as it can be. It's a shame because we already wasted a lot of time to form a group, invest in a class room and do a lot of planning. Writing is what makes you sound more professional. You can see why? The current 1st email doesn't speak in a professional manner.

I didn't think that my writing would turn out so bad. I don't know if you want me to do the writing work or not, but I think I'm learning more from it. I like to think of writing like a reflex that can be acquired. There is no use to just sit and wait for Alice to do it right. I really enjoy your emails and really appreciate your feedback. Is it alright if I write the next email and just copy paste everything from my mentor email to save time?

I had the pleasure of meeting you last week and inquiring about         bitumen shipments. I trust you are well and I look forward to your          reply.

If this is not the case, we need to find out why.\nIt looks like email 4 does not have a send button, only save. This means that you cannot send that email. The email should probably be copied over to a separate email in Outlook and sent from there.\n\nAnother thing\nEmail 5:\n>Sir,\n\n>Kindly see below for the updated information.\n\n>Thanks,\n\n>Regards,\n\n>_________\nNote the lack of a signature line below.\n\nUnfortunately, in your case, email 3 is missing signature 4, and email 2 and 4 are missing signature 1. It's possible that the sender has deleted these emails before they were sent.\nI can confirm that the emails are not being sent, they were deleted from my mailbox. This is a security measure taken when email 3 was created (not a complete email).\nSince this is a security measure, there is no way to undo it. However, you can contact me to see if we can send out email 3 using another email address.\nIf we cannot get email 3, we can look into getting email 1.\n\nWhy is my Outlook item missing my signature?\n\nHow to attach a file to an email\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

The AIS calls into Cadiz on 21st August which is out of your risk windows but the AIS only sails to Vigo on the 20th.

In this case, there is no one \"owner\" of the message, and it cannot be seen as a transaction. Because there is no agreed transaction, there is no mechanism for tracking the status of the message, so there is no way to keep track of how many emails have been sent and received.\n\nThis type of situation can be a big problem for business. A simple example is a bill that is not paid. A person may refuse to pay a bill\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

I was wondering if your vsl could make port-to-port delivery by the end of May?                    Thanks,                    Leon\nEmail 2:\nDear Leon,                       Thank you for your email.                   Our latest arrival in Khoula from Australia was 1st April.                   The empty vessel we use is currently in New Zealand.                   The next vessel from Melbourne to Khoula is the XH88, and it will depart on 29th May, we expect to get it at Khoula on 20th June.                   Please contact our agent Mr. Johnson to make an order.

Please note that there are some restrictions on certain commodities, such as firearms and animal-based products, which may not be allowed for export by sea. Therefore, we will need to check these items individually to ensure that there are no further restrictions. If everything is OK, we will send you a proforma invoice for the booking.
