Also, I notice you've been quoted a $2,500 pilotage fee from Tsukaji to Tokyo. I notice this is below the usual charge of $2,750 but can I get a breakdown of the charges for Tsukaji so I can be sure?                    Thanks,                    Susan\nEmail 2:\nMr. Jones,\nThanks for your message. Unfortunately, I cannot carry 6,500MT. \nThere's a bit more to it than the quote I gave you. The quota in Japan is just over 15,000MT and the port of Osaka holds the title of biggest port in the country. In fact, there are two other ports in the Kansai area (Hiroshima and Kobe) that are both bigger than Osaka. For our cargo to be loaded, it would have to be switched from Osaka and that would incur additional costs. Therefore, the whole quote you were given was subject to the eventual port of discharge being Osaka.\n\nI'm sorry I cannot be of more help on the pilotage fee issue. I can only confirm that the pilotage fee has been quoted from Tsukaji as this is the port of call that's on the vessel's I.P. The\nEmail 3:\nAs I indicated before, the vessel cannot carry 6,500MT. Can I please also request a breakdown of the pilotage fees so I can fully understand the costs? I have contacted the port of Osaka regarding the ultimate port of discharge. Due to the current port congestion there, they do not hold any information that can determine when a berth will be available. I will ask them to confirm with the relevant operator and advise you immediately.\nKind regards,\nSusan\nMorning Susan,                          Could you please let me know what you have found out regarding your vessel's port of discharge and port congestion in Osaka. I'm just waiting to hear back from the operators but it seems that they've all been over-loaded with cargo so far this year. I would appreciate your comments ASAP.              Thanks,              Ian\nAlso, please could you provide me with a breakdown of pilotage fees. The carrier I use\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.
