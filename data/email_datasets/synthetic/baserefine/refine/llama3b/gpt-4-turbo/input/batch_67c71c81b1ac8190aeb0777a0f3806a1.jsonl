Backscatter is a technique in which an auto-generated response is sent to the sender, without human intervention. This sort of reply looks as though the recipient is interacting with the sender.\n\nTo prevent backscatter, you can check each individual email for backscatter, or implement tools that stop messages from being sent automatically to a human.\n\nIn the email examples above, an auto-receipt would be sent to Ana. The auto-reply would say something like:\n\nThank you for your email. It has been forwarded to our assigned coffee broker, Mr. Hardy.

We tried our best to minimise the freight cost, because we are a young business.

In terms of price\nEmail 4:\nDear Mr Lau,                    Thank you for all your efforts to secure the shipping quotation. We managed to secure two vessels and are currently in negotiation with the carriers to secure rates for both slots. We will send you an update as soon as we know more.                     Regards,                    Precious\nEmail 5:\nDear Ms Khor,                    We secured both slots, and the final cost of shipping will be less than S$20,000.                    Many thanks,                    Precious\n\n\nIt is important to think about this from the carrier\u2019s perspective, as every shipper has the same cargo. I constantly kept an eye on rates for the same dates as the shippers were looking at, so I could check whether the shippers were taking advantage of rates. The rates of the carriers would change at different times based on many factors, including demand and supply. In fact, there is also a cap on rates by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) due to the deep-sea shipping market becoming an oligopoly, with only a few shipping companies dominating the global shipping market, as is the case with many industries today. As mentioned, it is difficult to find lower rates if they are limited by the IMO,\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

I would like to keep a few thoughts that you brought up in mind during your email to make a decision about our contract.\n\nI am sorry that I had such a hard time when I was trying to place the order. I didn't have a consultant. I did research the prices of FREYSSINET and thought I would do a better job than a consultant. Your note made me think of another idea. Maybe there are even more sources than I could find on my own. There is no doubt that we could get a better price from an agent than a consultant or if you were to provide one, we can save money.\n\nI'm impressed with your analysis\nEmail 3:\nJames,\nThanks for responding to my email. I got a lot of information from your email. I'm sure you don't write these responses every day but it really helps a customer.\n\nI'm especially happy about your last thought about the use of agent or consultant. I did a little research and I learned that you use consultants in about 10% of your orders. This was encouraging to me because we would not be the first. You may want to think about that before you send out the next email. I think we would save enough on fees with a consultant and agent that it would make us come out a lot ahead. Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further.\n\nSincerely,\n[YourName]\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.
