Unfortunately, this cannot be done overnight. I am expecting that the supplier will do some corrective actions within a week and then we can submit another request to the QCP for approval. The key is that the corrective actions are actually implemented in the system and the results are visible to us.\n\nNote: A specific deadline for the implementation of the corrective actions should be communicated to the supplier by the supplier's contract manager\nEmail 4:\nA couple of my colleagues and I have just finished a quality review of the product that is produced by the supplier. The results were that the company has had problems with this product since they started. When we looked into the history, we could see that all the products that were produced were defective. As you know, this is not allowed according to the standards we work with. The reason for this is that the supplier does not have any documented process controls for the production process. We were told by the supplier that they have been working on this for a long time but they have not been able to solve it.\n\nNote: I know that you will have a lot of questions. You should not feel uncomfortable asking questions and if you need to get any information from our side, please do so.

If we want to change the subject, we only need to change the value of WORKFLOW_SUBJECT. However, if we want to add a line to the subject, the code will change to something like this:\n\nWORKFLOW_SUBJECT = 'Last Update on {reviewed_on}: {workorder.name}. Please verify.'\n\n\nIf we want to change the subject line to include a date, we would need to insert a loop\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

A virus, once entered into a computer, takes control and executes a program that produces copies of itself. The advantage to a virus over a macro is that a virus is more difficult to detect and may be attached to legitimate files, in order to pass inspection. In other words, a virus is not usually flagged as a virus, even though it performs no legitimate function.\n\nMany emails can be identified as viruses. If you are suspicious, call the person whose email it was, and tell them what it says.

A virus, once entered into a computer, takes control and executes a program that produces copies of itself. The advantage to a virus over a macro is that a virus is more difficult to detect and may be attached to legitimate files, in order to pass inspection. In other words, a virus is not usually flagged as a virus, even though it performs no legitimate function.\n\nMany emails can be identified as viruses. If you are suspicious, call the person whose email it was, and tell them what it says.

I calculated the margin based on full container load and margin for Kavala to Odessa is:                     0,4*120000 / 12 = 2000$. \nWe should be able to offer 400 EUR as a surcharge for any container size, not only a 20ft one.                     Please, check once again and advise.                   Maria\n\n<Email 4>:\nDear Mrs. D. \nThe margin from the survey is 36%, not 12%. Please confirm.\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

What we are doing is explaining why the first email was confusing. We can see the reasons for the confusion.\n\nThis means the first message is perfectly fine but as it is\nEmail 3:\n<Email 4>:\n\nWhat if we don\u2019t have a conversation or an email thread, or just one word of an email is missing? For example, we have two messages (5 and 6) below\n\nWe might be able to figure out why message 5 is not a good email. But message 6 has to be a good email.\n\nHow about we use the above rationale to find out how many words are missing in the message? So a message should have a dot \u2018.\u2019 followed by a word followed by a dot \u2018.\u2019 and that word cannot be the same word in both messages. Then it will have to be something like this\n\ndot \u2018.\u2019, \u201c\u2026\u201c, dot \u2018.\u2019\n\nNow the question is, how many dots are there? And how many \u201c?\u201d are there? 5 dots and 2 question marks, so we have\n\ndot \u2018.\u2019, \u201c\u2026\u201d, dot\nEmail 4:\nWhat if we don\u2019t have a conversation or an email thread, or just one word of an email is missing?

So we need to find out which word is missing. dot, how? I think the word \u2018email\u2019 is missing.\n\nCheck the spelling in the third message. If the spelling is right, then it is not the word. Now, is it okay for an English message to have two different spelling of a word?\n\nSo, the message 6 above is correct, because the word \u2018word\u2019 and \u2018word\u2019 can be different. And the word \u2018how\u2019 is the word that is missing. So we got it. \ud83d\ude42\n\n## Symbols and missing words\n\nSymbols and other symbols in writing are a powerful and important tool. They make our writing look professional. It helps us make an impression on our audience. Symbols can be thought of as the \u2018stamp of the author\u2019.\n\nIt is even more important to use proper grammar,\nEmail 5:\nIt was one dot instead of two. So we need to find out which word is missing. dot, how? I think the word \u2018email\u2019 is missing.\n\nCheck the spelling in the third message. If the spelling is right, then it is not the word.

Symbols can be thought of as the \u2018stamp of the author\u2019.\n\nIt is even more important to use proper grammar,\n\n<Email 5>:\n , for example, when we are emailing or chatting with people.\n\nNow, what about symbols like colon, comma, and semi-colon? How do we use them correctly? I think it is good to learn about proper punctuation for email or writing because it helps to communicate your ideas in a clear and effective manner. So, let\u2019s start with colon \u2018:\u2019!\n\nThe colon is a punctuation mark that is used to separate a main idea from a supporting one in writing. If we look at the sentence below,\n\nThe food was very tasty: I ate two bowls.\n\nWe can see that there is a main idea and a supporting one. In this case, the main idea is the food was tasty. And the supporting one is that the person ate two bowls of food.\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

We only have the one ship and she\u2019s always fully booked.\n\n<Email 2>:\nWe could charter an entire ship for you, but it\u2019s very expensive. Let me check with the travel agents for details. You could probably get a quote next week.\n\n<Email 4>:\nYou could charter the entire ship for your anniversary party, but we can\u2019t begin planning your trip until I have a confirmed date.
