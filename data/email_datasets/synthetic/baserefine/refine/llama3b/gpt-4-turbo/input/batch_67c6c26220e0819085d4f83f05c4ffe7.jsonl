I've just finished doing a brief research on your website and found your services extremely interesting.                    I would like to know if you offer services in loading and unloading my load of biomass from Hamburg to Yokohama.                    Additionally, if possible, I would like to know if your rates are cheaper than the rates offered by any of your competitors.

I've just gone through your website, the services offered and it's very interesting.                    The charges of transporting a container from Hamburg to Yokohama have increased over the past two months, so I'm afraid my load cannot be transported for the same amount of money I paid for.                    I would like to know if you would offer me a discounted price and confirm this by email. I would also be glad to pay you for all the expenses incurred due to my delay in replying.

After releasing the Q4 2013 outlook call, crude oil finished off with a bang. The 42.5 handle just did not sustain the move.                    Looking at the bigger picture, crude is confirming our trading zone of 40-46.                      There are still other factors affecting crude. There's more to say on that but I will save it for the next email.                    Stay tuned!                    Chichi\n\n \n\n<Email 3>:\nGreat news!

Regards,                    Jackie\n \n\n<Email 4>:\nChichi,                    Without wasting too much time, here's the breakout scenario.                    At 38.5 handle, crude was in a trading zone.                    Then, at 40, it closed above 38.5 handle (outside trading range).                    Next, we came in at 40.2 on the 7/23 call, triggering the highest swing up since 7/2 (42.5).                    And finally, at 42.5, we enter an overbought zone (up-trending market).                    A stop is not necessary because our exit (42.5) is extremely protective.

What is the best and most economical option for me to get that coal?\nEmail 5:\nThank you for your enquiry for 2,00,000MT of coal. We will try our best to get you a cargo. On provisional basis, we would suggest you can do the cargo at $16/MT cfr<us$/ton>. From your previous mail it appears that your office will be handling all the ground operation of the shipment so you would like to take the cargo. We can give you same rates both in fob and cfr for Newcastle to Vietnam/ Bangladesh/ Nepal region but no more the distance as you would like to take the cargo at $16/MT (USD/ton) basis only. Our subject vessel is available at free port and we can make available within 2 to 3 weeks. If you would like to take the cargo we will have to finalize an agent at their end for coordinating. We can also put you in contact with our agent for\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.

This would give you 6-7 weeks' notice for loading in Zhoushan. The total cost would be in the ballpark of US$8.5 million (about $0.10/bbl and $0.08/bbl for loading and charters).

Also, what\u2019s your estimated transit time to Singapore?                    Best,                    Yinan\nEmail 2:\n1. The freight quote is: $1,396,652 2. The estimated transit time is: 35 days (not counting loading / unloading time)\n\n<<Brutal Definition of CVR>>:\nA CVR refers to \u201cCustomer Value Retention Rate\u201d. In other words, it is the percentage of customers that come back to you for a repeat order.\n\nFor example, if you sold 200 widgets to company A, 50% of those widgets were purchased again the next time A purchased from you.\n\nIn this example, your CVR is 50%.\n\nYou can also use this to measure the life-time value of your customers. If you have 200 customers and your CVR is 30%, you can assume that on average 60 of your customers are going to keep buying from you until they die.\n\nNote: These measurements can be used to accurately predict how well\nEmail 3:\nI have two customers who have kept buying from me repeatedly, one for 1,000 orders and the other for 2,000 orders. Are they using my online tool, or are they just purchasing over the phone, or both?\n\nThere\u2019s no clear answer to this, but here are a few pointers to help you make sense of this.\n\nRemember that the CVR (Customer Value Retention Rate) is the percentage of customers that come back to you for a repeat order. You can calculate this by looking at the percentage of orders that came back to you (or came back to you but didn\u2019t purchase again)\n\nSo, if you sold 200 widgets to company A, 50% of those widgets were purchased again the next time A purchased from you. In this example, your CVR is 50%. Note: these measurements can be used to accurately predict how well your company\u2019s\nEmail 4:\nI have one customer who purchased from me 2,000 times over a period of 20 years. Is he using my online tool? What about all the others?\n\nWell, you can\u2019t just blindly assume that everyone who has purchased from you is using the same tools. So, you need to make a few assumptions:\n\n1. If your customer made 2,000 purchases over a period of 20 years, then you can assume that he used your tools for at least 20 years (that is, 20 years ago).\nEmail 5:\nI am thinking about using your plugin for e-commerce. Do you have a plan to monetize it? Or do you plan to offer it for free?\n\nYes, I have a plan to monetize the plugin. I plan to do this by offering the plugin as a monthly subscription. The subscription will be priced at $100 per month. In other words, you will need to pay$100 per month to use the plugin.\n\nThis is one of the ways that I plan to monetize the plugin. The other way is by selling the plugin as a paid one-time purchase. I will be discussing this more in the next few days.\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

With all my warmest wishes,                    Anna\nEmail 2:\nJames,\n\nPlease book my next ship at once.                         In three days time my agent will ship my container of grain from Rotterdam to Halifax.                         I would also like to book a container from Halifax to Rotterdam at the same time.                               Kind regards,                                   Anna\n\nAnswer:\nAnna,                     If I remember correctly your name is Anna and your load would be shipped from Rotterdam to Halifax with ZIM/Rotterdam/ZIM ID: Y245877 dated: (add date).                         I will ask if we can book Halifax to Rotterdam with the same ship to arrive in Rotterdam two days before the date shown above.                         If everything goes according to plan I will send the booking after 12 pm on the 1st and after that you can send your LCL to Rotterdam on the following day.                         Your agent will be expecting the shipment.

I also sent the container in Rotterdam by ZIM/Ironman/1RIT04Z3072/3.                                  I will email again in the morning.\n\nAnswer:\nZIM has three options of empty return from Halifax to Rotterdam:                          COD Rotterdam, tomorrow Thursday 31st.                       One container from Hamburg to Rotterdam, Friday 1st February 2013.                           The shipment is guaranteed by ZIM and the container will be in Rotterdam on the 2nd. ZIM would like the container at their terminal on Thursday before 4 pm.                       A fourth option is sending my container by MSC to Bremerhaven and then the empty return on COD Rotterdam on Thursday, because ZIM can not get me a guaranteed return in time.                          You have the choice\nEmail 4:\nAnna,\n\nI just send you my booking for your grain from Rotterdam to Halifax. I will check if we can book your empty return from Halifax to Rotterdam by MSC/COD. If that is possible I will let you know asap.                              Your load would be shipped with ZIM/Rotterdam/Y245877 added date.                        Let me know if you have any questions.                    James\n\n<Email 5>\nAnna,\n\nI asked ZIM and it is possible to book your empty return from Halifax to Rotterdam by MSC/COD Rotterdam on the 31st.                        Your empty container would be taken from the ZIM terminal in Halifax on the 31st. but I will need the following information:                          Container no:                                Make, model and weight of the engine.

Could you provide a preliminary quote and confirm if you handle port dues under FOB terms?                    Best regards,                    Dan\nEmail 2:\nHi,                   With regard to your message above, I\u2019m happy to start a conversation about your logistics needs. It seems there are some potential risks, including weather impact and Suez Canal bottlenecks that will affect transportation. As such, the earliest available vessel for loading the cargo is not for another 14 days. However, you can still ship this cargo by the fastest available vessel for an additional premium of 7% if you are prepared to pay for the cost difference and the fees associated with carrying the risk of uncertainty. The sea freight cost is typically cheaper because the additional cost will only be incurred in the unlikely event of an inevitable delay or cancelation. I am attaching some indicative transport cost estimates for your review. These calculations are based on the available information, including port dues, and thus these figures may be subject to change depending on the final contract details.                    Kind regards,                    Simon\nEmail 3:\nDear Max,                   Thank you for your prompt response, I will confirm the exact volumes by the end of today, our usual weekly schedule is the 27th January.                     In the meantime, this cargo is classified as an LPG product and is subject to a 2% surcharge due to the very high shipping cost.                     If you\u2019re ready, I will send the final quote to you today.
