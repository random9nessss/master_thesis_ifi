I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of the huge oil spill this summer and we\u2019re just going to explain a little about the scope of the issue. (include an infograph, table, or graphs)                    We will need at least 40,000 tons of chemical dispersants to help the removal of the oil spill (explain).

The pathway to the dispersant is controlled by dispersing into the water column (using either chemical dispersants or in-situ burning). We have tried in-situ burning on some (its not approved but will be tested later) The main problem with the chemical dispersants is controlling the depth and concentration in the water column.

I have the information below. The vessel option you are looking for is through Magenta who will pick up the cargo from Manzanillo and deliver it to our Port of Entry in Corpus Christi. The vessel is set to sail on January 15th so please get your security letter for customs inspection in place before then. The vessel options are as follows:\n\n\n1. Magenta - Just as you mentioned this is the cheapest but there is a longer transit time\n\n\nTransit Time: 37 days\n\n\nFreight Cost: $5,990\n\n\n2. PCT - This is the fastest vessel but the cost is very high\n\n\nTransit Time: 26 days\n\n\nFreight Cost:$29,990\n\n\n3.
