I understand the onboard fresh water tankage is sufficient for three weeks, but does the design include the daily washing needs of the crew? How much water is required for sanitary purposes, laundry and washing the decks?\\n\\nWe also need to calculate the volume of water consumed by the engines for the last five years of operating hours. Are those figures available?\\n\\nThanks,\\nSharon\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"vessel\": \"Offshore Support Vessel\",\n    \"broker\": \"\",\n    \"commodity\": \"\",\n    \"load_port\": \"\",\n    \"discharge_port\": \"\",\n    \"cargo_size\": \"\",\n    \"incoterm\": \"\",\n    \"dwt\": \"\",\n    \"loa\": \"\",\n    \"starting_freight_quote_currency\": \"\",\n    \"starting_freight_quote\": \"\",\n    \"final_freight_quote_currency\": \"\",\n    \"final_freight_quote\": \"\",\n    \"laytime_start_date\": \"\",\n    \"laytime_end_date\": \"\",\n    \"demurrage_currency\": \"\",\n    \"demurrage\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI've:\n1.
