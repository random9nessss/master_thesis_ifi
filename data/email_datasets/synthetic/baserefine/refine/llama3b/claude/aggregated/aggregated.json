Maximum weight capacity of the vessel, which varies by vessel type\n2. The physical properties of the urea and its stowage factor\n3.

Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of this material, and not to damage it during transportation, we have stopped importing CFCL.\n\nOn the other hand, the price of other types of composites is increasing, and CFCL has become relatively more expensive.\n\nNevertheless, you are always welcome to reach out to us with your requirements, and we will be more than happy to help you find the best alternative for your project.\n\nBest regards,\nAntal Khilko"

For our cargo to be loaded, it would need to be routed through Osaka, which would incur additional costs.

Find another mode of transport for the remaining 1,200 MT of aviation fuel, which the customer won't take back. You can make a lot of money with this volume, as this aviation fuel is due to be consumed on the day you will receive it in Amsterdam. The customer does not want to transport the 1,200 MT to Belgium, so you should sell this additional aviation fuel on a spot basis and ensure proper credit risk management.\n\n2. Sell your FOB Hamburg cargo to the customer for a lump sum to secure full value.\n\nPlease use the additional document we discussed to cover all risks.\n\nRegards,\nMrs. Smythe"
