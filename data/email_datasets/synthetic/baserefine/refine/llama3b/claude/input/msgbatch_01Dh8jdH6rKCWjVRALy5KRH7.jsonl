We had an internal meeting yesterday about projects. The press wants to know more about the supply and demand aspect of the E&P situation and whether the PEMEX operation in Trinidad and Tobago will be renewed.   Do you have anything you can put together for them in an upcoming article?                        We also discussed moving forward with the new supply/demand report. We want to look at the 2012 report first. This may involve getting some more data. However, after we review this, we will most likely look into continuing with the Latin America report.                      Please let me know if you have any other suggestions or questions.                        Looking forward to the next conversation.

Best,                    Ryan\nEmail 2:\nHi Ryan,                       Thank you for your email of October 23rd. I am not sure we can find an available tanker at that time. However, if we find one, I will keep you informed.            Regards,                     Alan\n\n<Email 3>:\nHi Ryan,                       The tanker we are looking at for the 25th is not fully loaded, so the 25th may be doable. We would need to put together a charter party for this. If we can do that, please confirm your availability for the 25th as there is only 4 days between that and the 29th. Otherwise, we would need to look for something else.                    Regards,                     Julie\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

But unfortunately, we will not be able to load after 6:30am until the next day. For example, we can load the oil until 9am on Monday (13 June 2022), but we cannot start loading oil after 9:30am and we cannot finish loading oil before 6pm, so we will finish at 5:30am on 14 June 2022. We will have to stop loading after 6:30am as the boss of the EDCT do not want any more loading after 6:30am. I will check the ETA again.

The cost will be influenced by a number of factors, such as the location of the Middle East, the seasonality of the lobsters, the type of containers used for transporting the lobsters, and the type of transportation used. The cost of transporting the lobsters from Halifax to the Middle East will depend on the availability of carriers and the cost of each carrier. If you want to discuss the specifics of transporting lobsters to the Middle East, I would recommend that you contact a shipping company that specializes in transporting lobster. For example, we work with Carriers USA.\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1. Follow the JSON structure below exactly.\n            2.
