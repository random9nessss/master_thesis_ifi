However, this is set to change if a new state law is passed, which will allow ethanol to be taxed at 60 percent of the full price.\nAs a result, we would need to adjust our current rates and pass through a corresponding tax to ensure compliance with the new law. We can also help reduce your costs by absorbing the tax until June 30, 2013, but if the current rate remains unchanged, your fuel costs will increase significantly.\nWhile we understand that a new\nEmail 4:\nAlaska fuel tax on ethanol\nPlease find attached our email response from Pacific Ethanol, a supplier of ethanol and biodiesel to the Alaska state fuel tax department, regarding a change in the state tax ruling in Alaska which could affect our decision to ship ethanol there.\n[Some companies place this as a hyperlink.

We will gladly send you more information about the charter of both of these ships, if you wish. I will also send you a detailed overview of the fleet. I do not see any problems with the Armati but there are technical problems with the Semara. I will see what I can do about that. \nAmanda\n\n<Email 3>:\nAmanda,\nThanks for your prompt reply.

I am sorry but at this time our Operations team has no availability until January. Our charter rates can be viewed on the rate page on our website (please see link below) and these should be subject to Standard Charters terms & Conditions. As you will note the rates are offered only on a per direction basis, so whilst we will be charging two way rates we will be allowing a few days turnaround at sea between the outward and return legs of the flight. Additionally there is no charge for our expert advice on terminal rules and such like. We will contact you once availability has been confirmed and our rates have been reconfirmed.

We have been doing a cost benefit analysis\nEmail 3:\nI trust you are well,                 I was hoping you could help me out regarding this. Is it possible to combine freight items on an express charter, if so what rates apply.                 I also have a query regarding return slots and consolidation of cargo. We would like to consolidate 3 flights of around 500 kgs each on one flight as this will reduce the amount of flights we need and associated costs and delivery times. What would be a reasonable request time for us to supply this service (3-4 days).                 Kind regards,                 Kurt\nEmail 4:\nThank you for your enquiry.                   Regarding your first query, if you have two destinations and only want to travel once per cargo item and your freight exceeds 3,000kg, there will be a minimum charge of $5,000 to open up your freight as Standard Charters freight (see the link below for full information).                   Regarding your second query, the Standard Charters will be 40 days turnaround per trip and for the return leg from airport to airport we will allow up to 5 days turnaround. Generally 3-4 days should be enough time to collect your cargo, unless of course you want to wait and collect together.

As I understand it, you've pre-bought 3,000 MT of gelato from Naples for the flight to Melbourne.                       We are going to have it arrive in Australia in time for the festival. We have until October, so we have plenty of time.                    Now, if you ask me, it would be much better if the gelato arrived as a part of a shipment of napolitan foodstuffs from Naples, or a plane with a load of gelato from Naples arriving in Australia. But whatever works, Daniel.                    I would also like to order more gelato from Naples for our festivals in the future, as demand seems to have picked up since we started this thing. And before you ask, yes, there is a limit on gelato purchases from Naples. After all, the flood of gelato was somewhat unexpected.                    Unfortunately,\nEmail 3:\nPerhaps one day a three-car train will bring a smaller batch of gelato to Australia, but not today.\nEmail 4:\nOne final thing to consider: Many people in Australia like ice cream and do not like gelato.

We\u2019ll sell the majority of the gelato, but we\u2019ll donate some gelato to hospitals and nursing homes, especially ones in Western Australia.\n\nEmail 6:\nWonderful.
