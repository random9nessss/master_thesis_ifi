I would be willing to give you a quote for 1.25\u2033 and a second one. I would have to measure it though to determine the exact size.                     If you would like to order I could have it out to you tomorrow morning.                     Thank you for your help.

The 7,100MT is what our client need as it's the minimum load size for their buyer.                       The next issue we have is the routing, the kerosene cargo coming from Rotterdam to Las Palmas should have changed its routing to Tangier to cover a higher proportion of distance and fuel saving. The amendment is not allowed, and it's not a good thing.                       We have got a ship who can load cargoes for you in two weeks, if we make it, will you be able to get the cargo and load it in the time frame?

Well, not really \u2013 but you will write several emails in a short time to say \u201chello\u201d to the new company you\u2019ve been offered.                    The question is: Are you interested in the job? Of course, you\u2019re not going to say \u201cno\u201d, but what tone and language will you use? Can you see any difference between these two emails?                    Are these just plain English? If so, the person reading your email will ask him/herself, \u201cso what\u2019s going to make this job different from all the other jobs you\u2019ve had?\u201d                    Or, do you want to sound more professional? Think of someone else at the company you admire and ask, \u201chow would this person sound?\u201d. You want to be taken seriously, so why not use this role model to guide your language and style.                    First \u2013 address the person correctly\nEmail 2:\n1. Dear Mr. Goldie.\n2. Dear Mr. Ron Goldie.\n3. Dear Sir,\n\nThe last one is bad. Even if you don\u2019t know the title of the person you\u2019re writing to, you should find out. It is just poor manners to call someone \u201cSir\u201d when you know his/her title is \u201cMrs.\u201d. Of course, you can only find out his/her title if you have been given that information by the human resources department \u2013 so how would you know to address him/her that way? (The answer is \u2013 you won\u2019t. But if the company does not give you that information, call the person \u201cSir\u201d).\n\nSecond \u2013 when should you write an email?\nThe choice of email or letter will depend on the nature of the situation and your relationship with the person you are addressing. There are some circumstances where the choice of email and letter is similar\nEmail 3:\nSome emails are going to be shorter than a letter. If you are writing about a job offer you probably will use an email, rather than a letter. If you send a letter instead of an email, it might take several weeks for the employer to respond and you might not hear back from them at all.\n\n<Email 4>:\nOr perhaps you are simply giving the other person an apology. If it is a formal apology that will be sent to a formal address \u2013 to an official with a title, you will probably use a letter.\n\nThird \u2013 address the subject matter.\nAre you describing your qualifications for the job? Are you apologizing for being late for an interview or for the need to reschedule an interview?\n\nIt is better to be specific and complete.\n\nFourth \u2013 what tone of language should you use?\nA formal email will be written in a professional tone, expressing confidence and taking responsibility\nEmail 4:\nOr perhaps you are simply giving the other person an apology. If it is a formal apology that will be sent to a formal address \u2013 to an official with a title, you will probably use a letter.\n\nThird \u2013 address the subject matter.\nAre you describing your qualifications for the job? Are you apologizing for being late for an interview or for the need to reschedule an interview?\n\nIt is better to be specific and complete.\n\nFourth \u2013 what tone of language should you use?\nA formal email will be written in a professional tone, expressing confidence and taking responsibility\n\n<Email 4>:\n Another factor to consider is the formal or informal language you choose to use. Would a form letter (or would the form letter say a form letter) send the right message?\n\nFifth \u2013 making the connection.\nJust as you should have a similar style of introduction for a letter, an email should open with a similar introduction and an invitation to read your email through to the end. Here\u2019s an example of a less than ideal opening email:\n\nDear Mr. Goldie,\nI would like to inform you that a final decision has been made about the hiring process and I need to come to London to continue the recruitment process on the 12th of November. I will be leaving Paris on the 11th at 1 pm. I will be going by train and I will reach Paris Nord at 6.30.

Our selection process has begun, please let us know.                    Thank you for your participation!                    Vladimir\nEmail 2:\nThe area is the center of the recently emerged \"dry bulk finance bubble\" centered in Singapore. It is clear that large volumes of capital are coming from banks and investment firms into the dry bulk shipping market. The real question is whether any of this additional volume of shipping loans will improve returns to the shipping sector and make a difference in financing this sector as a whole. If you would like to know more about the potential pitfalls and opportunities surrounding dry bulk finance, please do not hesitate to get in touch.   \nThanks for reaching out,                     Anatoliy\n\n\nAuthor: Vladimir\nEmail Type: Sales\nDomain: Shipping Finance\nOpportunity: Focused\nProbability: 70%\nEmail 3:\nThe dry bulk finance market is booming, with many shipping companies taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and increased demand for commodities. The biggest issue in this market is that the interest rates are so low, that they can actually hurt the shipping companies' profit margins. This is because the low interest rates mean that the companies can borrow money at lower rates, but they are also unable to earn as much in interest. This means that the companies are able to pay off their loans more quickly, but they don't earn as much in profits as they would if they had to pay more interest. The other issue is that the demand for commodities is decreasing, which means that the companies are having to carry more unsold ships, which costs them money. The best way to make a profit in this market is to find a way to cut costs and make your shipping company more efficient.\n<Email 4>\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

My first concern is about insurance. What\u2019s your standard coverage, and would I be able to extend it beyond that if I needed to?                            Also, is there a rate I need to know in advance so that I can inform the shippers what they will be paying?

For Portugal, standard insurance is $1.50 per kg. We can go as high as $2.50 per kg for $1500 shipping, which covers $3 per pallet.                            Also, for Portugal we do a pickup in Dallas or Houston, which we would need to know as soon as possible.
