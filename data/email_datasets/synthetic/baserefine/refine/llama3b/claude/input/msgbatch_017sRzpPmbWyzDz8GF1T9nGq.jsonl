This could lead to major headaches on the day of sailing. It would also put extra pressure on our client, and I cannot have that.

Despite the itinerary on the website stating that a 5 hour lunch break would be given in the day time, this was not the case. Our client's cruise began early in the morning, and at the start of the first afternoon, the cruise stopped for an hour, where the client's lunch would have been normally taken.                Following this, our client informed the cruise company that she would not be able to attend any additional activities during the second part of the cruise, due to her trip abroad the next morning.                Unfortunately, after the cruise stopped, the client left to change her outfit for dinner. It is clear to me that her actions were not entirely justified. However, what can I do as the representative of our client?

However, our terminal demurrage is not the same, please read carefully below so that I may have a better idea what is the demurrage for a small order.                    \"The business terminal of Port of Newark charges a minimum terminal demurrage on each vessel on a per day per TEU basis at the rate of $5.00 per day, per TEU.

Is there a minimum time frame the ship will need to stay in Singapore, then the demurrage charge will be calculated based on that amount of time?                       2. How much would the demurrage be based on if I ship automobile gas at a weight of 3,000MT?                       3. How much would the demurrage be based on if I ship automobile gas at a weight of 6,000MT?                       4. How much would the demurrage be based on if I ship automobile gas at a weight of 15,000MT?                       5.

I received a very similar email earlier this morning but the case was\nvery straightforward as the seller had advised that the vessel was to be cleared on the 21st of August and\ndemurrage to commence from the 22nd.  I was able to quickly email back the response based on your case\nfor a 45 day lay time to commence on the 22nd.\nHowever, with regards to your case where you are buying a small quantity (3,000MT), I do not believe the\nseller should be paying the terminal demurrage as this is considered a short term booking and this is\ncovered under the charterer's guarantee as per the charter party.  The charterer will want to ensure that the\nship is not stuck in port for any longer than necessary for whatever reason and therefore, will want to\narr\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

I\u2019ve also made arrangements to pick up my container from the port. The agent has told me that I must clear the equipment in a few days, otherwise the container may be sold.

I will be flying to Quetta in 10 days and will be arriving at the port to pick up the container. The agent has told me that a truck will be provided to take the container to my address. I do have some questions.\n\n1. How do you pay for the clearance?\n2. Will the trucking company charge us a fee?\n3. What if the container is full?

How do you pay for the clearance?\nIf you are paying for clearance and the agent is going to handle it, I suggest you pay with a pre-paid card and keep the receipt. Once you\u2019re in Quetta, the agent will pay for the fees and keep the receipt for their records. When you go to get your cricket equipment, you\u2019ll pay the agent back and keep their receipt.\n\n2. Will the trucking company charge us a fee?\n3. What if the container is full? I need to send all my cricket equipment but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to fit it\n\nAs for fees, you should ask the agent to send a quote to you. Once you confirm the cost, you should pay the agent and they should file the paperwork. I suggest you ask for a copy of the quote for your records.\nIf the container is\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.
