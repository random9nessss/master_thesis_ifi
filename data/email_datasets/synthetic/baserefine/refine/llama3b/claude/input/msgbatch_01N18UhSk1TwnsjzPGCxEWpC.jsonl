I am extremely disappointed in them as well.              In order to be able to respond to the urgency of the situation, you should be a manager. Unfortunately, that\u2019s how the company is built.                     However, you might be able to convince them that it\u2019s actually a better solution to work with someone who is younger and more flexible than a manager. This is a pretty great opportunity for you and I am sad that you don\u2019t have the power\nEmail 4:\nGood morning,\nWe\u2019re looking to discharge an LTL container at Rotterdam on the 27th, and transit it to London with a FTL 20-footer.

He replied with no reference to Mikhail's response.\n\nHello Mikhail,\nWe can do that if you make a booking for it at once. Please make an order and I will let you know the price and date.\n\nMiki\n\nIn my opinion, Julia\u2019s co-worker made the right choice in choosing this strategy, since he did not want to respond to Mikhail\u2019s email. As you can see, in the second email, Miki offers to take Mikhail\u2019s project, since it is not worth a manager to deal with that. In order\nEmail 5:\nHowever, Mikhail wasn\u2019t satisfied with Miki\u2019s reply because he wanted the project to be carried out at a lower price. Julia\u2019s co-worker chose to use this strategy because Mikhail was not a manager. I strongly believe that the company\u2019s higher management should not respond to younger employees, but to those who are in a position to make decisions.\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

Hello Eric,                    As our customers all around the world may have noticed, we are introducing a new range of wooden lego. We think they are going to be a huge hit with your children.                    We are offering special 20% off for any purchases above 1 million lego units. The special promo expires on 3rd Jan, so hurry!                    Best wishes,                    Alice\nEmail 2:\nSubject: Notice                       Dear Eric,                      With the potential benefits of wood, we have been working with a big partner in China to set up wood business. After they produce the raw materials, we need to process it to a nice and reasonable shape.                    Some kids with wooden lego, and some kids with plastic ones. The problem is that some wooden legos may accidentally hurt a child's skin, and others can hurt their face. We have set up a quality check platform, and sent 500 legos to a certified laboratory to see whether the wooden lego causes a threat to children.                    The results showed that the legos are as safe as the plastic ones. Therefore, it is definitely the right time to go on market. We are 100% sure that the wooden lego is safe, non-toxic, non-irritating, durable, and durable.                    As\nEmail 3:\nSubject: Natural                                  Dear Eric,                                 After the distribution of the wooden legos in China, we are still receiving requests from European countries. These countries are Germany, France, Austria, Netherlands, and others.                                 We are happy to know that our wooden lego is in high demand, and we can not but make some strategies to bring wooden legos to more countries.                                 After some communications, we are here with a message to you. We will introduce an agent of wooden legos to bring these wooden legos to other countries. These agents have a huge influence on products such as wooden legos. We hope that the 2 parties can work together well and make a profit.                                 We are more than happy to introduce 20% commission to those agents who are able to sign contracts with us.                                 Thanks a lot.

In the table above, we see that there are no responses to our emails sent by Anshul. So, our next step is to make sure that his emails are not lost. We can build an app that checks periodically and then send them emails in the morning if needed.\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.

For the oil tanks, we would be very interested in seeing a price for a late-week sail from Tianjin to Shekou on the 28th of this month.                We were hoping to use the tanks to move Crude.                So, for the time being we would require 10,000MT.                Thanks,                Nick\nEmail 2:\nNick,                Sorry, we were not familiar with the details of the oil tanks, and it was not clear to us if we were to supply the empty tanks and load the crude, or load the tanks at our port and deliver them at your port.                So, we sent you an email and asked for details.                We have now received your request, and we were interested in moving 50% of the Crude (see attached).                However, I need to make sure we are clear on the terms and conditions, and I would appreciate if you can reply with more details on those.                See details below.                We have had a previous interest from a shipowner for the same sailing and in the same time.                So, please advise us as soon as you can.

The only thing we require is your help to connect us to a company which will supply the Crude and have a vessel to supply our tankers (in this case the PCTC FEDRA REY ) with this crude.                At this point, we are not interested in ownership or renting the tanker for a period.

Thank you,                    Jan\nEmail 2:\nHello Jan,                    We will schedule sailing of our VLCC bulker before the middle of next week. For the moment we don't have an extra day, but we can make an extra day at very short notice.                    In case we have a day available, we can let you know in advance. However, I think that you can get a best rate without the extra day.                    Also note that we always appreciate your cooperation in the necessary load procedure for loading VLCC cargoes on board. We have received several vessels from Busan with less than 100% ballast. We really have to reduce ballast with our last vessel to make sure to have sufficient load margins for the remaining cargo. That's our only excuse to load not the minimum ballast for our chemical vessel.                    Please be advised that if you have a cargo which will arrive close to expiry and consequently has to be held\nEmail 3:\nHello Felix,                Thank you for your latest information. However the tanks are already loaded with a cargo (last gas cargo) of 80% and will hold until the next load. Do you have a suitable rate for now?                Best regards,                Jan\nReply Email:\nDear Mr. Jan,                I can only give you a best rate if I know your cargo characteristics. But I think that you will have a lower rate if we let our bunker take care of your voyage. We will carry your product to Busan on a confirmed VLCC Bulker (per your request) and bunker from Busan to Aqaba. After that, you can pay bunker or proceed yourself. You will have to add discount of bunker oil at Busan.            If you wish, I can start our bunker and sailing arrangement in order to make an available space of approx. 5,500mt\n\n            ---\n\n            Formatting requirements:\n            1.
