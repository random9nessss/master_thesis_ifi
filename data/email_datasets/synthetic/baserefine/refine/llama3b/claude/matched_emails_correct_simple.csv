Hello Mr. Porter,
Thanks for the cargo status update. We really appreciate your speedy assistance. I just wanted to give you an update on our side: 
We are expecting to receive the shipment by Saturday, March 19. 
We also want to give you a special request for the unloading. We would like to unblock your warehouse and then use a forklift to pick up the cargo. After that, you can close the warehouse for the spring. I believe the steamroller is operating right now. We will gladly pay for any extra costs. 
With great appreciation,

 Good morning,
I just finished my B2B conference call, and we are happy to be able to discuss the possible shipment of [URL removed] tanks. The sale would be for 3000 tanks, and we need them to be shipped by August 1st at the latest. The shipment has to be ocean freight and shipped from the port of destination to the port of origination. 

We would be happy to follow your company's terms and conditions for the order. I would be happy to ship a TOT, but if you need more information before then, we can send the relevant document to you.

Thank you very much for your time and we hope to work with your company in the near future!

Sincerely,

Kobe

I understand that we are only in week 2, but the writing in email 1 isn't as good as it can be.

                    I'm aware that we have already lost some time in the past weeks. I'm really sorry about that. I didn't think that my writing would turn out so bad. I don't know if you want me to do the writing work or not, but I think I'm learning more from it. I like to think of writing like a reflex that can be acquired. There is no use to just sit and wait for Alice to do it right. I really enjoy your emails and really appreciate your feedback. Is it alright if I write the next email and just copy paste everything from my mentor email to save time? That's what I'm planning to do.

Thanks for the email.

When you create a new email, you should be able to see the Send button (in Outlook 2016/2013/2010/2007) or the Save button (in Outlook 2003), and have the other options greyed out. If this is not the case, we need to find out why.
It looks like email 4 does not have a send button, only save. This means that you cannot send that email. The email should probably be copied over to a separate email in Outlook and sent from there.

Note the lack of a signature line below.

Unfortunately, in your case, email 3 is missing signature 4, and email 2 and 4 are missing signature 1. It's possible that the sender has deleted these emails before they were sent.
I can confirm that the emails are not being sent, they were deleted from my mailbox. This is a security measure taken when email 3 was created (not a complete email).
Since this is a security measure, there is no way to undo it. However, you can contact me to see if we can send out email 3 using another email address.
If we cannot get email 3, we can look into getting email 1.

Dear Roberto,                 I had a quick look at the AIS schedule but unfortunately they don't call at Cadiz. I was also trying to find a connection to Cadiz in the London schedule but it's not in there either. However, I've just found a possibility via Vigo in Spain. Could you please let me know if you'd be open to a Vigo port call? (this is for your risk management). The AIS calls into Cadiz on 21st August which is out of your risk windows but the AIS only sails to Vigo on the 20th. We could ship to Vigo and arrange a lorrie for you to pick it up (1,600MT of FWA I am assuming?). I can do the paperwork and let you know the terms as well.

We could arrange the following:
- Ship the cargo to Vigo (vessel arrival on August 20th)
- Arrange truck transportation from Vigo to Cadiz for the 1,600MT FWA

Please let me know if this alternative routing would work for your risk management requirements. If you're interested, I can provide the complete terms and handle the necessary documentation.

A transport company is interested in purchasing the product, but there must be a quick and reliable way of transporting it to the barge so the payment can be made at the time of delivery.

For me, email 1 is the sender's email and email 2 is the receiver's email.
For David, email 1 is the receiver's email and email 2 is the sender's email.

This type of situation is called ""rank preservation"" - each user sends and receives messages, but the order is not preserved. In this case, there is no one ""owner"" of the message, and it cannot be seen as a transaction. Because there is no agreed transaction, there is no mechanism for tracking the status of the message, so there is no way to keep track of how many emails have been sent and received.

This type of situation can be a big problem for business. A simple example is a bill that is not paid. A person may refuse to pay a bill","From: david.smith@logisticscorp.com

Dear Mr. Hill,                    The Subject matter at hand is shipping our steel to Tangshan, as I stated previously.            I’ve attached a copy of your quotation along with our requirements, that is:                Is the vessel we need available at the current time?                Does the vessel accommodate our Barge side loading?                And the demurrage on this trip?

Dear Frank,                      We appreciate your patience while we worked to find you a suitable vessel.

 Dear Mr. Sosa,                    Thank you for your rate estimation. My budget is $2,200.00, and this is just over budget. I will have to look around a bit for a better solution.                    Regards,                    David.

Dear Andrew,                    Thank you for getting in touch. I know your team does not think that FOB, for this kind of product, would be a good option.            This is largely due to the fact that shipping costs are so high from Shenzhen.  However, I would be interested in hearing your thoughts and would like to discuss this in detail.

Thank you for getting in touch. Based on our analysis, FOB terms for this type of product would not be the most advantageous option, primarily due to the current high shipping costs from Shenzhen. However, I would be interested in discussing this in more detail to understand your specific requirements.

The million-dollar question is: does this really add value?  Is it necessary to email 3,000 separate documents just to transfer about 30 minutes of information from supplier to customer? (We’ll assume that a 30-minute phone call between customer and supplier to resolve an issue is about equal to sending 3,000 emails, only once).

The answer to this question is yes, it is necessary to send emails, and no it doesn’t add value.

You can now access it via the Internet Banking section of this website or download the Bankwest Mobile App. It will take me up to 2 hours to transfer the money. However, to do this securely, I will need the bank's International Code or SWIFT code. I note that you previously told me that I would not need to enter this but that the BNP Paribas website is still requesting that I do so.                   I am not sure why it is asking for the code and cannot figure out why. However, I am able to use the app but I need the code to do so. Can you please confirm this and let me know what it is?                   I have

If you can please provide me with the code as soon as possible so that I can move the funds and I can see my funds in the right place.                   Many thanks,                   Christine

<Email 4>
Here is the code that you can use: BNPBP22F.
I think that there is a little problem with the way that BNP Paribas is working.
You must be able to go to the Transfer Funds section of the app and make a payment with the code as above.
The reason why they are asking for the code is that when you go to Transfer Funds and click on the Pay Others section, a pop-up box appears with a box for the code.
I hope that this helps.                   Please let me know if you need anything else.

I've checked our schedule regarding your request. Unfortunately, we don't have any slots available for a single vessel in June. All our ships have tight schedules, and I cannot guarantee that we'll have any slots open by the end of June.

I've attached our ship's draft restrictions for your reference, but given your urgent timeline of June 10th, I recommend exploring alternative shipping options.

Body: Dear Mr. George,

Your proposal to purchase 5,000MT of corn from the West African coast looks quite attractive. However, as part of our tendering process, we need to get multiple quotes. Can you please provide the same terms, as well as your earliest loading window, and your latest port costs for us to include your bid in our final assessment of offers?

Regards,

Hi Maria,                    I’m looking at shipping 11,500MT of ex-Rotterdam jet fuel to New Orleans via the Isthmus of Suez. Could you send me details of your laycan from outload to EDCT to confirm that you can match the JWC.                    Many thanks,                    Simon

Dear Jim,                      Sorry for not getting back to you. I’ve just found this. Let me confirm the following to you: 1. You should have onboard time of 10 hours to Suez Canal. 2. Your vessel ETA to New Orleans is on 17 June 2022. 3. Ship’s name: L5 Master & QM: Captain Henrique Damasceno & Mercu Regalado. Can you please check with the charterer on your specific time from the dock to the EDCT? Looking forward to hearing from you. Maria

Hi Maria,                    The charterer has told me that they need the EDCT at 11:59pm on 13 June 2022. Do you still have time for the schedule you have offered me on 12 June? Many thanks,                   Jim

Dear Jim,                      It depends on the exact time. We can start to load oil at 5am until 5:30am. But unfortunately, we will not be able to load after 6:30am until the next day. For example, we can load the oil until 9am on Monday (13 June 2022), but we cannot start loading oil after 9:30am and we cannot finish loading oil before 6pm, so we will finish at 5:30am on 14 June 2022. We will have to stop loading after 6:30am as the boss of the EDCT do not want any more loading after 6:30am. I will check the ETA again. Thank you, Maria

Regarding the loading schedule:

We can load between 05:00-06:30 on June 13. However, we cannot conduct loading operations between 06:30 and next day. For reference, if we start loading at 05:00 on June 13, we must complete by 06:30, otherwise loading will need to continue at 05:00 on June 14.

This restriction is due to EDCT facility requirements. I will verify the ETA again and confirm.

We were wondering if we could push up the entry by a day to Saturday 10th. As you may have noticed, the winds are picking up and are expected to get worse and worse as we get closer to Icy and Snowy.

Hi Anthony,            The transport of lobsters to the Middle East will definitely be expensive. The cost will be influenced by a number of factors, such as the location of the Middle East, the seasonality of the lobsters, the type of containers used for transporting the lobsters, and the type of transportation used. The cost of transporting the lobsters from Halifax to the Middle East will depend on the availability of carriers and the cost of each carrier.

        I’d like to clarify your offer. I must mention that the oil cargo is still waiting for a buyer in a warehouse in London, which is already 4,000MT.

You can provide us with the balance you will need for ship hire and insurance.    Thanks!

As instructed, the office arranged for Matueo to receive payment terms for the oil cargo and give him a booking reference for a 40,000DWT vessel bound for Port Kelang. A contract was agreed with a sample of Lian’s terms and conditions attached:

Body: Hello Bob,

We're currently facing difficulties finding bulk carriers for the Brazil route as this destination isn't frequently serviced in the current market. As an alternative solution, I would suggest considering container shipping for this cargo.

Please let me know if you'd like to explore this option.

Thank you,
Ms. Wang

We must decline the container shipping option. While we understand it might be more economical, our operational requirements specifically need bulk vessel transport, even if it means paying a premium on the freight rate.

Dear Bill,                   Sorry for the delay, but we just completed the sample test for your verification. Our lab tested an average sample of 10 kilograms, which is approximately equal to 10% of the sample size of the cargo. We tested by digesting 50 grams of each sample for 10 minutes, digesting 100 grams of each sample for 5 minutes, and testing 50 grams of each sample for 10 minutes. The best test results from these 3 tests were used to determine the results. The resulting pH reading for the test is _______.                      Results for the test indicate that the ammonia content is within acceptable limits for ammonia acceptance.

I am not sure what format this might be, but it is easy to interpret the context using the actual email headers and content. Each email is clearly distinct from the others and both email chains end in clear cues that there is more to come. However, the information provided can be divided into two clear subjects: Email 1 and Email 2. 

**Email 1:**

Ivory Coast has a large number of suppliers in the chemical industry, and this is just one of many that could potentially be sending sulfur. The price is likely to be one of the biggest concerns for them, as it will be for you. It is also possible that the sulfur will be sent directly to the port of Abidjan, which would be convenient for you.

Hello, I am a teacher of French as a foreign language. I am in need of a French vocabulary text. I would like to know if you have such a text. If yes, how much would it cost and if no, what should I do? Regards,

Ivory Coast is an English speaking country, so I was able to use the context to understand that there are plenty of French speakers in the country who could provide the needed information. This is one of the many examples that can be found in everyday life. The emails above were clearly different from each other, but still useful to me for the purpose of interpreting their content. If you read the first email, you may be able to identify that the subject of the second one is the same as the first one, i.e. the contact was a supplier of sulfur. Then, when you come across the

I recommend checking with our licensing department about potential lease agreements for the photo tester. Also, we need your confirmation on the final Pico Interlink requirements and whether you'll need any additional accessories for the SF-15 Photo tester.

While we can provide all equipment currently in our inventory, you're welcome to supply your own equipment if preferred. In that case, we won't need to handle billing and logistics.

This email is regarding something that happened at
work today. A new female intern who was under
your supervision was fired. To summarize, she walked
in late this morning, was complaining about not
having anyone to work with, and was generally
complaining about everything. The only thing you
could do was tell her that you had already met with
the rest of the team and had already assigned them
to the projects. Then she proceeded to say how she
could probably solve all of these problems because
she was so smart. You proceeded to give her the
option to go home to think about it, but she kept
insisting she was intelligent enough to handle the
situation. She finally left to go home, which was
good.

I wanted to bring to your attention a situation that occurred today with the new intern under your supervision. She arrived late this morning and displayed concerning behavior. When informed that project assignments had already been distributed during the morning team meeting, she became argumentative and made several inappropriate comments about her superior capabilities.

When given the option to take the rest of the day off to reconsider her approach, she continued to be confrontational. Though she eventually left the office, I believe this warrants immediate attention.

Body: Dear Mr. Adams,

Thank you for your email. Regarding our 3,200MT of Naphtha sample delivery, it will be the same price to send as one batch of methanol.

Please note that samples will be done in Rikon, and the product will arrive in Japan in April.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.

Kind regards,

Thank you for your email.

Today is 4/5, and I will be back on Monday the 7th. We have had many people reach out to us in recent weeks who are purchasing methanol in other areas, and we need to be very careful to process their requests promptly.

My time is very limited because of the massive volume of requests. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Hi Mr. Ghosh,                    I need to send out 1,600MT of 36% urea to Lagos. What’s your quickest route? I’d prefer to use one of your DP2 vessels, but am willing to try your DP1 as well.

Have you booked our 18MT of paddy from Bangkok? Sorry, we just couldn't wait to see the space on the ship. So we just booked from the single importers.                    By the way, we had noticed that 2,000MT of rice has been sold from Vietnam with a coir yarn.                    I have to say, this doesn't make any sense. Who would buy rice from Vietnam when we have the largest yarn production facility in the world just a few miles away?                    I was hoping to find a very good transport deal from Thailand to Malaysia to Hong Kong on a convenient schedule, but I see you just sold the berths. Can you kindly suggest some carriers?                    Best regards,                    Kim

We’re currently looking at the container ship M/V Santa Rosalia, but its ETA to Los Angeles is still TBD.

We were hoping for your timely response on the quotation for your bulk oil cargo shipment from Los Angeles to Singapore. I have to mention that we are running extremely tight on the time frame. The reason is that we are due to deliver the cargo to our end customers by mid-June, but we only received the order last Friday.                            It’s very unusual that we are facing such tight deadlines, but our clients always rely on us to deliver promptly and to the highest quality.                            I wanted to check if the container ship M/V Santa Rosalia is still available to be your vessel for the shipment. I see that the vessel is in Shanghai right now, but we are working closely with the charter company to get the vessel to Los Angeles as quickly as possible.

                    This is a follow-up regarding our order of 700MT of kerosene. Please let me know if there are any problems with the shipment, and let me know if you have any questions about the products.                Regards,

In an email, the subject line informs the receiver that the cargo will be delivered soon. The second email is a follow-up message regarding the 700MT of kerosene ordered from the seller. In both the messages, there are informal terms of address such as ""Mark"" and ""George"" used. There are also many instances of informal salutations such as ""Dear"" and ""Sincerely"" used.

Mark:
                     In my experience as an executive, sending out a clear, well-structured email is important in communicating your message to the right audience. Your recent message to the sender of the cargo was one such example. The structure was clear and concise, making it easy for the receiver to understand. The only mistake you made was to address the receiver using their first name rather than the title of their position. You could have easily addressed him as “Mr. George”, but I guess you wanted to be more informal. Regardless, the main message was conveyed and you managed to make the whole process as straightforward as possible.
                Regards,
                Eko

In the email above, the receiver has explained to the sender how he should have addressed the sender of the cargo. He is correct about the sender not addressing the sender by his full name instead of the title. The main point of the email is","From: george.smith@tradingco.com

Regarding your correspondence with George, while the message was clear and concise, I would recommend using more formal address in future business communications. Using 'Mr. George' or their full name would be more appropriate than just 'George'.

Otherwise, the communication was well-structured and effective.

Body: Mr. Cano,

Regarding the concerns about my commitment to the opening presentation, I need to clarify a few points:

1. I have concerns about Miguel handling the logistics for the opening.
2. Given this is a political project, we need to ensure proper political expertise is involved.
3. I won't be able to deliver the presentation until November 21st at the earliest.

Please reschedule our project planning meeting as I may not be able to attend the current date.

I will provide further updates by Monday.

Regards,
Celeste

I received your email today. I was able to look into this situation and the sample was analyzed last Friday.

I understand that the quality of the batch is the reason why this is not approved and it will not be approved until the supplier does some corrective actions. Unfortunately, this cannot be done overnight. I am expecting that the supplier will do some corrective actions within a week and then we can submit another request to the QCP for approval. The key is that the corrective actions are actually implemented in the system and the results are visible to us.

Note: A specific deadline for the implementation of the corrective actions should be communicated to the supplier by the supplier's contract manager

A couple of my colleagues and I have just finished a quality review of the product that is produced by the supplier. The results were that the company has had problems with this product since they started. When we looked into the history, we could see that all the products that were produced were defective. As you know, this is not allowed according to the standards we work with. The reason for this is that the supplier does not have any documented process controls for the production process. We were told by the supplier that they have been working on this for a long time but they have not been able to solve it.

Note: I know that you will have a lot of questions. You should not feel uncomfortable asking questions and if you need to get any information from our side, please do so.

Hey Arjun,                    I have a new project where we’re going to need a 4000kVA high-power generator, with a 150kVA low-power generator. Can you give me some ballpark pricing estimates, or refer me to a competent electrician?                    Best,                    Vlad

Hi Vlad,                       Arjun, you are a god among men! Two generators, 4000kVA and 150kVA?

 last few projects with this company were a mess because they kept combining the different materials and labor costs with each other. That’s how they ended up with completely overinflated estimates.

 , my wife and I were experiencing a financial crunch, and we had to take on some overtime work to keep up. That’s why I was only able to pay you so little over the last few months, and why I’ve been so stressed out lately. I’ve tried my best to make it up to you, but I understand that I can’t make up for such a long period of time with nothing but work. I’ll try to pay you as much as I can over the next few months, and if I can get things settled soon, I can pay more.

I need a comprehensive spreadsheet with prices for various power and industrial projects, with the cost breakdown, including materials and labor. We'll need a separate sheet for each project as we're tracking multiple projects simultaneously. Our previous experiences with other companies were problematic due to combined cost calculations leading to inflated estimates. I'm looking for straightforward pricing with overall project costs rather than itemized estimates.

Body: Thanks for your quick response. I am happy to hear that you are able to handle our shipment this week.

However, we would appreciate it if you could send us a consolidated freight quote, so that we can send you a wire transfer, and then finalize the order. It would be better if the total charge for the shipment can be paid through electronic transfer, rather than sending a cash payment at the port, to avoid any delays or complications that may arise.

The delivery date is flexible, and we can accept your schedule from this Wednesday onwards. Please kindly inform me about the necessary documents that you may require from us.

Best regards,
Anna"

# Subject title
WORKFLOW_SUBJECT = 'A Quick Shipment Order'

In this sample, the subject is already written, but it is in a variable. If we want to change the subject, we only need to change the value of WORKFLOW_SUBJECT. However, if we want to add a line to the subject, the code will change to something like this:

Next step is to contain the crude and give it to companies that have orders for oil. (it’s important to know that there are huge oil companies like Chevron that have 40% of all oil of the gulf being scooped out)                    So, your email is looking for dispersants, and how can we help you get that by.

I'm writing regarding the ongoing cleanup operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Following my site visit this weekend, I wanted to discuss our dispersant requirements for the oil spill remediation effort.

We estimate needing approximately 40,000 tons of chemical dispersants for the removal operation. As you may be aware, major companies like Chevron are currently handling about 40% of the crude oil recovery in the gulf region.

Could you please provide information about your dispersant availability and vessel deployment capabilities? We need to ensure proper coordination for both the dispersant delivery and application.

We currently have some dispersant stockpiled and ready for dispatch. Our application method involves dispersing into the water column using either chemical dispersants or in-situ burning. While we've conducted some preliminary in-situ burning tests (pending approval), our main challenge with chemical dispersants is controlling depth and concentration in the water column. The advantage of in-situ burning is better depth control during the process.

Hello Jun,                    I just have a quick question, we have previously agreed that T & C are mutual subject to clearance. I’m a little concerned that the EPC terms may exclude customs clearance. I will need to forward to the buyer for approval.                    I will revert when I have a clearer understanding of this.                    Cheers,                    Ivan

Thank you for your email. Please do not worry because that kind of terms and conditions are subject to clearance and the customs clearance charges are an on cost so it will not effect the final FOB.                    Hope this clarifies your question.","From: jun.chen@trading.com

                            Dear Sir,                    Your mail was received and acknowledged.                    The above cargo is a 250 tons load in total. It would be ideal to load cargo from Berlin. But if we will load cargo from Bremen, then cargo can be loaded on a vessel sailing to Dublin by the end of November. The goods can be brought to Dublin from Bremen by the end of October 2016.

Instead of:

Body: Dear Sir,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the vessel inspection. I've just returned from a business dinner at the Maritime Club in Liverpool. Regarding your vessel inquiry, I'll need to review the hull condition report for the specified vessel.

Please note that for a vessel built in 2000 with DNV-2G steel construction and 100A1 classification, carrying 1500ton bulk cargo capacity, we'll need a current hull survey report to proceed with insurance arrangements.

Best regards,

#### The Nature of Viruses

A virus is a type of computer program, analogous to a self-replicating macro in a word processing program. A virus, once entered into a computer, takes control and executes a program that produces copies of itself. The advantage to a virus over a macro is that a virus is more difficult to detect and may be attached to legitimate files, in order to pass inspection. In other words, a virus is not usually flagged as a virus, even though it performs no legitimate function.

Many emails can be identified as viruses. If you are suspicious, call the person whose email it was, and tell them what it says. You will often find

People are often infected by the virus that is passed in the body of the message, rather than attached to the message as a file. By the way, the name ""virus"" is appropriate because the virus will only replicate if the user opens the message, either by reading the message itself or by clicking on the attachment.

The more you know about viruses and virus protection, the more difficult it will be for the virus to control your computer.

I'm very sorry but our port in Nador is not possible at this time. The vessel is now in Turkey with cargo and will likely head to Europe shortly. As of now there are no other options to get you your cargo. Unfortunately my best time frame would be the second week of November at the earliest.

We can take the ship and let you know the rate later but we need you to let us know if you can take a spot as the earliest we can get to the port is Saturday the 6th.

Thank you for your inquiry. I am Flevin Ankerman, handling maritime logistics inquiries. I must inform you that a speedboat transfer from Lagos to Johannesburg would not be possible as Johannesburg is inland and not accessible by watercraft. 

I would be happy to suggest alternative transportation methods for your group of three.

Best regards,

Mr. Santos,                    I’m looking for 2,000MT of tar for a deadline of August 25. Do you see any issues with getting it to Cotonou? I know you only have one lane, but you’re the one I’ve been working with the longest, so I know you can get it done.                    Best,                    Rachel                                        PS. If I get back from a vacation on the same day, I can pick it up.

We should be able to offer 400 EUR as a surcharge for any container size, not only a 20ft one.                     Please, check once again and advise.                   Maria

The vessel option you are looking for is through Magenta who will pick up the cargo from Manzanillo and deliver it to our Port of Entry in Corpus Christi. The vessel is set to sail on January 15th so please get your security letter for customs inspection in place before then. The vessel options are as follows:


1. Magenta - Just as you mentioned this is the cheapest but there is a longer transit time


Transit Time: 37 days


Freight Cost: $5,990


2. PCT - This is the fastest vessel but the cost is very high


Transit Time: 26 days


Freight Cost:$29,990


3. PCT - This is a better value than Magenta and

## Solutions

The above emails make sense in the context of an actual email thread, but would be confusing if taken out of context. What we are doing is explaining why the first email was confusing. We can see the reasons for the confusion.

This means the first message is perfectly fine but as it is
Email 3:
<Email 4>:

What if we don’t have a conversation or an email thread, or just one word of an email is missing? For example, we have two messages (5 and 6) below

We might be able to figure out why message 5 is not a good email. But message 6 has to be a good email.

How about we use the above rationale to find out how many words are missing in the message? So a message should have a dot ‘.’ followed by a word followed by a dot ‘.’ and that word cannot be the same word in both messages. Then it will have to be something like this

dot ‘.’, “…“, dot ‘.’

Now the question is, how many dots are there? And how many “?” are there? 5 dots and 2 question marks, so we have

dot ‘.’, “…”, dot

 <Email 5>:

It was one dot instead of two. So we need to find out which word is missing. dot, how? I think the word ‘email’ is missing.

Check the spelling in the third message. If the spelling is right, then it is not the word. Now, is it okay for an English message to have two different spelling of a word?

So, the message 6 above is correct, because the word ‘word’ and ‘word’ can be different. And the word ‘how’ is the word that is missing. So we got it. 🙂

## Symbols and missing words

Symbols and other symbols in writing are a powerful and important tool. They make our writing look professional. It helps us make an impression on our audience. Symbols can be thought of as the ‘stamp of the author’.

It is even more important to use proper grammar,

<Email 5>:
 , for example, when we are emailing or chatting with people.

Now, what about symbols like colon, comma, and semi-colon? How do we use them correctly? I think it is good to learn about proper punctuation for email or writing because it helps to communicate your ideas in a clear and effective manner. So, let’s start with colon ‘:’!

The colon is a punctuation mark that is used to separate a main idea from a supporting one in writing. If we look at the sentence below,

The food was very tasty: I ate two bowls.

We can see that there is a main idea and a supporting one. In this case, the main idea is the food was tasty. And the supporting one is that the person ate two bowls of food.","From: nate.wilson@globalfreight.com

Is there an automated reply sent when an email is not received by Linda or John (who is the intended recipient)? How will you track the case manually?

To answer this question, let’s imagine that both emails are sent at the same time.

In this example, we send two emails to Linda from John at the same time. They reach Linda at approximately the same time.

As we know, we often use a three-day buffer in our automated emails. This gives us time to confirm that an email is received by the intended recipient before sending an automated reply.

But today, I am not selling bulk grains anymore.                    Today I only sell dry bulk fertilizer, hard fertilizers, soft fertilizers, and rocks.

Today we bring over a million MTs of fertilizers.          I just delivered 2,000MT of potassium chloride fertilizer.          I just delivered 50,000MT of Nitrogen fertilizer.                    NUFertilizer is a soft fertilizer.                    We have ready stocks. 500,000MT in storage.                      Usually, we ship weekly. But this week we are running low on stocks.

I've been exporting timber to Southern Africa for 6 years now. The trade has been spectacular. While Canadians and Australians previously dominated the market, Brazilian forest products are now experiencing significant growth.

However, we're facing transportation challenges. With the Panama Canal currently affected by weather conditions, do you have any available slots for shipping from Brazil to South Africa?

However, given the current Panama Canal situation, I would be cautious about commitments for the full route to South Africa at this time.

Mr. Wu received three emails from Ms. Watson, each of which requested different information.

1. The first email asked for a quote for the quantity 2,500MT. The email asked for the earliest laycan date.
2. The second email requested a quote for the quantity 2,500MT, but with the requirement that the quote be adjusted up to 5,000MT

 Cancelled, _time after 1st email_

3. The third email, which came in response to Email 2, cancelled the inquiry. This email was sent 4 minutes after Email 2 was sent.

## Backscatter

The email sequences above were generated from pre-written message templates. Backscatter is a technique in which an auto-generated response is sent to the sender, without human intervention. This sort of reply looks as though the recipient is interacting with the sender.

To prevent backscatter, you can check each individual email for backscatter, or implement tools that stop messages from being sent automatically to a human.

In the email examples above, an auto-receipt would be sent to Ana. The auto-reply would say something like:

Thank you for your email. It has been forwarded to our assigned coffee broker, Mr. Hardy. Mr. Hardy will contact you soon to arrange the details of this order.

We do look forward to hearing from you soon.

The exportation of lumber could be seen as an invasive act in the ways it impacted the environment. In particular, the lumber lumber industry destroyed the rainforest, resulting in the extinction of many animals. Furthermore, the extinction of many animal species caused problems in maintaining a stable economy as well as in increasing the dependence of the community on the outside world.

The exportation of lumber from Freetown to Felixstowe in June has been assigned to the vessel MS FRISTOS.

The trans-Atlantic slave trade was an influential trade that was conducted for many years. It resulted in the introduction of about twelve million enslaved Africans, who were used as slaves by Europeans and Americans during the time. The trade can be said to be responsible for a decline in the number of African captives.
The good use of technology made the task of discovering and controlling the trans-Atlantic slave trade easy.

A Black Atlantic slave route took place through several forms. It took place from around 1450 A.D to 1830s A.D in 1830s A.D. The impact of the trans-Atlantic slave trade to the society can","From: patrick.smith@globaltimber.com

Good Morning Sir,

I just received your email, and sorry to hear of the delay in the cement shipment. 
You are correct, that was a last minute trip for my client, and a new shipment, this is the first time I was asked to send cement by air to Sweden. I have contacted my supply chain, and still waiting on the ETA. As a matter of fact, we did not even get a shipment to be sent to the forwarder. So I am working with my colleagues in the next couple of hours to get this shipment done, and hope to hear from them soon.

Dear Mr. Bravo,                     You are correct. The customer overpaid, but you are the one who must make the most out of this unexpected event.

Dear Mr. Bravo,                     The documents look fine to me, but there are two things you have to do: 1. Find another mode of transport for the remaining 1,200 MT of aviation fuel, which the customer won't take back. You can make a lot of money with this volume, because this aviation fuel is due to be consumed on the day you will receive it in Amsterdam. The customer does not want to transport the 1,200 MT to Belgium, so the least you can do is to sell this

An Example of Getting Quotes:
In one example, we got quotes for 40,000MT from Incheon to Ningbo, 15,000MT from Singapore to China and 20,000MT from Shanghai to China, among other lessor profitable cargoes from South Korea. We tried our best to minimise the freight cost, because we are a young business. As the shipping industry is dominated by cartel-like players, the cost of shipping is difficult to control.

After securing the best quotes and making a calculation, the total cost of shipping was less than S$20,000. In terms of price

It is important to think about this from the carrier’s perspective, as every shipper has the same cargo. I constantly kept an eye on rates for the same dates as the shippers were looking at, so I could check whether the shippers were taking advantage of rates. The rates of the carriers would change at different times based on many factors, including demand and supply. In fact, there is also a cap on rates by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) due to the deep-sea shipping market becoming an oligopoly, with only a few shipping companies dominating the global shipping market, as is the case with many industries today. As mentioned, it is difficult to find lower rates if they are limited by the IMO,","From: precious.khor@example.com

James,

I just saw the email you sent out about our inventory. I know that this is a response that most people can find off the web but I really appreciate that you took the time to read our order and get back to me. I would like to keep a few thoughts that you brought up in mind during your email to make a decision about our contract.

I am sorry that I had such a hard time when I was trying to place the order. I didn't have a consultant. I did research the prices of FREYSSINET and thought I would do a better job than a consultant. Your note made me think of another idea. Maybe there are even more sources than I could find on my own. There is no doubt that we could get a better price from an agent than a consultant or if you were to provide one, we can save money.

I'm impressed with your analysis

James,
Thanks for responding to my email. I got a lot of information from your email. I'm sure you don't write these responses every day but it really helps a customer.

I'm especially happy about your last thought about the use of agent or consultant. I did a little research and I learned that you use consultants in about 10% of your orders. This was encouraging to me because we would not be the first. You may want to think about that before you send out the next email. I think we would save enough on fees with a consultant and agent that it would make us come out a lot ahead. Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further.

Sincerely,

Body: Dear James,

Thank you for your detailed response regarding our order. I appreciate that you took the time to review our specific needs and reach out personally.

I should mention that I encountered some challenges while placing the order without a consultant's assistance. I had initially researched FREYSSINET pricing independently, believing I could manage without professional guidance. However, your email has made me consider that there might be additional sourcing options I haven't explored. I'm particularly interested in the potential cost savings we might achieve through either an agent or your direct services.

Your analysis has been quite enlightening.

Best regards,
Gomes

Thank you again for your comprehensive response. The information you provided has been very helpful in understanding our options.

I've done some research and found that your company utilizes consultants in approximately 10% of your orders, which is reassuring as it shows this is a well-established practice. The potential cost savings through either a consultant or agent arrangement seems significant. I would be interested in discussing this further if you're available.

First of all, you have made a very good decision picking us as your preferred carrier. We will be very glad to get your cargo to Dar es Salaam. For this, we will be using the ""Fast Liner"" shipping method. Please note that the ""Fast Liner"" service does not include any delays caused by Customs.

Would you mind sending us your credit application to speed up the payment and import clearance process? This document is crucial for us to process your cargo.

Thanks for your early inquiry. Our client requires arrival in Tianjin by May 10, 2022, which is approximately 30 days from now. We can accommodate the 7,500MT pyridine shipment through either:

1. Our 29,000 DWT Suezmax vessel with additional 50,000 DWT VLCC charter
2. A chartered 50,000 DWT Suezmax via Suez Canal
3. A chartered 60,000 DWT VLCC

This arrangement would provide 6-7 weeks' notice for loading in Zhoushan. Total estimated cost would be US$8.5 million (including loading and charter rates at $0.10/bbl and $0.08/bbl respectively).

Body: Hi Jamie,

Did you receive the request from Esposito's yesterday? I'd like to confirm a supply of 1,500MT of Mazut from Libya to Jebel Ali next week. Can you accommodate the laycan extension, too?

Best wishes,

Good day Mr. Yamaguchi,                    Our client just transferred some ethanol to the tank in Riyadh, but they cannot receive the shipper’s IRB until next week. Could you hold the cargo for 48 hours under DAF for free while waiting for the permit?                    Best regards,                    Paddy

Dear Paddy,                               The Client just got the IRB from Saudi customs, the transportation is proceed to the port. The shipper is waiting for the discharge of the cargo. However, it seems that the port could not complete the unloading because of the low manpower to work, as we received from the Saudi agent. The cargo will arrive Riyadh in 48 hours. Could you keep the cargo in tank under DAF for 48 hours? I could not wait any longer for free. Thanks.                       Best regards,                    Jon

I would like to confirm that your client has already transferred some ethanol to the tank in Riyadh. It is likely that the tank was not fully filled because of the shortage of manpower. The cargo was successfully discharged and delivered. I hope to work with you on this opportunity again in the future.","From: paddy.murphy@trading.com

The client has just received the IRB from Saudi customs and transportation to the port is proceeding. The shipper is waiting for cargo discharge, however, we've been informed by our Saudi agent that the port is experiencing delays due to low manpower availability. The cargo will arrive in Riyadh within 48 hours. Regarding your request for DAF storage - I regret that we cannot offer this free of charge.

Hello David,                    What’s the freight quote to Singapore for 50,000MT of granulated slag (2,000MT in single loads) from Hamburg next month? Also, what’s your estimated transit time to Singapore?                    Best,                    Yinan
Email 2:
1. The freight quote is: $1,396,652 2. The estimated transit time is: 35 days (not counting loading / unloading time)

<<Brutal Definition of CVR>>:
A CVR refers to “Customer Value Retention Rate”. In other words, it is the percentage of customers that come back to you for a repeat order.

For example, if you sold 200 widgets to company A, 50% of those widgets were purchased again the next time A purchased from you.

In this example, your CVR is 50%.

You can also use this to measure the life-time value of your customers. If you have 200 customers and your CVR is 30%, you can assume that on average 60 of your customers are going to keep buying from you until they die.

Note: These measurements can be used to accurately predict how well
Email 3:
I have two customers who have kept buying from me repeatedly, one for 1,000 orders and the other for 2,000 orders. Are they using my online tool, or are they just purchasing over the phone, or both?

There’s no clear answer to this, but here are a few pointers to help you make sense of this.

Remember that the CVR (Customer Value Retention Rate) is the percentage of customers that come back to you for a repeat order. You can calculate this by looking at the percentage of orders that came back to you (or came back to you but didn’t purchase again)

I am thinking about using your plugin for e-commerce. Do you have a plan to monetize it? Or do you plan to offer it for free?

Yes, I have a plan to monetize the plugin. I plan to do this by offering the plugin as a monthly subscription. The subscription will be priced at $100 per month. In other words, you will need to pay$100 per month to use the plugin.

This is one of the ways that I plan to monetize the plugin. The other way is by selling the plugin as a paid one-time purchase. I will be discussing this more in the next few days.","From: yinan.chen@trading.com

Please book my next ship at once.                         In three days time my agent will ship my container of grain from Rotterdam to Halifax.                         I would also like to book a container from Halifax to Rotterdam at the same time.                               Kind regards,                                   Anna

Answer:
Anna,                     If I remember correctly your name is Anna and your load would be shipped from Rotterdam to Halifax with ZIM/Rotterdam/ZIM ID: Y245877 dated: (add date).                         I will ask if we can book Halifax to Rotterdam with the same ship to arrive in Rotterdam two days before the date shown above.                         If everything goes according to plan I will send the booking after 12 pm on the 1st and after that you can send your LCL to Rotterdam on the following day.                         Your agent will be expecting the shipment.                                 James

Your agent tells me that he could not book my grain until the 5th, so I will wait for that.                         I also sent the container in Rotterdam by ZIM/Ironman/1RIT04Z3072/3.                                  I will email again in the morning.

Answer:
ZIM has three options of empty return from Halifax to Rotterdam:                          COD Rotterdam, tomorrow Thursday 31st.                       One container from Hamburg to Rotterdam, Friday 1st February 2013.                           The shipment is guaranteed by ZIM and the container will be in Rotterdam on the 2nd. ZIM would like the container at their terminal on Thursday before 4 pm.                       A fourth option is sending my container by MSC to Bremerhaven and then the empty return on COD Rotterdam on Thursday, because ZIM can not get me a guaranteed return in time.                          You have the choice

Anna,

I just send you my booking for your grain from Rotterdam to Halifax. I will check if we can book your empty return from Halifax to Rotterdam by MSC/COD. If that is possible I will let you know asap.                              Your load would be shipped with ZIM/Rotterdam/Y245877 added date.                        Let me know if you have any questions.                    James

Anna,

I asked ZIM and it is possible to book your empty return from Halifax to Rotterdam by MSC/COD Rotterdam on the 31st.                        Your empty container would be taken from the ZIM terminal in Halifax on the 31st. but I will need the following information:                          Container no:                                Make, model and weight of the engine.                         Serial number:                         If it is possible to put the engine on deck in Rotterdam.                        We do not need the engine","From: anna.trader@tradingco.com

Max,                    We’ve got 13,500MT of heavy gasoline in Cartagena that we’d like to ship out asap. Could you provide a preliminary quote and confirm if you handle port dues under FOB terms?                    Best regards,                    Dan

Hi,                   With regard to your message above, I’m happy to start a conversation about your logistics needs. It seems there are some potential risks, including weather impact and Suez Canal bottlenecks that will affect transportation. As such, the earliest available vessel for loading the cargo is not for another 14 days. However, you can still ship this cargo by the fastest available vessel for an additional premium of 7% if you are prepared to pay for the cost difference and the fees associated with carrying the risk of uncertainty. The sea freight cost is typically cheaper because the additional cost will only be incurred in the unlikely event of an inevitable delay or cancelation. I am attaching some indicative transport cost estimates for your review. These calculations are based on the available information, including port dues, and thus these figures may be subject to change depending on the final contract details.                    Kind regards,                    Simon

Milt,                       Thank you for your email dated 23/10/19. Your party won the most number of seats in the recent U.S. elections and you have been asked to form the government. This was one of the most keenly contested elections in history and you and your party have the ability to form a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. In response to the email below, your party plans to use the $100,000 gift from your Party Unity Coalition to fundraise for the initial payrolls of employees and contractors in the new government, then to contribute a further $50,000 each month to this effort for a period of 4 months. 
My boss also offered to fundraise a further $500,000 and to make this contribution and future contributions tax-deductible. However, in view of the fact that the U.S. has no tax system

I have already put together a quote for 30,63 USD. You can contact me again.                    Kind regards,                    Ian

In my opinion, Julia’s co-worker made the right choice in choosing this strategy, since he did not want to respond to Mikhail’s email. As you can see, in the second email, Miki offers to take Mikhail’s project, since it is not worth a manager to deal with that. In order

Hi Sergei,                    I hope that you are well.                      I am in the final stages of preparing my final report on the quality of agricultural products, and I have included a section in the report that relates to food processing as it pertains to products. As you know, my PhD is on food processing, and as such, I thought it would be beneficial to include this section in my report. I was wondering if you could go over this section with me, as I am unsure about how the key concepts are linked. I am also unsure how to apply the concepts to industry, and would be grateful for your input and guidance. I look forward to hearing from you,                                        Regards,                                        Andrew

Timestamp: 2024-02-01 09:15
Body: Hi Sergei,

A vessel was stranded off Australia due to mechanical failure. This has caused a significant reduction in transport to that area, and it has caused a shortage of supply. I've found some information that may help you prepare for the new market conditions, and I'm attaching this file for your presentation.

I hope this helps and that you are not affected by these disruptions.

Best wishes,
Andrew

I am contacting you to discuss the concerns I have regarding the issues on the cruise.              Despite the itinerary on the website stating that a 5 hour lunch break would be given in the day time, this was not the case. Our client's cruise began early in the morning, and at the start of the first afternoon, the cruise stopped for an hour, where the client's lunch would have been normally taken.                Following this, our client informed the cruise company that she would not be able to attend any additional activities during the second part of the cruise, due to her trip abroad the next morning.                Unfortunately, after the cruise stopped, the client left to change her outfit for dinner. It is clear to me that her actions were not entirely justified.

Body: Dear Luis,

I am writing to address additional concerns regarding our cruise client's experience.

The published itinerary indicated a 5-hour lunch break, which was not provided. Instead, the cruise began early morning with only a one-hour stop in the early afternoon. Our client subsequently informed the cruise company that she would not participate in the remaining activities due to international travel commitments the following day.

While I acknowledge that the client's decision to leave for a wardrobe change during dinner time may not have been fully justified, as their representative, I believe some form of compensation should be considered for the significant deviation from the advertised schedule.

Dear Simon,
Thanks for your detailed explanation. I received a very similar email earlier this morning but the case was
very straightforward as the seller had advised that the vessel was to be cleared on the 21st of August and
demurrage to commence from the 22nd.  I was able to quickly email back the response based on your case
for a 45 day lay time to commence on the 22nd.
However, with regards to your case where you are buying a small quantity (3,000MT), I do not believe the
seller should be paying the terminal demurrage as this is considered a short term booking and this is
covered under the charterer's guarantee as per the charter party.  The charterer will want to ensure that the
ship is not stuck in port for any longer than necessary for whatever reason and therefore, will want to

Thank you for your email. Let me clarify our terminal demurrage structure. The terminal charges are calculated on a per day per TEU basis at the rate of $5.00. Terminal demurrage is calculated based on both the vessel's time alongside/in accessible waters and the number of TEUs still berthed on the vessel.

Thank you for your detailed inquiries. While I handled a similar case this morning where the vessel was to be cleared on August 21st with demurrage commencing from August 22nd, your case is different. For your small quantity order (3,000MT), the terminal demurrage should actually fall under the charterer's guarantee as per the charter party, not the seller's responsibility. This is standard for short-term bookings.

My father managed to catch the boy and somehow held onto the rope to the boat until the boy calmed down enough to reach for the rope. We are both thankful that the boat didn't sink.

Hello Ms. Chao,                    I have received your quotation, but would like to get an extra day as load restrictions will prevent us from sailing immediately. Do you have a best rate for 10,500MT of ethanol ready from Aqaba to Busan. It can only sail in 4 days time.                    Thank you,                    Jan

Hello Jan,                    We will schedule sailing of our VLCC bulker before the middle of next week. For the moment we don't have an extra day, but we can make an extra day at very short notice.                    In case we have a day available, we can let you know in advance. However, I think that you can get a best rate without the extra day.                    Also note that we always appreciate your cooperation in the necessary load procedure for loading VLCC cargoes on board. We have received several vessels from Busan with less than 100% ballast. We really have to reduce ballast with our last vessel to make sure to have sufficient load margins for the remaining cargo. That's our only excuse to load not the minimum ballast for our chemical vessel.                    Please be advised that if you have a cargo which will arrive close to expiry and consequently has to be held

Hello Felix,                Thank you for your latest information. However the tanks are already loaded with a cargo (last gas cargo) of 80% and will hold until the next load. Do you have a suitable rate for now?                Best regards,                Jan
Reply Email:
Dear Mr. Jan,                I can only give you a best rate if I know your cargo characteristics. But I think that you will have a lower rate if we let our bunker take care of your voyage. We will carry your product to Busan on a confirmed VLCC Bulker (per your request) and bunker from Busan to Aqaba. After that, you can pay bunker or proceed yourself. You will have to add discount of bunker oil at Busan.

Our VLCC is scheduled to sail by middle of next week. While we currently cannot guarantee an extra lay day, we may be able to accommodate this on short notice.

Regarding vessel preparation, please note that we've recently received vessels from Busan with suboptimal ballast conditions. We need to ensure proper ballast management for safe chemical cargo operations.

I recommend proceeding with the standard laytime to secure the best rate. Please advise if you would like to proceed.

I'll need your cargo specifications to provide the best rate. However, I can offer a solution where we handle the voyage on our VLCC, including bunkering from Busan to Aqaba. You would have the option to either pay for bunkers or arrange your own. A bunker discount at Busan would apply.

We can accommodate approximately 5,500MT if you'd like to proceed with this arrangement.

Please let me know if you would like me to begin the bunker and sailing arrangements.

 Hey Andrea,
I’ve taken your advise and hired a local customs agent to get the cricket equipment cleared. I’ve also made arrangements to pick up my container from the port. The agent has told me that I must clear the equipment in a few days, otherwise the container may be sold. He also said that it’s a good thing to have the cricket equipment cleared by a local customs agent. I will be flying to Quetta in 10 days and will be arriving at the port to pick up the container. The agent has told me that a truck will be provided to take the container to my address. I do have some questions.

1. How do you pay for the clearance?
2. Will the trucking company charge us a fee?
3. What if the container is full? I need to send all my cricket equipment but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to fit it
Email 4:
Hi Saroop,
1. How do you pay for the clearance?
If you are paying for clearance and the agent is going to handle it, I suggest you pay with a pre-paid card and keep the receipt. Once you’re in Quetta, the agent will pay for the fees and keep the receipt for their records. When you go to get your cricket equipment, you’ll pay the agent back and keep their receipt.

2. Will the trucking company charge us a fee?
3. What if the container is full? I need to send all my cricket equipment but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to fit it

As for fees, you should ask the agent to send a quote to you. Once you confirm the cost, you should pay the agent and they should file the paperwork. I suggest you ask for a copy of the quote for your records.

Regarding your questions:

1. For clearance payments, I recommend using a pre-paid card and keeping all receipts. The agent will handle the fees initially, and you can reimburse them when you arrive in Quetta.

2. For trucking fees and other costs, ask the agent for a detailed quote before proceeding. Make sure to get everything in writing.

3. Regarding container capacity, you should discuss the dimensions with the shipping agent to ensure everything will fit.

We don’t want to go with that firm this month, because their certificates only came with a partial payment.                    Could you direct us to another company?

I checked with the loading company you recommended. They confirmed they can handle the job, but they're asking for $400 more than our original budget. Given their reputation, I think they're worth it. I'll get this additional cost approved on our end.

I would like to inform you that we have picked up the car from Rotterdam and now it is en route to Denmark. It will arrive at the port of Copenhagen at about 11:00 next Tuesday morning. I hope this makes up for the inconvenience caused by not transporting the car on the original date.

Regards,
Anders

Dear Ziad,                    Thanks for the quick response to my initial email.                    My deadline is tight, but I think I can manage a 2-3 day turnaround for this shipment of polymer.

Hi Koen,                    I have a 6,500MT shipment of aluminum from Mombasa to Haiphong. Is it still feasible for us to ship by 19 July? We’re worried about tariff risk due to COP26, so please let us know your best offer.                    Many thanks,                    Adrian

Koen,               I hope you’re well. I’ve read through the COP26 tax proposal with interest. As you are aware, the EDC tax rate will increase to 6% in 2023, which means it could reach $70 / mt if the rate doesn’t rise again in the following years. Therefore, it’s important for us to ship this order before COP26 takes effect, as we’re planning on increasing our exposure to ALUMINIUM. I have a few questions:
        1. The current EDC tax rate is 3% and there’s an additional 3% tax in 2023 and 4% in 2024. Is there any clarity on what the rate will be in the following years? I know this may change, but it’s difficult to predict. (Answer: In 2024, it may be 4% as

1. We also have a product which is looking to ship in November. Do you think it is worth
considering a new LCOE contract on top of the cost for us? (Answer: Yes, it might be worth it. There’s a good probability of seeing it drop because of the weakening Dalian index. But don’t expect the same discount as in previous deals. It’s quite difficult to find lumps in the market. LCOEs are hard to find.)
Koen,            I've sent the documentation in the email. Please let me know if there are any issues. I also attached the FMC Declaration to see if that's something you need.

Hi Mr. Kamhi,                    We are currently working on a 6,000MT cargo of acid anhydride from New Orleans to Saudi Arabia, and can you provide a standard rate if we finalize on Tuesday?                    Thanks,                    Bobby
Email 2:
Hi Bobby,
 
It will cost $25 per MT, FOB New Orleans.
The freight rates for the 40' FP container would be about $1400.
The ocean freight could be spread over 16 weeks, so I would expect to see your cargo 16 weeks from now, if I do not get an early payment for the freight. 
 
However, the standard practice here is to allow the buyer to get a spot rate, which, I have noted, is 28% higher than our price.
The seller is hoping to make the spot rate, but does not have the luxury of counting on it.
The buyer might not find a spot rate, or might not be able to pay for it.
So, that is why I am asking you to call me on Tuesday and get a standard price. 
 
Let me know if you need any further information.

We need a 1,300MT shipment of COG asap from Veracruz to Santos. Are you able to meet a next week laycan? Could you let us know the standard dispatch rate as well?

Body: Hi Yana,

I have a delay on a 1,300MT shipment for COG from Veracruz to Santos, because the vessel that was dispatched was diverted due to Hurricane Paula. We have another vessel that is approaching port but it may take 2-3 weeks for the discharge to be completed. I believe the laycan may be around Dec. 8-11. I will reach out to my counterparts in Santos for the actual laycan.

Please let me know if you have any additional requirements.

Good morning Patrick.                    We are currently moving 12,500MT of urea from Dubai to Jakarta next month. Could you advise if we will have to take a full vessel to transport this amount?                    Best regards,                    Penny

Hello Penny,
    It depends on the vessel being used and the type of material being loaded.
    When you move 12500mt in a single shipment, there are some factors that affect this amount as well:
    1) Max. Weight of each vessel, which depends on the type of vessel (tanker, lighthouse, etc.)
    2) The “type” of material that you are transporting and their density.
    3) The amount of space you are occupying in each “stack” (which can range from one to five depending on the type of vessel and its design)
    So, basically, you should consider that for every ton of material you move you can load a specific amount of empty spaces available (which is determined by the vessel’s design and type) in order to have a full “load” but it’s not a guarantee that you will fill all

    A) The “Single Deck” tankers (which are also known as “LNG vessels”); B) The “Double Deck” tankers (known as “LPG Carriers”); and C) The “Truck Tanker” (a semi-trailer that can be driven on the highway or even be used as a “road-train” in some cases).

Thanks Mika for your message.            Shipping  Pallets from China to North America can vary depending on the country of origin and destination. The most common route would be a maritime vessel travelling through the Panama Canal and being loaded onto a container ship.            For a start, here's an estimate for shipping a pallet of 4 m2 from China to Los Angeles: US$200 per shipment (equivalent to US$80 per cubic metre).

Timestamp: 2024-01-15 11:45
Body: Hello Penny,

It depends on the vessel being used and the type of material being loaded. When moving 12,500MT in a single shipment, several factors need to be considered:

1. Maximum weight capacity of the vessel, which varies by vessel type
2. The physical properties of the urea and its stowage factor
3. The vessel's cargo hold configuration and stack capacity

For this quantity, you might not need a full vessel - we could potentially arrange for a parcel booking on a larger bulk carrier. Would you like me to explore some specific options?

Hello M/s Alex,                    I need to schedule a shipment of 3,200MT of diesel from Venzuela to Rotterdam. I have 8 deliveries planned from July 15 to Aug 1. How much is your deposit?

Email 2:
Hi Tal,                Thank you for the inquiry. We will be glad to proceed with your inquiry. Our minimum amount of deposit is US$100,000. Since you are requesting 8 shipments, our total minimum amount of deposit would be US$800,000. We will require this amount to be made as 8 instalments of US$100,000 each. This amount will be deducted from the total value of your shipments. For instance, if you are shipping 3,200MT of diesel at US$500 per MT, the total cost of your shipment would be US$1,600,000. US$800,000 will be deducted from this amount making the total cost US$800,000. Our advance payment requirement is for us to guarantee your shipment. This amount will be considered a surety.

Hi Tal,               I am sorry for the misunderstanding. Please see the email below. It is difficult to obtain such a big amount of money in short notice. This is the reason why we require a higher deposit amount than what most of our clients usually pay.

Body: Hello M/s Alex,

I need to schedule a shipment of 3,200MT of diesel from Venezuela to Rotterdam. I have 8 deliveries planned from July 15 to Aug 1. How much is your deposit? Do you prefer payment by wire transfer or cash?

Looking forward to your reply,

Body: Hi Tal,

Thank you for the inquiry. We will be glad to proceed with your request. Our minimum deposit is US$100,000 per shipment. Since you are requesting 8 shipments, the total deposit required would be US$800,000, payable in 8 installments of US$100,000 each.

This deposit will be deducted from the total value of your shipments. For example, if you are shipping 3,200MT of diesel at US$500 per MT, the total cost would be US$1,600,000. The US$800,000 deposit would be deducted from this amount.

The advance payment requirement serves as a guarantee for your shipment and our freight charges.

Best regards,
Alex

Body: Hi Tal,

I apologize if there was any misunderstanding regarding the deposit amount. We require a higher deposit than usual due to the short notice and multiple shipments involved. Our forwarders are quite risk-averse and have limited resources, with most of their capital tied up in freight operations. They cannot take chances on shipments without adequate security.

I hope you understand our position.

I apologize for the delay, but you can start this order right away. I'll arrange for a single bill of lading to be issued, and I'm interested in hearing about the volume of orders I need to place to buy in bulk.

Thank you,

Body: Thank you for your prompt reply, Stephanie.

I've placed orders for 6 truckloads of feed for each week, starting the first week in September, and I would like to issue the initial invoice to you after the last truckload.

I also appreciate the offer of bulk buying, but I prefer FOB terms so that I can sell my own feed at retail.

Regards,
Adam

Dear Brian, 
Thanks for your enquiry. Unfortunately we do not have any availability for cargo for the 20th of June. There is a Bunker Bill due for our vessels, which is expected to be paid by the 13th of June and must be settled for our vessel to load and depart from the US. The earliest we would be available would be on the 25th of June. 

As for demurrage, we would like to discuss this with you as the amount and structure of demurrage is not fixed. Our rates start from USD1.00 /ft per day, for which the terms are: 

      Shipowner's Demurrage Policy

Sorry Brian. After a quick review of our schedule, there are no available slots until August.

Body: Dear Brian,

Thanks for your enquiry. Unfortunately we do not have any availability for cargo for the 20th of June. There is a Bunker Bill due for our vessels, which is expected to be paid by the 13th of June and must be settled for our vessel to load and depart. The earliest we would be available would be on the 25th of June.

Regarding demurrage, our rates start from USD 1.00/ft per day, under the following structure:

Shipowner's Demurrage Policy:
FOB Conditions: USD 1.00 per cubic foot per day, subject to maximum annual rate per cubic foot of USD 75.

Best regards,
Katie

Do you also need to use the lines for transportation of rubber?                    P.S. How much will this trip cost?                    Thanks,                    Victor

Dear Victor,                        I'm sorry, but I am unable to transport 50,000MT of napalm in your requested time. Also, the ship only has room for 30,000MT of goods. We can only use the lines for rubber, and this is how much I will charge you:                    100,000 napalm per roundtrip                     10,000 rubber per roundtrip                    200,000 rupees                    Please send payment via this account:                Steven Catherst                    ddc@thegoodstuff.com                        Regards,                    Roger Mertens

Dear Sir,
                     I am sorry to say, but I can't transport your goods. I have enough capacity to take 20,000MT of goods, and there's nothing here that would make up that amount. However, since you were kind enough to provide the account, I have decided to charge you 2% of the value of what I could have transported (60,000MT of napalm) just for the hell of it. To do this, I will take a 1000 napalm trip, which will cost you: 100000 napalm, 100000 rubber, 200000 rupees, and 1200 napalm/roundtrip.  I have included the account below:

This email, however, is not used, as the two parties already agreed on it.

It is the purpose of emails to coordinate, communicate, and conduct business. This section examines a sample of email threads between buyers and sellers. In many ways, email resembles face-to-face conversations, which were analyzed in the last section.

Emails are more asynchronous than face-to-face conversations. While email conversations allow for a lot of discussion, they are also prone to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and misinterpretation. Email users can only respond to a message when they receive it, but in the process of email composition, it takes a lot of time before a response is sent. Communication between two email users is often delayed and incomplete. Also, email messages are prone to re-read","From: heather.smith@tradeco.com

I think last year the budget for the SALES REP division of my company was approximately $2,500,000.

 Dear Liana,                    Thank you for your message and please accept my apologies for the inconvenience.                    Unfortunately, the price for CFCL is not the only reason we decided to stop importing this material.                    As you know, with the growing production of carbon fiber products, the supply of CFCL has become more limited, and it has become more difficult to secure it.                    Also, there are no warehouses in the USA that are licensed to store this product.                    Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of this material, and not to damage it during transportation, we have stopped importing CFCL.                    On the other hand, the price of other types of composites is increasing, and CFCL has become relatively more expensive.                    Nevertheless, you are always welcome to reach out to us with your requirements, and we will be more than happy to help you find the best alternative for your project.

We've been in touch with our client in Calais. We've received a 100% refund on your shipment. They've also agreed to reimburse us for the $7.5k we paid in shipping costs.

I'd like to add that this was a great opportunity to see the Parisian railway station, which was fascinating! We'll make sure to keep an eye on the process of getting this cheese to Kobe.

Body: Hey Chris,

We've just started our first voyage. I'm willing to pay 0.5% minimum guaranteed rate of $35/MT on 6,500MT of polymers from Rotterdam to Hamburg. But I can go down as far as $20/MT, do you think that's a fair offer?

Thanks in advance,

We've been meeting every weekend and I don't know what I'll do now, but we can't carry on the way we are. It was probably my fault that we got involved in the first place; the sexual tension was there all the time. Please be understanding. I don't really want to get into details but we have met in places and done things that we shouldn't have. It has to stop. Please don't say anything to Fiona. I don't know if you know or not, but we've been seeing each other for over a year now.

Can your vsl lift 8,400MT of clinker from Sohar to Mombasa? Also, do you apply a bunker escalation clause or keep a fixed rate?                    Regards,                    Andrew
Email 2:
Due to the complexity of bulk rates, both simple and indexed escalation clauses are commonly used in the
sea cargo market. Bulk rates are based on bunker price and tonnage. Escalation clauses are used to
implement the benefits of a bunker cost increase and prevent the carrier from changing the contract rate
and extending it through an escalation clause. Generally, escalation clauses are used when a contract
purchaser is concerned about the impact of a bunker price increase. Should the bunker price increase,
bulk rates and contracts are usually adjusted accordingly. A bunker escalation clause allows the parties
to index their contracts on a timely basis rather than having to wait until a contract is being renewed or
terminated. In addition, an escalation clause in a contract increases the incentive for the parties to
achieve cost savings by allowing the buyer to negotiate an adjustment when the seller is benefiting from
a rise in the cost","From: andrew.smith@shipper.com

Body: Dear Andrew,

Thank you for your inquiry. Regarding the bunker clause, we typically use an escalation clause for bulk cargo contracts. This allows us to adjust rates based on bunker price fluctuations, providing more flexibility than fixed rates. The clause enables regular indexing of contract rates without waiting for contract renewal, while protecting both parties from significant bunker price variations.

Regarding vessel availability and specific rate quotation, could you please provide your intended laycan dates?

Hi Charlotte,                    I’m on the receiving end of Mr. Russell’s email, and wanted to let you know our logistics department will be able to handle this order. What are we looking at for logistics costs, and are they going to be in addition to our land transport rate?                    Looking forward to hearing from you.                    Sarah
Email 2:
Sarah,                    Mr. Russell recently sent me an email confirming his wishes for the new pallets. He asked if they would be ready in time for delivery in 3 weeks. I thought you might like to see his email. It looks like he’s looking for more product than I first thought.                    So, to summarize:                    Mr. Russell ordered 20 new pallets for 20,000 units. We’re doing delivery in 3 weeks. We can handle this with the current pallets, but it will be tight. (Let’s talk logistics.)                    You said it would be good to speak with Mr. Russell about the shipping costs, but we’re on the hook for a $2,000 deposit. We can run the numbers and let you know how much you’re looking at for shipping costs.                    Let me know if you have any questions.                    Tami

Sarah,                    Tami’s response has gone into a queue waiting for our Logistics Manager to respond.                   Do you want me to check back in 10 minutes to see what his response has been?                    I can tell you that Mr. Russell wants you to confirm delivery for next Tuesday. The first pallet should be ready for delivery on Friday.                    Thanks,                    Charlotte

Mr. Russell recently sent me an email confirming his order details. To summarize:

- 20 new pallets for 20,000 units
- Delivery needed in 3 weeks
- Current pallet capacity is tight but manageable

Regarding costs, we're committed to a $2,000 deposit. I'll have the team calculate the final shipping costs for your review.

Hi Julie,                   We have recently received the 1099s for all of the vendors we pay on a monthly basis. It seems as though the information reported does not match the information reported on the payables vouchers. Please look into this immediately as we will be required to notify each of our vendors of the discrepancy.                   Please advise.                  Best Regards,                   Annette

Upon receiving the email, you are anxious to get the problem resolved quickly. Because you do not know the other parties involved in the issue, you need to initiate a conversation to find out what the other party thinks the problem is. Since Marko is not directly in charge of the Accounts payable accounts, you decide to send him an email asking for his input and/or expertise. Your reply email should be sent to both Marko and Annette.

Hi Julie,                   I have received the email and the 1099s from Marko and Annette. Let me see if I can figure out what is going on.

Dear Mr. Zee,            In response to your email, the IMO only allows the Suez Canal transit vessel to transit within 24 hours after the loading of LSHS, which is too tight a time for the scheduled sailing window of the cargo ship to the Indies. Mr. Chen (Manager, International Trade Department)

What kind of rates do you have for refrigerated service? I would also like to know about the inland charge of $1.50 from port to consumer.

Hi Karina,                    Thank you for the sul acid enquiry. As per our past experiences, most vessels from Antwerp take 10-12 days to arrive Houston. Also, most vessels will be full loaded for India with sulphuric acid as a ballast cargo, which will mean lower revenue for the vessel and therefore higher freight costs. I would recommend using a break-bulk vessel to optimise freight costs, especially given the uncertainty regarding international economic conditions. Please advise on your shipper requirements and if you would like a quotation.                    Kind regards,                    Jon

The cargo may be loaded by the shipper to the next best charter rate. 

Please let me know how your customer expects to do business with this opportunity, that is, if you could provide an offer based on the proposal submitted. We are looking for weekly spot shipment but it could be FOB as the availability is just weekly spot basis. 

How do you prefer us to do business? I guess it will be based on your offer as per our proposal submission.
If that is the case, the offer shall be submitted based on your shipper’s current or top charter rates.

In case you prefer to go by the proposal submitted, then we need to send to the client a revised proposal based on your current charter rates.

Hi Lisa,                    We are loading 3000 MT of crude oil today from Marseille to Beirut. Our earliest available berth in Marseille is Tuesday 27th July.

Dear Gary,                   We are on our way to Beaune and will likely have an ETA for your port around 2200 local time. As our equipment needs to be unloaded at Beaune it would be better if we could unload in Marseille. We will be available in Marseille from Thursday 29th July.

How would you recommend that I parse these emails to ensure that if there are multiple emails with the same date, the earliest date will be picked and the other emails are ignored. I think if you look at the way I have the email on the above email there is no check for duplicate dates.

Or perhaps it is an easier question to ask in how would you recommend that I parse these emails to ensure that if there are multiple emails with the same date, the first email with that date is picked and the other emails are ignored.

Hi Andrew,                    With the usual 5 days at Constanza, there will be no major issues at Calais. On the other hand, we are also extending a 7-day storage at our Med terminal to reduce the backlog from the above mentioned issues.                        With regards,                    Helena

Would you mind sending the cost of the crane by e-mail as we have to pay it today?

# Bulk vs Loop – Top 5 SQL Performance Comparisons

### Bulk Update and Delete

The first bulk versus loop comparison is bulk update and delete operations. A bulk update or delete can be viewed as a more or less complicated data type conversion. Instead of processing rows with SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE, one can convert them in bulk.

Bulk update and delete can be a lot faster than UPDATE and DELETE. While UPDATE and DELETE are based on changing one row at a time, a bulk update or delete can change or remove many rows at a time.

Let’s start with a simple UPDATE example.
```
UPDATE  table_name 
SET     field_name = 1.2

As we plan to ship several loads to this terminal in a short period of time, we will have at least one Vessel to keep both lanes operating smoothly.

WL7 is booked for Friday to Mon. For Monday and Tue we will use WL5 and WL6. WL6 will be used for Wed & Thur.

Good afternoon Mrs. Perkins,                    I’d like to arrange delivery of 10,000 tonnes of sugar for shipment from Shanghai to Vancouver. Your schedule for the coming month indicates that the Venus will be free for that size of load around 11 February.

That’ll be fine, I think. A nice fat cargo of sugar, will be on sale all over Vancouver by the time it reaches. As you say, the Venus is ideal for your load, it’ll sail on 6 February, it’ll be there on 12 February. A big, high volume, reliable ship; there won’t be any holdups, I’m sure. There’s no need to put the freight in in advance, just send the invoices to myself, once everything’s sorted I’ll make sure the rest of the paperwork goes smoothly.

 Hi Max,                    Thanks for the update. I've been in touch with the local representative in Greece. The container has been unloading for two weeks now. There is a lot of back and forth between the shipper, the shipper's agent in Greece, and the local Customs agent. In the mean time, the shipper had to pay several fines to the Greek Customs.                    Currently, the container is at the port in Thessaloniki, waiting for the shipper to send a new bill of lading for it. Once the bill of lading is sent, the container will be cleared and sent to Broker Inc.                    I've attached a couple of photos to give you an idea of the situation. As soon as the bill of lading is approved, I'll let you know and send you more photos of the process.                    Best regards,                    Rob

Thanks for the update. I've been in touch with the local representative in Greece. The container has been at the port for two weeks now. There is a lot of back and forth between the shipper, the shipper's agent in Greece, and the local Customs agent. The shipper has had to pay several fines to Greek Customs.

Currently, the container is at the port in Thessaloniki, waiting for the shipper to send a new bill of lading. Once the bill of lading is sent, the container will be cleared and sent to Broker Inc.

I've attached a couple of photos to give you an idea of the situation. As soon as the bill of lading is approved, I'll let you know and send you more photos of the process.

Best regards,
Rob

Body: Hi Max,

I've attached a photo of the container clearing through Greek Customs. Once I receive the bill of lading, I will send you the next pictures of the container as it is being loaded onto a transport truck. We hope to have the container at the shipper's warehouse within two weeks.

Best regards,
Rob

Body: Hi Max,

The container is finally at the shipper's warehouse in California. Unfortunately, there are still problems with it getting to the shipping agent in San Francisco. The forwarding agent tried to take it there but was told by the freight broker that it had already been invoiced to them. The forwarding agent has been advised to contact the broker directly to resolve this issue.

Best regards,
Rob"

Timestamp: 2024-02-01 09:15
Body: Good morning, Mr. Moser,

Our vessel from Dubai to Anvers has a limited discharging time and is likely to hit an arrival delay. Our client needs 7,000MT of flour by tomorrow. We would appreciate if you could assist us in arranging fast discharge on this charter from the nearest port.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Lydia

I have been very busy lately due to the recent cancellations on my vessel. You can expect our sail to the Port of Kiel for the next few days, and the vessel will be on standby at the scheduled ports. I will contact you when we arrive at Anvers.

Thanks for your understanding.

Best regards,
Manuel

Hello Saima,                    We’ve got a cargo of bitumen 7,200MT out of Sohar. The export cargo is from our account.. The loading schedule is on May 14th with a transit time of 10-14 days. Do you think you can still manage it with the latest rate card?                    Thanks,                    Sarfaraz.

Hi Sarfaraz,                     Thanks for your email. As per our agreement you need to submit your L/Cs by the 14th. I would highly recommend submitting them as early as possible and if we receive them by the 14th we would most likely issue the Bill of Lading for this cargo. If we do not receive L/Cs by the 14th, we will not be able to issue the Bill of Lading.                    Best,                    Mohammed.

Body: Dear Shelly,

It is much better to send 1,000MT of soybean oil from London to Sao Paulo. This way it is easier to handle. You can save 10,000 British pounds with this reduced volume.

Let me know if this is OK with you.

Best regards,
Erik

Thank you for the suggestion. Would you be able to reconsider the 2,000MT option? We really need to ship the full volume.

I apologize, but we cannot accommodate 2,000MT of soybean oil from London to Sao Paulo at this time. The 1,000MT option is our best offer.

The first offer stands - that would be the original quote minus the 10,000 GBP reduction for the smaller volume.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Morning Mr. Jones,                    Could you confirm whether your vessel can carry 6,500MT of steel from Tokyo to Cleveland? Also, I notice you've been quoted a $2,500 pilotage fee from Tsukaji to Tokyo. I notice this is below the usual charge of $2,750 but can I get a breakdown of the charges for Tsukaji so I can be sure?                    Thanks,                    Susan

Mr. Jones,
Thanks for your message. Unfortunately, I cannot carry 6,500MT. 
There's a bit more to it than the quote I gave you. The quota in Japan is just over 15,000MT and the port of Osaka holds the title of biggest port in the country. In fact, there are two other ports in the Kansai area (Hiroshima and Kobe) that are both bigger than Osaka. For our cargo to be loaded, it would have to be switched from Osaka and that would incur additional costs. Therefore, the whole quote you were given was subject to the eventual port of discharge being Osaka.

I'm sorry I cannot be of more help on the pilotage fee issue. I can only confirm that the pilotage fee has been quoted from Tsukaji as this is the port of call that's on the vessel's I.P. The

As I indicated before, the vessel cannot carry 6,500MT. Can I please also request a breakdown of the pilotage fees so I can fully understand the costs? I have contacted the port of Osaka regarding the ultimate port of discharge. Due to the current port congestion there, they do not hold any information that can determine when a berth will be available. I will ask them to confirm with the relevant operator and advise you immediately.
Kind regards,
Susan
Morning Susan,                          Could you please let me know what you have found out regarding your vessel's port of discharge and port congestion in Osaka. I'm just waiting to hear back from the operators but it seems that they've all been over-loaded with cargo so far this year. I would appreciate your comments ASAP.

Body: Dear Susan,

Thanks for your message. Unfortunately, I cannot carry 6,500MT. 

Regarding the ports, there's a bit more complexity to consider. While the quota in Japan is just over 15,000MT, and while Osaka is a major port, both Hiroshima and Kobe in the Kansai area are larger. For our cargo to be loaded, it would need to be routed through Osaka, which would incur additional costs. Therefore, the quote provided was contingent on Osaka being the port of discharge.

Regarding the pilotage fee issue, I can only confirm that the fee has been quoted from Tsukaji as this is the port of call on the vessel's itinerary.

Best regards,
Ian

 Good morning,                     The Lucie is a diesel ship so she has an operational capacity of around 5,000MT and I'm having trouble believing that 4,200MT of diesel could be raised for your ship.

Can you tell me if this service is available, or not, in the next 24 hours?                    Please call me at 555-555-1212.                    Thanks,                    Robert

Alaska fuel tax on ethanol
As a company that is committed to helping Alaska achieve energy independence by supporting the development and production of cleaner, lower-emission fuels, we need your support to maintain our rates for ethanol and fuel additives shipped to Alaska.
Currently, we’re only able to offer discounted ethanol and additive rates due to the fact that the Alaska fuel tax does not differentiate between ethanol and petroleum-based products. However, this is set to change if a new state law is passed, which will allow ethanol to be taxed at 60 percent of the full price.
As a result, we would need to adjust our current rates and pass through a corresponding tax to ensure compliance with the new law. We can also help reduce your costs by absorbing the tax until June 30, 2013, but if the current rate remains unchanged, your fuel costs will increase significantly.
While we understand that a new

Body: Dear Mr. Smith,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the pending tax ruling changes. I've attached the detailed documentation outlining the proposed changes to ethanol taxation in Alaska.

The key change is that ethanol will be taxed at 60% of the standard fuel tax rate, as opposed to the current structure where it's taxed equally with petroleum-based products. This change would take effect following the passage of the new state law.

Body: As a company committed to supporting Alaska's energy independence through cleaner, lower-emission fuels, we need to address the upcoming tax changes.

The current situation allows us to offer discounted ethanol rates as the tax structure doesn't differentiate between ethanol and petroleum-based products. However, with the pending legislation, ethanol will be taxed at 60% of the full rate.

We can absorb the tax impact until June 30, 2023, but after that, we'll need to adjust our rates to reflect the new tax structure.

Dear Mr. Lie,                    We need a 3,400MT shipment of adhesives from Rotterdam to Lübeck in early October. Can you advise your earliest loading date?                    Best,                    Jan

Hello Jan,                    Thank you for your email. Our first 3,400MT loading is on October 4th, but it is a very tight window as that is a Monday and is usually our slowest week of the month.                    If you want to expedite it, we can try to send it on October 2nd or 1st, but the latter option is on our limited summer sailing schedule and will have to sail on a larger vessel than usual. The 2nd option is on our regular schedule and will have to use a vessel that is full and may have less throughput for you. However, we can still confirm loading dates by October 7th, so you will know for sure what you are getting into.                    Please confirm your choice so we can provide an invoice.                    Best,                    Lie Best

Thank you for your email. Our first 3,400MT loading slot is available on October 4th, though this being a Monday makes it a challenging window due to typically reduced operations.

We can offer two alternative options:
1. October 1st - Using a larger vessel (subject to our limited summer schedule)
2. October 2nd - Regular schedule, but vessel will be operating at full capacity which may affect loading efficiency

We can confirm final loading dates by October 7th at the latest.

Please let me know which option you prefer so we can proceed with the invoice.

Great to hear from you. We are looking for suitable vacancies for June, July and August. There are quite a few ships available at that time of year.

Our customers frequently ask to be updated about a new order, as this often changes the equipment in the yard. The following sections are useful in order to achieve the goal of an informed client who is well prepared.

### After placing an order:

In order to obtain the equipment information, we first search our archives. To be able to search, the first three fields must be entered:

I need to charter a 60m dry bulk vessel in the summer. Do you have a candidate in your fleet? What are the available dates in June, July and August?

Body: Hi William,

Great to hear from you. I've checked our fleet availability for the summer months you mentioned. We have two suitable dry bulkers that might interest you:

- MV Armati (currently available)
- MV Semara (currently undergoing technical maintenance)

I can send you detailed specifications for both vessels and our complete fleet overview. The Armati is fully operational, though we're still resolving some technical issues with the Semara.

Would you like me to forward the detailed information for both vessels?

Best regards,
Amanda

It would be great if you can send me a free quote for your product this time, and hopefully I can close the deal with this shipment.                    Thank you,                    Pedro

Thank you for your prompt response. I have reviewed your proposal, and I appreciate your detailed quote.

Regarding the vessel size, you mentioned 20,000DWT for the first shipment. Would it be possible to arrange larger vessels for the second and third shipments? Also, given that our fleet consists of six 10,000DWT vessels, could we discuss a potential multi-user discount?

I look forward to closing this deal.

Regarding your first query, if you have two destinations and only want to travel once per cargo item and your freight exceeds 3,000kg, there will be a minimum charge of $5,000 to open up your freight as Standard Charters freight (see the link below for full information).                   Regarding your second query, the Standard Charters will be 40 days turnaround per trip and for the return leg from airport to airport we will allow up to 5 days turnaround.

Regarding your first query, for freight exceeding 3,000kg with two destinations on a single cargo journey, there will be a minimum charge of $5,000 to process as Standard Charters freight.

For your second query, Standard Charters operates on a 40-day turnaround per trip, with up to 5 days allowance for the return leg from airport to airport. Your suggested 3-4 days should be sufficient for cargo collection, unless you prefer to wait and consolidate shipments.

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the bitumen shipment. Being from Rotterdam myself, I'm quite familiar with the route.

I can offer a freight rate of 8 million euros for the complete transportation. While I'd like to offer a preferential rate, I'm afraid I can only do so if the freight is prepaid by your side.

Let me know if this works for you.

After reviewing your concerns, I can confirm that market liquidity is not a significant threat to the furniture shipment. This was just one of several operational delays we've encountered. We are compiling a comprehensive list of issues and solutions, which will be included in our presentation in two weeks.

Thank you for your assistance with unloading the furniture. I've informed the team about the situation.

Mark,                    How about 3,300 MT of gelato from Naples to Melbourne? Should we start as a cargo hold, or can we split that 3 MT between the reefer plug and cargo hold?                    Best,                    Daniel

Excellent work today, guys. As I understand it, you've pre-bought 3,000 MT of gelato from Naples for the flight to Melbourne.                       We are going to have it arrive in Australia in time for the festival. We have until October, so we have plenty of time.                    Now, if you ask me, it would be much better if the gelato arrived as a part of a shipment of napolitan foodstuffs from Naples, or a plane with a load of gelato from Naples arriving in Australia. But whatever works, Daniel.                    I would also like to order more gelato from Naples for our festivals in the future, as demand seems to have picked up since we started this thing. And before you ask, yes, there is a limit on gelato purchases from Naples. After all, the flood of gelato was somewhat unexpected.                    Unfortunately,

Perhaps one day a three-car train will bring a smaller batch of gelato to Australia, but not today.

One final thing to consider: Many people in Australia like ice cream and do not like gelato. How much of the gelato are we going to send to Australia, and how much of the gelato are we going to send to Australia?

Body: Excellent work today. I understand we've secured 3,000 MT of gelato from Naples for transport to Melbourne.

We need to ensure delivery before the October festival, so timing isn't critical yet. I suggest we consider incorporating this into a larger shipment of Neapolitan foodstuffs to optimize logistics.

Given the increasing demand, we should explore additional gelato orders from Naples for future festivals, though we need to be mindful of the supplier's production limits.

Thank you for your inquiry. We've reviewed the request but would prefer to handle a smaller cargo size. Would you consider reducing the quantity to 9,900MT? This would allow us to offer more competitive rates.

Sorry I'm late to get back to you. My boss had some personal issues and so I had to cancel my travel to Canada for a couple of weeks.

I'm going to divide the code into two parts. First, we are going to code the contents of the letters. We can copy the content of each letter and then assign it to a variable in the code. This way, we can send the same code to each of the receivers. Here is the code:

```python
letter_1 = """"""Dear Mr. Hassan,
I'm writing to you about a possible load of 5,000MT of diesel from Fujairah to Karachi. Can you let me know what your freight rate is?

```python
letter_3 = """"""Dear Sir,
I'm looking to arrange an opening of an account with your company, because I think we can work together in the future. Can you send me the details?

Thanks,

```

I will now declare all the variables.

```python
letter_1 = """"""Dear Mr. Hassan,
I'm writing to you about a possible load of 5,000MT of diesel from Fujairah to Karachi. Can you let me know what your freight rate is?

Next, we are going to send the letters to the different addresses. You can send any email to the receiver with a variation of the email. Let's add all the addresses in a list:

```python
addresses = ['recep@company.com', 'address2@email.com', 'address3@company.com']
```

I can make sure you get the correct documentation and arrange for the import.                    In either case, let me know if you have any questions. Have a great day.                    Maria

Dear Ms. Wood,
First off I would like to say I appreciate the prompt response in regard to my last email. I see you have some inventory available, but they do not meet my shipment's needs. If I were to contact you about something different would it be a problem? That being said I am a consultant in the logistics industry and my services are always free of charge and as per the contract there is no obligation to you to purchase through my companies.  There are many people out there looking to cut costs in logistics and I can get them better rates than you can. 
That being said I have contacted a gentleman in New York that could get me the varnishes to Louisiana if needed. Now for my question. I'd like to give you a call sometime next week to review my rates so you know how I can assist you with your shipments. I really want to help,
Email 4:
Hi Maria,
Thanks for the call and the offer to help. It is always a good idea to learn from the competition and see if there are ways to improve. Here's the problem though, with someone giving a 'free quote' on a project there is no commitment to us, which means they have to do whatever they have to do to get that deal. I'm sure they're better than Hotwire, but they will lose you and then we have to deal with you again. That's why I'm so hesitant to send quotes to people I don't know.
I do hope we'll keep in touch and maybe, sometime, we'll see if I can't help you on a project.

We have 300MT of varnishes to ship from the port of St. Louis to New Orleans, and I'm looking for your spot rate. Could you also confirm if you'll be handling the documentation?

Thank you,

Body: Dear Maria,

I apologize, but we don't currently handle varnish shipments to the New Orleans area. If you have other products not restricted in our system, I'd be happy to assist with rates and documentation.

Please let me know if you have any other shipping needs I can help with.

Best regards,
Sarah Wood

Body: Dear Ms. Wood,

Thank you for your prompt response. I understand about the varnish shipment. As a logistics consultant, I'd actually like to discuss how I might help you with better rates for your shipments. My services are free of charge with no obligation. I've found I can often secure better rates than current market prices.

Would you be open to a call next week to discuss potential collaboration?

Best regards,
Maria

Body: Hi Maria,

Thank you for the call and your offer to help. While I appreciate the opportunity to learn from market competitors, I have concerns about working with free quote services. Without firm commitments, it's difficult to ensure consistent service quality for our clients.

Let's stay in touch, and perhaps we can explore specific projects in the future where our interests align.

Best regards,
Sarah

I understand your position regarding my offer. While I'm disappointed we couldn't work together, I remain open to discussing ways to optimize shipping costs. Perhaps it would be best to be direct about such opportunities in the future to avoid any misunderstandings.

Laycan for this fleet must be on or after July 1st. For the latest fleet, we're currently looking at July 15th as being the optimal laycan date, as subsequent freight options are limited.

Hey Rashid,                    Let me know your feedback on my suggestion regarding the technical route.                    Thanks,                    Rashid
 This is pretty straightforward, let me start by describing the benefits to my company
                   By way of technical route, it will be possible to increase profits by up to 200m USD
                   The new route will be built for 1.2b USD, this is just an estimate I got from a professional engineer. 
                   By buying some equipment of equivalent quality, we can save up to 200m USD
                   A small part of this money can be saved by buying cheaper cement
                   In my opinion, the highest potential for savings is in buying high-quality cement with 3% sulfur, as in Azerbaijan.
                   It is worth pointing out that the technical route is built from scratch, but the existing route was built by the Soviet Union, so it may","From: rashid.ahmad@energytrade.com

I'm concerned about your friend's suggestion from the Ministry. Such a plan seems questionable, and I suspect his motivation is purely profit-driven regarding the technical route. We should proceed with the original contract signing first. I can discuss any alternative proposals with him afterward.

Body: Dear Mr. Moutran,

Regarding the technical route proposal, here are the key benefits:
- Potential profit increase of up to 200M USD
- Estimated construction cost of 1.2B USD (based on professional engineering assessment)
- Possible 200M USD savings through equipment procurement
- Additional savings through strategic cement sourcing (specifically high-quality cement with 3% sulfur from Azerbaijan)

Please note that while this would be a new construction, compared to the existing Soviet-era infrastructure, it offers significant advantages.

Hello Mr. Moynihan,                    I was wondering if you had the capacity to move 8,000MT of base oil from Rotterdam to Singapore? We have a laycan of April 5th and are looking to make this commitment.                    Thank you,                    Wendi

The laycan is April 5th.            We had to change the place of trade for the tanki, so it is now Europe > Asia.              I have attached my latest tanki. It has all the instructions and details in it. I will email you a pdf copy of the contract.            The contract expires on March 31st at 3pm Singapore time. If you are interested, I would like to negotiate an extension with you. The expiry date is not a hard deadline and it will take time for all parties to receive everything they need from one another, so extending the deadline will hopefully make things easier on all parties.

Wendi, what do you mean by ""Europe > Asia""? I already knew that your contract was to change, since I received your email #1. I would need to see this new contract before I can be confident with our understanding of the deal. I am not willing to move the base oil without seeing this new contract, which is fine. However, I do not understand what you mean by ""Europe > Asia"". We are in two different continents, and therefore moving the base oil between Europe and Asia is really impossible to execute. For example, from where in Europe would you like us to load the base oil in? Could we instead export the base oil to either the US or Canada, and then import it to Singapore? Also, the laycan of April 5th is a very tight timeline, and we are unable to make this commitment without seeing your new

I hope this email finds you well. I am following up regarding the 8,000MT of base oil shipment from Rotterdam to Singapore. The laycan remains April 5th.

We have updated the trading route to Europe > Asia. I have attached the latest tank instructions and will forward you a PDF copy of the contract shortly.

Please note that the current contract expires on March 31st at 3pm Singapore time. I would like to discuss the possibility of extending this deadline to allow all parties sufficient time to complete the necessary documentation.

Thank you for your emails. I need to review the new contract before proceeding further. The April 5th laycan is quite tight given the current timeline.

Regarding the Europe > Asia route, I need to understand your specific requirements. Would you consider routing through North America as an alternative? We could arrange shipment via either US or Canadian ports if that would be more feasible.

Please send the new contract for review as soon as possible.

Hello Frank,                    Can you please reply ASAP?
I would like to know if you will send polypropylene or any other

Body: Hello James,

This shipment was canceled yesterday. However, I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion about facilitating last-minute product movements for other customers. I can guarantee placement of their products for a small commission percentage. Please let me know if this arrangement interests you.

I'll be on vacation until the end of the month, so please respond at your earliest convenience as I need to resolve this before my departure.

Sincerely,

Hello Cap'n Ju,
We have  10,000 MT of iron ore from Sydney to Shanghai and were wondering if you have any available containers with packing and ready to load in the early February. We are interested to load on the 5th February at least.
Regards,
Rui

This is one of the common subject matters with our customers. They are not able to decide when and where to load and our role is to help them in making a decision. Here is a flowchart of our advice process.","From: rui.zhang@haitian-steel.com

- Longwinded introductory paragraph
- Little information about what they are asking
- Is the ship going to pick them up or do they have to go to a terminal

 Hi David,                      Thank you for your kind response.  We now understand there will be a reduction in capacity at Yangon in early October, and we can definitely accommodate your vessels.  However, we are having trouble finding accurate draft information, and we'd like to make sure we're getting our quotes to our customers as soon as possible.                    I'm assuming there will be no difference in draft requirements for our other vessels, and I'm also assuming the draft is the same for all ships.                    Could you please let me know the information I need to provide to my customers in order to get accurate quotes?                    Thanks,                Mandy
Email 4:
Hi Mandy,                      The exact minimum draft will be determined by when each vessel comes into Yangon, as we have a range of charterers and we can't possibly ask for 24 separate quotes. We will try our best to give you quotes, but the degree of variation is dependent on what we are able to procure on the spot.                    It's currently being confirmed that we will not be able to access the shallow draft ports, so that would be off the table for your vessels.  Once we've confirmed what we can provide, we'll get back to you.  Please don't hesitate to contact me directly with any questions.                    Best regards,                David

Thank you for your quote on the 22,500MT shipment of P20 alloy steel from Wuhan to the UK.

I need some clarification on a few details:
1. Will delivery include transport to our warehouse in England, or is it port delivery only?
2. Could you please specify our laycan dates?
3. Does the quoted price include insurance, container handling, and stowage fees?

Once these points are clarified, we can proceed with the necessary documentation and sign the Letter of Intent (LOI) this week.

The vessel will arrive at the UK port within 40 days from departure. We can arrange full cargo insurance for approximately US$5,000. I will forward the detailed insurance policy documentation prior to shipment.

Delivery terms are to port only - any inland transportation would need to be arranged separately. Container handling and stowage fees are included in the original quote.

A bale with a gross weight of 70,000 kg is currently awaiting delivery at pier 7 in the port of Genoa. This commodity was imported aboard your vessel 'JCM SCANDALING', under bill of lading #59751.

The freight forwarder has requested payment prior to cargo release. Additionally, there appears to be a discrepancy in the calculation of port and sea days, resulting in an underpayment of off-hire time.

We kindly request your immediate attention to:
1. Address the freight forwarder's payment request
2. Review and settle the off-hire time calculation

Please respond at your earliest convenience to avoid any further delays.

I just wanted to follow up my inquiry regarding the 5,000MT of potassium ferrate from Skaw to Plymouth. Since we will be looking to schedule the ship for late July, I wanted to make sure that it is possible to sail the 37,000DWT ship to Plymouth if the conditions are suitable.

We would be looking for top quality product and any insight on potential suppliers would be most helpful.

Thanks Charles,         I'm getting back to you as soon as I can.                  The Weather in the NE is terrible right now and will be for a while. All the Metro stations in the NE are shutdown due to the adverse weather. Not only has the weather impacted my ability to access my e-mail but it also adversely affected my laycan estimates.                   Many of the hubs have changed their flight schedules to allow for extra time and I will have to update those same laycan estimates as well as many of our other hubs. I will send you a brief report of those adjustments soon. However, in the meantime, I just wanted to let you know that the extra time needed to get these estimates to you by today is due to the weather situation.

Body: Hi Mateo,

Are you still planning a 10,000MT shipment of crude from Syria to Tanger to load 24th December? I've got a berth on P3 SCS at Tilbury but the laycan on the vessel is 24th January. I'd be happy to offer an expedited rate to make sure this is ready on time.

Cheers,

Sample Bill of Lading:
Regarding Loading Term, please find below. For consignee's main port, Fos please.
Please also note that due to the current market conditions, we would require a clearance of containers as soon as they arrive in the US port, so Fos port will need to be cleared and bond will need to be opened for 2 days. For Bond Opening Cost it's $600-$650 / TEU and other pre-delivery costs are mentioned below.
For more details, please see below.

Body: Dear Sacha,

Regarding Loading Terms, the consignee's main port will be Fos. Please note that due to current market conditions, we require container clearance immediately upon arrival at the US port. The Fos port will need to be cleared and bond will need to be opened for 2 days. Bond Opening Cost is $600-$650/TEU, with additional pre-delivery costs as previously mentioned.

Hello Mr. Thomas,                    It appears that you will need to operate one of your LPG tanks on the 12th of April, is that correct?                    Let us know if you have questions.                    Thank you for your help.                    Regards,                    Eric

Hi Eric,                      How are you doing?                     I have a tank size of 800 gal LPG and the original filler hose is 1.25″.                     Can you supply a larger one to connect to our tanks?                     Thank you.                     Sincerely,                     Giovanni

Hello Giovanni,                     1.25″ will probably work just fine.                     800 gal is small though, since that is about the size of the tanks that are designed to service residential or small home business establishments.                     I would be willing to give you a quote for 1.25″ and a second one. I would have to measure it though to determine the exact size.

Body: Hello Mr. Santiago,

Your demurrage invoice for 8,000MT of sugar from Santos to Libreville has been calculated based on the following factors:

Bulk Carbon Rate: $0.14/Metric Ton
DP Charge: $4,700
Demurrage: $3,100
Total Due: $8,014.80

For your consideration, an alternative scenario of 8,000MT at $0.12/Metric Ton would result in:

Bulk Carbon Rate: $0.14/Metric Ton
DP Charge: $4,700
Demurrage: $0.75/Metric Ton
Total Due: $8,014.80

Recommendation: Please consider using a 9,000MT bill of lading for optimal pricing.

Dear Eva,
Your clients ask me to inform you that there is no spot cargoes going to Las Palmas, but if the 7,100MT is enough, it's not too bad. The 7,100MT is what our client need as it's the minimum load size for their buyer.                       The next issue we have is the routing, the kerosene cargo coming from Rotterdam to Las Palmas should have changed its routing to Tangier to cover a higher proportion of distance and fuel saving. The amendment is not allowed, and it's not a good thing.                       We have got a ship who can load cargoes for you in two weeks, if we make it, will you be able to get the cargo and load it in the time frame?

You have a new job! Well, not really – but you will write several emails in a short time to say “hello” to the new company you’ve been offered.                    The question is: Are you interested in the job? Of course, you’re not going to say “no”, but what tone and language will you use? Can you see any difference between these two emails?                    Are these just plain English? If so, the person reading your email will ask him/herself, “so what’s going to make this job different from all the other jobs you’ve had?”                    Or, do you want to sound more professional? Think of someone else at the company you admire and ask, “how would this person sound?”. You want to be taken seriously, so why not use this role model to guide your language and style.                    First – address the person correctly
Email 2:
1. Dear Mr. Goldie.
2. Dear Mr. Ron Goldie.
3. Dear Sir,

The last one is bad. Even if you don’t know the title of the person you’re writing to, you should find out. It is just poor manners to call someone “Sir” when you know his/her title is “Mrs.”. Of course, you can only find out his/her title if you have been given that information by the human resources department – so how would you know to address him/her that way? (The answer is – you won’t. But if the company does not give you that information, call the person “Sir”).

Second – when should you write an email?
The choice of email or letter will depend on the nature of the situation and your relationship with the person you are addressing. There are some circumstances where the choice of email and letter is similar
Email 3:
Some emails are going to be shorter than a letter. If you are writing about a job offer you probably will use an email, rather than a letter. If you send a letter instead of an email, it might take several weeks for the employer to respond and you might not hear back from them at all.

<Email 4>:
Or perhaps you are simply giving the other person an apology. If it is a formal apology that will be sent to a formal address – to an official with a title, you will probably use a letter.

Third – address the subject matter.
Are you describing your qualifications for the job? Are you apologizing for being late for an interview or for the need to reschedule an interview?

It is better to be specific and complete.

Fourth – what tone of language should you use?
A formal email will be written in a professional tone, expressing confidence and taking responsibility

<Email 4>:
 Another factor to consider is the formal or informal language you choose to use. Would a form letter (or would the form letter say a form letter) send the right message?

Fifth – making the connection.
Just as you should have a similar style of introduction for a letter, an email should open with a similar introduction and an invitation to read your email through to the end. Here’s an example of a less than ideal opening email:

Dear Mr. Goldie,
I would like to inform you that a final decision has been made about the hiring process and I need to come to London to continue the recruitment process on the 12th of November. I will be leaving Paris on the 11th at 1 pm. I will be going by train and I will reach Paris Nord at 6.30.

Body: Dear Candidate,

As you prepare to apply for positions within our company, we wanted to provide some important guidelines about professional communication.

When writing your application emails, consider your tone carefully. While you want to show enthusiasm, maintaining professionalism is crucial. Consider how someone you admire in the industry would communicate, and use that as a model for your own correspondence.

When addressing your application emails, please use the following format:

Could you purchase 100,000 gallons of naphtha from Houston to New Orleans for urgent delivery at mid-month? Would you mind adding a quote for reefer shipping from Hamburg to Brisbane for early next week?

That's all!

Best regards,
Randall

I hope you're doing well. Can you send me your newest price sheet for fertilizer so that I can put it in our cost accounting system?

By the way, if you're going to be in San Francisco in about a month, please let me know so I can show you around.

Thanks!

This email contains a Java applet for making a short clip of any size from a video file. At the beginning of the clip a button labeled 'Start' appears, and once the user clicks on this button, the clip begins to play. During the clip, the button will change to 'Pause' if the user pauses the clip, and then change back to 'Start' to start the clip again. It is also possible to advance the clip by clicking on the little slider on the right. The clip must be no longer than 10 seconds, but the user can resize the video in any way he likes. The applet works in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer.

Japan is a very good market for trading. I’m sure that
the demand from the Japanese market will continue to be
high for bitumen. However, I can understand that

Dear Mr. Daniel,

I have just sent an email to Mr. John. He told me that his country's customs is asking for a $1 million bond for each
shipment. We have confirmed that such a condition is in fact
common in most of our clients countries and Mr. John has been
told to get the papers that will clear up any potential problem
with customs.                    Please inform me what you will do.                    Thank you.                    Jack Burns

Good day sir,                     I have received the emails you sent to John and he has just informed me that he will not give in

The area is the center of the recently emerged ""dry bulk finance bubble"" centered in Singapore. It is clear that large volumes of capital are coming from banks and investment firms into the dry bulk shipping market. The real question is whether any of this additional volume of shipping loans will improve returns to the shipping sector and make a difference in financing this sector as a whole. If you would like to know more about the potential pitfalls and opportunities surrounding dry bulk finance, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

The dry bulk finance market is booming, with many shipping companies taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and increased demand for commodities. The biggest issue in this market is that the interest rates are so low, that they can actually hurt the shipping companies' profit margins. This is because the low interest rates mean that the companies can borrow money at lower rates, but they are also unable to earn as much in interest. This means that the companies are able to pay off their loans more quickly, but they don't earn as much in profits as they would if they had to pay more interest. The other issue is that the demand for commodities is decreasing, which means that the companies are having to carry more unsold ships, which costs them money. The best way to make a profit in this market is to find a way to cut costs and make your shipping company more efficient.

Following up on Vladimir's email, I wanted to provide more context about the Singapore-centered dry bulk finance market. We're seeing significant capital inflow from banks and investment firms into this sector.

The key question is whether this increased volume of shipping loans will enhance returns and meaningfully impact sector financing. I'd be happy to discuss both the potential pitfalls and opportunities in more detail.

When a client sends a booking enquiry and provides their contact details, you need to make sure that their emails are not overlooked. Most airlines are unlikely to know the names of the emails they should respond to, especially if they don’t always hear from the same clients.
Even if the client does not provide a specific email address, there are ways you can ensure you respond to them, such as using the carrier’s booking system or common practice (perhaps at least, provide a standard response that contains your shipping details, even if the client does not provide them) without resorting to bcc (blind copy to

What’s your standard coverage, and would I be able to extend it beyond that if I needed to?                            Also, is there a rate I need to know in advance so that I can inform the shippers what they will be paying?                            Lastly, how long would it take for the shipment to reach the port of Lisbon?                            Thank you!                            John
Hello John,
    - Hi! So, we’ve had a chat. For Portugal, standard insurance is $1.50 per kg. We can go as high as $2.50 per kg for $1500 shipping, which covers $3 per pallet.                            Also, for Portugal we do a pickup in Dallas or Houston, which we would need to know as soon as possible. For insurance

Hi Mr. Vargas,
         I just finished loading my shipment to ship to Portugal this morning, with another 25 40’ containers coming next week. Would you be able to give me an accurate estimation of when you can get it out to Lisbon?             I can’t wait to get these shoes in there! I want to get them to market ASAP.

Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately, we are experiencing severe capacity constraints at the moment. While we could potentially handle around 1,000MT, we have no vessels or containers available for the Fujairah-Rio route until early next year.

Thank you for your prompt response. I understand the limitations regarding shipping capacity. Given that we have 1,000MT ready for immediate shipment, would it be possible to explore alternative routes or transshipment options that might help us meet our September timeline? If not, we may need to seek other shipping partners for this urgent cargo.
