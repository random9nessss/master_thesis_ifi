Due to the complexity of bulk rates, both simple and indexed escalation clauses are commonly used in the sea cargo market. Bulk rates are based on bunker price and tonnage. Escalation clauses are used to implement the benefits of a bunker cost increase and prevent the carrier from changing the contract rate and extending it through an escalation clause. Generally, escalation clauses are used when a contract purchaser is concerned about the impact of a bunker price increase. Should the bunker price increase, bulk rates and contracts are usually adjusted accordingly. A bunker escalation clause allows the parties to index their contracts on a timely basis rather than having to wait until a contract is being renewed or terminated. In addition, an escalation clause in a contract increases the incentive for the parties to achieve cost savings by allowing the buyer to negotiate an adjustment when the seller is benefiting from a rise in the cost.\n\nBest regards,\nShipping Team"}],"labels":{"broker":"","commodity":"clinker","load_port":"Sohar","discharge_port":"Mombasa","cargo_size":"8400 MT","incoterm":"","vessel":"","dwt":"","loa":"","starting_freight_quote_currency":"","starting_freight_quote":"","final_freight_quote_currency":"","final_freight_quote":"","laytime_start_date":"","laytime_end_date":"","demurrage_currency":"","demurrage":""}},{"email_chain":[{"from":"alex@example.com","to":"kang@portklang.com","subject":"Inquiry on Elastomers Shipment","timestamp":"2023-10-01 09:00","body":"Hello Mr. Kang,\n\nI\u2019m checking your list of customers.

As I understand it, you've pre-bought 3,000 MT of gelato from Naples for the flight to Melbourne. We are going to have it arrive in Australia in time for the festival. We have until October, so we have plenty of time. Now, if you ask me, it would be much better if the gelato arrived as part of a shipment of Neapolitan foodstuffs from Naples, or a plane with a load of gelato from Naples arriving in Australia. But whatever works, Daniel. I would also like to order more gelato from Naples for our festivals in the future, as demand seems to have picked up since we started this thing.

However, the low interest rates can also negatively impact profit margins, as companies earn less on their investments.

To succeed in this market, it is crucial to focus on cost-cutting measures and improving operational efficiency.\n\nBest regards,\nVladimir"}],"labels":{"broker":"","commodity":"","load_port":"","discharge_port":"","cargo_size":"","incoterm":"","vessel":"","dwt":"","loa":"","starting_freight_quote_currency":"","starting_freight_quote":"","final_freight_quote_currency":"","final_freight_quote":"","laytime_start_date":"","laytime_end_date":"","demurrage_currency":"","demurrage":""}},{"email_chain":[{"from":"irina@example.com","to":"john@example.com","subject":"Request for Shipping Estimate","timestamp":"2023-10-01 09:00","body":"Hi John,\n\nWe have a request from a customer to ship 10,000MT of diesel from Port Klang to the Port of Vanikoro.\n\nCould you please give us an estimate for voyage time, bunker cost, and insurance rate?\n\nBest regards,\nIrina"},{"from":"irina@example.com","to":"john@example.com","subject":"Follow-Up on Shipping Estimate Request","timestamp":"2023-10-02 10:00","body":"Hi John,\n\nJust following up on my previous email regarding the request to ship 10,000MT of diesel from Port Klang to the Port of Vanikoro.\n\nCould you please provide an estimate for voyage time, bunker cost, and insurance rate at your earliest convenience?\n\nBest regards,\nIrina"},{"from":"irina@example.com","to":"john@example.com","subject":"Reminder: Shipping Estimate Request","timestamp":"2023-10-03 11:00","body":"Hi John,\n\nI hope this message finds you well.
