I have a few things to clear up so I can post this on your thread.\n\nFirst, I want to state that this is not my machine but an attached mobile crane. I will try to email you pics. It is definitely a 40\u2032 truck crane 2WD, it has a liquid pressure test kit in the front and a \u201cSmokin Box\u201d on the side with a winch. It is fully self-contained with 40,000 gallons of diesel.\n\nIf you want, you can see pictures at this website: http://www.bradcoengineering.com\n\nThis is an Arizana 18m Truck Crane 2WD with a swivel winch in front that holds up to 1000kg (2200lbs).\n\nThanks,\nJanowski"

Find another mode of transport for the remaining 1,200 MT of aviation fuel, which the customer won't take back. You can make a lot of money with this volume, because this aviation fuel is due to be consumed on the day you will receive it in Amsterdam. The customer does not want to transport the 1,200 MT to Belgium, so the least you can do is to sell this additional aviation fuel on a spot basis and make sure that the credit risk of this contract is managed well.\n2. Sell your FOB Hamburg cargo to the customer for a lump sum, to make sure that you receive all you deserve.\n\nRemember to use the additional document we discussed in the previous message to cover all the risks.\n\nRegards,\nMrs. Smythe"

This could be via our 29,000 DWT Suezmax ship (slated for lifting) and chartering a 50,000 DWT VLCC, or by chartering a 50,000 DWT Suezmax (travelling round via the Suez Canal) or a 60,000 DWT VLCC. This would give you 6-7 weeks' notice for loading in Zhoushan. The total cost would be in the ballpark of US$8.5 million (about $0.10/bbl and $0.08/bbl for loading and charters)."

If your customer made 2,000 purchases over a period of 20 years, then you can assume that he used your tools for at least 20 years (that is, 20 years ago)."

I plan to do this by offering the plugin as a monthly subscription. The subscription will be priced at $100 per month. In other words, you will need to pay $100 per month to use the plugin.\n\nThis is one of the ways that I plan to monetize the plugin. The other way is by selling the plugin as a paid one-time purchase. I will be discussing this more in the next few days."

It seems there are some potential risks, including weather impact and Suez Canal bottlenecks that will affect transportation. As such, the earliest available vessel for loading the cargo is not for another 14 days. However, you can still ship this cargo by the fastest available vessel for an additional premium of 7% if you are prepared to pay for the cost difference and the fees associated with carrying the risk of uncertainty. The sea freight cost is typically cheaper because the additional cost will only be incurred in the unlikely event of an inevitable delay or cancellation. I am attaching some indicative transport cost estimates for your review. These calculations are based on the available information, including port dues, and thus these figures may be subject to change depending on the final contract details.\n\nKind regards,\nSimon"

Our client's cruise began early in the morning, and at the start of the first afternoon, the cruise stopped for an hour, where the client's lunch would have been normally taken.\n\nFollowing this, our client informed the cruise company that she would not be able to attend any additional activities during the second part of the cruise, due to her trip abroad the next morning.\n\nUnfortunately, after the cruise stopped, the client left to change her outfit for dinner. It is clear to me that her actions were not entirely justified. However, what can I do as the representative of our client?\n\nI feel that the cruise company must compensate the client for the disappointment of\n\nBest regards,\nMargarita Madison"

How much would the demurrage be based on if I ship automobile gas at a weight of 3,000MT?\n3. How much would the demurrage be based on if I ship automobile gas at a weight of 6,000MT?\n4. How much would the demurrage be based on if I ship automobile gas at a weight of 15,000MT?\n5. How much would the demurrage be based on if I ship automobile gas at a weight of 24,000MT?\n6.

I received a very similar email earlier this morning, but the case was very straightforward as the seller had advised that the vessel was to be cleared on the 21st of August and demurrage to commence from the 22nd. I was able to quickly email back the response based on your case for a 45-day laytime to commence on the 22nd.\n\nHowever, with regards to your case where you are buying a small quantity (3,000MT), I do not believe the seller should be paying the terminal demurrage as this is considered a short-term booking and this is covered under the charterer's guarantee as per the charter party. The charterer will want to ensure that the ship is not stuck in port for any longer than necessary for whatever reason and therefore, will want to arrange accordingly.\n\nBest regards,\nMr. Turner"

When I was a young boy, my father would regularly take me to the harbour where we would buy a shiny new fishing boat. I can still remember vividly how excited we were about the boat. I even drew my own boat on the beach before we took it for a spin. I'm sure you can imagine how sad I was when my father came back, covered in blood! The poor boy (in my boat) couldn't swim! My father managed to catch the boy and somehow held onto the rope to the boat until the boy calmed down enough to reach for the rope. We are both thankful that the boat didn't sink. I tell you this story because I feel I have had a similar experience with this project. At first, I had grand plans, and a shiny new approach.\n\nBest regards,\nMr. Koyama"

I have shipped a container of cricket equipment from Brisbane and I need to know whether you can pick it up from the port. I\u2019ll need you to help me out with the clearance as well.

I\u2019ve also made arrangements to pick up my container from the port. The agent has told me that I must clear the equipment in a few days, otherwise the container may be sold. He also said that it\u2019s a good thing to have the cricket equipment cleared by a local customs agent. I will be flying to Quetta in 10 days and will be arriving at the port to pick up the container. The agent has told me that a truck will be provided to take the container to my address. I do have some questions.\n\n1. How do you pay for the clearance?\n2. Will the trucking company charge us a fee?\n3. What if the container is full?

Once you\u2019re in Quetta, the agent will pay for the fees and keep the receipt for their records. When you go to get your cricket equipment, you\u2019ll pay the agent back and keep their receipt.\n\n2. Will the trucking company charge us a fee? As for fees, you should ask the agent to send a quote to you. Once you confirm the cost, you should pay the agent and they should file the paperwork. I suggest you ask for a copy of the quote for your records.\n\n3. What if the container is full? I need to send all my cricket equipment but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to fit it. If the container is full, you may need to consider additional shipping arrangements or storage solutions.\n\nRegards,\nAndrea"

Also, the driver might not always stay at the delivery address for the entire pickup time (check with the agent when you're sending the packages). - DHL is more expensive for sea freight packages than air freight packages.

However, I think that you can get the best rate without the extra day.\n\nAlso note that we always appreciate your cooperation in the necessary load procedure for loading VLCC cargoes on board. We have received several vessels from Busan with less than 100% ballast. We really have to reduce ballast with our last vessel to make sure to have sufficient load margins for the remaining cargo. That's our only excuse to load not the minimum ballast for our chemical vessel.\n\nPlease be advised that if you have a cargo which will arrive close to expiry and consequently has to be held\n\nBest regards,\nFelix"

The ocean freight could be spread over 16 weeks, so I would expect to see your cargo 16 weeks from now, if I do not get an early payment for the freight. However, the standard practice here is to allow the buyer to get a spot rate, which, I have noted, is 28% higher than our price. The seller is hoping to make the spot rate but does not have the luxury of counting on it. The buyer might not find a spot rate or might not be able to pay for it.

When moving 12,500MT in a single shipment, several factors come into play:\n\n1. Maximum weight capacity of the vessel, which varies by vessel type (tanker, bulk carrier, etc.)\n2. The type of material and its density.\n3. The available space and how it is utilized, which can range from one to five stacks depending on the vessel design.\n\nEssentially, for every ton of material, a specific amount of empty space is required, determined by the vessel's design and type. However, it is not guaranteed that all available space will be filled.\n\nBest regards,\nPatrick"

If you are still looking for a new ship for your cargo, we have a ship open on 30 June for a 5,000MT move from Lon to New.\n\nWe also have a ship open on 7 July for a 6,000MT move from Lon to New. Your message indicated a 15,000MT load would be best, however, the vessel we have open does not have space for that move.\n\nLet me know if the 6,000MT move on 30 June will work for you.\n\nRegards,\nWade"

For Thursday and Friday, we will use WL5. WL7 is booked for Friday to Mon. For Monday and Tuesday, we will use WL5 and WL6. WL6 will be used for Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nThis should keep the two lanes open 100% of the time. Sorry for the inconvenience, but it\u2019s our best solution to keep both lanes open.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\nLucia"

The quota in Japan is just over 15,000MT and the port of Osaka holds the title of biggest port in the country. In fact, there are two other ports in the Kansai area (Hiroshima and Kobe) that are both bigger than Osaka. For our cargo to be loaded, it would have to be switched from Osaka and that would incur additional costs. Therefore, the whole quote you were given was subject to the eventual port of discharge being Osaka.\n\nI'm sorry I cannot be of more help on the pilotage fee issue. I can only confirm that the pilotage fee has been quoted from Tsukaji as this is the port of call that's on the vessel's itinerary.\n\nBest regards,\nJones"

Due to the current port congestion there, they do not hold any information that can determine when a berth will be available.

Do you have anything you can put together for them in an upcoming article?\nWe also discussed moving forward with the new supply/demand report. We want to look at the 2012 report first. This may involve getting some more data. However, after we review this, we will most likely look into continuing with the Latin America report.\nPlease let me know if you have any other suggestions or questions.\nLooking forward to the next conversation.\nBest regards,\nEric"

Here is a sample of the promotion that can be added to an email or web banner. This sample promotion applies to east coast shippers only, but it is up to you what direction you want to promote.\n\nSorry, you cannot apply this special rate to shipments within North America. Special ocean promotions for service to the U.S. East Coast.\n\nIn the United States, what you consider the east coast is a very large area. It includes New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, Wilmington, Richmond, Norfolk, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Miami, New Orleans, Houston, Galveston, Mobile, and New York City. Special ocean promotions for service to the U.S. West Coast.\n\nIt is great to hear that you are including different areas in your marketing. We also have promotion available to several ports on the west coast including the following ports: Los Angeles, Long Beach, Tacoma, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Oakland, Richmond, and Wilmington. We also have ports in the Gulf of Mexico that you may want to consider adding such as: Mobile, Gulfport, New Orleans, and Houston.\n\nI will add the link below so you can see all of our locations.\nhttp://www.silverferries.com/lotes"

Kolhe is very willing to cut a deal in which you will get the tubes for $100 per kit if you place the order now, and will pay $1 million for an additional 500,000 kits when you are ready to place the final order. You will also need to commit to providing us with ten million more tubes a year, each one for $200.\n\nThis plan will ensure that Kolhe will have a dependable source of income until we can start producing the tubes ourselves.

You can see a list of the ports that we serve, as well as the closest ones to your location.

However, this is set to change if a new state law is passed, which will allow ethanol to be taxed at 60 percent of the full price.\n\nAs a result, we would need to adjust our current rates and pass through a corresponding tax to ensure compliance with the new law. We can also help reduce your costs by absorbing the tax until June 30, 2023, but if the current rate remains unchanged, your fuel costs will increase significantly.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nBest regards,\nPacific Ethanol"

It seems like you want to get the rice as soon as possible, but I\u2019m not sure that this is the case.\n\nThere are many routes that you can take, but here are the most important factors that will determine the right shipping line for you. The length of time from departure to arrival is important because you need to know when the ship will arrive in Qingdao. It\u2019s important to know if the ship is going to arrive in a timely fashion, or if it will be delayed due to weather conditions or other unexpected events.

For example, from where in Europe would you like us to load the base oil in? Could we instead export the base oil to either the US or Canada, and then import it to Singapore?

It is urgently needed in a timely fashion as it is to be loaded onto a barge that is also leaving Rotterdam on the 12th of May. It is imperative that it be delivered to the correct location as soon as possible.\nA transport company is interested in purchasing the product, but there must be a quick and reliable way of transporting it to the barge so the payment can be made at the time of delivery.\nShipping via air freight is the only way we can guarantee timely delivery, however it will cost approximately $120,000 to ship it to Amsterdam in an FCL pallet. (FCL is Freight Collect on Loading; meaning that a pallet is loaded on a truck and paid for at loading.)\n\nBest regards,\nJohn"

To summarize, she walked in late this morning and was complaining about not having anyone to work with. She was generally complaining about everything. The only thing you could do was to tell her that you had already met with the rest of the team and had already assigned them to the projects. Then she proceeded to say how she could probably solve all of these problems because she was so smart. You gave her the option to go home to think about it, but she kept insisting she was intelligent enough to handle the situation. She finally left to go home, which was good."

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of the massive oil spill that occurred this summer. To give you a better understanding of the scope of the issue, we can provide an infographic, table, or graphs.\n\nWe estimate that at least 40,000 tons of chemical dispersants will be needed to aid in the removal of the oil spill. The next step is to contain the crude oil and distribute it to companies that have orders for oil. It\u2019s important to note that major oil companies like Chevron are already involved, accounting for 40% of the oil being scooped out from the Gulf.\n\nYour email mentioned the need for dispersants. Please let us know how we can assist you in obtaining them. We will also need to have the vessel at the site.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Doe"

The pathway of the dispersant is controlled by dispersing it into the water column, either using chemical dispersants or in-situ burning. We have experimented with in-situ burning on a small scale, although it is not yet approved for widespread use.\n\nThe main challenge with chemical dispersants is controlling the depth and concentration in the water column. With in-situ burning, you can better control the depth of burning.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Doe"

Magenta - This is the cheapest but has a longer transit time.\n\nTransit Time: 37 days\nFreight Cost: $5,990\n\n2. PCT - This is the fastest vessel but the cost is very high.\n\nTransit Time: 26 days\nFreight Cost: $29,990\n\n3.

The commodity was imported on board your vessel 'JCM SCANDALING', for which your bill of lading #59751 was issued. However, the freight forwarder now requests to be paid against release of the cargo and requests you to take immediate action to complete the proceedings.\n\nThe owner is unable to carry this cargo due to a lack of availability of off-hire time. The ship owner expects that his off-hire time be properly calculated. Our analysis reveals that there was a miscalculation in the calculation of days in port and days at sea which leads to underpayment. Kindly be advised that upon the failure to process the claim for days in port and days at sea, the ship owner will take further action.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\nShipping Agent\nJCM Scandaling"

Could you advise the freight rate and laytime accordingly? If the shipment is on CNF basis, I would like to have the discount rate for my cargo vessel. Kindly let me know of the demurrage-free period. Thank you for your cooperation. Yours truly, Yusuf"

We\u2019ve got a couple of interviews with editors soon, including the Editor in Chief at Apple Daily. (She\u2019s my favorite.) We are in the midst of rewriting the first 10% of the book and my draft is coming together nicely, even if it is taking me double the time that it used to. We are talking about that again with the editors at dinner tonight. I am hoping that I can turn the manuscript in by the end of March.

However, I can understand that businesses are worried about the recent shortage of fuel oil which causes the price of products to rise.

Large volumes of capital are coming from banks and investment firms into the dry bulk shipping market. The real question is whether this additional volume of shipping loans will improve returns to the shipping sector and make a difference in financing this sector as a whole.\n\nIf you would like to know more about the potential pitfalls and opportunities surrounding dry bulk finance, please do not hesitate to get in touch.\n\nThanks for reaching out,\nAnatoliy"

        "body": "Hi M. Corbin,\n\nThe dry bulk finance market is booming, with many shipping companies taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and increased demand for commodities. The biggest issue in this market is that the interest rates are so low, that they can actually hurt the shipping companies' profit margins. This is because the low interest rates mean that the companies can borrow money at lower rates, but they are also unable to earn as much in interest.\n\nThis means that the companies are able to pay off their loans more quickly, but they don't earn as much in profits as they would if they had to pay more interest. The other issue is that the demand for commodities is decreasing, which means that the companies are having to carry more unsold ships, which costs them money. The best way to make a profit in this market is to find a way to cut costs and make your shipping company more efficient.\n\nBest regards,\nVladimir"

This allows us to narrow down the scope of the project and hence have a clear price estimate.\n\nI have one more question: Are you the manufacturer or the supplier?\n\nYou are kind enough to forward the detailed T&D spec sheet along with all the information to our company. We would be grateful if you could share with us any other contact details of your firm and if your assistant is free on the phone. I will appreciate if you could provide us with the earliest possible response on the same.\n\nThanking you,\nYours sincerely,\nXYZ Project Manager"

I'm sure you don't write these responses every day but it really helps a customer.\n\nI'm especially happy about your last thought about the use of an agent or consultant. I did a little research and I learned that you use consultants in about 10% of your orders. This was encouraging to me because we would not be the first. You may want to think about that before you send out the next email. I think we would save enough on fees with a consultant and agent that it would make us come out a lot ahead. Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further.\n\nSincerely,\nJames"

Therefore, it\u2019s important for us to ship this order before COP26 takes effect, as we\u2019re planning on increasing our exposure to aluminum. \n\nI have a few questions: \n1. The current EDC tax rate is 3% and there\u2019s an additional 3% tax in 2023 and 4% in 2024. Is there any clarity on what the rate will be in the following years?

Escalation clauses are used to implement the benefits of a bunker cost increase and prevent the carrier from changing the contract rate and extending it through an escalation clause. Generally, escalation clauses are used when a contract purchaser is concerned about the impact of a bunker price increase. Should the bunker price increase, bulk rates and contracts are usually adjusted accordingly. A bunker escalation clause allows the parties to index their contracts on a timely basis rather than having to wait until a contract is being renewed or terminated. In addition, an escalation clause in a contract increases the incentive for the parties to achieve cost savings by allowing the buyer to negotiate an adjustment when the seller is benefiting from a rise in the cost.\n\nRegards,\nShipping Department"
