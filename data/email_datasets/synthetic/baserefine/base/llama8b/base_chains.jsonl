How many days would the vessel be anchored prior to the loading port?\nI look forward to your response. \nBest regards, Lisa\n**taktaks@hotmant.com**\n\n--- \n<Email 4>\ntaktaks@hotmant.com Re: 45-60 day\n"}

As far as Mundra is concerned, there will be no berth congestion (whether it be monthly or weekly) in any month of this year.                 Regarding the port of Long Beach, the container volume is consistently increasing month on month. It will also increase in the coming month.

The transhipment movement from West Africa & other major US destinations to Long Beach will increase by more than 10% this year.

Many thanks,                    Robert\nEmail 2:\nMatadi is a very busy port with cargoes often backed up at berth. There is no guaranteed transit time to discharge ships. It is typical for ships to be waiting in line from 2-4 days to get to berth and there is not a predictable number of ships in line to discharge as ships can come at any time without warning.\n                \n                It is typical to run back up and sometimes 2 berths simultaneously. When two berths are available, the berthing order is typically handled by the Terminal based on when the ship can reach the berth. In the event that your vessel can reach the berth on the day that is scheduled for your vessel, your berth time will likely be honored. If you are late due to port congestion and cannot reach the berth that is reserved for you, your berth may be given to another ship and you will have to wait in line for the next\n"}

He had offered an alternative product for the price you had provided.\nThe supplier is directly from the US and I think there is no reason for any third party to be involved in the transaction.\nTo be honest with you, the suppliers are not even prepared to sell the product at the prices you had quoted.

The best rate for you will be $60 per tonne + $5 in extra charges. The extra charges is because the port authority in Israel gives us that discount if we ship at least 100,000 tonnes per year.                      I also have a discount if you take shipping insurance. The extra charge for the insurance is$3 per tonne. You also need to deposit $20,000 into our account before we start shipping cement to you. The freight will be FOB, which means that you pay all the charges to move the cement from the terminal to the warehouse, or any location you want. Let me know if you are interested. I'm just preparing a form for you to sign.                    Yours truly,                    Ha\n"}

However, the transportation company asks for the following documents: a set of bills of lading, a certificate of insurance and a set of commercial invoices. I would appreciate your advice.\nYours sincerely,\nTom\n\nThe problem of Cargo Document is tricky because it involves the dispute on whether the transportation company should be considered as the agent of the seller.\n\nBusiness background:\nThe first email shows that the buyers have agreed on an acceptance to offer (letter of acceptance, cf. \u00a7 1384, Italian Code of Commercial law (Codice Commerciale)) and made a transportation contract for the 500 ton cargo of corn with a third party.

Thank you very much.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Silver, President Silver Shipping, Inc.\n</Email 3>\n\nThe main issue:\nFor the transaction to be a sale with CIF clause, at the moment of conclusion of the contract of sale, the Seller and the Buyers have to agree on the destination port and the Seller have to insure the goods for the Buyers. If the Buyers do not have a transportation contract, the Seller must comply with this CIF clause to fulfill the contract. Otherwise, the Seller should not promise the contract with the Buyers at all, which is the same as Article 6 \u00a7 1 (c) of the ICC\nEmail 4:\nGordon,\nMr. Silver would like to know where you have got the buyers of the corn. We have already got buyers but you asked for the freight and insurance costs. We do not understand why. As we agreed, you are responsible for the sale, insurance and transportation of the corn. We expect to see a written transportation contract from you within the next 3 days. Please forward to Mr. Silver a copy of the transportation contract.\nYours sincerely,\nBill\n</Email 4>\nThe point is that the Seller has not decided what destination port the Buyers are going to choose yet. It seems that the Sellers have fulfilled all the CIF obligations in this case. Thus, it is unnecessary to involve any transportation company. If there is no such transportation company that the Seller and the Buyers both use, the contract of sale cannot be considered as a CIF contract. Therefore, the Sellers should not\n"}

Some traders were approached in a very business-like manner, allegedly by major oil firms. The email subject line would indicate that the email was from a trusted business partner, such as a large energy firm or similar corporate client.\n\nThe email requests are easy to read but hard to understand.

In this instance, we can probably deduce that our client is confused as to what the client actually wants and also may be uncomfortable with all the business jargon. In both situations, the client should take a step back and evaluate the order. First, the client should\nEmail 4:\nDear John,                    Thank you for your reply.                    I am really sorry to trouble you. My name is Alihac, Assistant to the CEO of Singapore Energy.                    I\u2019d like to discuss with you about the details of the project.                    Please let me know when you are free.                    Best regards,                    Kim\n\nAs the requests are unsolicited and we have not received any communication with our buyer in the past, it would be a good idea to contact them directly to confirm their intent. We could ask the buyer for more information and maybe arrange to speak with the buyer directly. When speaking with the buyer, it would be important to ask them to provide more information about the deal. The buyer may have a reasonable explanation for their request. However, it is important to keep in mind that a reasonable explanation does not necessarily mean the request is legitimate.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis type of email scam\n"}

If you are interested, please advise latest by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony\n\n</Email 3>\n\nThe sender mentions in Email\u00a03 that the ship will leave Singapore to Jakarta on 18\u00a0November. That means there will be a time difference between 18\u00a0November and 20\u00a0November. So this information is not consistent with the information given in Email\u00a02, which is the main source of information.\n\nOne reason for inconsistency could be the mistake in Email\u00a02, when Ms.\u00a0Armitage wrote 22\u00a0November instead of 20\u00a0November. Or one may assume that when Ms.\u00a0Armitage sent Email\u00a02, she didn't know about the departure date on 18\u00a0November.\n\nLet us consider the following situation:\nEmail 4:\nHi Sally,                There will be a chartered departing on 18 Nov, with delivery ETA expected to be around 10 to 12 Dec.                Please advise if you are interested by 15 Nov.                Regards,                Tony\n\n</Email 4>\n\nIn Email\u00a04, we assumed that Ms.\u00a0Armitage may have made a mistake in Email\u00a02, and corrected it in Email\u00a04. So let us analyze this situation.\n\nAssume the ship leaves Singapore on 18\u00a0November and arrives at Jakarta on 10\u00a0December. This means the ship will take 22\u00a0days to reach Jakarta.\n\nSo, if loading is completed on 20\u00a0November, it will take a minimum of 2\u00a0days to complete the loading. It may take longer.\n\n\u2022 So the loading will take place between 18 and 20\u00a0November.\n\u2022 Then, if the\n"}

Thanks,                    Felipe\nEmail 2:\nDear Felipe,                 25,000 tons of oil from Copenhagen to Lagos in a seven-day freight?                    That's quite a bit of oil, Felipe. I assume you need to ship it by sea.                    You see, the oil trade operates on a just-in-time inventory management model, whereby oil is shipped to tankers as needed. This provides a stable supply and demand, eliminates inventory storage costs and prevents oil from degrading over time.                    Since your request involves shipping 25,000 tons of oil in seven days, my freight quote estimate would exceed what is available.                    Please confirm that your request is for 25,000 tons of oil in a seven-day freight and I can provide a quote to the maximum that is available to my company.

If you are shipping this amount of oil in an outbound tanker, then the only companies capable of doing so are Shell, Chevron and Exxon. I don't have contacts with these companies.                    If you're shipping by sea, then you'll need a port in Copenhagen to load onto a tanker. I've emailed my contacts in the seaport of Copenhagen. They'll be in touch with me in the morning.                    If you're shipping by road, then the quantity would need to be in 45 liter plastic oil drums. The storage space and legal limitations of this option would be impossible to organize in such a short time frame.\nEmail 4:\nDear Felipe,                 Again, shipping 25,000 tons in seven days is an unusual request.

He's a very important person who receives hundreds of emails from oil dealers like yourself, so he just needs to be advised that the shipping in question is okay. He's very busy, but if he doesn't reply within two weeks, please email him directly to remind him. You can just copy me on the email.                 This is your second response that implies you're okay with me contacting the seaport, so I'm sending you a copy of this email for your reference.

Cheers,                    Mona\nEmail 2:\nDear Mona,        The refrigeration is done by ventilation - the holds are ventilated by system that draws air through ice cold seawater. The air is then used to keep the goods at right temperature. There is no refrigeration in the holds of our ships. In between, there are rooms for packages of bulk goods.                    We could load the PKE in these rooms. It should fit in one or two such rooms. The loading rate would be 7-8t per hour.                    The max weight per carcase is 1.500kg. The container could not handle heavier carcases.                    To prevent damage of the PKE during loading, we have made special arrangements for the loading. The shell of the PKE must be closed after being loaded and we suggest using special sealing material for this purpose. A sample of this material can be sent if you wish.

Unfortunately, a few days into the voyage, the vessel ran aground and was a total loss. Not only did Brian misrepresent his ship owner to be a reputable one, he went ahead and used me to sign up an insurance contract for his own personal benefit, under the influence of alcohol.

Now I am having trouble recovering the costs of the cargo.                    Can you help me find a reliable ship broker to ship a product from Greece to Rotterdam?

In your opinion, are all the suppliers out there able to supply such a big order?                    Also, how long will the loading time take?                    Many thanks,                    Timothy\nEmail 2:\nDear Tim,             I'm going to refer to my first email response and elaborate as requested.             We\u2019ve never sold that quantity of MGO. Our company is a division of a larger company that has supplied 100,000mt+ to major trading companies in the last few years, so we can do this. The time frame can be negotiated between the supplier and buyer. We usually provide the shipping documents within 10-12 days of the shipment and request payment in cash 4 weeks later. The buyer needs to pay the bank documentary charges within 2 weeks of the shipment.             I think the real trick is to find a supplier who is able to supply this quantity. To find a supplier for 200,000mt who is able to deliver such a big order is quite challenging. The order should be split into two parts, each part being around 100,000mt.\nEmail 3:\nI\u2019ve just learned that the delivery vessel has a limit of 130,000mt and two big ships might be needed. So, 100,000mt of the order might be enough to fill one ship, and the other ship will have to be loaded with the other 100,000mt.             There are many shipping vessels available that can take this amount of cargo. The average delivery time for this kind of shipment is around 45 days, although it\u2019s possible to shorten the delivery time. It depends on the cargo vessel\u2019s available route.             The costs for this shipment can vary from USD 10 to USD 20 per mt, depending on the size of the cargo vessel, the route taken, and the distance the cargo will have to travel.             In conclusion, I think the best course of action is to ship the order in two parts, each part being around 100\nEmail 4:\nI will continue to provide information on how to find a supplier and transport and shipping companies for this type of shipment.             The best way to find a supplier is to contact the local trade association or trade missions in your area. They can help you find a local supplier, and if there\u2019s no local supplier, they can refer you to the association or missions in the destination country.             There are several types of shipping vessels that can take this amount of cargo. The most common types are bulk carriers, tankers, container ships, and Ro-Ro (Roll-on/roll-off) vessels. Each type of vessel has its own advantages and disadvantages.             The most common route is from Europe to Japan. The distance between the two countries is around 7,000 nautical miles, and the voyage can take around 30 days, depending on the vessel\u2019s speed and the weather.             The average\n"}

Your quote of $7,350 is a great value for a premium wheat like our MG and we were hoping you would have enough of the stock to allow us to charter your vessel to Dalian to load. When is your next voyage to Dalian?                    If we could charter your vessel directly from your current port, perhaps London, then that would greatly reduce our shipping costs and we would definitely prefer to charter with you. We will arrange for our vessel to load with your wheat and deliver it to Dalian where we will book a voyage to Durban.

Are you sure we have a 50-foot container deal with you? If we had a 50-foot container deal with you, I would've thought you would've offered us the container first because we are an origin based company. Also, I'm not sure what 'book' means in this context. There are not many 50-foot container companies in Canada and if we had a deal with you, I would be sure about that.\nRegards,\nNeeta\nNeeta Bhojwani\nPresident\nAsia-USA Logistics Inc\nPh: 604-568\nEmail 4:\nFrom: Cuenca, Paul\nTo: Bhojwani, Neeta\nSubject: Re: Free 50ft Container\nDate: Wednesday, February 17, 2010 11:47:31 AM\nHi Neeta,\nYes, we will book it as you wish. We will also book the 20ft container for you, however, we need to move it as a OOG from the main line to the OOCL main line. We need to move it to Keelung for OOCL to pick it up from there.

I\u2019m currently the vessel broker of a Chinese bulk carrier currently in Chittagong, Bangladesh.                    We have 3,800MT of heavy plates to load. Destination is Port Louis, Mauritius. We have been given the following port dues and fees to be deducted from the cargo:                    * General Cargo Port Dues: USD 3,256.00                    * Coast Guard Charges: USD 164.00                    * MFAF (Mauritius Free Airport Fee): USD 112.80                    * Port Corporation: USD 159.84                    * Generator Rental: USD 0.16/ Hour * 12 Hours = USD 1.92                    * Empty Tank Cleaning: USD 10.00 * 2 Tanks = USD 20.00                    Could you kindly take this into account when submitting\nEmail 2:\nDear Samuel,\nThank you for your email. Unfortunately it is not appropriate for you to pass charges like this on to the cargo owners without their consent. If you are able to provide evidence that this is the owners\u2019 responsibility (e.g. a bill of lading with a clause allowing the carrier to deduct port dues from the cargo), we might be able to discuss a rate increase to cover these expenses, but if you are just making up charges to pay your agency then it is unethical and we will not pay you.\nThank you,\nAlain Ferris\nPS: We also need a few more details on the cargo (origin, grade, product code), which will enable us to get a more accurate quote for the freight.\nPPS: The more information you are able to provide in your emails, the faster we can give you an answer, and the less likely it is that you will have\n"}

I'm afraid the above rate is no longer available.                        It seems that after your July inquiry, the freight cost has been rising continuously. In September, the rate could be around 12,000USD/30,000MT. It's quite expensive compared with your original contract of 1,300USD per MT.

At that time we agreed the contract price was only 1,300USD per MT. If we reduce the price further, we'll definitely lose some money.                        I don't know how to explain this to the client.                        I'd better tell him to take some other cargo.

The Suez Canal plays a crucial role in the global shipping industry, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. However, recent events have caused concerns among vessel operators and shipping companies about delays and increased congestion at the canal.\n2. Since the closure of the canal in March due to the Ever Given ship blocking it, operators have been expressing fears of congestion and delays. Despite the reopening of the canal in mid-April, vessels are still facing delays as the backlog of shipping containers and other cargo continues to accumulate.\n3.

I understand that you have some questions regarding the Ever Given ship and the backlog of vessels at the Suez Canal.

The process of refueling and repairing the ship is expected to take several weeks.\nAs for the backlog of vessels in the canal, the congestion has\n"}

Pye,                    I\u2019m writing you about your question.

I can handle a late July load date, but you must understand that it may take us a few weeks to secure the necessary permits. You can help speed things along by hiring a third party to find out who the permits are issued to, and to pay them for their services. Your cargo is a noxious substance that has been denied to others in the past, so this must be done delicately. The load window can be as short as 3-4 days, but we\u2019ll have to include that in the permits, too.

We can accommodate a shipment of 3000MT of rubbish, but I'm concerned by your use of a boxship. Sure, it'll transport the garbage, but you're going to have to pay out the wazoo to get one. My advice is to go the less expensive route and use your neighbor's trash cans for the operation. Those are typically made of cheap plastic that is easy to transport by land. I wish you the best of luck!            James               ----- Original Message -----               To: James S.

We'd be happy to take on your job! We're going to need to know a few things before we can proceed though:               What is your trade?               How far do you need to go?               What are you going to do with all of that garbage in the end? (toxic waste? Trash that will just be dumped into the ocean somewhere?)               This is actually the largest cargo ship in the world. But yes, I guess you could consider it a \"boxship.\" Oh but don't worry! We'll make sure to go easy on the plastic that way it won't weigh so much and we won't use up too much fuel.

The main factor here is that every port of origin in this region has its own cargo\u2019s name that differs from one port to another. Let me give you an example. Vung Tau\u2019s oil is usually known as \u201cXONE\u201d, for example. If the cargo\u2019s origin was not Vung Tau, it would be known as something different.

If the agent wants to sell his cargo by using an incorrect cargo name, it is much easier for him to trick the buyer by giving a name that has a higher profit for him, or a name that is more familiar for the potential buyer. This issue is something that we have to be aware of. We have to make sure that the cargo is what we think it is, and if we\u2019re sure that we know the exact\n"}

The distance is only 275 miles and if you cut through the shallows then it's maybe only 250 miles.                    With the shallowest part 43 feet, a 35,000 ton tanker would only use about 16' of water to float. If a tanker could travel through the route, I'm sure that the insurance premiums wouldn't be a major problem.                    I could not find any such tanker out there right now so it's not a matter of just connecting the dots.

The contract says 2,500MT, but they might also require 1,500MT of grain. This order will leave in the first week of July. We need your help.                    How much would shipping 4,000MT of both goods together cost, and do you see any risk of port congestion?                    Many thanks,                    Ivy\nEmail 2:\nHi Ivy,\nGood morning.\n\nThe order for 2,500MT should be easy to manage.\nRegarding the order for 1,500MT of grain, unfortunately, we do not see any vessel available to fit both cargoes in the same vessel. As we are still in June, there are still some free slots available on July, but as the order size is so big, we have limited choices.\nThat being said, we can manage to fit 1,000MT of milk powder and 1,500MT of grain in the same vessel with the owner of a 10,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge the previous cargo in July. All details about the vessel are as follows:\n\nM/V T1\nType    General Cargo\nFlag    Liberia\nCall    MOYO\nDeadweight    8,600MT\nBuilt    1996\nHold No\nEmail 3:\nRegarding the risk of port congestion in Australia, I'm afraid the situation is getting worse and that it may be difficult to find a slot for such a big order. Also, the railway terminals are overloaded as well.\nI know the situation seems very bad. I can only offer you the best available. If you are willing to wait till October, I can offer you a better slot with more space. This way, you will be able to fit more products, or reduce the price.\nWhat do you think?\nEmail 4:\nThank you for your help. The information you provided is very useful to us. \nWe want to ship the 4,000MT cargo in early July. We do not have enough storage capacity, so if we delay the delivery, it may lead to the depreciation of our goods, so I'm afraid we can only choose the original plan.\nAlso, we will have more orders to deliver in July. Can you please help us?\nWaiting for your reply!\nRegards,\nIvy\nBest regards,\nMartin\nEmail 5:\nHi Ivy,\n\nI understand that you have to deliver the order at the earliest opportunity, and that you can't wait till October. I'll look for a slot in September for you.\n\nPlease find attached a quotation for 3,000MT and 4,000MT. We can ship 1,000MT in July and 2,000MT or 3,000MT in August. I can fit 2,000MT on a 6,000dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September and 3,000MT on a 6,500dwt M/V which is due to discharge in September as well.\n\nDo you have a choice of milk powder or grain as the cargo to be shipped in August?\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\nMartin\n"}

{"id": 581, "chain": "Email 1:\nDear Ms. Ghosh,                    My group is sourcing 25,000MT of rubber from Shanghai to Salem. We can be very flexible on loading, but need to know your thoughts on two possible shipping methods:                    1. 50/50 via Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. How much extra would be this compared to a typical voyage at your current market price?                    2. 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev. Is there any discount available if we book these voyages for 2016 as well?                    Sincerely,                    Sarah\nEmail 2:\nDear Sarah,                        Glad to get your inquiry. Actually, I have just sent an email regarding the new liner service through Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode to VRS China. Let me know if you get that. I am not sure about the sea transport to India since I am not from that dept. But I would like to go for the FCL rate of Hoegh Autoliner as there is an attractive rate by these carriers.                    One of my friends of Taiwan is also very interested in this carrier. She will go for 10/20 cbm containers. But they were waiting for the government\u2019s final approval. Anyway, please wait for our China dept\u2019s advice.                    Any other queries please contact me at any time.                    Have a nice day!

Thank you for the offer! Do you have any indication on the timing of the service? In addition, do you think I should consider 33/67 via Golden Highway and Damleev as well? I did not include those carriers in the original email because my thinking was that they are more suitable for 2016. Still, the volumes will be the same for both years. Sarah\n\n\nIn this email exchange, Sarah was mainly interested in the future developments of Hoegh Autoliner 85 and Maersk Ode. She also mentioned that she wanted to discuss an alternative carrier, Golden Highway and Damleev.\n\n<Email 4>:\nSubject\n"}

The Port of Elizabeth is basically a bit \u201crustic\u201d. Most of the coal is stored at berths which are up the hill or out of the water in a kind of side-loading facility. The coal berths are essentially ash ponds that are filled from barges, loaded from stockpiles, or loaded by rail. In any case, the coal must be transported in some way and the loading will depend on the coal berth. The average loading rate is between 600-800 mt/h, and with no draft restrictions or berthing limitations, we are expected to load at an average rate of 1500 mt/h.

It looks like neither your terminal nor mine has cranes strong enough to handle such large ships. But we do have a lot of common interests with the island of Grande Comore. For example, we can both benefit from using a reputable port with quality equipment and speedy service, as well as avoiding overloading.                    The solution is to find a company that can efficiently load the cargo. Most shipping companies prefer to hire their own personnel for discharge because their ships require a high level of attention. The only problem is that many stevedoring companies are not experienced in unloading large ships. And that\u2019s why we need your help.

Do you think you can still beat their rate?      \n   Best regards,          \n   Thor          \n\n--         \nWhen you give an estimate, it will give the exact rate. It is correct if the pickup and delivery dates are the same and the amount of goods shipped is 50 CBM. If your pickup date is July 10, 2017, the delivery date is July 20, 2017, and the amount of goods shipped is 25 CBM, you can click the blue icon in the lower right corner. Change your preferred dates and change the amount of goods shipped.\n   Our company charges $0.05 per CBM per day, so the extra cost is $25 ($25 CBM*0.05$ per CBM per day*20 days\nEmail 3:\n--         \n   Hello,           \n   Do you have experience in moving polymers?

I wish to inform you that the goods which comprises of one piece of one Rolls Royce and four pieces of Household goods have been detained by the Librerian authorities for the past three years as they claim that the customs documents were not properly filled.

Calloway and Vaughn. Please be advised that pursuant to Section 14.4 of the Purchase Agreement dated November 4, 2004, we have placed certain assets that are subject to the asset transfer agreement that you recently sent over to us in our depository at 15 York St., in Toronto, to await the return of those assets to ABC. These assets are detailed in a list attached to our email of December 14, 2004, (see attachment A). I assume these are the assets that are under your custody. If you have any objections to this deposit, you must advise us\nEmail 4:\n[RECEIVED AT TIME OF EMAIL]\nDear Mr. McGroarty,\nThank you for your email. Please be advised that we have no objections to the list you provided to us. However, the list in question has not been previously reviewed by the Board of Directors of ABC and therefore we are unable to provide you with any information regarding the specific assets. It is our understanding that our list does not conform to the requirements of the Sale Agreement, particularly since the list reflects that we are permitted to retain certain files and information despite the fact that we are prohibited from using or retaining any ABC Confidential Information, as set out in the Sale Agreement. This is a concern to our Board of Directors.\n\nPlease be advised that your proposal to place certain of our assets in a depository pending return to ABC is inappropriate and contrary to the terms of the Sale Agreement. Specifically, Section 2.1(a)\nEmail 5:\nI just spoke with Martin but I was copied on the email below. \n    Today is December 17th, 2004 and we continue to have no approved and executed sale agreement. In the meantime, ABC is purging all of our assets and information, and sending same to various unidentified third parties and law firms. \n     We simply cannot accept these proposals in light of ABC's wrongful purging of our assets. All of the discussion contained in your email is irrelevant in light of the purging. Please provide us with a confirmed list of all assets that have been sent to third parties and their names. \n<Email 6>:\nDear Mr. McGroarty,\n\n<Body>: You must withdraw any claim that ABC has breached the purchase agreement. You are not our trading partner; you are our custodian, holding assets that belong to ABC until such time as the transaction is closed\n"}

This makes the victim pay attention to the price, believing it is actually lower than the price of the chartered ship (by the way, let's make it 0.19$). By saying that you will pay 0.05$/MT for bunker, the victim thinks you are buying bunker, while you are actually renting the vessel.\n\n    Also note that the shipping cost (0.19$) is given to the nearest part of the fourth decimal place, which might look suspicious if the sender and receiver have different countries. It is a very good trick to make such mistakes, as I did in email 2, or even in email 1 if the victim is inexperienced. It makes the victim think he is comparing two similar offers, which they are not, and look bad for not noticing it. Finally\n"}

The first modification was in 2010 when a new engine was installed. This new engine has increased the vessel\u2019s cargo capacity to 7000MT and increased its efficiency. In 2017, the vessel underwent another modification in which its six layers were lined with waterproof cloth and epoxy. This modification has improved the vessel\u2019s ability to carry cargo without leaking and increased its durability. We believe that these modifications have improved the vessel\u2019s performance and made it a better choice for shipping iron ore.

For some reason the attachment was not attached to the e-mail.\n  Matthew, We have almost finalized all the arrangements. Attached is a document for your review. I will be going to Jamaica in the next few days and I am happy to make all the necessary arrangements for the shipment.\n...\nMaryland Bankruptcy Court\n\n<Email 4>:\n Please sign the document attached and email it to me as soon as possible so that I can proceed to make arrangements to send the cargo to Kingston Wharves. Regards, Charles Denton\n\nCannon\n\nI concur with Mr. Detrick's decision to uphold the bankruptcy court's ruling with regards to the findings and sanctions, with an addition of noting the lack of cooperation with the trustee. I do not think it is appropriate that there was no interview done to this company and I have the utmost concern of how can one do a complete review on a company without speaking to that company. For that reason, I will advise to bring this matter up during the oral argument of Mr. Detrick. Since he is hearing the matter, I think it would be proper to ask if a quick interview with the representatives of Hartley Crane Company, Inc. will be a consideration for the trustee.\n"}
