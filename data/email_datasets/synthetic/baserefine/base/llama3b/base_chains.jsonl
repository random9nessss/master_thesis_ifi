Please advise whether our team can pick up your order for 1,500 MT of fish feed at your warehouse tomorrow. You need to release an opening POI to our driver by 2 PM tomorrow. If possible, please advise an estimated loading time. Otherwise, we will need to use our B backup option of loading at South Changjiang.                      Thank you,                      Yan\n"}

Or you didn\u2019t even get the email?                      So I phoned you again at 3:30pm. You answered this time. I had to leave a message, which you probably didn\u2019t even bother to listen to. The point of the message was that I\u2019m very, very unhappy that you haven\u2019t returned my emails.                      Just in case you can\u2019t read my mind, the reason I\u2019m so unhappy is because you didn\u2019t even reply to the email, and you took hours to phone me back. I don\u2019t know whether you\n"}

There are still other factors affecting crude. There's more to say on that but I will save it for the next email.                    Stay tuned!

At 38.5 handle, crude was in a trading zone.                    Then, at 40, it closed above 38.5 handle (outside trading range).                    Next, we came in at 40.2 on the 7/23 call, triggering the highest swing up since 7/2 (42.5).                    And finally, at 42.5, we enter an overbought zone (up-trending market).                    A stop is not necessary because our exit (42.5) is extremely protective.                      So, what happens\n"}

So, you need to make a few assumptions:\n\n1. If your customer made 2,000 purchases over a period of 20 years, then you can assume that he used your tools for at least 20 years (that is, 20 years ago).\nEmail 5:\nI am thinking about using your plugin for e-commerce. Do you have a plan to monetize it? Or do you plan to offer it for free?\n\nYes, I have a plan to monetize the plugin. I plan to do this by offering the plugin as a monthly subscription. The subscription will be priced at $100 per month. In other words, you will need to pay$100 per month to use the plugin.\n\nThis is one of the ways that I plan to monetize the plugin. The other way is by selling the plugin as a paid one-time purchase. I will be discussing this more in the next few days.\n"}

It seems there are some potential risks, including weather impact and Suez Canal bottlenecks that will affect transportation. As such, the earliest available vessel for loading the cargo is not for another 14 days. However, you can still ship this cargo by the fastest available vessel for an additional premium of 7% if you are prepared to pay for the cost difference and the fees associated with carrying the risk of uncertainty. The sea freight cost is typically cheaper because the additional cost will only be incurred in the unlikely event of an inevitable delay or cancelation. I am attaching some indicative transport cost estimates for your review. These calculations are based on the available information, including port dues, and thus these figures may be subject to change depending on the final contract details.

Do you know of a broker that can help us get them to Vietnam? I would like to make some real money on this and the sooner we can make it happen the better. I also have a stock of construction materials that I want to put in place but I can only do it once we have a truck.                    I would really appreciate it if you can find out what you can. Thanks,\nMichael\n\n<Email 6>:\nHi Roger,                    I\u2019m currently looking to buy whitegoods at a reasonable price, do you have anything in stock?

Our client's cruise began early in the morning, and at the start of the first afternoon, the cruise stopped for an hour, where the client's lunch would have been normally taken.

I have shipped a container of cricket equipment from Brisbane and I need to know whether you can pick it up from the port. I\u2019ll need you to help me out with the clearance as well. Or, do I need to hire a local customs agent to get it cleared. Also, how do I contact the shipping agent?\n\nRegards,\nAndrea\n\nComments:\n\u2022 Email 1: Only replies with further email to this address\n\n<Email 3>:\n Hey Andrea,\nI\u2019ve taken your advise and hired a local customs agent to get the cricket equipment cleared. I\u2019ve also made arrangements to pick up my container from the port. The agent has told me that I must clear the equipment in a few days, otherwise the container may be sold. He also said that it\u2019s a good thing to have the cricket equipment cleared by a local customs agent. I will be flying to Quetta in 10 days and will be arriving at the port to pick up the container. The agent has told me that a truck will be provided to take the container to my address. I do have some questions.\n\n1. How do you pay for the clearance?\n2. Will the trucking company charge us a fee?\n3. What if the container is full? I need to send all my cricket equipment but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to fit it\nEmail 4:\nHi Saroop,\n1. How do you pay for the clearance?\nIf you are paying for clearance and the agent is going to handle it, I suggest you pay with a pre-paid card and keep the receipt. Once you\u2019re in Quetta, the agent will pay for the fees and keep the receipt for their records. When you go to get your cricket equipment, you\u2019ll pay the agent back and keep their receipt.\n\n2. Will the trucking company charge us a fee?\n3. What if the container is full? I need to send all my cricket equipment but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to fit it\n\nAs for fees, you should ask the agent to send a quote to you. Once you confirm the cost, you should pay the agent and they should file the paperwork. I suggest you ask for a copy of the quote for your records.\nIf the container is\n"}

The current EDC tax rate is 3% and there\u2019s an additional 3% tax in 2023 and 4% in 2024. Is there any clarity on what the rate will be in the following years? I know this may change, but it\u2019s difficult to predict. (Answer: In 2024, it may be 4% as\nEmail 3:\n1. We also have a product which is looking to ship in November. Do you think it is worth\nconsidering a new LCOE contract on top of the cost for us? (Answer: Yes, it might be worth it. There\u2019s a good probability of seeing it drop because of the weakening Dalian index. But don\u2019t expect the same discount as in previous deals. It\u2019s quite difficult to find lumps in the market. LCOEs are hard to find.)\nKoen,            I've sent the documentation in the email. Please let me know if there are any issues. I also attached the FMC Declaration to see if that's something you need. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Thank you for your help! Many thanks,                                Adrian\nEmail 4:\nHi Koen,                    We've made our selection and are ready to ship this consignment. However, I've received an invoice from the bank asking for a second payment in advance, as the first payment was insufficient to cover the costs. I believe this is for the ELT payment, which was done in May.                    However, I didn\u2019t receive any communication from you about this. I was waiting for an update before making the payment. If it\u2019s ELT payment, it shouldn\u2019t be this high, should it? Many thanks for your help,                               Adrian\n\n<Email 5>:\nHi Koen,                We\u2019re back in touch with you because I\u2019ve just been informed about the following: The shipping company that we\u2019ve been working with over the past few months has decided to halt their operations in our country.

Regards,                    Andrew\nEmail 2:\nDue to the complexity of bulk rates, both simple and indexed escalation clauses are commonly used in the\nsea cargo market. Bulk rates are based on bunker price and tonnage. Escalation clauses are used to\nimplement the benefits of a bunker cost increase and prevent the carrier from changing the contract rate\nand extending it through an escalation clause. Generally, escalation clauses are used when a contract\npurchaser is concerned about the impact of a bunker price increase. Should the bunker price increase,\nbulk rates and contracts are usually adjusted accordingly. A bunker escalation clause allows the parties\nto index their contracts on a timely basis rather than having to wait until a contract is being renewed or\nterminated. In addition, an escalation clause in a contract increases the incentive for the parties to\nachieve cost savings by allowing the buyer to negotiate an adjustment when the seller is benefiting from\na rise in the cost\n"}

A bulk update or delete can be viewed as a more or less complicated data type conversion. Instead of processing rows with SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE, one can convert them in bulk.\n\nBulk update and delete can be a lot faster than UPDATE and DELETE. While UPDATE and DELETE are based on changing one row at a time, a bulk update or delete can change or remove many rows at a time.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a simple UPDATE example.\n```\nUPDATE  table_name \nSET     field_name = 1.2\nEmail 5:\nDear Sven,                        I am interested in buying 2,000MT of scrap metal from Gent to Stettin.

In this case, email 1 is the first message to reach Ms. Christina who represents the company named \"Singaporean Paper Mill\" on behalf of their customer, a leading supplier of pulp and paper products.\nEmail 3:\nDear Christina,\nWe just received your email regarding our consignee would like to know the break bulk tariff on Paper Hand Rolled please send it to my email directly.                     \nBest Regards, Jesse\n\nNote: Email 3 is another example of a communication that actually was sent. In this case, the communication was sent to Ms. Christina directly, instead of to the company she represents. In many cases, the same \"broken chain\" appears, where the actual shipper contacts the recipient directly instead of using the channel of the NVOCC.\n"}

I need your help once again as I had a request for 7,000MT from Santos and I informed my good friend Francisco about it and I got advice from him. The distance of Santos to my ship is pretty much, so I prefer Santos.                   Thank you.                                        Pedro\n\n<Email 4>:\nSubject: Advice from\n"}

In fact, there are two other ports in the Kansai area (Hiroshima and Kobe) that are both bigger than Osaka.

Therefore, the whole quote you were given was subject to the eventual port of discharge being Osaka.\n\nI'm sorry I cannot be of more help on the pilotage fee issue. I can only confirm that the pilotage fee has been quoted from Tsukaji as this is the port of call that's on the vessel's I.P. The\nEmail 3:\nAs I indicated before, the vessel cannot carry 6,500MT. Can I please also request a breakdown of the pilotage fees so I can fully understand the costs? I have contacted the port of Osaka regarding the ultimate port of discharge. Due to the current port congestion there, they do not hold any information that can determine when a berth will be available. I will ask them to confirm with the relevant operator and advise you immediately.\nKind regards,\nSusan\nMorning Susan,                          Could you please let me know what you have found out regarding your vessel's port of discharge and port congestion in Osaka.

Regarding your second query, the Standard Charters will be 40 days turnaround per trip and for the return leg from airport to airport we will allow up to 5 days turnaround.

Thank you,                    Maria\nEmail 2:\nDear Maria,                    Unfortunately I do not ship varnishes to the New Orleans area and would prefer not to. That being said if I do a search of my available inventory and find anything that is suited to your needs, I will contact you immediately.                    If however it's just another product you are shipping that's not on the Hotwire system, I'd be more than happy to assist you. I can make sure you get the correct documentation and arrange for the import.                    In either case, let me know if you have any questions. Have a great day.                    Maria\nEmail 3:\nDear Ms. Wood,\nFirst off I would like to say I appreciate the prompt response in regard to my last email. I see you have some inventory available, but they do not meet my shipment's needs. If I were to contact you about something different would it be a problem? That being said I am a consultant in the logistics industry and my services are always free of charge and as per the contract there is no obligation to you to purchase through my companies.  There are many people out there looking to cut costs in logistics and I can get them better rates than you can. \nThat being said I have contacted a gentleman in New York that could get me the varnishes to Louisiana if needed. Now for my question. I'd like to give you a call sometime next week to review my rates so you know how I can assist you with your shipments. I really want to help,\nEmail 4:\nHi Maria,\nThanks for the call and the offer to help. It is always a good idea to learn from the competition and see if there are ways to improve. Here's the problem though, with someone giving a 'free quote' on a project there is no commitment to us, which means they have to do whatever they have to do to get that deal. I'm sure they're better than Hotwire, but they will lose you and then we have to deal with you again. That's why I'm so hesitant to send quotes to people I don't know.\nI do hope we'll keep in touch and maybe, sometime, we'll see if I can't help you on a project.\nEmail 5:\nMs. Wood,\nDear Ms. Wood,\nI was sorry to hear you are not interested in helping me, but if you are interested in consulting me about any way to improve my shipping cost I am always open to any ideas. I would appreciate if we could at least start off with a friendly email. I am glad you offered help, but you might want to consider to not offer help and save yourself some time. Thank you and have a good day.\n"}

Your local bank will send the payment to the carrier to pay for the cargo.                    4. The cargo will be delivered to the client in Cartagena.                    It would be good if you can help with the customs clearance in Cartagena.                    ------------------------------                    END G\n"}

We now understand there will be a reduction in capacity at Yangon in early October, and we can definitely accommodate your vessels.  However, we are having trouble finding accurate draft information, and we'd like to make sure we're getting our quotes to our customers as soon as possible.

Thanks,                Mandy\nEmail 4:\nHi Mandy,                      The exact minimum draft will be determined by when each vessel comes into Yangon, as we have a range of charterers and we can't possibly ask for 24 separate quotes. We will try our best to give you quotes, but the degree of variation is dependent on what we are able to procure on the spot.                    It's currently being confirmed that we will not be able to access the shallow draft ports, so that would be off the table for your vessels.  Once we've confirmed what we can provide, we'll get back to you.  Please don't hesitate to contact me directly with any questions.

{"id": 671, "chain": "Email 1:\nYou have a new job! Well, not really \u2013 but you will write several emails in a short time to say \u201chello\u201d to the new company you\u2019ve been offered.                    The question is: Are you interested in the job? Of course, you\u2019re not going to say \u201cno\u201d, but what tone and language will you use? Can you see any difference between these two emails?                    Are these just plain English? If so, the person reading your email will ask him/herself, \u201cso what\u2019s going to make this job different from all the other jobs you\u2019ve had?\u201d                    Or, do you want to sound more professional? Think of someone else at the company you admire and ask, \u201chow would this person sound?\u201d. You want to be taken seriously, so why not use this role model to guide your language and style.                    First \u2013 address the person correctly\nEmail 2:\n1. Dear Mr. Goldie.\n2. Dear Mr. Ron Goldie.\n3. Dear Sir,\n\nThe last one is bad. Even if you don\u2019t know the title of the person you\u2019re writing to, you should find out. It is just poor manners to call someone \u201cSir\u201d when you know his/her title is \u201cMrs.\u201d. Of course, you can only find out his/her title if you have been given that information by the human resources department \u2013 so how would you know to address him/her that way? (The answer is \u2013 you won\u2019t. But if the company does not give you that information, call the person \u201cSir\u201d).\n\nSecond \u2013 when should you write an email?\nThe choice of email or letter will depend on the nature of the situation and your relationship with the person you are addressing. There are some circumstances where the choice of email and letter is similar\nEmail 3:\nSome emails are going to be shorter than a letter. If you are writing about a job offer you probably will use an email, rather than a letter. If you send a letter instead of an email, it might take several weeks for the employer to respond and you might not hear back from them at all.\n\n<Email 4>:\nOr perhaps you are simply giving the other person an apology. If it is a formal apology that will be sent to a formal address \u2013 to an official with a title, you will probably use a letter.\n\nThird \u2013 address the subject matter.\nAre you describing your qualifications for the job? Are you apologizing for being late for an interview or for the need to reschedule an interview?\n\nIt is better to be specific and complete.\n\nFourth \u2013 what tone of language should you use?\nA formal email will be written in a professional tone, expressing confidence and taking responsibility\nEmail 4:\nOr perhaps you are simply giving the other person an apology. If it is a formal apology that will be sent to a formal address \u2013 to an official with a title, you will probably use a letter.\n\nThird \u2013 address the subject matter.\nAre you describing your qualifications for the job?

Would a form letter (or would the form letter say a form letter) send the right message?\n\nFifth \u2013 making the connection.\nJust as you should have a similar style of introduction for a letter, an email should open with a similar introduction and an invitation to read your email through to the end. Here\u2019s an example of a less than ideal opening email:\n\nDear Mr. Goldie,\nI would like to inform you that a final decision has been made about the hiring process and I need to come to London to continue the recruitment process on the 12th of November. I will be leaving Paris on the 11th at 1 pm. I will be going by train and I will reach Paris Nord at 6.30. I would be very grateful if you could arrange a car and driver to collect me\n"}

Vladimir\nEmail 2:\nThe area is the center of the recently emerged \"dry bulk finance bubble\" centered in Singapore. It is clear that large volumes of capital are coming from banks and investment firms into the dry bulk shipping market. The real question is whether any of this additional volume of shipping loans will improve returns to the shipping sector and make a difference in financing this sector as a whole. If you would like to know more about the potential pitfalls and opportunities surrounding dry bulk finance, please do not hesitate to get in touch.   \nThanks for reaching out,                     Anatoliy\n\n\nAuthor: Vladimir\nEmail Type: Sales\nDomain: Shipping Finance\nOpportunity: Focused\nProbability: 70%\nEmail 3:\nThe dry bulk finance market is booming, with many shipping companies taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and increased demand for commodities. The biggest issue in this market is that the interest rates are so low, that they can actually hurt the shipping companies' profit margins. This is because the low interest rates mean that the companies can borrow money at lower rates, but they are also unable to earn as much in interest. This means that the companies are able to pay off their loans more quickly, but they don't earn as much in profits as they would if they had to pay more interest. The other issue is that the demand for commodities is decreasing, which means that the companies are having to carry more unsold ships, which costs them money. The best way to make a profit in this market is to find a way to cut costs and make your shipping company more efficient.\n<Email 4>\n"}

If we want to change the subject, we only need to change the value of WORKFLOW_SUBJECT. However, if we want to add a line to the subject, the code will change to something like this:\n\nWORKFLOW_SUBJECT = 'Last Update on {reviewed_on}: {workorder.name}.

For example, we have two messages (5 and 6) below\n\nWe might be able to figure out why message 5 is not a good email. But message 6 has to be a good email.\n\nHow about we use the above rationale to find out how many words are missing in the message? So a message should have a dot \u2018.\u2019 followed by a word followed by a dot \u2018.\u2019 and that word cannot be the same word in both messages. Then it will have to be something like this\n\ndot \u2018.\u2019, \u201c\u2026\u201c, dot \u2018.\u2019\n\nNow the question is, how many dots are there?

How do we use them correctly? I think it is good to learn about proper punctuation for email or writing because it helps to communicate your ideas in a clear and effective manner. So, let\u2019s start with colon \u2018:\u2019!\n\nThe colon is a punctuation mark that is used to separate a main idea from a supporting one in writing. If we look at the sentence below,\n\nThe food was very tasty: I ate two bowls.\n\nWe can see that there is a main idea and a supporting one. In this case, the main idea is the food was tasty. And the supporting one is that the person ate two bowls of food.\n"}

We tried our best to minimise the freight cost, because we are a young business.

Many thanks,                    Precious\n\n\nIt is important to think about this from the carrier\u2019s perspective, as every shipper has the same cargo. I constantly kept an eye on rates for the same dates as the shippers were looking at, so I could check whether the shippers were taking advantage of rates. The rates of the carriers would change at different times based on many factors, including demand and supply. In fact, there is also a cap on rates by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) due to the deep-sea shipping market becoming an oligopoly, with only a few shipping companies dominating the global shipping market, as is the case with many industries today. As mentioned, it is difficult to find lower rates if they are limited by the IMO,\n"}

I did a little research and I learned that you use consultants in about 10% of your orders. This was encouraging to me because we would not be the first.

The cargo will arrive Riyadh in 48 hours. Could you keep the cargo in tank under DAF for 48 hours? I could not wait any longer for free. Thanks.

It is likely that the tank was not fully filled because of the shortage of manpower. The cargo was successfully discharged and delivered. I hope to work with you on this opportunity again in the future.\n"}

As you know, my PhD is on food processing, and as such, I thought it would be beneficial to include this section in my report. I was wondering if you could go over this section with me, as I am unsure about how the key concepts are linked. I am also unsure how to apply the concepts to industry, and would be grateful for your input and guidance.

We will carry your product to Busan on a confirmed VLCC Bulker (per your request) and bunker from Busan to Aqaba. After that, you can pay bunker or proceed yourself. You will have to add discount of bunker oil at Busan.            If you wish, I can start our bunker and sailing arrangement in order to make an available space of approx. 5,500mt\n"}

Email users can only respond to a message when they receive it, but in the process of email composition, it takes a lot of time before a response is sent. Communication between two email users is often delayed and incomplete. Also, email messages are prone to re-read\n"}

When can you have an estimate for us?                    We\u2019ve just signed for 3,000MT of salt from Le Havre to Galveston.

Unfortunately, the price for CFCL is not the only reason we decided to stop importing this material.                    As you know, with the growing production of carbon fiber products, the supply of CFCL has become more limited, and it has become more difficult to secure it.                    Also, there are no warehouses in the USA that are licensed to store this product.                    Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of this material, and not to damage it during transportation, we have stopped importing CFCL.                    On the other hand, the price of other types of composites is increasing, and CFCL has become relatively more expensive.                    Nevertheless, you are always welcome to reach out to us with your requirements, and we will be more than happy to help you find the best alternative for your project.\nEmail 4:\nDear Mr. Tanoov.

Where can I get technical data sheets for these materials? As I understand it, CFCL 55 and 56 are available in two variants, with a different thickness. Is it correct?
