I\u2019m reaching out regarding your recent inquiry for a crude oil shipment. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for a 100,000 MT cargo. The laycan is October 15-20, and the starting freight rate is in the low 50s ($50.50 per MT). Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.
