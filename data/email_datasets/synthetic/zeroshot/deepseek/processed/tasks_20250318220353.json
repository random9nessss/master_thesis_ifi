I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is 15-20 October. Our starting freight quote is in the low 50s, specifically $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you consider $49.50 per metric ton? Also, can you confirm the demurrage rate?

I understand your position, but $49.50 is a bit tight given current market conditions. However, I can offer $50.25 per metric ton as a middle ground. The demurrage rate is $20,000 per day, pro rata.
