I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and LOA of 280m. The laycan is 15-20 October. I\u2019m quoting a freight rate in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.
