I\u2019m reaching out regarding your recent inquiry for a crude oil shipment. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for a 100,000 MT cargo. The vessel has a DWT of 120,000 and an LOA of 250 meters. The laycan is October 15-20. Our starting freight quote is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per MT. Let me know your thoughts.

The laycan works for us, but the freight rate is a bit on the higher side. Given the current market, we were hoping for something closer to $49.50 per MT. Also, could you confirm the demurrage rate?
