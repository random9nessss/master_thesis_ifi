I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. She\u2019s a 150,000 DWT tanker with an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is 15-20 October. I can offer a starting freight rate in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Would you consider coming down to the mid-40s? Also, can you confirm the laytime and demurrage terms?

I understand your position, but the mid-40s is a bit tight given current market conditions. I can offer $49.50 per metric ton as a compromise.
