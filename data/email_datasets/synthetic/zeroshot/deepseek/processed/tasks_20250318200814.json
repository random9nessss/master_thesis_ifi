Following up on our call earlier, I\u2019m pleased to provide a freight quote for your crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We\u2019re looking at a rate in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton, based on a 100,000 MT cargo size. The vessel we have in mind is the MV Oceanic Star, a modern VLCC with a DWT of 300,000 and LOA of 330 meters. Laycan is tentatively set for October 20-25. Let me know your thoughts.

The rate seems a bit on the higher side given current market conditions. Would you be able to come down to the mid-40s? Also, could you confirm the vessel\u2019s availability for the laycan?
