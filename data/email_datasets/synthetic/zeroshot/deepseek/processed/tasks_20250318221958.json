I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. She\u2019s a 150,000 DWT tanker with an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is 20-25 October. Our starting freight quote is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The MV Ocean Star sounds like a good fit, but the freight rate is a bit on the higher side. Given the current market, we were hoping for something closer to $49.50 per metric ton.

I understand your position on the freight rate. After discussing with the owner, we can offer $50.00 per metric ton, which is a competitive rate given the vessel\u2019s specifications.
