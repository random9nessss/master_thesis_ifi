I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. I have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. She\u2019s a 150,000 DWT tanker with an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is 15-20 October. My starting freight quote is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you consider something in the mid-40s, say $45.50 per metric ton?

I understand your position, but $45.50 is a bit tight given current market conditions. I could potentially come down to $49.00 per metric ton, but that\u2019s as low as I can go.
