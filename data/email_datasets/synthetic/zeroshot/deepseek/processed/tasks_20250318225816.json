I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280m. The laycan is October 15-20. Our starting freight quote is in the low 50s ($50.50 per metric ton). Let me know your thoughts.
