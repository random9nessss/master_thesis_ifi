I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is October 15-20. I\u2019m quoting a freight rate in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate seems a bit high. Given the current market, I was hoping for something closer to $49.50 per metric ton. Can we work on this?
