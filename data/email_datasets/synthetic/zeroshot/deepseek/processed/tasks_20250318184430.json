I\u2019m reaching out regarding your recent inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. She\u2019s a 150,000 DWT tanker with an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is October 15-20. I can offer a starting freight rate of $52.50 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Would you be able to come down to the low 50s, say $50.75?
