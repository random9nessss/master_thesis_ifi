I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a vessel available, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is October 15-20. The starting freight rate is in the low 50s ($50.50 per ton). Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.

The laycan works for us, but the freight rate is a bit higher than expected. Would you be able to come down to the mid-40s?

I understand your concern about the rate. After discussing with the owner, we can offer $48.75 per ton, which is a competitive rate given the current market.
