I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is October 15-20. Our starting freight quote is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The laycan works for us, but the freight rate is a bit on the higher side. Given the current market, we were hoping for something closer to $49.50 per metric ton. Can you check if this is feasible?
