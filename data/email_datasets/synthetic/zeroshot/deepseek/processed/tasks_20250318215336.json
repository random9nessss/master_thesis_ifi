Following up on our call earlier, I\u2019m pleased to provide a freight quote for the crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We\u2019re looking at a rate in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton, based on a cargo size of 80,000 MT. The vessel we\u2019re considering is the MV Ocean Star, a 2015-built Aframax with a DWT of 115,000 and LOA of 240 meters. Let me know your thoughts.

The rate seems a bit high compared to the current market. Would you be able to come down to the mid-40s? Also, could you confirm the laycan dates? We\u2019re looking at loading between October 15-20.

I understand your concern about the rate. After discussing with the owner, we can offer $48.50 per metric ton, which is competitive given the vessel\u2019s specifications.
