I\u2019m reaching out regarding the crude oil shipment you inquired about. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for loading around October 20-25. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The starting freight rate we\u2019re quoting is in the low 50s, specifically $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you consider something in the mid-40s, say $45.50 per metric ton?

I understand your position, but $45.50 is a bit tight given current market conditions. How about we meet in the middle at $48.00 per metric ton?
