We have a vessel available for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. The vessel is a 150,000 DWT Aframax with an LOA of 250 meters. The laycan is 15-20 October.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit on the higher side. Given the current market, I was hoping for something in the low 50s, say $50.75 per ton.
