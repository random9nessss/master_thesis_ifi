I\u2019m reaching out regarding your recent inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Oceanic Star, available for this route. She\u2019s a 150,000 DWT tanker with an LOA of 280 meters. The starting freight rate we\u2019re quoting is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you consider something in the mid-40s, say $45.50 per metric ton?
