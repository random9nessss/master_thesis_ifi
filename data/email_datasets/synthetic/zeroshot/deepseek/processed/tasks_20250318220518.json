I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for a laycan of October 20-25. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The starting freight rate is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The laycan works for us, but the freight rate is a bit on the higher side. Would you consider $49.50 per metric ton? Also, could you confirm the vessel\u2019s specifications and any additional terms?
