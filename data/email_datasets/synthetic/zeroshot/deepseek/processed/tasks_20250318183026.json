I\u2019m reaching out regarding your recent inquiry for a crude oil shipment. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Oceanic Star, available for a 100,000 MT cargo. The vessel has a DWT of 120,000 and an LOA of 250 meters. The laycan is 15-20 October. I can offer a starting freight rate of $52.50 per MT. Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you consider lowering it to the low 50s, say $50.75 per MT?
