I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280m. The laycan is 15-20 October. Our starting freight quote is $52.50 per metric ton. Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you consider lowering it to the low 50s, say $50.75?
