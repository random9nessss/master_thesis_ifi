I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for a laycan of October 15-20. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The starting freight rate is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.
