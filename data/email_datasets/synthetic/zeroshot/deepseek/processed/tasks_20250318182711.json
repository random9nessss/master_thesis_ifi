I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The starting freight rate we\u2019re quoting is in the low 50s ($50.50 per metric ton). Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.
