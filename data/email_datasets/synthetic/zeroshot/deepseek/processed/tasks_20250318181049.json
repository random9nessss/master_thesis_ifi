I\u2019m reaching out regarding the crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a vessel available, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280m. The laycan is 15-20 October. Our starting freight quote is $52.50 per metric ton. Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.
