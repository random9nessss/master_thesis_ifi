Following up on our call earlier, I\u2019m pleased to provide a freight quote for the crude oil shipment from Rotterdam to Singapore. We\u2019re looking at a rate in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton, based on a cargo size of 80,000 MT. The vessel we\u2019re considering is the MV Ocean Star, a modern VLCC with a DWT of 300,000 and LOA of 330 meters. Laycan is tentatively set for October 20-25. Let me know your thoughts. \n\nBest regards, \nSarah"}, {"from": "John (Charterer)", "to": "Sarah (Broker)", "subject": "Re: Freight Quote for Crude Oil Shipment", "timestamp": "2023-10-01 14:30", "body": "Hi Sarah, \n\nThanks for the quick response. The rate seems a bit on the higher side given current market conditions. Would you be able to come down to the mid-40s?
