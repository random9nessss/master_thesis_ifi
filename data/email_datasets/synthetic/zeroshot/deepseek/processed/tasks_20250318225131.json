I\u2019m reaching out regarding your recent inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The starting freight rate we\u2019re offering is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.
