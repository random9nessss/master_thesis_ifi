I\u2019m reaching out with a freight offer for a crude oil shipment from Rotterdam to Singapore. We have a vessel available, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and LOA of 280m. The laycan is 25th-30th October. Starting freight rate is in the low 50s, say $50.50 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit on the higher side. Given the current market, we were hoping for something in the mid-40s. Can you work on the rate?
