I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. She\u2019s a 150,000 DWT Aframax with an LOA of 250 meters. The laycan is October 15-20. I\u2019m quoting a freight rate in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you come down to the mid-40s? Also, can you confirm the demurrage rate?

I understand your concerns on the rate. After discussing with the owner, we can offer $48.50 per metric ton, which I believe is competitive. The demurrage rate is $15,000 per day, pro rata.
