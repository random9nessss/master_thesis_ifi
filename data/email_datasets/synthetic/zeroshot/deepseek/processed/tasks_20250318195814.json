I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Oceanic Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and LOA of 280m. The laycan is 15-20 October. Our starting freight quote is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you consider something in the high 40s, say $48.50 per metric ton?
