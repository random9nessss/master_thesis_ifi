I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for a laycan of October 15-20. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. Our starting freight quote is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The laycan works for us, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you consider something in the mid-40s, say $45.50 per metric ton? Also, could you confirm the vessel\u2019s specifications and any demurrage terms?

I understand your position on the freight rate, but $45.50 is a bit tight given current market conditions. How about we meet in the middle at $48.00 per metric ton? The MV Ocean Star is in excellent condition, and I\u2019ve attached the full specs for your review. Demurrage is set at $20,000 per day, pro rata. Let me know if this works for you.
