I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Trader, available for a laycan of October 15-20. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The starting freight rate we\u2019re quoting is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.
