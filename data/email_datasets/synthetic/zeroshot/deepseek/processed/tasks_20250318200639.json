I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The current freight rate is in the low 50s ($50.50 per metric ton). Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\nSarah"}, {"from": "John (Charterer)", "to": "Sarah (Broker)", "subject": "Re: Freight Inquiry for Crude Oil Shipment", "timestamp": "2023-10-01 14:30", "body": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for the quick response. The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Could you consider a rate in the high 40s, say $49.75 per metric ton?
