I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for the laycan period of October 15-20. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. The starting freight rate we\u2019re quoting is in the low 50s, specifically $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were hoping for. Would you be able to come down to the mid-40s, say $48.50 per metric ton?
