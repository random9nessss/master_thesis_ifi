I have a vessel available for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. The vessel is the MV Ocean Star, 150,000 DWT, 280m LOA. The laycan is 15-20 October.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit high for us. We were hoping for something in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Also, can you confirm the laytime and demurrage terms?
