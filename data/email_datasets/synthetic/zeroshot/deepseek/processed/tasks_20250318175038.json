I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. I have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. She\u2019s a 150,000 DWT Aframax with an LOA of 250 meters. The laycan is October 15-20. My starting freight quote is $52.50 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\nSarah"}, {"from": "John (Charterer)", "to": "Sarah (Broker)", "subject": "Re: Freight Inquiry for Crude Oil Shipment", "timestamp": "2023-10-01 14:30", "body": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for the quick response.
