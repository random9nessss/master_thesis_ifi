I\u2019m reaching out regarding your recent inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. I have a suitable vessel, the MV Oceanic Star, available for this route. She\u2019s a 150,000 DWT tanker with an LOA of 280 meters. The starting freight rate is in the low 50s ($50.50 per ton). Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.
