I\u2019m reaching out regarding your recent inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for this route. She\u2019s a 150,000 DWT tanker with an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is 15-20 October. I\u2019m quoting a freight rate in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit on the higher side. Given the current market, I was hoping for something closer to $49.50 per metric ton.

I understand your position on the freight rate. After discussing with the owner, we can offer $50.00 per metric ton, which is quite competitive given the vessel\u2019s specifications.
