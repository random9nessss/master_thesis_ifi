I have a vessel available for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. The vessel is a 150,000 DWT Aframax, built in 2018, with an LOA of 250 meters. The laycan is October 15-20. I can offer a starting freight rate of $52.50 per metric ton. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit on the higher side. Given the current market, I was hoping for something in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton.
