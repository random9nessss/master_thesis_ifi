I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, with a DWT of 150,000 and LOA of 280m. The laycan is 15-20 October. The starting freight rate is in the low 50s ($50.50 per metric ton). Let me know if this works for you or if you\u2019d like to discuss further.

The laycan works for us, but the freight rate is a bit on the higher side. Could you consider something in the mid-40s, say $45.75?
