I have a vessel available for a crude oil shipment from Rotterdam to Singapore. The vessel is the MV Ocean Star, a 150,000 DWT tanker with an LOA of 280 meters. The laycan is 15th-20th October. I can offer a starting freight rate of $52.50 per metric ton. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\nSarah"}, {"from": "John (Charterer)", "to": "Sarah (Broker)", "subject": "Re: Freight Inquiry for Crude Oil Shipment", "timestamp": "2023-10-01 14:30", "body": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for the offer.
