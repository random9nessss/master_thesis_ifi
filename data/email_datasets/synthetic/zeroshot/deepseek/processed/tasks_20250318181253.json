I\u2019m reaching out regarding your inquiry for a crude oil shipment from Houston to Rotterdam. We have a suitable vessel, the MV Ocean Star, available for a laycan of October 15-20. The vessel has a DWT of 150,000 and an LOA of 280 meters. Our starting freight quote is in the low 50s, say $50.75 per metric ton. Let me know your thoughts.

The vessel details look good, but the freight rate is a bit higher than we were expecting. Could you consider something in the mid-40s, say $48.50 per metric ton?
