Let me recalculate the rate considering the additional call. This could indeed optimize the voyage and potentially lower the freight per MT. Give me some time to work out the figures.\n\nHowever, please note that the final rate will also depend on the loading window and total quantity confirmed. We would need firm stems from both ports.\n\nBest,\nCristina Walker\nAnderson Shipping Brokers"
