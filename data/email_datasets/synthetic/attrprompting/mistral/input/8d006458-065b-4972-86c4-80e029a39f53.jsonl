{"custom_id": "349", "body": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a synthetic email chain in JSON simulating a realistic maritime shipping communication between a broker and a charterer. The chain should reflect authentic back-and-forth exchanges and contain timestamps, short disclaimers (optional), and shipping jargon.\n            The communication starts on 2021-07-08.\n            \n            Essential Attributes:\n            - Broker:                           \"Global Maritime Brokers\"\n            - Commodity:                        \"Iron Ore\"\n            - Load Port:                        \"Fort Lauderdale\"\n            - Discharge Port:                   \"Phuket\"\n            - Cargo Size:                       \"8880MT\"\n            - Incoterm:                         \"DDP\"\n            - Vessel:                           \"AL GHUWAIRIYA\" (DWT: 154940 and LOA: 345m may be mentioned naturally in the conversation; however, including these details is optional)\n            - Starting Freight Quote:           \"AUD109\"\n            - Broker's Demeanor:                \"Confident\"\n            - Broker's English Level:           \"foreign\"\n            - Broker's Formality:               \"colleagues\"\n            - Verbosity:                        \"ultra concise\"\n            - Selected Abbreviations:           \"iuhtautc, agw, usc\" \n              (Incorporate these abbreviations only if they naturally fit into the conversation.)\n    \n            - **Noise Injection**: Punctuation Anomalies - Introduce missing, extra, or misplaced punctuation (e.g., missing commas or extra periods) to mimic hurried or error-prone typing.\n\n    \n            Conversation Guidelines:\n            {'name': 'Reefer / Specialized Cargo', 'description': 'Charterer requires temperature control or special handling. Broker suggests a suitable vessel/extra fees.', 'notes': 'First email from charterer. All numeric quotes from broker. Use shipping jargon. Use plausible email addresses.'}\n            \n    \n            2. Negotiation Flow:\n               - Emails should feel natural and reflect typical shipping negotiations:\n                 - The charterer might push back on the rate or ask for clarifications on vessel details.\n                 - Mention or highlight important maritime points such as \u201claycan,\u201d \u201cstem,\u201d \u201cloading window, demurrage rate per day\u201d) even if not part of the essential attributes.\n    \n            3. Subject Lines & Timestamps:\n               - Include a concise but slighlty evolving subject line for each email (e.g., \u201cRe:, \"Fwd:\", minor additions, etc.).\n               - Add a timestamp in chronological order. Gaps between timestamps should be plausible. No mentioning of timezones.\n    \n            4. Stylistic Variations:\n               - If formality is set to \u201cinformal\u201d and English level is \u201cforeign\u201d or \u201cintermediate,\u201d introduce mild typos or grammar slips. \n               - If formality is \u201cformal\u201d and English level is \u201cexpert,\u201d maintain a more professional and polished tone.\n    \n            5. JSON Output Format:\n               - \"email_chain\":     an array where each element is an object with the keys \"from\", \"to\", \"subject\", \"timestamp\", and \"body\".\n               - \"labels\":          an object containing the following pairs. For any label in \"labels\" that is not applicable or not mentioned in the conversation, leave its value as an empty string:\n                   - `\"broker\"`\n                   - `\"commodity\"`\n                   - `\"load_port\"`\n                   - `\"discharge_port\"`\n                   - `\"cargo_size\"`\n                   - `\"incoterm\"`\n                   - `\"vessel\"`\n                   - `\"dwt\"`\n                   - `\"loa\"`\n                   - '\"starting_freight_quote_currency\"'\n                   - `\"starting_freight_quote\"`\n                   - '\"final_freight_quote_currency\"'\n                   - `\"final_freight_quote\"`\n                   - `\"laytime_start_date\"`\n                   - '\"laytime_end_date\"'\n                   - '\"demurrage_currency\"'\n                   - `\"demurrage\"`\n\n            6. General Guidelines:\n               - Aim for around 9 messages, but adjust as needed if more or fewer work better.\n               - The final freight quote must always be an actual numerical value, even if the starting freight_quote is indicated as for example mid60s\n               - The chain should revolve around one cargo/commodity scenario, not multiple. \n               - Freight quotes may be revised or clarified by the broker, but only after an initial quote has been established and only if the charterer counters with a revised rate inquiry.\n               - If a noise injection is triggered, weave it naturally into one of the emails without derailing the conversation.\n               - The broker is called Luz Tapia and the charterer is called Ethan Villegas.\n               - Vary the currency formats as preferred (for example: USD, $, usd, us$, etc.).\n               - Don't recite information such as vessel names in subsequent emails if they are clear from context, unless the vessel name is revised, just mention it once. \n               - Don't use any markdown formatting. Just plain text."}]}}
