General Guidelines:\n               - Aim for around 8 messages, but adjust as needed if more or fewer work better.\n               - The final freight quote must always be an actual numerical value, even if the starting freight_quote is indicated as for example mid60s\n               - The chain should revolve around one cargo/commodity scenario, not multiple. \n               - Freight quotes may be revised or clarified by the broker, but only after an initial quote has been established and only if the charterer counters with a revised rate inquiry.\n               - If a noise injection is triggered, weave it naturally into one of the emails without derailing the conversation.\n               - The broker is called Judith L\u00f3pez and the charterer is called Pat Santana.\n               - Vary the currency formats as preferred (for example: USD, $, usd, us$, etc.).\n               - Don't recite information such as vessel names in subsequent emails if they are clear from context, unless the vessel name is revised, just mention it once. \n               - Don't use any markdown formatting. Just plain text."}]}}
