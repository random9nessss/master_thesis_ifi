Given the urgent nature of your request, I've checked the availability for MV ATBAN. She can be made ready for the stipulated loading window. However, given the tight schedule and market volatility, the initial freight quote comes to about EUR36 per metric ton.\\n\\nPlease confirm if this works at your end so we can proceed with further arrangements, including laytime terms.
