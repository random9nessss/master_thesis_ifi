The laycan is 1st to 5th Feb, and we're offering a freight rate of \u20ac40/MT CFR.\n\nGiven the high-risk nature of the route, there's an additional war risk premium of \u20ac2/MT and a piracy surcharge of \u20ac1/MT. Demurrage is set at $15,000/day.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\nJosh"

As for additional charges, the only other cost would be the adcom (address commission) of 1.25%, which is standard in our contracts.\n\nOn a side note, I recently read that the port of Cairns has implemented new environmental regulations, which might slightly affect the discharge operations.

She\u2019s a solid vessel with a DWT of 88438 and an LOA of 290m, so she can handle the 6349MT cargo size comfortably.\n\nFor a CFR basis, I\u2019m looking at a starting freight quote of AUD108 per metric ton. The laycan window I can offer is 10th to 15th July. Let me know if this works for you or if you need any adjustments.\n\nBest regards,\nLauren"

        "body": "Hi Lucas,\n\nNo worries at all. BEIDOU STAR was built in 2001, but she\u2019s been well-maintained and recently dry-docked. Her current draft is 12.5m, which is perfect for Durban and Goteborg. As for the rate, I can bring it down to USD60 per MT if we can finalize by tomorrow. Let me know if this works for you.\n\nBest,\nNoah"
