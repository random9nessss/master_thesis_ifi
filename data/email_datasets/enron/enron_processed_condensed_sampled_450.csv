"Scheduled for Febr. 1 at 2pm.

Location - at a fire station in a Hispanic Community - exact location will be 
forwarded shortly but estimated distance from ENE office = less than 15 min.

Expect News Conference to last a total of 30 minutes, including Q&A. Jeff 
Skilling will be spokesperson for Selection Committee. However, we will try 
to have as many committee members present as possible. 

Mayor will likely discuss (estimated time = 10 min.):
 - changes that are required at HFD - potential need to bring in an outsider, 
etc...
 - reasoning behind involvement of Enron/Jeff Skilling & formation of 
selection committee - de-politicize the process, etc...

JS should speak about the following (estimated time = 10-15 min.):
 - how he became involved in the process
 - how the committee members were selected
 - who the members are with a brief background on each (We plan to provide a 
bio on each of the committee members as part of the press release)
 - time line for Fire Chief selection 

Q&A (estimated time = 5-10 min.)
 - expect questions along the lines of: Are the meetings going to be open or 
closed?, Outsider vs. Insider related questions...

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/issues with the above. 
I'll coordinate collection of Bios from Committee members. Anything else I 
can do to help out here?

Hey guys,

I'm in the process of getting authorized to access files in the O drive, and 
need to confirm which folders are ones that I would need.  The one labeled 
Legal seems appropriate.  Also, I understood from Alan that there is a folder 
with scanned in ISDA Masters that I need.   The thing of it is that I don't 
know what's in any of the folders, so it's hard to figure which ones I should 
get authorized for.

If you guys could help me identify which ones they are, that would be great.

Thanks,

Limor

"These deals have been changed - just thought I'd let you guys know, for 
future reference, that deals scheduled to flow during on peak hours only 
should not be booked through Sunday. Even though the system won't recognize 
any Sunday hours, apparently it messes with Houston's reports.

Kate,

I understand that the deals are not actually flowing on Sunday but for 
auditing/reporting purposes per Melissa Murphy, these deals need to display 
the correct term of 2/17 only instead of 2/17-2/18.

The deals are:  523881, 523882, 523877, 523875, 523876, 523879, 523880, 
523883, and 523884

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

Thanks,

Dear NYTimes.com Member,

One of the most meaningful features to appear in The New
York Times and on NYTimes.com is Portraits of Grief. This
feature first began running on September 15 and presented
brief profiles of World Trade Center victims. On December
31 the final daily edition of Portraits of Grief appeared
in The New York Times newspaper. A book will be published
this year, and the feature will continue to appear from
time to time, as more names become known and more families
agree to interviews.

In the meantime, we invite you to visit the Web site to
see a complete collection of Portraits of Grief,
alphabetized and listed by day. This archive represents
all the Portraits published to date. They will remain at
NYTimes.com indefinitely.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/portraits/?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Fz041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

Another recent special feature has been the multimedia
photo essay. We have already talked here about the essays
done by Vincent Laforet and James Hill. I would now like
to direct your attention to the newest, this one by Times
staff photographer Ruth Fremson about the women in
Afghanistan. The essay features a very strong audio
commentary, which makes the point that not all the women
feel the same about the head-to-toe veil they were
required to wear under the Taliban's rule: in fact, many
are very comfortable dressed as they are.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/dayofterror/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Ja041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

We have enjoyed participating in almost daily
""conversations"" with correspondents of The New York Times.
In these unstructured talks, each correspondent provides
information not only about the news he or she is covering,
but on what life is like in the particular place he or she
is located. There are over 50 discussions now available
for listening in audio format.

"Hey Louise, following are a few folks I would suggest making an extra effort to talk to in the very near future, although with the announcement of Duran I think he has already begun meeting with these guys. 

Ozzie Pagan-Ozzie Pagan-Ozzie Pagan
Bernie Aucoin-Head of Power Structuring
Janelle Scheur- NE mid-market
Michael Brown-NE orig.
Heather Kroll- SE orig.
Bruce Sukaly-TX orig.
Charlie Vetters/Mike Miller- Principal Investing

These gas guys could use a little attention:

Ed McMichael-Head of Gas Structuring
Frank Vickers-East gas orig.
Laura Luce-Chicago/Midwest gas

I talked with Delainey last night and asked him to talk with Duran which he did. Delainey also talked with Michael Brown and Janelle Scheur (I wasn't here). I talked with Ozzie this morning and Delainey is talking with him now. We've asked every one of these guys to stay calm and give this a chance to work. I do think they all have confidence in Duran so that's good. 

Personally, I think the Baughman announcement was a mistake. Baughman is a superb mid-market leader, but the NE isn't in need of that. Janelle can handle that role with no issues whatsoever. The NE needs a high-powered structured originator that will continue to build and really lead that business. The signal that was just sent with the Baughman announcement is that the NE will be a mid-market shop only (confirming the concerns already up there),  with no realistic capability of executing on the current business plan. 

Please let me know if there's anything more I can do. It really took a lot of work to get East Power finally set up like it needs to be, and I really hate to see it falling apart like this.  And remember, we have put out no ""bids"" for ANY individual within ENA or wholesale. 

Call if you need anything..."
"Due to problems experienced by TAGG Deal Capture users a couple of weeks ago, 
we have made some modifications that will change the process of how a deal 
ticket is produced. Under the previous process, a user will request a Deal 
ticket to be generated and the TAGG application would basically schedule a 
job to generate and print the report on UNIX. The amount of time between the 
moment the user would click on the button to generate Deal Ticket and the 
time the actual ticket  printed was dependent on the amount of activity in 
the whole TAGG system. This time would range from about one minute to several 
minutes. Also, sometimes the ticket would never print. On the new version of 
the application, the report is generated directly from the user's machine and 
it will print on the default printer used by all the other windows 
applications on user's machine.  For  those users using dial-up, the 
processing will be done on the dial-up machine and the report will print on 
the default printer attached to the dial-up machine. From the user's point of 
view, in order to generate a Deal Ticket they need to follow exactly the same 
steps they were doing before. The processing going on behind the scenes will 
be different, but report will print almost instantaneously. Every effort has 
been made to replicate the report as close as possible, but there will be

More tickets are available-as many as you want (I think you're the only real

tells you something.  Good  time for Michael to be sick!

Carlos has interviews today and tomorrow with ENA.  I think he is looking
good for Mexico.  You guys are the absolutely best qualified for that
business, and I'll start planting that seed when I can.

By the way, thanks for the great job on Coral.  Did you hear from Rose on
the HSR on TurboPark?

We do want Astros tickets for next year - at least 15 games.  Are more
available?

I heard that Hampton had an issue with Patty Biggio (thank goodness, these
salaries are absurd), and I guess I'm glad to see Ausmus come back.
However, he is not a substitute for a pitcher.  And how is Shane?

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you."

"Michael - Yes there is a trading track for EGM and they are getting ready to staff up that part of our Program.  It will be an on-going part of the Program and while you do have some experience in trading you probably need Enron experience (six months or so).  Karen Buckley at 5-4667 manages the trading track side of the program and I would suggest you call her for further details.  My advice is to learn the Enron culture and maintain contact with Karen so you will have an opportunity to interview for the trading track program as it evolves.  Ted

Hi David,

Thanks for sending the answers to our technical questions. After carefully
reviewing your answers, we have a few follow-up questions.  These appear in
""green"".  Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.

We are looking forward to meeting with you next week. Tentatively, we are
planning to have 5 or 6 people attend.  These include three really technical
people, a couple of leads (including myself), a user from the True Quote
business side who understands the products that are traded on True Quote,
and the new True Quote CIO (who's mainly interested in hearing what is said
more so than actively participating in the discussion).

By next Tuesday, I plan to send you our proposed agenda for the meeting.  If
you have a different agenda in mind for the meeting, let's discuss it over
the phone on Wednesday and jointly priortize the items for discussion. We
are very flexible in terms of the agenda.

Thanks in advance for any additional information you can send us.  It's nice
to have a contact to be able to correspond with.  Have a great day!

Maria,

It was good to hear from you this morning.  I have attached your document
with answers to your questions included.  In addition, I've provided the
finalized DTD and our schedule of release dates for specific functionality.

I raised your desire to meet to discuss the project and everyone agrees
that getting together is a good idea.  That said, we believe it would be
best to wait until we have a firm agenda to discuss.  For instance, we will
need to get together in the near term to discuss data mapping issues.  Feel
free to call or drop a note if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

David

The following are the dates that we will release functionality.

1 December 2000:  Login, Attempt Transaction, Post Price, Request Price and
Request Order Status.
15 December 2000: Request Transaction History, Request Credit Matrix, Post
Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix.

Subject: RE: Enron-TrueQuote Integration Technical Questions


David,

I really appreciate your efforts in adding another hour to our meeting this
afternoon and in making Jay available for the discussion.  The following is
a list of technical questions that we would like to discuss in this
afternoon's meeting:

1) This one is probably going to be discussed in the first two hours - We
will need to have the data to populate our tables with in order to map PID,
CPID, RID, PSETID, CATGID, CTYID, CMDTYID.  The non-technical people know
all of the information about the products, deal types, etc.  However, do
they know that for example, PID ""123"" maps back to Product ""ABC""?  I would
think the technical people are the ones that know how this codes map back to
specific product information on your system.

2) Could you provide us a little background on why Credit term changed from
""Required"" to ""Implied"" during the last version of the DTD that we received
from you?

3) We sent this question a few days ago, but have not received a response:
There are several different parameter names specified for the XML that is
passed between systems.
The following is a list of those specified in the External Interface
Document:

Post Prices:  prices (Page 12, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Request Prices:  prices (Page 14, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Attempt Transaction: txn (Page 16, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Product Set Data: xml (Page 26, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Credit Matrix: xml (Page 28, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)

Should all of the parameter names be ""xml"" or should the parameter names for
Post Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix be changed to reflect the
naming convention of the other use cases?

Using ""xml"" as the parameter name for all use cases will reduce the
redundancy of the code we'll need to write to route the data to our internal
interfaces.

4) We still have some concerns over having to maintain Enron's calendar on
our system since term is sent as part of the key.  We would like to discuss
alternatives for dealing with date interpretation.

5) We had asked a question earlier regarding business responses being sent
back within the same HTTP session.   We are going to assume that
confirmation comes back in the HTTP response since there has been no
interface defined for business responses.  We would like to confirm this
assumption in this meeting.

6) Is there going to be some capability of cancelling a transaction attempt
if for some reason we do not receive a response back from Enron on a
transaction attempt and a subsequent transaction search?

7) Would Enron consider posting all of their requests to a .asp file as
opposed to a file with no extension (ext_nrt.asp instead of ext_nrt)?  It is
a generally accepted practice to include file extensions when transporting
files.

Thanks again for everything David.  We will look forward to talking to you
later today!

Regards,
Maria

Maria,

I understand your concern and while I want to ensure we address product
mapping as the primary focus of the meetings, I asked if Jay Webb and/or
Mike Guadarrama could spend some time discussing your technical questions.
Jay and/or Mike will be available from 3-4 today to do just this.  I know
you've asked some technical questions already and are also interested in
credit mapping nevertheless, would you please provide a brief rundown of
the technical issues you want to discuss so that Jay/Mike can be prepared
in advance to make the best use of the hour?  Thanks.

The meetings will be attended by our Product Control Group who are
responsible for creating and maintaining all of Enron's product types and
products.  They are the experts when it comes knowing all the various ways
Enron represents and implements products on EnronOnline.  Other than
myself, the four attendees will be Sheri Thomas, who heads the Product
Control group, Jennifer deBoisblanc-Denny, who heads the products area of
the group and two experts in gas and power products.

Look forward to hearing from you soon so I can inform Jay and Mike.

There will be people there that understand the products in non-technical
detail.

When were you thinking we could involve your ""technical"" people?  I agree
with the agenda and strongly agree that we need to understand each other
products before we can attempt an integration.  However, my team's
reponsibility is to figure out how to ""technically"" send/receive and map
information from your system.  If this is not going to be addressed the
first day, than perhaps some of them don't need to come.  I guess I'm now
concerned that the second two hour meeting isn't going to be long enough to
provide my team the information they need proceed with their technical
implementation.  I understand that the documents you've sent me should
address most of our questions, but each revision has left my team with more
questions and confusion about how this is all going to work.

Will Jay Webb be in either meeting?  Could you send us a list of the
attendees on your side and their roles/functions as well.   We want very
much to make these meetings as productive as possible, understanding that
your team as well as mine are very very busy.

I appreciate your help,

Thanks for the finalized list.  I assume that one or more of the people

Oh, I see, my misunderstanding.  We are in 3 Greenway Plaza.  Two 2-hour
meetings is fine with us. No problem in us driving downtown.  However,
could
we schedule from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 on the 8th, and from 10:00 to 12:00 on
the 9th?  I have a conflict on the 8th.

The agenda looks fine.  If there are any additional XML-type questions left
to answer by the time we have the meeting, we may want to allow some time
to
discuss them.

Thanks again David, looking forward to meeting in person.

Maria,

Actually, I was suggesting 2 hours on both the 8th and the 9th of November
for getting together to discuss mapping issues.  If November 8th and 9th
isn't good for you, we can try November 9th and 10th.  I would say let's
just get together for one, four hour meeting but it is difficult to get the
Product Control people together for that length of time since they are
integral to the day to day operations of EnronOnline.  (I am assuming you
are in downtown Houston.  If getting here is difficult then we can try to
arrange a one day meeting.) Any thoughts on the suggested dates/times?

As far as the number of meetings required, from our point of view we just
need to accomplish product and counterparty mappings.  The agenda below
addresses products and a follow-up would address counterparties.  Beyond
that, the External Interface Document and DTD should address all the
technical issues that enable you to design and construct your part of the
system.  I'll send you the most recent External Interface Document and DTD
shortly.

Please let me know you thoughts on the proposed agenda.  I'm sure we can
work out an agreeable schedule.

Regards,
David

Agenda
11/8/2000 10:00-12:00  Clarification of product representation and product
creation
process.

It is important to understand each other's methods for representing
products and the process by which we create new products prior to jumping
in to the mapping problem.

11/9/2000 10:00-12:00  Map schedule A products.

It is important to not only know which products of ours map to yours but
what process can be applied to make mapping easily repeatable.

Hi David,

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.  I was out of the office
yesterday.  November 9th looks better for me.  I am concerned though, that
2
hours is not going to be enough. Do you expect this to be the first of
several meetings?

Maria,

I've passed along your questions to the development team, which is
currently looking at them.  I'll get back to you regarding these as soon as
I get their feedback.

Regarding a meeting next week, I think we're going to have to postpone
until the following week.  How does November 8 & 9 look for you?  I've
tentatively scheduled our product people for 10 AM till 12 PM for product
mapping discussions.  Let me know what you think.

Below is the agenda I think we should start with for our first meeting.

11/8/2000
10:00 - 12:00  Clarification of product representation and product creation
process.
It is important to understand each other's methods for representing

Hi David,

Thanks for sending the answers to our technical questions. After carefully
reviewing your answers, we have a few follow-up questions.  These appear in
""green"".  Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.

We are looking forward to meeting with you next week. Tentatively, we are
planning to have 5 or 6 people attend.  These include three really
technical
people, a couple of leads (including myself), a user from the True Quote
business side who understands the products that are traded on True Quote,
and the new True Quote CIO (who's mainly interested in hearing what is said
more so than actively participating in the discussion).

By next Tuesday, I plan to send you our proposed agenda for the meeting.
If
you have a different agenda in mind for the meeting, let's discuss it over
the phone on Wednesday and jointly priortize the items for discussion. We
are very flexible in terms of the agenda.

Thanks in advance for any additional information you can send us.  It's
nice
to have a contact to be able to correspond with.  Have a great day!

Maria,

It was good to hear from you this morning.  I have attached your document
with answers to your questions included.  In addition, I've provided the
finalized DTD and our schedule of release dates for specific functionality.

I raised your desire to meet to discuss the project and everyone agrees
that getting together is a good idea.  That said, we believe it would be
best to wait until we have a firm agenda to discuss.  For instance, we will
need to get together in the near term to discuss data mapping issues.  Feel
free to call or drop a note if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

David

The following are the dates that we will release functionality.

1 December 2000:  Login, Attempt Transaction, Post Price, Request Price and
Request Order Status.
15 December 2000: Request Transaction History, Request Credit Matrix, Post
Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix.

Richard/Maria,

Attached please find the 'treatments' for the various Tokenized reference
periods currently in use for US Nat Gas and US Power.  I believe you will
find these spreadsheets easier to translate than the previous.  Let me know
what you think.  As you've pointed out it is critical that we are both on
the same page when it comes to our treatments of these reference periods;
however, I do believe this is an issue that we can work through together.
I would suggest that we get together again for another couple hours once
you've had the chance to review not only the info I've provided to date but
also the list of Schedule A products that I plan to provide on Wednesday.
As always, feel free to drop me a note or give me a call anytime.

Regards,
David

P.S.  Please keep in mind that the present structure of the TRP's do not
contemplate weekends that breach a calendar month, and holidays.  For
example, a US Nat Gas Day Ahead product (Number XXXX)  being offered after
11:00 a.m. on a Thursday the 27th will provide a TRP Product for Saturday
the 29th, Sunday the 30th, and Monday the 1st. Since our trading areas
would not want to breach the current calendar month, they would create two
date-specific products; Number YYYY for Saturday the 29th through Sunday
the 30th, and Product Number ZZZZ for Monday the 1st.

Power TRP Treatment.xls)(See attached file: West Power TRP Treatment.xls)

A question has come up that may have serious implications for our system.
Please forward to the right person, we would really appreciate it if we
could have a response as soon as possible.

The question is ""How many transaction attempts can be sent by Enron to True
Quote at one time(will Enron be sending more than transaction in a batch)?""
Your documentation seems to read that you may be sending more than one
transaction at a time.  If that is true, then we may have a problem if you
plan to send transaction searches that would force us to cancel all of the
previous transaction attempts that were sent over together, since our system
processes items in sequential order.

Please call me if the question seems confusing.

Subject: FW: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Good morning David,

Here's another clarifying question.  I have in my notes documentation that
says that Enron will do partial fills of transactions sent to EOL. The
question that being asked in the attached note has to do with transactions
sent by EOL to TrueQuote.  Does Enron want (or will Enron accept) partial
fills by the True Quote system? If so, how should we identify (if at all)
that this was a partial fill?

Thanks David.

Subject: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Maria,

Matt raised a question regarding transaction attempts made by Enron Traders
directly against the True Quote system (not going through EOL).  This is a
two scenario question:

1)  If an Enron trader is initiating a buy in the True Quote system against
a counterparty's position to sell at a specified price and volume (ie:
15,000 @ 2.40 - which is currently a valid market in True Quote), at the
point the transaction is being executed in the system, the volume drops to
10,000, would our Enron want to fill whatever quantity they can at the given
price.  Currently we are interpreting all transactions made directly from
Enron into the True Quote system will be entered as a Fill or Kill.
Will Enron allow partial fills of transaction attempts?
Also, should the successful transaction attempt consist of several parties,
will Enron accept this (3 parties of 5,000 each)?
Do we send back a response identifying a FILL for the partial volume and
FAIL for the remaining volume?

2)  Reverse the statement for an attempt of Enron to Sell a volume against a
counterparty's position to buy.  Is Enron willing to sell partial volumes
should the market not be there to fill Enron's order completely?

Chris,

Wayne and I have reviewed this transcript from the conversation with Enron.
During that conversation, several items were to be worked offline.  These
are detailed and are listed as ""To be worked offline"" in Exhibit B, C, D,
and E.

Would you like to have EnFORM participate in your discussion with Enron, or
do you feel that these items are strategically sensitive enough that you
should have this conversation without EnFORM's involvement?

These ""To be worked offline"" issues are very important, but we do have
additional technical questions that would best be addressed by a technical
Enron contact.  If we could begin the process of a establishing a technical
""relationship"" with an individual at Enron as soon as possible, it would
speed development and lower costs of this project.

P.S.  Wayne was next to me as I typed this note.

Regards,
Maria

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------


The following questions were discussed in the telephone conference call with
Enron on September 26th.  We have inserted Enron's answers in Blue and have
highlighted follow-ups and offline discussions in Red.


Questions for Enron to answer regarding True Quote's interface:

High Priority Questions (need to be addressed):
(From Exhibit A) Will the product ID that Enron is transmitting specifically
identify a product offering including commodity, deal type, region /
location, and tradable term (fully qualified begin and end dates)?

Product ID is a fully transactable item - Product, Location, Dates
Product ID is a fully qualified instrument - excluding price, volume and
counterparty
Product ID can be for next day and balance of month.  However, on next to
last day of month, the Product ID will offer either next day or BOM, not
both (there is no reason for redundancy)
Product ID that is for anything, except for the rolling Tokenized
products/dates (example: For a spot month, the Product ID will expire on the
first day of that spot month)
Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute


(From Exhibit B) Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an
Enron product id is a ""Fill or Kill"" transaction, meaning, a transaction
attempt submitted to Enron would not stay in their system if it was not
immediately filled.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will
be immediately removed from Enron's system and could not be filled later if
market conditions made the order viable.

A transaction attempt by TrueQuote will be ""Fill or Kill"" (It will not in
stay in EOL's system)

If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to non-availability of volume,
these volumes need to be expired in the True Quote system

If a transaction attempt fails for ANY reason, Enron will immediately
rebroadcast that Product to the True Quote system

Does True Quote need to design functionality for partial fill of a deal
transaction for an outside entity?

Enron will do partial fills.  The True Quote system needs to design
functionality to accept partial fills from an outside entity.

What is the time threshold for waiting on an Enron response to a transaction
attempt?

Enron will accept whatever True Quote determines is an acceptable threshold
for waiting.

What is the estimated delivery date for Enron's DTDs?

The EnronOnline Exchanges External Interface Document was received on
Monday, October 2, 2000.

Exhibit A (Enron Price Interface-what Enron sends to TQ):

Concerning the Enron price interface, Enron has stated that EOL currently
handles prices/volume updates at the rate of 100 updates per second, growing
potentially to 500 per second (across all EOL product offerings).  Given
this level of update activity, how will the transmission of these updates be
accomplished?  Below are some questions which should clarify these concerns:

What is the expected rate of updates for the sub-set of EOL products that
will be transmitted to the True Quote platform?  Is it expected that these
products will also endure update activity at the rate of 100-500 updates per
second?

Although it was not communicated how often an XML document will be sent, it
was clarified that the XML documents will be sent at certain time
intervals.Each update will contain all information since last time polled
(includes all changes (only changes) since last transmission)
Need to clarify if True Quote will be polling EOL for Updates, or if EOL
will send them automatically at certain time intervals.

Will there be one XML document interface transmission for each Enron product
update, or will one XML document interface contain updates for multiple
Enron products?  The implications of this are as follows:  Will True Quote
need to handle 100-500 XML documents per second, or will True Quote receive
one XML document at a determined interval that has updates for all Enron
products?  If the XML document contains updates for all Enron products, how
often will Enron send us the document?   If it's one XML document per Enron
product, will True Quote be expected to handle 100-500 XML document
submissions per second?

The XML document will contain updates for multiple Product IDs.  If only one
Product ID has changed in EOL since the last transmission, then only one
Product ID will be sent to True Quote in the updates.

Can we confirm that Enron will only submit one price/volume offering per
Enron product id; meaning, Enron will never have multiple price and quantity
offerings for the same Enron product ID on the True Quote platform.

Enron will never send Market Depth for any Product ID.  What you see on EOL
is exactly what is transmitted to True Quote (one offering per Enron Product
ID).  However, each Product ID update will contain both the Bid and the
Offer.

The interface currently does not have a field to define the duration of the
order.  Given this, can we assume that when the price interface submits a
product price/volume update to the True Quote platform, the order will be
loaded with a duration of ""Good Until Canceled"".  True Quote will mark the
order as 'GTC' until Enron submits a new XML document for that Enron product
that changes the status to ""Suspended"".  In this case True Quote would
cancel the order on the True Quote system.

All orders will remain on the True Quote system until the EOL traders pull
the deals.  At this time, EOL would send ""Suspended Status"" for the Product
ID.

How are terms related to Enron Product IDs?  Example:  For a given Enron
commodity, deal type, and location that is traded in October, would a new
product id be created for that same product offering when the month rolls to
November?
 Yes

If product ids do not include a direct relationship to a specific tradable
term, when a Price Interface XML document is submitted to the True Quote
platform, how will True Quote know which trade term the product id is
associated with?
Product IDs do have a direct relationship to a specific tradable term

We are currently assuming that an Enron product id specifically identifies a
product offering including commodity, deal type, region/location, and
tradable term.
This assumption is correct

Can we confirm that all Enron orders transmitted to the True Quote platform
will be cancelled at the end of the day and that all products will be
re-loaded into the True Quote system the following morning?  If not,  will
the assumed 'Good Until Canceled' duration for each product id remain active
until the status has been changed to ""Suspended""?

All EOL orders should be removed by the traders at the end of the day.  For
those that are not removed, True Quote should run a nightly batch job that
removes all EOL orders left in the system.  Each morning, True Quote will
authenticate with EOL, and at this time, all orders on EOL will be
transmitted to True Quote.

Exhibit B (Transaction Interface with Enron):

For each field (across all interfaces), we will need clearly defined data
types (precision, range of length, space/bytes it takes).

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we assume the Bid/Ask flag is an integer? Perhaps a bit?  If it's a
character, what is the character indicator?  B/A?

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we confirm the data type for volume is integer?

This information still needs to be provided.

Across all interfaces, there is not a defined unit of measure for price and
volume by Enron product id.   Should part of the XML DTD specify the unit of
measure for both price and volume, or are we to assume that Enron product
ids for Power are in US dollars and megawatt/hr, and Enron product ids for
natural gas are US dollars and MMBTU?

Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute

Price - how many decimal places? (precision of the number)

This information still needs to be provided.

Volume and Price - Does Enron have an min / max / default increment value
established for price and volume increment ranges by Enron product id?  (For
example, within True Quote the default volume increment for natural gas is
5000, and the price increment is $0.0025.  Both the price and volume
increments, min/max ranges can vary by region or location).

On EOL, the traders determine the minimal tradable increments and the
minimal tradable amounts (this minimums could be as low as 1).

To be worked Offline:
How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron, if trader
has a minimum greater than entities are willing to participate, how do we
display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)


Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an Enron product id
is a ""Fill or Kill"" transaction, meaning, a transaction attempt submitted to
Enron would not stay in their system if it was not immediately filled.  If
the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will be immediately removed
from Enron's system and could not be filled later if market conditions made
the order viable.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to
non-availability of volume, these volumes need to be expired in the True
Quote system.

Already answered above.

Will Enron allow partial fill of transactions?   For example, if the Enron
price interface submits an offer with 20,000 mmbtu available, can True Quote
submit a transaction bid attempt to take only 10,000 mmbtu of the Enron
offer?   If not, is it a valid assumption that we can only submit a
transaction attempt to lift the entire Enron offer of 20,000 mmbtu?

Enron will allow partial fills.

Exhibit C (True Quote Price Interface-what TQ sends to Enron):
Does Enron expect True Quote to submit a single price point offering for an
Enron product id that is the aggregate total volume of all orders available
for that product id on the True Quote platform at the best available price?
This would allow Enron to submit a transaction attempt against the True
Quote platform, submitting a volume request that would potentially sweep
multiple counter parties creating deals with all entities necessary to
satisfy transaction attempt.
Alternative 2:  Does Enron expect True Quote to submit only the best
individual order (the best price and volume for an Enron product id from
only one counterparty) identified by its True Quote order id (True Quote
would not transmit the counter party id; however, before sending the XML
interface to Enron, the counterparty would have to pass the credit rules
maintained in the counterparty credit matrix on the True Quote platform).
Alternative 3:  Would Enron expect True Quote to submit multiple price
offerings per Enron product id (a market depth of various price and volume
offerings).  In this scenario, the volume associated with each price point
should be an aggregate of multiple True Quote orders (as shown in the True
Quote market screen).  The XML interface could potentially transmit
individual True Quote orders and their associated volumes (not an aggregate
volume of multiple orders); however, giving Enron the ability to 'pick and
choose' individual orders could potentially violate True Quote customer
service agreements that require deals to be executed in the chronological
sequence that the order request was received by the True Quote platform.

Enron wants to see the granularity of each True Quote Product ID order.
Enron expects True Quote to submit multiple price offerings per Enron
Product ID.  (Example:  If  True Quote has an order in the system for
100,000 MMbtu's at $3.00, which is comprised of 10 individual orders of
10,000, Enron wants True Quote to send all of the individual orders).

To be worked Offline:
Fair and equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of
orders without bias)
Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions
Need to clarify with Enron whether they want to receive the best price in
the market for a given Product ID, or if they want to see all of a given
Product ID's market depth.

Our concern is that if True Quote transmits individual True Quote orders and
their associated volumes (not an aggregate volume of multiple orders),
giving Enron the ability to 'pick and choose' individual orders, this could
potentially violate True Quote customer service agreements that require
deals to be executed in the chronological sequence that the order request
was received by the True Quote platform.


Exhibit D (Sponsor Transaction Interface):
Are we correct in assuming that transactions posted by Enron traders against
True Quote deals will be executed on the True Quote system?  Will the
duration of the order attempts being sent to True Quote be ""Fill or Kill"" or
some other duration?

To be worked Offline:
The traders will want to transact against True Quote directly without
adjusting the market position through EOL, but how this is accomplished will
be to be discussed.

Exhibit E (Counterparty Interface):
In general, we need more details about what Enron will be sending as part of
their daily counterparty credit / term interface, as well as the intra-day
counterparty credit/term interface:
Currently, exhibit E does not specific any fields or data types within an
XML DTD.
What are the ""terms"" under which participants can trade with Enron?  For
example, will the level of restriction include volumetric limits, financial
limits, tradable date range limits (number days or months into the future)
by Enron product id (assuming a product id specifically defines a commodity,
deal-type, region/location, and tradable term).  Will Enron send us a 'yes /
no' flag to turn off/on a counterparty's ability to trade with Enron by the
Enron product id?

To be worked Offline:
Credit terms and counterparty interface details were not addressed in the
teleconference.  The details of granularity will need to addressed to better
understand the responsibilities that True Quote will have in handling
Enron's credit structure.


Questions for True Quote to Answer:

Exhibit D:  Does the Sponsor Transaction interface (Enron proposing
transactions on the True Quote platform) still invoke the Enron Transaction
Interface?  There was some discussion that if internal Enron traders
proposed transactions against the True Quote platform, the point of
transaction would be the True Quote platform, and True Quote would not have
to invoke the transaction on the EOL platform.  True Quote would simply
confirm whether the Enron transaction attempt succeeded or failed.  If it
succeeded, True Quote would send a confirmation XML interface to confirm the
deal had been executed and transmit the True Quote Deal ID to Enron.
What is the time threshold for waiting on Enron's response to a transaction
attempt?  For example, after 'n' seconds the True Quote platform should
alert a system operator that an Enron transaction attempt has failed to
return either a confirmation or failure.

Please respond to the questions above.

Thank you.

* Product ID
* Product ID is a fully transactable item  and fully qualified instrument -
Includes: Product, Location, Dates; Excludes: Price, Volume and Couterparty
* Tokenized Dates:  Product ID for next day and balance of month are
tokenized dates which means that the product ID will remain the same for
designated date range (next day, next 2 days, BOM, etc).  The dates will
role, but the product ID will remain the same
* Product IDs for anything but the rolling Tokenized products/dates (i.e. -
spot month), expire after date has been reached.
* There will be no redundancy of product IDs that encompass the same date
ranges (i.e.:  there are usually two separate product IDs for next day and
balance of month, but when the next to the last day of the month is reached,
both will reference the same day.  At this point, Enron will only have one
product ID associated with the given date range)
* Enron has set up product IDs to adequately reflect Weekend trading on
Friday (deals entered for Saturday will encompass Sat - Mon (and include
extra days when Holidays are involved))
* Once a strip term has been reached, trades within the month then change to
the tokenized product IDs.
* Enron will Fill or Kill all transaction attempts - they will execute or
cancel the trade immediately
* Enron will Partial fills transaction attempts
* When True Quote sends a request for a transaction, the threshold for
waiting on a response from Enron will be defined by True Quote.
* Trade failure will re-broadcast product (failure for any reason)
* If for any reason there is a concern about a product, True Quote can
request (HTTP) validation of the product in question
* Frequency of updates:  Enron will send True Quote a document that contains
all information since last time polled (includes all changes (only changes)
since last transmission)
* Every product sent will have only one bid and offer price associated with
it at time of transmission.  What you see on EOL is what is sent to True
Quote.
* There will be no market depth transmitted to True Quote from Enron
* Duration of orders
* Orders will be displayed on True Quote until suspended by traders
* All orders will remain on system until traders pull deals
* True Quote session is finite (7 -7).  At the end of every day all deals
will be removed from True Quote (either by Enron traders removing them, or
TRUE QUOTE will run a batch job to clear Enron deals).  In the morning, TRUE
QUOTE will authenticate and all products will be loaded from Enron to TRUE
QUOTE.
* The Currency and Unit of measure are implied as part of Product ID, it's
not an attribute.
* Granularity of orders transmitted from True Quote to Enron will show each
order associated with each price and volume of a Product ID (i.e. 100,000
mmbtu @ $5 is made up of 10 separate orders of 10,000, Enron would like to
see all 10 orders of 10,000 - including counterparty information)
* Transaction attempts made from True Quote to EOL - Point of execution will
be on EOL
* Transaction attempts made by Enron Traders against True Quote price
postings will be executed on True Quote

Offline:
* Will we know if a transaction has failed due to volume not available,
credit failure, or Enron has not heard of the transaction
* How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron; if trader
has a minimum tradable volume greater than entities are willing to
participate (i.e. Enron minimum tradable amount is 10,000 or 15,000) how do
we display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)
* If we transmit to Enron the granularity of all orders (including
counterparty information), how will True Quote / Enron ensure the fair and
equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of orders
without bias)
* Business question: how much do we want to send Enron (they are ok with
sending each order for all price points in an instrument), do we show top 1
or top 5?
* Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions

Maria,

Please confirm with David that NO partial fills refers *only* to transaction
attempts.  We fully expect that Enron will send us (potentially) large
volumes via. the price posting interface; then, we may execute multiple
transaction attempts for that EOL product ID to Enron via. the transaction
attempt interface.  These individual transaction attempts could be much
smaller (in volume) than the volume posted via. the price posting interface.

Basically, the way we understand it is... the individual transaction
attempts will be 'all or nothing'; however, we can break the large price
post down and transmit multiple (smaller) transaction attempts against that
large price post volume.

I believe we are all in agreement on this, but it never hurts to be
absolutely sure concerning something of this magnitude and importance.

Thanks,

-Stewart

I've spoken the David Fisher at Enron this morning.  The conference call
will Andy Zipper and Jay Webb cannot be arranged until next Thursday (Dec.
14). David will send details later.

David has asked us to assume that there will be NO partial fills on either
side. He believes that even if they agree to do this it will likely be a
""day 2"" enhancement and not a functionality that is part of the January 5th
deliverables. He is also requesting that we focus on completing the
functionality that will allow Enron to post prices on True Quote and will
allow True Quote to execute transactions on EOL.  In addition, another
priority needs to be to have the credit functionality completed.  These are
going to be the requirements that need to be tested by December 18th and
need to be in production by January 5th.

True Quote's ability to send prices to Enron and accept transaction attempts
from EOL is secondary at this point and not likely to be a requirement that
needs to be met by January 5th.

Please let me know if there is any reason why the execution engine will not
be ready to accept price posts from EOL and send transaction requests
(assuming only full orders will be filled) by December 18th.  If there is
any concern about getting credit functioning within that timeframe, please
let me know this as soon as possible, as well.  Thanks for all of your help.
You all are key contributors to this project and without your awesome
knowledge and skills, we would never be able to complete this project in the
timeframe that we're being asked to complete it in.  I really appreciate
your efforts.

Stew & Richard,

I would be surprised if Enron was willing to store the minimum qty, but what
about sending it in the transaction request as an additional attribute?
Might they be talked into that?  This would be better for us since we should
not have to worry about maintaining our system information on the Enron
platform.

How about proposing that both platforms send the min & increment volume
requirements?  This would be more complex for us now, but might be better in
the long run for both platforms.  We would be more flexible and better able
to integrate with outside systems if we were able to accept this type of
information.  It get complicated because you could only fill where the two
requirements (our and the outside system) were compatible, but it is
do-able.  Thoughts?

Dennis &  Chris...

One other EOL scenario we forgot to talk about this evening was the scenario
where:

1)  EOL post 20,000 / day to our platform via. the price post interface...
2)  A True Quote customer submits a request to do 15,000 / day...
3) TQ submits a transaction attempt to EOL for 15,000 day...
4)  EOL only has 14,000 remaining, so they deny the entire transaction
attempt...

However, if Enron's system was aware that we would take partially filled Gas
orders in minimum increments of 5,000, EOL could have partially filled the
transaction request for 10,000.

Any news on that scenario?  I'll talk to Maria first thing in the morning...
perhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's
best business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always
fill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.
However, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the
entire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume
with the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled us,
we would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a new
transaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep
for the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.

I haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if
EOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably
be no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL
denies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the
EOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next available
counterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially filled
us, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for the
full volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume
they confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different
counterparty.  Only one additional deal would have to be created with the
next available counterparty to fill the last 5,000 of the original request.
Seems simply enough... and it would be in EOL's best interest to fill our
transaction attempts partially so they would complete our transaction
attempts more often....   if they don't fill us partially, EOL will probably
end-up denying many of our transaction attempts if the exact volume is not
available.  hmm.... what do ya'll think?

Maria,

Stewart is correct in his understanding of no parital fills.  I will
reiterate his statements through the following examples:

If Enron posts a gas product with 50,000 MMBTU available and TrueQuote
attempts a transaction on 30,000 MMBTU, the attempt will be successfull if
the following 3 criteria are met:

1.  30,000 MMBTU is still available when the transaction hits EOL.
2.  30,000 MMBTU meets the minimum volume for the product as set by the
trader.
3.  30,000 MMBTU meets the increment volume for the product as set by the
trader.

Examples of how the 3 criteria above come into play:

1.  If when TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU, the volume
available for the product drops to below 30,000 MMBTU, the transaction will
fail.
2.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set the minimum volume for the product to 40,000 MMBTU, the transaction
will fail.
3.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 32,500 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set 5,000 MMBTU increments, the transaction will fail.

I set-up a meeting with Jay Webb and Andy Zipper for next Friday.  That is
the earliest we all could meet.  Once we talk, I'll coordinate a conference
call with you.  For the time being let's stay the course.

Regards,
David

Subject:  One other item about Enron...

Dennis &  Chris...

One other EOL scenario we forgot to talk about this evening was the
scenario
where:

1)  EOL post 20,000 / day to our platform via. the price post interface...
2)  A True Quote customer submits a request to do 15,000 / day...
3) TQ submits a transaction attempt to EOL for 15,000 day...
4)  EOL only has 14,000 remaining, so they deny the entire transaction
attempt...

However, if Enron's system was aware that we would take partially filled
Gas
orders in minimum increments of 5,000, EOL could have partially filled the
transaction request for 10,000.

Any news on that scenario?  I'll talk to Maria first thing in the
morning...
perhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's
best business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always
fill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.
However, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the
entire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume
with the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled
us,
we would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a
new
transaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep
for the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.

I haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if
EOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably
be no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL
denies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the
EOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next
available
counterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially
filled
us, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for
the
full volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume
they confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different
counterparty.  Only one additional deal would have to be created with the
next available counterparty to fill the last 5,000 of the original request.
Seems simply enough... and it would be in EOL's best interest to fill our
transaction attempts partially so they would complete our transaction
attempts more often....   if they don't fill us partially, EOL will
probably
end-up denying many of our transaction attempts if the exact volume is not
available.  hmm.... what do ya'll think?

"By now, most of you have heard about the FirstEnergy Settlement, underwhich 
FE will recover as best we can ascertain at this time, all of its stranded 
costs.  Key components of the setllement include:

1. FE makes 1120 mw of power available at a price that varies by customer 
class and increases gradually over the 5 years.  (The price does not include 
line losses which the Company agreed to throw in if another marketer signs on 
- none did),  The market price is also the shopping credit.  The  shopping 
incentive is then added to the credit . The shopping credit for residential 
and commercial customers is low but could possibly work pending analysis from 
structuring.  The industrial credit is very low.

2. Customers on special contracts (approximately 800 of them), can during the 
first year either opt to cancel their contract or extend it through the RTC 
recovery period, which is unlawful in my view, although that observation did 
not slow anyone down.

3.  The settlement creates an implicit cap on shopping of 20% since the 
Company will seek to have the incentive removed once the 20% is reached.  The 
agreement states that if the incentive is not removed, then customers will 
pay for the incentive as a deferral which will extend the recovery period.  
This too is also unlawful because it allows the recovery of generation 
related costs beyond the market development period.

4.  Barring extension of the shopping incentive and other caveats, the RTC 
rolls off on December 31, 2006 for Ohio Edison, June 30th, 2007 for Toledo 
Edison and December 31, 2008 for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company.

5.  Distribution rates are frozen until 2007.

6. There is a 5% residential rate cut.

7. FE absorbs the pancaking charges for power coming through PJM and MISO 
until the RTO is up and running.

This settlement is basically political.  Over the past several weeks, FE has 
cut a host of sidebar deals with each of the intervenors and customers who 
signed on to this travesty.  When the parties were assembled for settlement 
talks, they lasted 2 days before parties surrendered their litigation 
positions.  The hearing schedule is equally aggregious.  Coincidentally, the 
hearing examiners had a schedule in mind that was extremely similar to FE.  
Our testimony is due on April 24 with no further discovery prior to its 
filing.  The testimony of FE and defenders of the Stip is due on April 26.  
We then have 3 days for depositions with supplemental or rebuttal testimony 
being a big IF.  The hearing commences May 2.

The parties who thought it was fine to give FE $8.9 billion without 
quantification or review are Consumers Counsel, Staff, Industrial Users, 
Retail Merchants, Low income (some), Ohio Manufacturers, Shell Energy, 
Kroger, AK Steel, Ohio Hospital Association.

Those fighting the stipulation are all the other marketers, the Cleveland 
Growth Association, the City of Cleveland, Citizens Action, Citizens Power,  
Safe Energy Communications Council.

By separate e-mail, Laurie Knight will send you the shopping credit and 
shopping incentive numbers.  Also, if you would like a copy of the 
settlement, please let Laurie know.

Two final points.  We are doing everything we can to try to improve or derail 
acceptance of the settlement, although it appears to be a fait accompli.  
Second, the stage has been set for similar type negotiations with the other 
utilities

Please pass this memo along to anyone else who you think has an interest in 
knowing this information.

Thanks,
Janine

Statement by Governor George W. Bush

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  Our nation
watched as we were all reminded on a daily basis of the importance of
each and every vote.  We were reminded of the strength of our democracy
- that while our system is not always perfect, it is fundamentally
strong and far better than any other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount and yet
another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are honored and humbled
to have won the state of Florida, which gives us the needed electoral
votes to win the election.  We will therefore undertake the
responsibility of preparing to serve as America's next President and
Vice President.

Statement by James A. Baker III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in this very
room that the election process in - Florida and in the country as a
whole - needed to conclude with fairness and finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about what was at
stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable end to the process of
counts, challenges and contests if it slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

Statement by Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford
Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job that you
and your office have done during these last almost three weeks since the
election.

This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty. But we
got the job done, and we got it done right. People called me and
say--particularly from out of state--and say what's going on down in
Florida, and I have to keep reminding people, the only thing that's
going on here is that we've got a razor-thin election for the most
important job in the world.

And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the anguish,
we've just got a close election. And any state that had to go through
this would've had the same problems, I think, that we have had.

But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the important
word there, ""should."" You know, Yogi Berra once said, ``It's not over
till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a winner, and it's time
to move on.

There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have enough
legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas. But one thing the
lawyers can't do for us and one thing the courts can't do for us: They
can't bring this country together again.

And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight, it's
going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this country together
again, and I hope we can get on with that work soon.

And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.

Reaction to Governor Bush's Statement

RE: What Gore needs to consider:
""The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and that Gore
requested.  Bush still won counting with Gore's rules... [Gore has] to
consider where reasonable people in the center are going to look at
this, and say, 'Guys you had your shot, the count, the recount - they
changed the rules for you and you still did not win.'  It's time to be
magnanimous.

RE: Governor Bush's Speech: ""...the tone...was perfect...

""There was a persistence and a determination in what [Governor Bush]
said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory.  It was the first kind of
conciliatory speech that anybody has given in this, and that probably
goes to peoples hearts.""

        - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00

Gore Just Spinning About Supreme Court Says Expert
Fox News Channel, 11/26/00

Fox News' Brit Hume: ""...does the Gore team not have something to work
with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court coming up on
Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of continuing, a sort of
unfinality if such a word exists.""

National Journal's Stuart Taylor: ""...Unless I'm missing something that
is completely hollow spin.  There is nothing what so ever, I think-that
the Supreme Court of the United States can do for Al Gore.  They could
do some things for George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do
anything except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.
But I don't think he's in the position to say, ""Oh by the way could you
order some more recounts?""  So I think there is nothing, if...Gore runs
out of ammunition.  Which I think he may well do, before the Supreme
Court of the United States gets to a hearing.  I think he has to give
up, because there's nothing...""

______________________________________________

Call To Action

Florida tonight certified the votes cast in the Presidential Election,
giving it's 25 electoral votes to George W. Bush.

George W. Bush won the vote on election day and won the mandated recount.
He won on November 17, after the inclusion of the overseas ballots.  Now he
has won after the manual recount as directed by the Florida Supreme Court,
and the results have been certified.

If you believe this election should end and that endless lawsuits are not
good for our country, please call your Congressman
and Senator, regardless of their party affiliation, and tell them that Al
Gore should concede!

Subject: Invitation to present at Risk's advanced stress testing course



I would like to invite you to present a section on  Risk's course entitled, 
""Practical application of advanced stress  testing"" which will be held in 
London (5 & 6 February 2001)  and New York (12 & 13 February 2001).
?
You have been recommended to me in the course of my  research as an authority 
in this field so I would be delighted for you to  present any of the sections 
that are still available on the attached  programme:

For London: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 4 and  
For New York: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 4 and 8

My market research indicates that advanced stress  testing is a highly 
interesting theme for a wide range of senior quantitative  analysts and risk 
managers. I anticipate the course to be technical and  practical in nature 
and assume a high level of knowledge from the delegates. It  aims to extend 
the scope of accepted practices into the new areas of liquidity  and credit 
risk stress testing and complement VaR methods by introducing new  risk 
measurement techniques that can be applied in an integrated  context.
?
Please contact me as soon as possible with an indication of which section  is 
most suitable for your current interests. If you feel that you will not be  
able to participate on this occasion, I would welcome any speaker 
suggestions  you may have. Please call me if you have any questions.

Discuss if there is value in having a GPG Pre-Implementation Review . 
"Transaction Support Accounting met with Jack Boatman and Rachel Cady yesterday to discuss their notification below
as related to a tie-in for the Phase V project.:

	""On March 1st and 2nd our Phase V crew will be working the 24"" and 36"" mainline to tie-in the Gulf South Mobile Bay interconnect.  This work will require that Transco Citronelle to be partially shut-in on March 1st and completely shut-in on the 2nd. In order to maintain delivery pressures in the Market Area  during this work we will have to borrow(defer exchange) gas up to 220,000/day from Bay Gas Storage at an estimated cost of about $80,000 to $100,000.

This cost to complete the tie-in is quite unique since we are only paying to borrow the gas and we wanted to notify you about this cost so you can start thinking about how to include it in the work order for the Phase V tie-in.""

Meeting Conclusion:
	The ""borrowed gas"" if used will be a part of the OBA at the interconnect and will be repaid within the month. - No Gas Acctg. 	Issues or follow-up items.  Jack indicated they previously discussed with Rate Dept.

	The $80,000-$100,000 cost estimate is the fee to be paid to Bay Gas to be ready to perform during the const. period.
		To Do's:
		John Cobb to review construction costs treatment for this fee with Jim Saunders.
		(Subject to Jim's approval this fee may be capitalized as an indirect cost of the project since it is incurred
		 due to the required construction tie-in and is only for the construction period.)
			
		Jack Boatman to contact Jim Alexander relative to this additional Phase V costs.

		Separate discussion required to discuss the purchases of linepack and purge gas."

"Scott,

Structuring got back to us with some issues we need to clarify to get the 
pricing from a trader.

Capacity
 - Will Calpine be able to get manufacturer's guarantee for net capacity (or 
can we re-sell turbines to third party?)
 - Is it ""unit contingent call"" or there will be a ""liquidated damage 
protection"" within the tolling agreement?

Nodal pricing
 - What is the exact name of substation in eastern PJM? Structuring could not 
find ""Parlin"" in eastern PJM (even within eastern PJM, there will a 
substantial pricing differential among different bus points).

Gas delivery point

Actually, it is really hard to get the number by today since a trader who 
will give pricing is not here today. If we don't hear from you or/and if you 
don't decide yet about above issues, we will make assumptions as follow;

- Capacity: 180 MW out of 4 LM-6000 turbine with manufacturer's guarantee and 
with term of liquidated damage protection included.
- Exact substation: East Hub in PJM
- Gas delivery point: Transco Zone 6

We will try to get the pricing hopefully by tomorrow. Please call me at 
713-853-7330, if you have any question. Thank you.

"Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

"If we did sign it prior to getting bank approval, we would likely have to 
make the WIC portion of the release, subject to the bank approval.  Otherwise 
Huber could be put into the position of having the obligations but being 
unable to complete it obligation due to a WIC process out of Huber's 
control.  But assuming that was done, I don't see why we couldn't sign the 
agreement now.

I spoke with Steve Saye at WIC today and he said that they interpret the 
tarrif to read that a release done at the full negotiated contract rate is 
the same as the maximum rate. Therefore we can release at the $.12 rate.  He 
also stated that he would begin the approval process with the banks for the 
release but thought that there would be no problem with Huber's credit.  He 
did state that the bank approval timing was out of his control but he would 
try to expedite it. In addition, he felt that the best way to do the release 
was to do it  with the first bidder meeting minimum terms and have Huber 
ready to take it.  He said that it would not have to be noticed ahead of time 
so noone would know that it was going  to hit the board.

My question is, can we get the contract with Huber signed prior to receiving 
the bank approval for the WIC peice?

"Sally - Plse see the attached summary that Risk Ops prepares for 
Frevert/Sherriff/Brown on Enron Europe every week.  Do your business unit 
controllers prepare something like this for the Americas, EGM, & EIM that we 
could use in our weekly briefing to Rick Buy?  What's happening is we try to 
prepare our own analysis of the trading P/L, and it really doesn't make much 
sense to do that since Ops is probably already doing it.  I'd love to get 
looped in to similar analyses for the other business units.  Also, do you 
know who I'd contact in  EES?  I'll call Barry Pearce for EBS.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Subject: Re: Rick Buy report  


Attached is a copy of the latest European Trading Summary. 
As this report contains the same information as the Rick Buy report, I 
suggested to Ted that we stop duplicating work and simply use this report.



The report is usually produced on Monday mornings UK time, so should be ready 
when the Rick gets in the office.
People to contact wrt co-ordination are, Michael Kass or his superior James 
New.

Please let me know if this report will be used in this week's Rick Buy report.

Subject: Ops Weekly Update

Ted mentioned to me that you guys receive or participate or just know of some 
type of weekly Enron Europe update on Fridays for Sherriff??? or some top guy 
over there, and that Risk Operations (New/Jordan etc.) prepare a report for 
that update.  Meanwhile, back in Houston we (MRM) independently prepare a 
weekly update for Rick Buy on Thursdays.  I'd like to get a copy of the 
report done last week, and talk to whoever in MRM participates, if anyone 
does, or if it's just Ops then whoever that is.  I think Ted was thinking we 
could leverage off this report and maybe move Rick Buy's weekly update back a 
day to coincide.

Do you know what I'm talking about?  Or should I talk to Lloyd or Oliver? I'd 
like to discuss after the morning meeting tomorrow if you have a minute - 
maybe you can also fax or e-mail the report?  

Thanks,
Cassandra.

That's a good idea, everybody likes salad and it would go good with sandwiches.
We could also make some bakes beans.  It would be like a barbacue/.  Ham
,polish sausage, macaroni salad and baked beans.  That wouild really make for
an interesting afternoon.  That will make sure Mrs. Alberg stays upstairs.

 I have reviewed the attached form of contract.  My comments are that a 
limitation of liability section similar to section 13.2 from the Duke form 
should be added and that (ii) of Section X (C0) be deleted unless the company 
can make the warranty relating to all gas being ultimately consumed in 
Texas.  Please call if you need anything further.

FUTURE OF REGULATION
ILLINOIS
Legislation to rewrite telecom law introduced

Several legislators yesterday introduced HB 492/SB 134 to rewrite the
telecom article of the state's Public Utilities Act, which expires July
1.  Connect Illinois, an advocacy group that counts Ameritech-Illinois
as one of its members, joined the legislators in a news conference
yesterday announcing the bill.

The major objectives of the legislation are to (1) guarantee consumers
that prices for basic residential service always remain affordable, (2)
allow the marketplace to increase competitive choices for business and
broadband services, (3) give concise legislative direction to the future
role of the state Commerce Commission, (4) modernize ICC communications
rules to permit them access to the latest information, (5) require
network unbundling for all carriers and cable ""open access,"" and (6)
create an atmosphere that encourages technological investment and
deployment.

The bill would establish a two-year rate freeze, with future increases
capped below the rate of inflation.  It also would deregulate optional
services, such as call waiting and Caller ID.

The sponsors of SB 134 are Sens. Steve Rauschenberger (R., Elgin) and
Denny Jacobs (D., East Moline).  Reps. Steve Davis (D., Bethalto) and
Art Tenhouse (R., Liberty) sponsored HB 492.

The legislation is available at
http://www.legis.state.il.us/legisnet/legisnet92/hbgroups/hb/920HB0492LV.html.

TAXATION
HAWAII
Bill would extend franchise tax to telecom, cable TV businesses

Rep. Calvin K.Y. Say (D., District 18) has introduced HB 1180, which
would amend the state franchise tax to include telephone, telecom, and
cable TV businesses.  Those businesses would have to pay 2.5% of their
gross receipts for the preceding calendar year.

HB 1180 awaits consideration by the House Consumer Protection and
Commerce Committee and the House Finance Committee.

STATE & LOCAL GOVERNMENT
MICHIGAN
Group begins work on telecom plan

The Michigan Economic Development Corp. (MEDC) has begun gathering
information to develop a telecommunications plan for the state, a
corporation representative told TR.   MEDC is quasi-governmental agency.

The MEDC's executive committee directed the corporation to begin work on
the plan to learn how Michigan can develop its telecom industry and
infrastructure.  The executive committee didn't set any timeframe for
when it would like the plan completed, the representative said.

The MEDC is in the very early stages of developing the plan and hasn't
defined specifically what issues it will address yet.  Mostly, the group
is gathering information about what other states are doing in this area,
the representative explained.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT
PENNSYLVANIA
Carrier fined $50,000 for failing to post surcharge notice on pay phones

One Call Communications Inc., d/b/a Opticom, has agreed to pay a $50,000
civil penalty for failing to post notice of a surcharge it had been
assessing on intrastate calls made from pay phones.  Public Utility
Commission regulations require notice of such surcharges to be posted in
plain view on the pay phone.

The commission said its prosecutory staff confirmed reports of the
violations during an informal investigation.  The company said it was
unaware of the posting requirement.  The PUC said local exchange
carriers (LECs) own some of the pay phones served by Opticom and won't
let the company place stickers on the phones.

According to the staff, Opticom immediately posted notification stickers
where it could and ceased assessing the surcharge on calls made from LEC
pay phones on which it couldn't post stickers.

The commission said the $50,000 fine, which the company agreed to in a
proposed settlement with staff, was sufficient given the company's
cooperation during the investigation.  The PUC tentatively has agreed to
adopt the settlement.  It asked for comments on the settlement by Feb.
13.  (Docket no. M-00011449 Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission v.
Opticom Division of One Call Communications)

CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
KANSAS
Bill would prohibit 'slamming'

The House Committee on Utilities has recommended the passage of a bill
that would prohibit changing or adding to a customer's telecom services
without authorization.  HB 2099 would prohibit carriers from directing a
local exchange carrier to change a subscriber's carrier without
obtaining the subscriber's permission beforehand.  Carriers requesting
such a change would be responsible for proving through a ""preponderance
of the evidence"" that the consumer authorized the transaction.

HB 2009 also would prohibit providers from engaging in any activity that
could mislead the subscriber while soliciting or confirming a carrier
change.  In addition, the bill would prohibit the use of sweepstakes
entries as a form of authorization to switch a consumer's carrier or add
supplemental services to the consumer's account.

Violations of HB 2009 would be punishable by civil penalties of between
$5,000 and $20,000 per offense.  Individuals could bring a private
action against any party they believed had violated HB 2009.

HB 2009's text is available at
http://www.ink.org/public/legislative/bills.cgi/bill/2002/2099.pdf.

INTERNET
TEXAS
Sen. Carona aims to enact UETA

Sen. John J. Carona (R., District 16) has introduced SB 393 to enact the
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which would make electronic
signatures and records legally equivalent to traditional signatures and
records.  The bill wouldn't require the use of electronic records and
signatures but would uphold their use when both parties involved in a
transaction agreed to conduct business electronically.

SB 393 also wouldn't preempt requirements in other laws regarding the
posting of a record.  In addition, electronic records wouldn't be
enforceable if the sender prevented the recipient from storing or
printing them.  The Department of Information Resources would specify
the manner in which state agencies could use electronic records.

SB 393 has been referred to the Senate Business and Commerce Committee.
Its text is available at
http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/77r/billtext/SB00393I.HTM.

UNIVERSAL SERVICE
SOUTH DAKOTA
Bill would create universal service fund

Several legislators have introduced SB 232 to establish a state
universal service fund (USF).  The Public Utilities Commission would
have to establish rules governing administration of the USF by Oct. 1.
It would have to implement the fund by Jan. 1, 2002.

Sens. Kenneth D. Albers (R., District 16) and Gil Koetzle (D., District
15) and Reps. Mike Jaspers (R., District 11) and James Bradford (D.,
District 27) introduced the measure.  It has been referred to the Senate
Committee on State Affairs.

ADVANCED SERVICES
HAWAII
Bill would set up cable TV access infrastructure plan

Sen. Les Ihara Jr. (D., District 10) has introduced SB 1536, which would
require the director of commerce and consumer affairs to develop a
statewide cable TV access infrastructure plan that would aim to
distribute more equally the costs associated with public, educational,
or government cable TV channels.  The plan could include establishing a
statewide fund from cable TV franchise fees to provide funds for the
needs of the cable TV access infrastructure.

SB 1536 awaits consideration by the Senate Economic Development and
Technology Committee and the Senate Ways and Means Committee.

SECTION 251/252
TEXAS
PUC to hear Supra complaint against SW Bell

The Public Utility Commission has scheduled an April 9 hearing to
consider the merits of a case filed by Supra Telecommunications and
Information Systems, Inc., against Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.
(7/20/00 p.m.)  Supra filed the complaint because SW Bell denied Supra's
request to collocate a Lucent Technologies, Inc., host switch in SW
Bell's Dallas Taylor central office.

SW Bell says it denied Supra's request because the FCC's advanced
service order and section 51.323 rule don't require incumbent local
exchange carriers to collocate equipment that will be used ""solely for
switching purposes.""  (Docket no. 22797 - Complaint and Request for
Expedited Relief and Interim Ruling of Supra Telecommunications and
Information Systems, Inc., Against Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. and
for Resolution of Dispute)

NETWORK MANAGEMENT
NEW YORK
Bill would exempt coin calls from excise tax

Sen. James W. Wright (R., District 46) has introduced SB 1086 to exempt
coin-sent-paid calls from the state's 2.5% telecom excise tax.  Other
calls made from pay phones wouldn't be exempt.

Sen. Wright's staff said the revenue generated by coin calls is minimal
and likely exceeds the cost of administering the tax.  The staff also
found that the majority of pay phone providers are small businesses, and
their cost of calculating, collecting, and accounting for the tax is a
""substantial burden.""

The bill has been assigned to the Committee on Energy and
Telecommunications.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT
IDAHO
PUC holds off on area code public hearings

The Public Utilities Commission has decided to wait until late spring to
hold public hearings on a possible new area code in Idaho.  ""By late
May, the new forecast will give us a better indication of when Idaho
will run out of phone numbers for the '208' area code.  With that
information, we can better set the timetable needed to get public input
on how best to put the new area code in service,"" the commission said.

The commission staff told TR that North American Number Planning
administrator NeuStar, Inc., plans to issue a revised forecast for the
208 area code in May.  Earlier projections said the state would need a
new area code in the first quarter 2003.  The staff said requests for
new telephone numbers have slowed down, which could delay the need to
implement a new area code.

Rep. Eric Hamakawa (D., District 3) has introduced a bill to extend the
offense of forgery in the second degree to include the unlawful use of
the signature device of another individual to create an electronic
signature of that person.  HB 154 would add the offense to the state's
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

HB 154 awaits consideration by the Consumer Protection and Commerce
Committee and the Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs Committee.

BERKELEY AND COLUMBIA ANNOUNCE JOINT EXECUTIVE MBA PROGRAM
The Haas School and Columbia Business School are jointly launching their 
new Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA program this fall. The new program is 
being marketed by both schools across the nation starting this week.

The Berkeley Columbia EMBA blends the distinctive strengths of the two 
schools: Wall Street and Silicon Valley, New York and California. Aimed at 
a select group of high-level executives, the new program will enroll its 
first class in June 2002.

The marketing launch of the EMBA program, which was originally scheduled 
for the week of September 11 was delayed due to the terrorist attacks in 
New York and Washington, is commencing now and will continue into spring 
2002. The EBMA program places a major emphasis on drawing applicants from 
the west coast. Information sessions for prospective applicants across the 
nation start on November 7 and will continue through February.

Information sessions will be held throughout California and western states 
as well as New York, east coast states, and the Midwest.
Upcoming information sessions in California include:
    Berkeley, Nov. 7, 6:00 to 7:30 pm
    Los Angeles, Nov. 28, 5:00 to 6:30 pm
    Oakland, Nov. 29, 5:00 to 6:30 pm
    San Francisco, Nov. 30, 8:00 to 9:00 am
    San Jose, Dec. 4, 5:00 to 6:30 pm
    Sacramento, Dec. 11, 8:00 to 9:00 am
    Orange County, Dec. 13, 8:00 to 9:30 am
    San Diego, Dec. 14, 8:00 to 9:30 am

For more detailed information on these and other events, please go to the 
web site at:
http://web.haas.berkeley.edu/embaadmissions/events/index.cfm.

The EMBA curriculum will offer participants fresh insights into the complex 
forces of global, financial, technological and entrepreneurial changes that 
are transforming the business world. It leverages the schools' locations in 
two of the world's most important business centers - New York City and the 
San Francisco/Silicon Valley area.

""In today's turbulent business environment, executives must possess 
outstanding management skills and a keen understanding of the rapidly 
changing nature of the economy and business world,"" said Haas School Dean 
Laura Tyson. ""This unique educational partnership will develop leaders with 
the requisite vision and skills for success.""

Designed to accommodate the busy executive, the Berkeley-Columbia EMBA 
features a convenient schedule of 15 weeks of instruction over 19 months 
alternating between New York and Berkeley. The bi-coastal curriculum, 
taught by the faculty of these two premier institutions, will offer broad, 
general management courses with a strategic perspective, including a series 
of cutting-edge electives in areas such as IT strategy and international 
finance.

Companies sponsoring promising executives in the Berkeley-Columbia EMBA 
will see immediate benefits from the program, as participants are 
encouraged to apply cutting-edge concepts to their workplace.

In addition to receiving MBA degrees from both Columbia Business School and 
UC Berkeley, participants will benefit from a lifetime membership in the 
global professional networks of both schools that includes over 50,000 alumni.

UNDERGRADUATES COMPETE IN INVESTMENT BANKING CASE FINALS ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30
Haas undergraduates have a chance to tackle real-world problems with

competition on Tuesday, October 30, from 6:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in the

demonstrate and further develop their knowledge and skill base. This year's 
case focuses on the recent sale of Cobalt Networks to Sun Microsystems.

Over 30 teams submitted cases to the competition. The final four were 
chosen on Friday, October 23. Each of the finalist teams will make a short 
presentation followed by questions from a panel of judges, which will 
include company management, investment bankers, members of the investment 
community, and Haas faculty.  The winner will be announced, followed by the 
judges' critique of the presentations, and a discussion of what actually 
happened during the sale of Cobalt Networks.  There will be time allotted

Lecture Series in Marketing on Thursday, Nov. 1, at 5 p.m. in the Wells

Leadership"" as the inaugural lecture in this series.

Stern is the John D. Gray Distinguished Professor of Marketing.

""Perspectives about how to use the Internet and the web must be re-assessed 
in light of the hard lessons learned over the past several years during the 
irrational exuberance era,"" says Stern. He focuses on issues related to 
designing and managing marketing channels in his research. In the lecture, 
he will address changes to marketing strategies and tactics that are 
required in order to find the right paths to profitability in the 
post-Internet-bubble era.

TOP HAAS ECONOMISTS OFFER THEIR FORECAST FOR THE US ECONOMY NOVEMBER 9
One of the many benefits of attending the Haas School and UC Berkeley is

current economy. On Friday, November 9, 2001, at 4:00 p.m., Dean Laura 
Tyson invites Haas students to a forum on the US economy.

""Economic Outlook Forum 2001"" will examine economic conditions in the

macroeconomic conditions. Borenstein will speak on energy and airlines,

INTEL CEO TO SPEAK AT RESEARCH DIALOGUE ON NOVEMBER 14
The Business Faculty Research Dialogues bring major corporate speakers to 
Haas every year to create a continuing discussion around a central theme. 
This year the theme is ""Adding Value with Information Technology"" and the 
lineup of speakers is impressive.

First up is Craig R. Barrett, president and chief executive officer of 
Intel Corporation, on Wednesday, November 14, at 4:00 p.m. in the Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium. Barrett has been in the news recently commenting on 
the possibility of the Windows XP release increasing demand for new 
computers. He has been fairly negative on this possibility, instead stating 
that Intel continues to focus on its core business.

Before joining Intel in 1974, Barrett was an associate professor of 
materials science at Stanford, where he earned his bachelors, masters, and 
Ph.D. degrees in materials science. He joined Intel Corporation in 1974 as 
a technology development manager. He was elected to Intel board of 
directors in 1992 and was named the company's chief operating officer in 
1993. He became Intel's fourth president in May 1997 and chief executive 
officer in 1998.

Barrett will be followed by Eric Benhamou, chairman of the board for 3COM 
Corporation and Palm, Inc., on March 15, 2002, and Eric Schmidt, chairman 
of the board and CEO of Google, Inc. in Spring 2002 (date TBD).

"Dear Vince, Christie and Vasant:

Thank you for the presentation to the Enron Tiger Team.  It was most
informative and well received by the students. This is an exciting project
and the students are enthusuastic and anxious to begin.  Many thanks, also,
for hosting the dinner at the Palladium.  It was a wonderful opportunity to
get to know more about the project, as well the Enron representatives and
the students.

Listed below is the contact information with team contacts identified.
I will send you the teams project preferences as soon as I recieve them from
all the students.

It may be a good idea to contact the students before they leave for vacation
(15-22 Dec) to see who is interested in a trip to Houston in January for
planning purposes.  They will return to campus Jan. 16.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist from this end.

Again, thank you for your support of the Wharton School and of the Tiger

"Tom:

You can only see the master agreement database.  The brokerage agreement database is separate and cannot be viewed by anyone outside Legal.  The Bear Stearns agreement you see listed is there in error.  It should be in the brokerage agreement database.  We do have listings for Morgan and Goldman.  Sara wasn't aware that you couldn't see this database when you spoke,

I have gone through the database and have only been able to find the Bear Prime Broker agreement under ECI.  I know I have a Morgan ECI account and should have a Goldman pending.  I am looking for Enron Co=Enron Credit Inc. is that not correct?

Please advise.

"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you."

FROM:    Neal Wolkoff
Executive Vice President

SUBJECT:  MARGIN RATE CHANGE  FOR NOVEMBER 17th, 22nd, 29th, 2000



MARGIN RATE CHANGE  FOR NOVEMBER 17, 2000

Effective Date:      Friday, November 17, 2000  (close of business)

Futures Contract:    Palladium Futures

Contract Months:    November and December 2000 Only
NYMEX Division Margins on Palladium Futures Contracts
Effective Date:      Friday, November 17, 2000  (close of business)

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):           Old:  $15,000   New:  $25,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin):               Old:  $16,500   New:  $27,500
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):           Old:  $20,250   New:  $33,750

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the ""Scan Risk"" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.
 Because there is a difference between the margin required for the November 
and December 2000 delivery months and other months, each spread which 
includes either one leg in the November or December delivery month will have 
its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $10,250 starting 
on November 17th.  This figure is determined as follows:

Example At Clearing Member Rates for November 17th Margin Change:
One Long December Palladium   (1 x $25,000)          =        $25,000
One Short March Palladium         (1 x $15,000)          =   -     $15,000
Net Scan Risk                  ($25,000-$15,000)       =        $10,000
Spread Rate                   (1x $250)             =   +     $   250
Total Requirement                                 =        $10,250

"Regardless of your ""misc mind altering"" habits, I think Will did say that they would only be able to have path modifications/cuts modified in the notes part initially.  Then (whenever the ""next"" modification was implemented), they would add the capability to interact with Enpower deals (ie write notes to the deal record and then, provide an entry point for deal entry for new deals done).

The East Group does not need to see POR/POD in the path for ""transmission.""  My intent was to put a counterparty name in the TRAN1 NAME column (example: TVA), and Enpower deal number in TRAN1 DEAL#	(example: 236891.1) if available, and Oasis number + level of reliability in TRAN1 OASIS	 
(example:  30912345 F-7).  I thought the logic for ""Tag"" and ""Oasis"" should be a combination of text and numbers. The reasoning for Border 2 was to have an additional border point to query for (in confirmation) when we move from one place to another. What if you put the borders in the Oasis column (ie: WW/MEAD 123456 F-7)? The path would be: Generation-marketer-E-TRANS(T) WW/MEAD 123456 F-7-E-marketer-Sink.

Gotta run,

Good Morning,

Did you read Will's last note?  Anyway, I am wanting to do one of two things and need to know which you like better.

The name and oasis number representation for tranny is not enough info for us.  We need POR and POD information as well. So,  I need the following capability

Either  

Put the transmission path in the E cell like we do now,

or

Put more information in the Trans name  ( ie:  APS-(T)PV/WW)  and in the OASIS cell  (ie:  23055 HNF)


Do you have a preference?  

We also need to be a united front about the design and intent of the Path Cut. They are not wanting to make it work all the way. I sure don't remember the conversations being that it should be just a replacement for the notes part, but because it's enpower everything should work together.  Am I on crack?


Thanks,

Cara"

Larry Ruff sent along a note indicating that his invoice  (US$20,000)  for

1)  Is this deal done?  No, not yet.  Cabot is reviewing our new Enfolio long 
term contract and has suggested some minor modifications.  Also, this new 
long term contract form is awaiting final Legal Department approval - we 
expect this imminently.  Finally, our reservoir engineers are scheduled to 
visit Cabot's offices on 12/5/2000 to review their downhole data - we will 
not enter into a long term contract until a full reserve review has been 
completed.  
2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed.  For 
December, the firm quantity on Tennessee is 11,280 Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 
14,100 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  The firm quantity on Transco is 14,720 
Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 18,400 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  We intend to keep 
the desk whole on these firm quantities.
3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point 
of view?  We expect to communicate with Cabot from a logistics/volume 
management point of view. 
4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is 
responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?  We intend to do whatever is 
necessary to get the gas to pipeline pooling points and thereupon turn it 
over to each Desk's logistics team.  We do not see the need to duplicate our 
existing logistics function.

Victor,

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

George x3-6992

"Sara/ Bob, 

Further to my discussions with Sara yesterday evening, and in the absence of any email from both of you to the contrary, I conclude that the confirms as they stand now should be OK from a legal perspective, subject to the credit approval of the entities. As I mentioned yesterday, Treasa's contact at CSFB here is trying to retain CSFB International as the counter-party as was the case for the 2000 transaction earlier. 

Thanks very much for your help.

The STOCK INDEXES closed higher on Tuesday after a number of tech
firms reaffirmed earnings guidance, giving investors confidence that
the worst may be over. This positive news sent the Nasdaq sharply
higher on the day filling last Wednesday's gap at 2170.58 thereby
increasing the odds that a short-term bottom was likely posted with
last week's low. Today's strong gains turned momentum indicators
neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during
the first half of June are possible.

The Dow also closed higher on Tuesday due to spillover support from
the Nasdaq and S&P 500 index. The Dow's solid rebound off last
Friday's low has turned short-term momentum indicators neutral to
bullish signaling that additional gains are possible. However, I
would not be surprised to see a pause if not modest setback on
Wednesday as the Dow may consolidate some of its recent gains before
extending its rebound off last week's low. Closes above May's high
crossing at 1135 are needed to renew this spring's rally.

INTEREST RATES September bonds closed higher for the fifth day in a
row following the release of the National Association of Purchasing
Management's May non-manufacturing index showed continued weakness
and the April factory orders report was softer than expected.
September bonds have retraced just over 62% of May's decline. If the
rally continues, the 75% retracement level crossing at 101-20, then
May's high at 102-22 are potential targets later this month. Momentum
indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices into
early-June are possible.

The CRB INDEX closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as
it continues to consolidate above trading range support crossing at
208.43. Closes below this support level would confirm a trading range
breakout thereby opening the door for a larger-degree decline during
June. At the same time, momentum indicators are becoming oversold
warning traders that the CRB might have posted a broad double bottom
with last week's low. Closes above broken support crossing at 213.20
are needed to temper the bearish outlook.

ENERGY MARKETS were mixed on Tuesday. Early strength in the energy
products was due to short covering, which was triggered by a refinery
snag. However, weakness in the cash markets tempered today's gains as
traders await this afternoon's API inventory data reports. In other
news, OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna are likely to keep production
quotas and current levels. They also are likely to increase
production to offset the short fall caused by Iraq's suspension of
oil exports over the weekend.

July crude oil closed higher on Tuesday as it continues to
consolidate above the 50% retracement level of the December/May rally
crossing at 27.51. Momentum indicators are bearish but nearing their
respective oversold zones warning bears to use caution when trying to
press their hand. If the decline off May's high resumes, April's
reaction low crossing at 27.25 is July's next target.

July heating oil closed higher on Tuesday due to short covering
thereby leaving Monday's downside reversal unconfirmed. Closes below
last week's low, which coincides with the 38% retracement level of
the December/May rally crossing at 75.66 are needed to renew July's
decline off May's high. Stochastics and RSI remain bearish signaling
that additional weakness near-term is possible.

July unleaded gas spiked below last week's low crossing at 90.30 and
this year's uptrend line before a short covering bounce tempered some
of today's losses. A number of short- term momentum indicators though
bearish are becoming oversold hinting that we could see a short
covering bounce off the aforementioned uptrend line. If this support
level is broken, the door would be open for a possible test of
April's gap crossing at 87.25 later this month.

July Henry Hub natural gas posted a huge key reversal down on Tuesday
after early session strength failed to attract follow-through buying.
Additional weakness on Wednesday is needed to confirm today's bearish
reversal pattern thereby signaling the likely end of the corrective
rebound off last week's low.

CURRENCIES The September Dollar closed lower on Tuesday due to light
profit taking amidst rumors of European Central Bank intervention.
Additional weakness on Wednesday is needed to confirm today's bearish
reversal pattern however, it will take closes below May's uptrend
line crossing near 118.57 to signal that a short-term bottom has
likely been posted. Until then the door remains open for sideways to
higher prices during the first half of June. The daily ADX (a
trend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that additional
strength is possible.

The September Swiss Franc closed sharply higher on Tuesday and in
doing so filled last week's gap at .5631. Closes above .5645 are
needed to turn a number of momentum indicators neutral to bullish
thereby increasing the odds that a short-term bottom might be in
place. Until then, the door remains open for a test of weekly support
crossing at .5508.

The September Canadian Dollar posted a potential key reversal up on
Tuesday and is set to challenge trading range resistance crossing at
.6541. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to
confirm a breakout and renew the rally off April's low. Momentum
indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices
during the first half of June are possible.

The September Japanese Yen posted a key reversal down on Tuesday and
in doing so turned a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral
to bearish. Additional weakness on Wednesday is needed to confirm
today's bearish reversal pattern. However, the close below trading
range resistance crossing at .8425 is a clear warning to bulls that a
top and trend change might be near.

PRECIOUS METALS August gold closed slightly higher on Tuesday as it
continues to consolidate around the 75% retracement level of this
spring's rally crossing at 267.20. While the near-term trend is down,
the recent consolidation near the aforementioned support level along
with stochastics and RSI becoming oversold hint that a short-term
bottom might be in or near. If the decline continues, the reaction
low crossing at 263.20 is August's next target.

July silver posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close to
consolidate some of Monday's losses. The door remains open for a test
of trading range support crossing at 4.31 cents. If this support
level is broken, the door would be open for additional weakness and a
possible test of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.

July copper closed higher on Tuesday due to short covering following
Monday's spike below May's low at 74.75. Momentum indicators remain
bearish hinting that additional weakness is possible. Closes below
Monday's low would open the door for a test of weekly support
crossing at 74.10 later this month. Closes above 77.20 would increase
the odds that a double bottom was posted with Monday's low.

GRAINS July corn posted a downside reversal with a lower close as
buying faded into the close. Talk of warmer weather by the weekend or
early next week erased early support due to Monday's bullish crop
conditions report. Even if the weather forecast are true, this week's
cool/wet weather will likely cause further deterioration in next
Monday's crop ratings report. Despite today's sell off, the recent
trendline breakout has opened the door for sideways to higher prices
with May's high at 2.11 1/2 being a possible target.

July wheat extended Monday's decline despite Monday's friendly crop
condition report that showed further deterioration in the winter
wheat crop. Harvest pressure along with a favorable world weather
outlook for wheat- producing areas and stagnant U.S. export demand
continues to weigh on prices. While a short covering bounce is
possible on Wednesday as July may try and consolidate some of this
week's losses, momentum indicators have turned bearish and the door
is open for sideways to lower prices into mid-June.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed fractionally higher on Tuesday.
Early strength was tied to Monday's friendly crop condition report.
However, extended forecasts are calling for a warm up and drier
conditions to move into the Midwest by the weekend or early next
week, which sent buyers to the sidelines. Traders remain reluctant to
push the panic button despite slow crop development and declining
crop conditions given the projected increase in next year's carryout
and the strong U.S. Dollar. Look for two-sided trading to continue
near-term.

July soybean meal gapped up and closed higher on Tuesday but near
session lows due to profit taking ahead of the close. Early support
was due to Monday's crop conditions reports and spillover short
covering following Monday's upside reversal. July meal needs to close
above 168 or below 159.60 to clear up near-term direction in the
market. Until then, look for two-sided trading to continue to
dominate the market.

LIVESTOCK August hogs closed lower on Tuesday on ideas that meat
packers will reduce slaughter thereby pressuring the cash market.
Additional pressure came from ideas that August has become slightly
overbought technically. However, today's mid-range close leaves the
door open for sideways trading on Wednesday. If the rally resumes,
April's high crossing at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below
last week's gap at 64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top
has been posted.

August cattle closed slightly lower on Tuesday as traders await
direction from the cash market. The recent rally in futures appears
to have priced in $76 cash bids. Momentum indicators have become very
overbought warning bulls to use caution a the market might be forming
a broad double top with January's high.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Tuesday thereby confirming
Monday's key reversal up. Today's rally also turned a number of
oversold momentum indicators neutral to bullish thereby increasing
the odds that last week's low might have marked a short-term bottom.
Closes above May's downtrend line crossing near 62.10 are needed
before this is confirmed.

July cocoa closed higher on Tuesday due to light short covering
following Monday's upside reversal. Nevertheless, July remains below
broken trading range support crossing at 955. Multiple closes above
this broken support level are needed to temper the near-term bearish
outlook in the market. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming
oversold warning bears to use caution when pressing the short side of
the market.

July sugar closed slightly lower on Tuesday in narrow trading as it
continues to consolidate above last week's apparent double bottom.
Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that
additional short covering off last week's low is possible. If the
decline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.

July cotton posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on
Tuesday. Additional weakness would increase the odds that the short
covering bounce off last week's low may have run its course. It will
take closes above this year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95 to
confirm that a bottom and trend change has taken place. Until then,
the overall downtrend remains intact.

Services, Inc., Enron Net Works, LLC, Enron Engineering and Construction 
Company, EGEP Services, Inc., Enron Transportation Services Company, Enron 
Property Services Company, and Portland General Electric Company vendors as 
an additional step toward implementing our commitment to conduct our business 
affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards.

We are sending you a copy of this letter so that you will be aware that your 
vendors will be receiving this letter and so that you will be reminded that 
Enron does enlist the cooperation of its vendors in adhering to its Business

Dear Sir or Madam :

 Enron Corp. (&Enron8) believes in conducting its business affairs in 
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of 
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a 
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does 
not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct 
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or 
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your 
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects 
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that 
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department will 
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and 
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical 
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length 
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations.  
If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

James V. Derrick, Jr.
Executive Vice President
and General   Counsel

         Very truly yours,"

"Attached is a first draft of a response to Greenpeace's April 5 letter to 
Jeff Skilling asking for Enron's answers to some specific questions on the 
Kyoto Protocol and climate change.   Similar letters were delivered by 
Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK, 
Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium.

I have attached a copy of one of the letters below.  All the questions are 
the same in each.

I have drafted a response with the goals of:

1)  Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without 
""greenwashing.""   We have an already-published public ""statement"" on climate 
change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts 
and accomplishments to back up our statements.   I think our letter can land 
in the stack that they consider ""positive"" responses, and not in the stack of 
non-responses or ""we don't care"" responses.

2)  Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about ""Kyoto."" 
  I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful 
answers to the general themes of the letter.   I have discussed this with 
many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down 
into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll 
quickly get into questions we can't now answer, and may never be able to 
answer.   I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look 
solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be 
engaged in this important issue.

3)  Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple 
applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script 
to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual 
meeting Q&A;  Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations; 
something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report.  

Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive 
issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we 
need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can 
understand and use.  With that said, I also believe that these messages 
should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying 
too far from the basics can be dangerous.  We should designate one or two 
clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by 
press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our 
response letter.

There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, 
using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds 
in the local areas.   I am not opposed to doing so, but would again 
appreciate being able to review these responses before they go.  Please let 
me know if you have other views.

I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 
if we can turn it around that fast.  Thank you for your input and assistance 
and I look forward to your reply.

Jeff

Michelle,
 
Gee, not sure if you've gotten this lovely little bit o' Houston trivia  making its way on the web.  But sure is funny and a nice commentary on how  we use Powerpoint presentations to do just about everything  today.
 
Hey, sent you a Christmas card, um, to your parent's address.  Gee,  where did I put your new address? Want to send it on over for next  year??
 
Unfortunately, won't get to see you in Houston this year b/c, gasp, my  parents are coming to California!  It's gonna be the whole family plate -  Mom, Dad, Laura, Mary and I.  Add Ben and his mom and it's going to be a  terrifying holiday.  Don't you wish you were  here???
 
Karin Snelson might come down, but not sure she wants to join us.   Shoot.
 
Hope all is well with you.  I realize work must just be nuts.   Wishing you a bit o' peace there, too.
 
Cheers,
Suzy
 
PS - just gave notice here at work (a good story, detailed in my  Christmas card), so from now on, it's best to use my personal email (which I  actually  might start checking), which is  suzannethomas@yahoo.com

Subject: Hello Vince


Vince,

A couple of things.  First, I'm planning on your arrival at Baylor sometime
the afternoon of Monday, November 13.  I want to set up a small seminar for
our faculty if you want to do it.  I will schedule it for 4 pm so if you
can arrive in Waco (Continental has several flights in each day) sometime
in early afternoon I'll pick you up.  The Ex MBA class begins at 6 p.m. and
I'll set you up to speak first for about an hour with q&a to follow.  How
about putting together some thoughts related to our paper?  You can do the
same talk for the faculty in the early afternoon.  You and I can get then
together on Tuesday morning to work on the paper.  I have a 1 p.m. class on
Tuesday is my only constraint.  If you have time to hang around we'll do
the talk a third time in that class.  By then I suspect we will have made
some real progress.

Next point, we have both Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling set up for Dec 4th in
the afternoon.  I plan to get some questions together for them based on our
discussions next Monday and Tuesday.

I'm really looking forward to seeing you next week and to working on our
paper.

Have a great week.  I'm off to Austin and New Orleans this week, thus the
reason for the early message on the class a week from tomorrow.

Take care.

John

p.s. Take a look at my web site for a review of the spring ""new economy and
business education conference"".  By the by, I need a short bio-sketch on
you for the site and for my introduction to the faculty and the class.

Natural Gas Futures Dip Slightly Lower

    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX ended down $0.024
yesterday to $2.048 per MMBtu. The March contract gained $0.001 to $2.09
per MMBtu. The market began the day higher on early short-covering, but
fell off sharply in the afternoon after an extended forecast called for
mild weather across much of the nation. Last week the AGA reported 124 Bcf
of natural gas was withdrawn from storage, leaving about a Tcf more still
in the ground than a year ago. Look for the market to take-out the $2.00
support level soon. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally flat to $0.05 higher yesterday. Natural gas for next
day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.01 to $2.12 per MMBtu. Look for
cash prices to weaken ahead of the weekend, likely leading futures prices
lower as well. With some cold in the Northeast and Midwest, but mild
temperatures forecast for the next two weeks, traders expect to see spot
prices at a discount to futures by the weekend. Turn-back volumes could
also weaken prices. By the end of January storage operators face
requirements to withdraw gas out of storage, the extra volumes hitting the
market could push prices further down.

Enron Creditors Want Andersen Investigation


    Enron's creditors' committee has asked the bankruptcy judge for
permission to investigate Andersen to help it prepare possible legal
action against the accounting firm. The committee wants to force Andersen
officials to testify and turn over documents. It was appointed last month
by the US Trustee's office, an arm of the Justice Department. Creditors,
which are owed $40 billion, are concerned that Enron may be worth less
than they thought. Andersen's CEO sent an auditing expert in his place to
testify yesterday before Congress on the destruction of documents related
to Enron. Another witness, David Duncan, a fired Andersen executive,
invoked his 5th Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refused to
testify at the hearing.

Enron's Top Management Departs


    As Enron struggles to survive, its top executives have been bailing
out. Of the 14 executives named in the company's annual 10-K filing with
the SEC last April, about half are gone. Vice Chairman Mark Frevert said
that he left the company at the end of December and seems uncertain
whether he quit or was fired. Greg Whalley, president and COO, will join
Swiss bank UBS which has acquired Enron's trading unit. Former CEO Jeffrey
Skilling and former Vice Chairman Clifford Baxter left the company last
year and Chairman Kenneth Lay resigned 2 days ago, in what some see as an
attempt to stave off the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee. A trustee
would supersede Enron's top management and its board of directors and
would likely name a new law firm to replace Enron's current bankruptcy
attorneys. A coalition of creditors has petitioned a bankruptcy judge to
appoint a Chapter 11 trustee to run Enron. To have a trustee appointed,
creditors must prove management's actions have been inept or fraudulent.
Document shredding and a suspected cover up of the company's true
financial liabilities could be adequate grounds to name a trustee. Lay's
departure leaves CFO Jeff McMahon and Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of
Enron Global Services in charge of the company for now. Enron plans to
hire a turnaround specialist to run the company until a permanent
replacement is chosen. Three consulting firms that specialize in turning
around failing businesses have been mentioned as possible front-runners.
They are Alvarez & Marsal, Glass & Associates and Zolfo Cooper.

Judge Halts Andersen Shredding


    A federal judge has approved a plan from Enron shareholders to prevent
Andersen from shredding any more documents related to Enron's audits. The
judge ruled that plaintiffs lawyers can start taking depositions in 20
days from Andersen employees who were fired or suspended for the document
shredding. Andersen must also file a report with the judge explaining the
shredding at that time. But Andersen argues that it has not completed its
own investigation into the shredding, and depositions related to the
lawsuit should take a back seat to investigations by Congress, the SEC,
the Justice Department and others. The judge also ruled Andersen can shred
no more documents and that the firm must preserve all Enron-related
documents going back to 1994 and that plaintiffs' lawyers can inspect
them. Andersen attorneys assured the judge that the records are under
guard and shredding has ceased. Andersen has admitted that its Houston
staff shredded a significant but undetermined number of documents related
to Enron audits last fall as federal regulators launched probes into
possible accounting improprieties. The company later fired the head of the
Houston office for his role in the shredding and placed several others on
administrative leave. Attorneys for the plaintiffs' want to depose the
former partner and five others. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit against
29 current and former Enron executives and board members for more than $1
billion they gained by selling company stock during a 3-year period prior
its bankruptcy filing. Allegations have emerged that Enron employees
shredded accounting and finance documents as recently as last week. A
hearing on Enron shredding is scheduled for February 5th before federal
bankruptcy judge.

FERC to Hold Closed Meeting to Consider Investigation


     The FERC plans to hold a rare, closed-door meeting next week to
discuss a several issues, including the possible initiation of an
investigation. The private meeting will be held Wednesday, immediately
following FERC's regularly scheduled bi-monthly meeting that is open to
the public. The FERC issued a list of agency officials who will attend the
closed-door discussion of the possible investigation, including Chairman
Wood and the three commissioners, the office of general counsel, staff
with FERC's office of market tariffs, and staff with the office of the
executive director. Other items to be discussed at the closed meeting
include: 1) A demand by a group of natural gas producers in the Gulf of
Mexico that Williams cut its new gathering rates and other fees for
transporting volumes to shore. The producers claim that Williams has
boosted its rate for interruptible gathering by more than 230% since
December 1st; 2) A July complaint by New Power Holdings that PJM
Interconnection's capacity requirements and deficiency charges are unjust,
discriminatory and preferential. New Power wants PJM to change its
existing capacity deficiency rate of $177 per MW day; 3) A case involving
a FERC order last summer that says National Fuel Gas violated the law when
it operated a natural gas well and storage fields in Erie County, New
York, before obtaining authorization.

PSEG to Upgrade Coal Fired Plants in New Jersey


    PSEG has agreed to spend $300 million over 10 years to install
equipment to limit air pollution at its New Jersey coal fired power plants
to bring them into compliance with 'new source' review rules that require
the installation of air pollution equipment when a plant undergoes major
modifications. The agreement settles a complaint brought by the Justice
Department, the EPA and the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection. The complaint alleged that PSEG failed to install necessary
pollution controls at two plants. The federal air pollution rule is
currently under review by the White House. Utilities with aging coal-fired
plants contend that the rule requires expensive upgrades which reduces
their ability to produce more energy. PSEG said it would rather resolve
the issue than face protracted and costly litigation. PSEG Power has about
17,000 MW of generation capacity. In 2004, the company will start to
phase-in equipment to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide
and mercury at 3 New Jersey coal-fired plants with a total capacity of
about 1,250 MW, with all work scheduled to be complete by 2012. PSEG will
install selective catalytic reduction and dry scrubber devices, which
remove particulates from exhaust before it is released into the air. The
new technologies will cost about $150 million each.

KeySpan Net Income Falls 42%


    KeySpan says 4th quarter net income fell 42% on lower natural gas
prices and expenses related to the sale of a barge business. Net income
declined to $34.4 million, or $0.25 per share, from $58.9 million, or
$0.43 a year earlier. Revenue fell 14% to $1.62 billion from $1.87
billion. KeySpan has agreed to sell its Midland Enterprises barge unit to
closely held Ingram Industries for $230 million in cash and $135 million
in assumed debt. It had expenses last quarter of $30.4 million, or $0.22
per share, related to the sale. KeySpan also wrote off the value of its
investment in natural gas reserves by $31.4 million, or $0.23, because of
lower natural gas prices. KeySpan owns 68% of Houston Exploration. It had
costs of $2.5 million on Roy Kay Cos, a general-contracting business it is
closing. Excluding those losses, KeySpan earned $99 million, or $0.71 per
share. It was expected to earn $0.75. KeySpan cut its 2002 earnings
forecast by $0.20 to $2.50 - $2.65, because it expects less profit from
exploration and production. KeySpan's Vice Chairman and Chief Operating
Officer Craig Matthews will retire, effective March 1st.

Cargill Halts Saltville Natural Gas Storage Expansion

     An planned expansion of a Virginia natural gas storage facility
planned by Duke Energy and NUI has failed to obtain FERC approval because
Cargill filed a complaint. Cargill asked the FERC to issue an order
halting the construction of an expanded salt cavern storage facility
planned for Saltville, Virginia. Duke and NUI formed a joint venture
called Saltville LLC to expand the salt cavern storage to hold 12 Bcf of
working natural gas capacity over the next 3 years. The site currently
stores only 1.1 Bcf. Cargill says that the companies are attempting to
circumvent the jurisdiction of FERC by seeking approval only from Virginia
state regulators even though the gas may be used in interstate commerce.
The expanded Saltville storage site would have a deliverability of up to
550 MMcf per day. The Virginia State Corporation Commission has scheduled
a February 20th hearing on the project.

Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits
Dow Jones Newswires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday
he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy
suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.

But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation
he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has
discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting
overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.

Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement
official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and
forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.

The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to
overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.

""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back
the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.

Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office
has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant
Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney
general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy
overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protection
following the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996
California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricity
from its customers.

Lockyer's disclosure that he hasn't discovered criminal conduct, including
no evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he said
he wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman. Lockyer told the Wall
Street Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8
by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is
Spike, honey.""'

On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,
""So far...we haven't found criminal behavior associated with pricing
policies.""

Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers of
manipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County Superior
Court.

That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.
San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn't have
proof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceeds
in a process known as discovery.

""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""
Slavin said.

The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.

A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesale
energy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the
Wholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositions
regarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and the
committee's chairman, said he's concerned that documents destroyed by
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoena
issued in June.

Dunn's committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding the
Enron records.

"Thanks. Will talk with you tomorrow. One issue that should be discussed is
the timeline that you sent to scott flood earlier today. My guess is that
any bidder will have their own minimum master and contract wording that they
will want to use as well as credit department needs. And so sending out
language to counterparties before a bidder is awarded should be carefully
thought out because it may not be acceptable to the bidder. This is only a
timing issue I think but is important nonetheless. "

TERMINATION OF TRADING PRIVILEGES

	Please be advised that the Exchange has been notified by MBF
Clearing Corp., that effective with the close of business, October 23, 2001,
it will no longer guarantee the membership of:

Robert Symanski (JRSY-3569)

	Members and Member Firms have (10) days from the date of this notice
to advise the Corporate Secretary's Office of any claims in accordance with
Rule 2.51.

	Inquiries regarding the above should be addressed to the Member
Services Department at 212-299-2378."
"John--Attached is an update of the values in the various transport books as 
of October 3rd.  Please note that the East Desk has already made its 
changes.  All that was done was to move the correlations up--the old 
percentage and new percentage of each deal is shown on the sheet.  I am 
waiting on a deal by deal breakdown of extrinsic value changes, but I have 
been told that the change in total for the East Desk was ($5,900,000).  They 
brought this in at the same time they cleared out the $5,700,000 positive 
that had been withheld, resulting in about a ($200,000) change.  Please let 
me know if you disagree with any of the changes that were made and we will 
fix them.  They really did not seem very controversial since these were all 
Columbia Gulf transports and the correlations were just set too low.

The West Desk's proposal on PGT/Kingsgate is also shown on the worksheet.  
After speaking with the Canadian office on forward AECO basis, Phillip and 
Keith believe the Kingsgate / Malin spread should be widened considerably.  
At this time they are proposing moving the current spread from $.1676 to 
$.2676, and moving the correlations up to the point that results in a 
$.0303/MMBtu extrinsic value number.  They believe this would put the values 
in the appropriate places, and would result in very little net impact overall 
to their books.  As of yesterday's close, the impact would be a positive 
$55,301 change.  No changes will be made until you approve it.


Regarding the Central Region, I have not spoken with or received anything 
from Hunter and Andy yet.  Neither one of them is here today but I will get 
with them as soon as I can to let you know the Central Region's proposal.  
You can at least see where they stood as of October 3rd for what is on the 
books.  I have not included Geoff Storey's capacity deals on this sheet since 
his have no extrinsic value, but I will be happy to add them if you need that 
info."

Subject: PRC

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave

I have several changes to the demand fees for Tenaska IV.  Let me know if you have any questions.

For Dec 2000, we need to adjust the demand fee on deal 529856 to account for a volume change on the receipt side.  We overpaid Williams and are going to take our money back.  We then need to refund Tenaska IV.  Please change the demand fee from $878,330.63 to $918,566.13.

For Feb 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,341,675.50 to $3,438,325.95.  Tenaska IV owes us for the remaining expenses.  Also, please change the agency volume on deal 514353 from 45,000 to 45,067.

For March 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,591,791.50 to $2,653,694.95.  I have attached the March spreadsheet I received from Mark in case you want to see it.

Of course.  Do you two want to be there for the early show or I could just
meet you there later?

Also, you can sign up on the internet for the early bird show.  I don't
think you can pay when you get there, except if you go at 10 a.m.

Miss Tana,

Are you interested in going to the Nutcracker Market this Saturday morning
and being there for the early bird special (8 a.m.)??  It costs $25 to get
in early, but that covers $10 admission, $5 parking, coffee and
refreshments.  Otherwise, you can go at 10 a.m., pay $10 to get in with the
rest of the crowd and $5 for parking.  I think I am going to plan to be
there around 7:40-7:45.  Let me know if you are interested.

Subject: Power Alley

Folks:

I have the University of Georgia Study that explains the Power Alley 
concept.  For those of you who do not know what I am referring to, the 
Governor of Georgia, Roy Barnes, wants to develop an economic development 
zone right through the middle of the state.  In order to do this he intends 
to upgrade or build new infrastructure including roads, railroads, fiber 
optics, and a 24'' natural gas pipeline.  There are definite holes in the 
proposal, but I thought that you all might be interested.  If you are 
interested in receiving a copy, let me know.  If you know of others who 
should receive a copy, keep me posted.

The executive summary is only about 20 pages, and I could have copies in the 
mail today.  The rest of the study involves 200 pages, and if you would like 
a copy of that information, I could get it to you sometime after the first of 
the year.

I also would be interested in your comments about what needs to be done for 
this infrastructure to be of worth.  For example, it is clear to me that in 
order for the pipeline to be valuable, it needs to be tied into other pipes.  
It is not clear which pipes or where.  Second, it is clear that if they 
expect generation to be built, they will need upgraded transmission and 
possibly a bigger pipeline, 30'' (depending on demand).

Please give me some feedback.  I would like to provide some sort of 
constructive feedback to those presenting the information.  I have been 
working with some of the primary movers on this piece of work, and I would 
like to see the project completed.

Thanks.

"Ed,
Great job at actually getting something (almost) in writing from HL&P!

The big poles are just not suitable for neighborhood use, simply too big.  I
am, therefore, selfishly relieved that they are not continuing along my
street.  With all the townhome development, plus these mega-poles, what else
can be done to destroy the traditional appearance of our area?  Maybe
they'll put an environmentally sensitive second deck 20' above Montrose to
bypass the ailing downtown highways?

The attached explanation does however beg the question why there's one of
the new pole holes been dug on the NE corner of Peden and Montrose, when the
line runs down the west side of Montrose Blvd. and then west on Peden.

Neartown neighbors,

The attachment is a response to my information request concerning Reliant -
HL&P's installation of the big poles. Conversations after my letter's
receipt moved in the direction of possible community meetings where R-H
would explain what they were doing and answer our many questions.

Last Tuesday R-H informed me that since the installation project would be
completed by the end of this month, that the attachment would be sufficient
for their communication purposes. A meeting with us was not necessary.

The R-H spokesperson readily admitted that there had been no attempts to
obtain community imput/feedback prior the new pole installation.

I'm disappointed and frustrated. I need your thoughts on how to proceed.

Read the attachment and tell me what you think should happen next.

Thanks

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal."

"Thanks.  Have a good weekend, and I'm looking forward to the Term book 
adventure next week.

"Ilan,

In order to calculate the VA we need the actual VisuPro counter data since we 
are using an assumed formula for the Vestas Availability.  (See attached for 
this year 2002 VA):



Note this report was an interim report and the ""EA"" values used for 
comparison does include the 90 day ramp up time and the Trent leaning towers.

With regard to the German turbines: If the German team has summarized data 
then we could make the calculation, with some simplifying assumptions, for 
the year 2001 on the German turbines and extend the graph.  By summarized 
data I am talking about a summation of each of the counter values for all of 
their turbines for all of the months during last year.  (This is not totally 
unreasonable, we could provide this data for turbines in the US very quickly 
but that is because we have the data in an Oracle database.)  

If, however, the data comes to us as individual VisuPro files it would be 
impossible to assimilate and produce the report before AWEA.  In fact I would 
not recommend trying to produce this number even after AWEA because of the 
complexity of the process.

We will pose the question to the German team but I am not optimistic that 
they have summarized counter data.

Best Regards,
Hollis


*  One simplifying assumption goes back to the fact the European VisuPro 
SCADA system has 4 counters which are defined differently than the 7 US 
counters.  We would need to assume the German grid never went down and was 
always available.  If we were unable to make this assumption then we would 
need to load all the error messages from each individual turbine in Germany 
and isolate the time associated with grid events (i.e. error messages 8 
Overvoltage 9 ""Undervoltage"", 10 ""Underfrequency"", 11 ""Overfrequency"", 116 
""Line fault voltage"", 117 ""Line fault frequency"") and back that time out of 
RT and apply it to SOT.

Subject: Re: April Availability  

Ben - 

Two issues remain, in order to graph the data as you requested:

1) 2001 Vestas Availability would need to be calculated,

2) We don't have the VA calculation for Germany, only the US. 

I will put a graph together, nonetheless.

Hollis -  Is it possible to get the two questions above answered?  

Thanks,
Ilan

Enron Turns Internal Credit-Risk Tool Into New Product
2001-04-04 17:19 (New York)



   By Christina Cheddar
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise,
knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more
important.
  For Enron Corp. (ENE), the world's largest energy trading company, keeping
track of credit risk has always been part of doing business. That became even
more true with the company's launch of EnronOnline, its Internet-based
commodities trading network.
  In order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on
EnronOnline, the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders
manage the credit risk.
  Early last year, Enron rolled out this tool, Enron Credit, on a limited
basis. Gradually, the company expanded its use and scope. Last month, the
company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format.
  Enron Credit tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rating known 
as
the ""Enron cost of credit."" The rating is expressed as an interest rate.
  The Web site also provides news, a company's expected chance of bankruptcy
and other related information.
  While much of this information is free to registered users, Enron also has
turned the product into a new revenue stream.
  Users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for 
a
fee.
  The site also can sell a user a ""digital bankruptcy swap,"" which is a way to
hedge against credit exposure.
  The price of the swap is determined by a rating Enron's staff assigns to a
company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect against.
  For a supplier, the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable
to pay due to bankruptcy, the supplier will be paid immediately.
  According to Enron Europe President John Sherriff, the goal of Enron Credit
is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity.
  The tool is important because ""in just a short amount of time, a company's
credit can go from stellar to bad literally overnight.""
  At present, some analysts haven't factored in revenue from Enron Credit into
their earnings models. However, as the commodity markets Enron trades in
mature, it is possible the need for products such as Enron Credit could
increase.

Subject: AIG Highstar

Friday is the day when we are supposed to close the Alamac sale to AIG 
Highstar.  Should we fail to close this transaction, we should look to our 
potential alternatives for withdrawing from the fund, unless of course we 
view that we will close but it will happen over the few days following.    
Interestingly, AIG may be planning to use further funds raised to create a 
second fund rather than add to the current fund leaving us with more of a 
percentage ownership but less capability of accessing the deals (fuel supply, 
despatch and EPC rights would not be attached to any second fund).

We also have far too many people talking to AIG now and we need to stop this 
immediately, going forward only Joe Deffner should communicate with Bob as at 
the moment we have too many people doing all of the work for AIG for no 
return.  As of Friday or the close of Alamac - Bob can only talk through 
Joe.  We are not in the business of doing work for this fund.

Can you put together (only if we fail to close) a short review for John of 
why we should stay in the fund over removing ourselves.  I recognize that 
contractually we have no capability of exiting at this point but I know you 
think differently and I hope you are right.  My view is that we need to get 
out as we have no control over their investments.  I have spoken to Brian 
Stanley on this fund and Brian is (unless someone in his group has a reason 
not to)  happy to follow whatever approach we take particularly as EE&CC is 
no longer a EPC company."

Subject:	Interconnect Agreement - Questar Southern Trails

All, 

Please review the attached interconnect agreement between Transwestern and Questar.  It is fully reimbursable by Questar.  This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.

Please reply back to me with any comments you may have.  I would like to send a draft to Questar on Tuesday morning, January 22, when we return from our holiday. 

Bill and Robert - please see the red-lined language addressing the tax reimbursement.  

Thanks for your time,

Kim.   X33098

Diane,

As mentioned in my voice-mail, attached is the list of all Intercompany Financial Agreements.  Some intercompany arrangements were entered into before the creation of RMT.  Those agreements have been bolded for your convenience.  You will need to search those for live confirmations as well:

Yesterday's run up doesn't, at least at first glance, resemble a major bottom.
Yes, we did make a new low and settle higher, setting the stage for a possible
reversal. To confirm, we need to see a settle above the $19.40 high from
Tuesday. The reason it didn't resemble a major bottom was the lack of solid
spread action. Crude spreads barely budged, even at the highs. If people were
really seeing yesterday as a potential bottom, it should have been reflected in
more nervousness in short crude spreads. The only market that did react
spread-wise was heating oil. Turnarounds and a mildly improving overseas market
have had some effect. Mar/Apr, in particular, has moved in from -50 to flat.
Replacing barrels during turnaround at close to carry makes sense, anything in
premium only makes sense if a squeeze opportunity arises. Given the huge stock
overhang in PADD One and lack of extended cold weather, I don't see this as
viable. Paper players are clearly very short, however, and that has some
bearing. Back on the short spread angle, you could make the case for a lack of
covering until a strong settle was seen. If the majority sees yesterday's settle
as important, we should see a definite crude spread reaction today. A decent
number of out of the money $19 calls were exercised last night, we haven't seen
that play in some time.  Gas demand fell of the table and gas/heat continues to
look soft.

HEY! Tonya said to staple copy B of the W-2 to the tax return--But on the
one from camp it says Copy C for payer or State Copy, Copy B for Recipient
(Keep for your records).  So which one do I send?  The one from the school
says send B but I'm confused on the other one.
What did the doctor say about Tonya & the due date? Love, Ma

"Dear Jeff,

I & my family  are deeply disturbed by the cowardly attack on America.  It
has been extremely painful to watch such acts of crime.  This is the gravest
tragedy we have come across in our lives.

America is the richest democracy in the world & India the largest.  We enjoy
freedom & no amount of terrorist act can shake our foundations.  Terrorism
is the biggest danger to humanity & let us bravely fight to end these
barbaric acts.

Like America, India has been suffering cross border terrorism for more than
2 decades.  Along with you, we feel & suffer from such brutal pains &
sorrows.  Our arms reach out for all the families who were victims of this
dastardly attack.

I sincerely hope your family, friends & colleagues are safe & are recovering
from their worst nightmare.  In the true spirit of YPOer, we all pray to
give you, your family & America strength to bear the loss of fellow
citizens.

Today, all of us at home & office stood in silent homage.

With sympathy & warm regards,

FERC approval?  And is there a story behind the sale of Sierra's power 
plants?"

Subject: Wholesale Volumes - August


It's that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations!  
The database for August is now ready for viewing.  Just as a reminder, this 
is the shortcut on your desktop called ""Statistical Database"". 

As there is continued investor focus on our Wholesale Operations, Investor 
Relations requests that Business Analysis & Reporting provide monthly 
volumetric analysis for Wholesale Operations in addition to the quarterly 
analysis.  Please review the analysis for August 2000 and provide 
explanations for all material changes (+/- 10%) for the year/year, 
quarter/quarter, and month/month variances.  The current objective of 
Investor Relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential 
investor or analyst questions, but it may be used for ad hoc requests and 
presentations.   It is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial 
personnel.

Please forward your verification and explanations via e-mail to me by 10:00am 
Friday, September 22.  Please feel free to call with any questions.

Thanks,

Misti

"Virginia,
We have resolved almost all of the recent PMA sheet.  The Tacoma/MPC deal is fine if its zeroed out for HE 3.  I just need to have the cost zeroed out as well as the revenue.  Currently only the revenue has been zeroed out and if I receive the credit for buying from MPC I am satisfied.  Fran is aware of this.

I am still having a problem with the WBOM $108,000 as you are aware.  This would be the only outstanding PMA and whatever the problem is with our tools (if any) likely needs to be resolved.

I appreciate your hard work on tracking down this $108,000.
The risk sheet is on my desk.

Thanks, 

Bill"
"Actually, I think the PWC guys will be contacting you to talk about the information they're hoping to locate.  I believe we're going to try to meet with Wei Hu this afternoon to discuss primary and secondary curve mapping/tables.

Thanks,

Ava & Alma, since I don't know what day's I will be in the office, I have decided to let the two of you set the date on the UPS on-line training.

There is a catch,,,,,,,,, if I miss the overview, you will have to train me....

Ava, would you please reply to Lewis and Verna and let them know what is convenient for you, since you have Reservation Invoices going out next week.

Thank you,
Ricki

Subject: Natural Gas Storage research


I am working on a report aimed at Energy Marketers that will examine
Natural Gas Storage: Effects on Energy Trading. I am looking for people
who can talk about the importance of this subject to power marketers.
Please contact me if you can inform me on any of the following subjects.

I am interested in exploring the following issues:
1. Storage process: transportation, injection, withdrawal
2. Are all storage facilities connected to pipelines?
3. Description of types of storage facilities: salt caverns,
above-ground tanks, inactive underground volcano, others
4. Problems that limit underground reservoir effectiveness
5. Historical storage data
6. Contributing factors to storage levels: weather, generation demand,
reliability concerns
7. National map of storage facilities and capacities
8. Terms definitions: base gas, working gas, underground storage,
traditional storage, salt caverns, other relevant terms
9. Impact of storage fluctuations on prices and energy trading
10. Safety issues of natural gas storage
11. Seasonal storage trends
12. Total amount of national storage capacity
13.  Future storage capacity needs
14. LNG as storage alternative
15. Technology improvements
16. Who regulated natural gas storage?
17. List of storage facility owners

If you are involved with natural gas storage, or are an energy trader
who is affected by natural gas storage, please contact me by November
13th. Thank you in advance for your help!

"I can't believe you're going to put them outside!  100% of the TIME?  That
would be soooo difficult to do, I would end up letting them in, I have no
discipline when it comes them, with their sweet, sweet faces!  I do think
you are getting paid back for your lack of understanding for Barbara, it's
terrible when those kind of things come back to haunt you.

Which house is for sale, John's? Or that woman that never came outside?  Did
I tell you that they raised my tax value on the Roseland house for 2001 to
$231,000...what a joke!!! I#m sure that the purchaser will contest and win,
he only paid 190,000 and that is the fair value.  Are prices going down in
Montrose, what's the problem with the house by you, why isn't it selling?  I
would love to be able to buy a place that cheap...my land here cost $300,000
US!  The house alone here will be another $300,000 when it's
finished...incredible.  Armin has a small one bedroom apartment that he paid
$150,000 US for and we checked into selling it, evidently he bought when
prices had peaked...we'd get have that for it if we sell...so I guess we are
staying in the landlord business for now.  We just signed a new tenant, hope
she's not a problem, the others we've had were no problem.

I'm really sorry about the dog situation.  But what else can you do.  Oh,
what we do for love and lust!  I left everything and moved to Germany and
you're throwing your dogs outside.  Life has it's difficulties!

How's your mom?  What#s happening with MDAnderson?"

"Hello Everyone,

The reason why I'm calling this meeting is to make sure once for all that none of us spend endless hours chasing down and mapping curves.

As it stands now the people in risk management can map curves to OMICRONS but they do not take effect until something is changed in GRMS.

So it would seem like the best way is to deal with this is connect the front end to the back so that everytime risk management adds a curve or changes a mapping it should directly impact VaR without having to change something in GRMS.

I know we have something on the front end but we need to connect it to the back.

I need ideas and a definite solution that will save us all a lot of time..............

Please accept this meeting notice.  It will only run for an hour and we will talk to each other on a when needed basis.

Thanks

Bharat"

Bill and Chris - this is what I remember as to settlements with the DEC bidding strategy.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

-Heather



Delano will schedule into the Day Ahead market and make a sale at the PX index price.  Real Time submits dec bids in the Suplemental Energy Market for any hours when they believe there is a good chance of being dec'd at a 0 price (the pprice you bid may be different than 0 to establish ouselves in the ISO Merit order - ).  Real Time makes 50% of the difference between the day ahead PX and the dec price (in this case 0).

"Here is the transcript of the ISO's real-time desk asking Enron real-time trader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO ""set"" the market-clearing price (""MCP"") for replacement energy.  The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's excess energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).

There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO that he had to ""talk to his boss"" because he ""didn't want to do anything wrong.""  

Note:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our desk.


Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:40:50 - 14.43:38

Enron:  Enron, this is David [Porter].

ISO:  Hi David.  This is Allen at the ISO.

Enron:  David: Hi Allen.  How ya doing?

ISO:  Allen:  Hold on one sec.  I've got to get something.

Unknown:  Stage one at 11.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, I'm on the hour-ahead desk.  Did you guys put a bid in?

Enron:  David:  Yes, hang on one second Allen.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah.

Enron:  Ryan:  This is Ryan [Slinger].

ISO:  Allen:  Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.  Did you guys put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?

Enron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?

ISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.

ISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?

Enron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?

ISO:  Allen:  Yes

Enron:  Ryan:  Um,?.

ISO:  Allen:  This isn't on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing.  It would be good to keep it [the Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price.  It doesn't matter how many megawatts you  put it at, but we want to clear it at a higher price.

Enron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we're not on a recorded line, or we are?

ISO:  Allen:  We're not.  No, we're not, okay.  We already talked to the day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we wanted you, if it's possible, to continue to set that, whether it's 20 MW or whatever you want to put in there.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, um?..

ISO:  Allen:  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?

ISO:  Allen:  No.  What happened is that we bought it back?.see, the day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny over the [inter] ties.  They were faking it.  So we wanted to keep the price up high.   

Allen and Ryan:  Unintelligible.

Enron:  Ryan:  So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying it back?.

ISO:  Allen:  Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, that's ridiculous.

ISO:  Allen:  That's really ticking us off and right now . . .

Enron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that's probably Powerex, isn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  There's about four of them right now.

Enron:  Ryan:  Shit.

ISO:  Allen:  And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn't, we didn't, we took them out.  Basically, we're not allowing  anything over the ties.

Enron:  Ryan:  I didn't submit one for 17 or ?.

ISO:  Allen:  That's fine.  They'll probably go to a penny and they'll probably get excited and do a bunch, and we'll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I'll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  I appreciate it.  It's actually in the best interest for the State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put a stop to it.

Enron:  Ryan: Okay.

ISO:  Allen.  Thanks, bye.

Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:46:55 - 14:47:40 (3 minutes later)

Enron:  This is Ryan.

ISO:  Hey Ryan, its Allen.

Enron:  Ryan:  Yeah.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, did you put it in for the next hour?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16?

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah, no, they already ran 17.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, I didn't do 17, no.

ISO:  Allen:  Well, see, we're gonna run, we're gonna run 18 coming up here in the next fifteen minutes.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.

ISO:  Allen:  If you have any questions, let me know.  I hope you know this is me from the ISO.  I don't know if you think I'm somebody else but you can call me at the hour-ahead desk.

Enron:  Ryan:  Well, I mean, I'm talking to my boss right now as far as, because of, you know, I don't want to be doing anything that's wrong.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah? 

Enron:  Ryan:  Even if it is helping you guys out, if it's wrong, I can't do it.

ISO:  Allen:  I know, but if you continue to bid in at, um, the market, that's the best thing to do.  For replacement.  All right.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, I'll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  Thanks, man.

"Jennifer,
I gave Mike Horning a call I received his e-mail.   He is following up with 
Cox directly to find out what is happening on the broadband side 
(negotiations with Blockbuster).  

I reviewed Universal's request for a sponsorship (of JPI).  He was also 
asking dollar amounts for the sponsorship.  It looks like Mike is going to 
probe Daphne Harvey (Universal) for the technical knowledge he needs in order 
to make the best pitch to Universal.  It looks like he will also feel out the 
organizational structure to see if his contacts are the right ones.

Colleen, 

As part of my strategy, I want to glean information.    Hopefully it will 
give me an understanding of their process and goals, so that I may be more 
effective in my discussions with their media group.

Following are a few questions I will ask Daphne (I don't expect Daphne to 
have all the answers):

1) Help me understand how Universal wants to save money on advertising?
2) Who at Universal is driving that process?  (Names, Titles, etc.)
3) What are the saving targets? (% or $ amount)
4) Where do they want to save in regards to advertising? (Spot TV, Network 
TV, Cable, Radio, NP, etc.)
5) What is their annual advertising budget?  (Per film? Metric? Per media, 
etc.)
6) How much does she understand about media buying? (GRP's, CPM's, Demos, 
Dayparts, Reach & Frequency, etc.)
7) What is her role in this process?
 
I'm sure I will have a few more questions, as we speak with each other.

Sir,

I just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2,200K.  This is net of 
Corp Charges and Intercompany billings.  In order to get to this number, we 
have to reduce your budget by 83K.  Do you have any suggestions in which 
category(ies) we need to reduce?

 Budget  10,521,000
 I/C billings   8,238,000
 Subtotal   2,283,000
 Per Delainey   2,200,000
 Need to dec by      83,000

Here are my suggestions based on Oct expenses:

 Category   Oct expense  Budget  Decrease Yearly amount

 Periodical/subscription  5,200   10,000  3,000  36,000
 Tuition and Reimbursement 11,000   21,000  4,000  48,000

This will bring you to the bottom line suggested by Delainey.  Please let me 
know your decision by November 21.  If you have any questions, call me at 
5-7094.  Thanx.

Nelson,

I know you are focusing on agricultural products for trading, so I just 
wanted to know if we are looking at Wool.  I know that it's traded in 
Australia and New Zealand, so we might be able to look into it as well.  
Please let me know.  Thank you.

Clinton Seeks Stepped-Up Probe
Into Increasing Electricity Prices
By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J. FIALKA
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
WASHINGTON -- The Clinton Administration and federal energy regulators stepped
up efforts to respond to a politically disastrous rise in California 
electricity
prices, threatening to go as far as re-regulating some prices if they 
determine
that the free-market experiment in the state has failed.
The moves by federal authorities come as California regulators and lawmakers
scramble to come up with an expedient solution to high power prices in the San
Diego area, where monthly bills have in some cases quadrupled since last 
summer.
'Workably Competitive'
In a 21-page order issued Wednesday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
said that under the Federal Power Act it can intervene to limit the prices
charged by generators to the California market -- if it determines the prices
they are charging aren't ""just and reasonable,"" and the market is not 
""workably
competitive.""
The order accompanied an upgrade of the FERC's effort from a staff probe to a
formal investigation, requested by President Clinton, who also Wednesday
extended $2.6 million in federal emergency loans to low-income residents in 
the
San Diego area to help pay their electric bills.
""There is a crisis of confidence in California wholesale electricity markets
that threatens to erode the political consensus necessary to sustain a
market-based approach to regulation,"" William Massey, one of four FERC
commissioners, said Wednesday in an opinion attached to the order. ""In these
circumstances, the FERC must act forcefully and decisively to ... insist that
jurisdictional wholesale markets produce consumer benefits and just and
reasonable rates.""
As prices have risen, power generators such as Duke Energy
</pj/q-quote.cgi?sym=duk&type=company> Co., the local utility, San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. and public officials have all pointed the finger at one another 
for
what appears to be a badly flawed market. California governor Gray Davis, who 
is
pushing for local legislation that would lower bills and accelerate 
power-plant
construction, Wednesday said ""out-of-state generators"" were most responsible 
for
""bringing San Diego residents to their knees.""
FERC's action Wednesday originated in a complaint filed Aug. 2 by San Diego 
Gas
& Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy </pj/q-quote.cgi?sym=sre&type=company>, 
the
utility whose customers have raised the most outrage over the rate rises.
The utility sold off its plants and now buys all the power its customers use 
out
of a state-sanctioned auction, passing those market costs directly through to
its customers.
A Warning to Generators
Steve Baum, Sempra Energy chairman, said FERC's action is a warning to
generators ""that the prices they've been receiving are now at risk."" He 
expects
FERC to eventually issue a ruling that California's market isn't competitive,
setting the stage for a possible return to cost-based rates in periods of high
demand. Prior to deregulation in 1998, the rates utilities charged for
electricity were based on their underlying cost. Deregulation allowed them to
charge whatever the market would bear.
California's Governor Orders Regulators to Slash Electric Rates in Southern
Areas (Aug. 10)
Mr. Clinton said the FERC investigation would allow Washington to ""better
understand"" what is happening in the California market so the government can
protect consumers there and in other deregulated states.
While politicians and regulators seek solutions, wholesale power prices in
California are becoming more aberrant.
Even on days when consumption and prices normally drop, such as Sundays, 
prices
have been stubbornly high this summer. For example, the auction price of
electricity to be consumed at 10 p.m. last Sunday was $125.48 per megawatt, or
more than four times the price such power commanded on the third Sunday of
August in 1999. The markup is especially noteworthy because actual demand on
that day was 12% lower than on the comparable day a year earlier.
""A number of people are looking at the high prices trying to figure out what's
going on,"" says Jesus Arredondo, spokesman for the state-sanctioned entity 
that
runs the state's day-ahead energy auction, the California Power Exchange in
Pasadena, Calif.
These prices have remained high despite the best efforts of public officials.
For instance, the organization that runs the state's electric grid and is
responsible for keeping consumers constantly supplied with electricity has
reduced the maximum price it will pay for electricity this summer to $250 per
megawatt hour from $750. While this action has capped peak prices, it has also
caused an increase in the overall number of hours in which prices are 
abnormally
high.
Take Wednesday for instance. Prices for power in California never dropped 
below
$108 per megawatt hour, even for power contracted for delivery in the dead of
night, and the hourly price was at or above $200 in 13 of 24 hours despite 
only
moderately high demand.
California's problems are likely to step up pressure on Congress to pass 
omnibus
legislation which would provide uniform national rules for deregulated state
energy markets and make more efficient the interstate power-transmission 
system,
Mr. Clinton said Wednesday.
The administration has pushed for such a measure but the House Commerce
Committee, which has jurisdiction over the legislation, still appears 
deadlocked
on the details. It plans to hold a hearing in California on electricity-market
conditions there next month.

John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of 
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the 
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize 
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our 
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in 
our recent conference call.  

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  

We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, 
however it is uncertain if this is achievable.

To clarify, and also getting back to Mark Taylor's argument that IBJ is one 
of the more sophisticated financial enterprises on the planet, and 
considering the fact that they have agreed to Enron being the Calculation 
Agent, is their argument that they are incapable of mark to market 
verification?  We calculate - we call for margin - they verify.

I am certain that they calculate mark to market positions with their other 
trading entities, and their argument that they can't do so for Enron is 
weak.  If they simply refuse a CSA, then we can deal with this as discussed 
in our phone conversation last week, but this argument of theirs should be 
something we can get around don't you think?

Mark-

Today, we received IBJ's responsive comments to the points that have been 
raised, which are set forth below for your review.

IBJ has stated ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  During our recent 
meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial 
institutions.  I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan 
from IBJ of roughly US$ 100,000,000.
Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his 
input.  

IBJ's specific responses are quoted below as follows:-

""Part 1

(a)  Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA.

(g)  We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as 
for a party, a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than before.

Part 3

We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only.

Part 4

(f)Even though deleting the word ""not"" in this provision, we can net the 
payments with respect to the same Transaction.   Due to our system 
incapability, we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or more 
Transactions in the same currency.

(h) Agreed.

Part 5

(a)  If your suggested language is included, a Non-defaulting Party has to 
continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation, 
which does not seem realistic.  We prefer to terminate Transactions when an 
Event of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which 
releases a technical error.

(c)  Agreed.

(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.

(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's 
branch offices. If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan, we will amend 
this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office.  We heard 
that in most jurisdictions of the world,  it is not effective to set-off the 
obligations between a party and the other party's Affiliate.

(i)  Agreed to include this provision.

(j)  We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligations 
without the other party's consent to even its Affiliates. We might not get 
approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might 
cause an additional payment of tax or other cost.

(k)  We will revert to you later.

(m)  Agreed.

(n)  Agreed to include this provision.

Part 6

We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity 
Transactions in the respective Confirmations.""

I look forward to receiving your input.  I note that Jane McBride has started 
here at Enron Japan, therefore I have copied her on this correspondence.  
Looking forward to seeing you in Houston soon.

Best regards,

John

Thanks for your input.  I agree with all of the comments you have raised.  As 
to Part 5 (n), the use of the English language is not uncommon in Japan with 
regard to these types of arrangements and should be insisted upon for 
transactions under the ISDA documentation.

I think that it will be useful to better understand Japanese market practice 
relating to the use of the Credit Support Annex. Therefore, I have asked 
Baker & McKenzie to provide a clear picture as to the situation in Japan and 
will provide this information upon receipt.

Following receipt of John Suttle's comments, I will prepare the response to 
IBJ based on the points that have been raised by both you and John.

		 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

 I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it 
looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow 
and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While we 
have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a 
master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many 
of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have 
trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be 
helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a 
mark-up.

Following are my points responsive to their revisions:

Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the 
possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for 
example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy 
this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk 
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a 
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells 
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed are 
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we 
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word ""not"" in this provision, IBJ is saying that 
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not net 
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to 
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to one 
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or ENA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to 
receive payments due even though technically in default under another 
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other 
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be 
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same 
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if not 
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city. 

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can not 
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go 
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market 
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed to 
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each 
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never 
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we 
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like 
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If 
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it but 
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while 
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency 
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is 
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty that 
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money.  
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without our 
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rather 
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate is 
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it 
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them 
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisions 
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a 
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it) 
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  I 
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discuss 
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like 
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given the 
volume and nature of their comments.

I have just had IBJ on the phone again asking for a progress report on the 
ISDA docs.  Have we managed to move this forward, bearing in mind Labour Day, 
since he is very keen to commence trading on Monday next.  He suggested that 
he would be comfortable in trading prior to the implementation of the docs 
for these initial trades as per Jonathon's previous comments in past mails.  
Are we comfortable doing this if we cannot resolve the issues on the docs?

They are also very keen to see the draft confirms for the proposed trade 
(Steve, I have just heard from Rob in the vid conf that the proposed volumes 
may prove difficult to take on the books??).  Please advise as to our 
capability so that I can convey this to him in the morning.

those analysts rants, and maybe I'd be happy for a while..... but
February
made me shiver, with every option they delivered, bad news in the

I couldn't believe the pending doom, I can't remember if I cried when I
read
about Skilling step aside but something nauseated  me from deep inside,
the
day, that Enron shareholders, cried. So...
CHORUS

"I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.

While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators ""may"" have withheld power, the basic argument is that ""DEREGULATION ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED.""   In addition, the paper states that ""MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHES TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION.""

In addition, California's response of ""DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS.""

I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis.  The CBO finds that ""WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET""..because ""FEATURES OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET.""

Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (together with our details of the policy failures).  This CBO report clearly undercuts the ""political"" arguments of the Davis administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible long-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consumers.

Subject to receiving more information, my recommendation is not to make a ""federal case"" out of the CBO report.  In other words, we should be aware of Dave's comments and concerns, but I would not suggest we contact CBO or anything like that.  If others think some response is needed, this is the type of thing EPSA should do, if done at all.  We should refrain from carrying water for the generators.  The report is being written up favorably in the trade press I have seen, largely because the CBO report says that what California did was NOT deregulation and thus the crisis was not caused by deregulation.  That ""60,000 feet"" view is worth a mint politically and while there are parts of the report that we differ with, I think its value far outweighs its blemishes.

John,

My take on the paper is that is wasn't particularly flattering to the generators/suppliers.  It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had addressed and that the ISO did not implement.  It is reasonably sound as far as ""history of the formation"" is concerned but some of their statements and conclusions I have to take issue with.  

Off the top of my head, they use the term ""idle"".  In my mind as a utility person, idle means available but just not running.  As they apply the term, they use it to describe any unit not running, either because it was forced off or was off for maintenance, I realize it's only a word, but it carries many different inferences, mostly unfavorable.  Early in the document they refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding supply to manipulate the price.  They never substantiate this claim.  In fact as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case showing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high prices, but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have understood the full picture.  They also don't really touch on the lack of supply side response.  According to Greg Conlin, the President of the P{UC when AB1890 in CA was designed, was a key part to the equation, they spend little, if any time discussing how this part of the puzzle never developed.  They also give insuffucient explaination of the ""per-se"" reasonablness clause....There are other more specific instances I can send to you at a later time.

I left my notes on the document back in my office, I can give you a summary early next week if that's OK.  I am currently fact gathering about PJM and NYISO congestion models with Steve Walton for RTO West...

Thanks,

Dave

Like most sources of information in DC, folks on the Hill pick and choose those that support their pre-conceived policy notions.  Having said that, the CBO is a respected source of information.  I read the summary and have the full report in my ""to read"" stack.  The summary actually made the report sound largely favorable from our perspective.  It wouldn't hurt to have a little more detail on the problems with the report as you see them so we can decide whether we need to do anthing or just be ready should a CBO witness testify at a hearing.

John,

How much weight and influence do papers published by the CBO have with policy makers there in DC?  I have some concerns about the general tone and some of the conclusions contained in the report.  If these papers draw little attention, then , no harm, no foul.  But if policy makers tend to draw from these papers, then perhaps we need to correct or address some of the issues raised in this report.

Thanks,

Subject:	Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis - by the CBO

Jim,

Last week some time I had been on the distribution of a paper published by the CBO entitled, ""Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis"".  In reviewing this paper several things struck me.  The paper is not particularly accurate, they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse, they ignore the lack of implementation of demand-side response programs that were supposed to be a integral part of the AB1890 and they use inappropriate terms, such as ""Idle"" when describing plants that were unavailable because of maintenance or repair.

My reason for writing is to ask you, how politically influential is a paper like this?  Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on problems, especially with those associated with the problems experienced in CA?  And if so, because of some of the mis-representations it contains, do we want to develop a fact sheet for our folks in DC to use to refute some of the claims made in this paper?

Thanks,

Dave

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

In  its  Order  on  Rehearing  issued  by  FERC  in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission rejected the NYISO's request for rehearing
to  continue  to  bill for operating reserves based on the $2.52 bid cap in
effect  for  the period March 1 through March 27, 2000.  FERC also directed
the NYISO to re-calculate operating reserve charges for that period without
the bid cap in place.

On Friday, November 16, 2001, the NYISO filed a stay/extension with FERC in
order  to postpone any re-billing pending an appeal of the FERC decision in
the  Federal Appeals Court. In the event that FERC does not act in a timely
manner   on  the  NYISO's  request,  the  upcoming  March  2000  settlement
adjustment,  expected  to  be  issued  on  or  about December 7, 2001, will
reflect  this  re-calculation in accordance with the FERC Order.  The total
amount  of  this  adjustment  is  approximately  $27 million, which will be
allocated  to the appropriate suppliers and LSE's for the period of March 1
through March 27, 2000.

California Stiffs Gore's Hatchet Men  
California's state controller, Democrat Kathleen Connell,  says she won't sign any checks for those $30,000-a-month Gore hatchet men hired  by bumbling Gov. Gray Davis to try to blame others for the state's energy  fiasco.  
""I would like assurance that their work is directly related to solving  California's energy crisis and not the political strategy that [Mark] Fabiani  and [Chris] Lehane have built a reputation for through their work at the White  House,"" Connell said, Fox News reported today.  
Connell says she supports a lawsuit filed Monday in Sacramento by Lewis  Uhler, president of National Tax Limitation Committee, to block ""consultant""  fees to the two former advisers to failed presidential candidate Al Gore.  
""They have a conflict of interest that may be terminal to their employment,""  Uhler said. ""These are clearly not electricity experts. Their background  suggests they have been hired to be damage control folks for a beleaguered  governor."""
"Attached is my first pass of the warranty language that Mike previously 
submitted.  This markup has been reviewed by Kay but I have not had a chance 
to get feedback from Sheila or Enron's commercial team.

Hi Louise,

I asked each of my directs to consider 3 levels of cuts.  I told them this is strictly an exercise at this point and that we haven't been given targets (trying to keep the emotion down).  The three levels were:

 A. Remove capability for new projects but retain a reasonable ability to continue growth of our current application suite.

 B. Reduce to minimal development capability.  Retain ability for operations and minor enhancements to applications.

 C. Cut to life-support level.  Retain ability to operate the applications and fix bugs.

The cut levels are as follows:
A. Reduce by 11 (to 129)
B. Reduce by 21 (to 108)
C. Reduce by 17 (to 91)

Jeff Johnson placed himself in the A cuts, though I removed him from that cut thinking I can talk him out of it.  He is in the B cut.

Steve Stock placed himself in the B cuts.

Michael Guadarrama placed himself in the B cuts.  He said he would probably leave if the A cuts were made but would wait until we got through the transition.

Hopefully we can hold this together.

I'll try to call you to discuss.

Thanks.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave,s  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to 
travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The 
program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting 
an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, 
fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an 
opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of 
adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 
96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 
percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through 
the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing 
all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent 
families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to 
help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a 
non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to 
bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 
281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston,s  Kidsave 
program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  
available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp 
week is Monday through Friday.

Kay:

E-mail delivery sounds fine.  Per the letter agreement, we need to submit
the final form of the Turbine Contract and a blacklined version of same
reflecting changes from the form attached to the letter agreement.   I have
assumed that the version to be attached to the letter agreement is the
version #3 that you sent by e-mail on April 3 @12:45 to Greg Lang et al., as
I believe this was the last draft circulated prior to execution of the
letter agreement.

Would you prefer to send these documents to Greg directly or would you like
for me to handle this?  It appears that the blackline attached to this
e-mail is the appropriate blackline (comparison of version 3 to version 4),
so please confirm and let me know if you would like me to send those
documents along to Greg.  Our transmittal will officially reference that
""pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Letter Agreement, we have enclosed....""

Please advise as to handling.  Thanks.

"Chris:
Thanks for your prompt response.  I think that we do need to register the 
charge document which in this case would be the confirmation that will be 
executed. Can you provide me with an estimate of the total cost?

Does everyone at Enron agree?

Caroline,
I will redraft the Bermuda confirm to change from LC's to cash and send to 
you.  Please make sure that the counterparty is aware that we plan to 
register/file the confirm in Bermuda.

		 Subject: Re: Cash Collateral


Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of ""perfecting"" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  There is no time limit on such registration.  
However, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

I trust that the above is of some assistance.  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Subject: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister

Steve,

Over the last month the Japanese regulators and Government have come to the 
realization that the electricity deregulation initiatives implemented in 
March of this year have not stimulated competition in the manner in which 
they had expected. MITI and the Government are currently examining why the 
initiatives implemented in March are falling short of expectations and 
looking to move the 2003 review forward to next year. There are currently two 
multi party committees looking at the energy sector. The ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party also has one committee looking at energy. In addition, MITI 
is in the process of forming a new advisory group comprising academics to 
consider the next stage of deregulation. 

As you are aware, we have been working the regulatory aspects through MITI 
and the US Government for some time now with a degree of success - in fact, 
the majority of our 12 month goals have been achieved. Recently, with the 
addition of Kimura, we have increased our level of contact with senior 
political figures in Japan.

Both MITI and the USG continue to seek Enron's views on issues relating to 
the current deregulation process and the way Enron wants to see electricity 
deregulation. We have recently addressed the parliamentary Deregulation 
Committee which reports to the Prime Minister and regularly provide 
educational presentations to MITI on issues relevant to deregulation. 
Further, senior political figures are now recognizing that Enron can assist 
in the deregulation process in a positive way.

What we appear to have in Japan in the electricity sector is a reasonably 
clean slate and the opportunity to have a major say in how things should be 
structured in the future.

Ken Lay's links with the Republican Presidential campaign has received media 
attention in Japan and it is believed in Government circles here that he will 
receive a cabinet position if Gov. Bush is elected. As a result, Mr Lay 
currently carries a great deal of weight in senior Government circles in 
Japan. In the period prior to the Presidential election, we have an ideal 
opportunity to get our message across at the highest levels of the Japanese 
Government through Mr Lay.

A meeting between Mr Lay and Prime Minister and other senior Government 
members would significantly increase Enron's profile in Japan and assist in 
conveying our vision for the next phase of deregulation.

If Mr Lay were to visit Japan, possibly in late October or early November, we 
would also look at coordinating the Tokyo office opening with the visit and 
arrange a number of high level commercial meetings. Prime Minister Mori and 
the US Ambassador have already expressed an interest in attending the office 
opening. 

Both Joe Hirl and I would like to speak with you further about the above. 
When would be a convenient time?

kind regards

I saw this morning that 66 Winter Wheat had an option pending =(   I love that house!  But, we are not in a position yet to make a decision about moving, so I guess it wasn't meant to be.

I just wanted to let you know that we appreciated you coming out to show us some homes the other weekend and following-up so promptly with your e:mail on other houses.  If we do decide that we're coming to the Woodlands, we will be calling you to look for a house.  We really enjoyed meeting you and think that it would be great to work with you to look for a home.

Thank you!

"I received word late last week that Dave Gorte (works for Rick Buy) is 
setting up a meeting to discuss the process under which EES will have its 
deals considered by RAC.

I think that we should be in the meeting (and will probably be invited).  
Marcia informed me that this will take place sometime this upcoming week 
(when I am in South America).  I am not sure who they will invite from Govt 
Affairs.

I think that we should argue that the following package of information be 
pre-assembled and provided to Govt Affairs when EES brings a deal to RAC:

1. List of each position by utility and by rate class within the deal 

2. Regulated Rate forecasts by utility and by rate class for each position in 
the deal.  Not just the ""scalars"" but also the absolute $/Mwh.

3. For each impacted position, the key assumptions contained within the 
curves - 
 a. deregulation date (if any)
 b. stranded cost roll-off date (if any)
 c. standard offer end date (if any)
 d. other rate reduction dates and amounts (if any)

4. Revenue side or Cost side contract terms that impact the deal (for 
example, movement in pricing terms given some event)

I also think that we should have at least 3 working days to review this 
package.  

If anyone can think of anything else that would ease our analysis, I would be 
game.

Thanks.

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs."

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

Subject:	No deal - Time to move !

All, 

After very serious consideration and having the experience of the first quarter,  I have decided the following:

1) Personally, I am starting the building of the public model beginning of June. I will follow a different methodological approach than the rest of the team but we are going to have the same common target for the 15th of July deadline.

2) The first suite of models will be ready beginning of July.

3) During implementation, I will be reporting to Scott Salmon and I am prepared to accept feedback on modelling (technical issues) from the following people (strictly): Iris Mack, Steve Leppard, Jagjit Dhaliwal, Slava Danilov, Vasant Shanbhogue, Bryan Seyfried, Amitava Dhar, Vince J Kaminski (The order of the names is random).  

4) Scott Salmon will communicate with the traders to make sure that we meet their requirements.

5) The traders should have all the time they need to assess the performance of the models and provide their valuable feedback. 

6) Extension of the models will be a continuous process (More data, more models).

7) Personally, I consider it absolutely beneficial  if I work closely with Houston and London Research from now on, so we can make sure that we do not miss anything going forward. If necessary, I am prepared to come to Houston and discuss technical issues about models.

8) If I have any problems to proceed with the current plan, I am going to ask for rotation as soon as possible. If this is not possible, I am going to leave the company immediately.
 
9) For those who invited me in the past in private rooms and asked me to slow down, I have to tell them that if this happens again I am going to proceed with an official complaint.

I am really sorry if I am being a bit agressive here, but I am sure that this the last chance for many of us. 

That's for now -

Best Regards,

g.

Subject:	RE: Models and Data from the Loan Pricing Corporation (A Reuters Company)



Hi,

	Today I met with John Dowling - a Vice President  of the Loan Pricing Corporation (LPC) .  LPC may present another potential set of options for ECT's data and/or public and private firm models needs.

	More specifically, John stated that LPC offers the following products/services:
	
?	A US data base - archives date back to 1988.  This database has various fields describing default and nondefault loans, etc.
?	A public and private firm model (both) for an annual subscription rate of $75,000.  These models estimate PDs for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.
?	The firm is beginning to collect data in European countries.


	John will be sending us further details about the analytical techniques used to develop their public and private firm models.  In addition, he will send us information on the various fields used in their database.



Regards,
Iris

Dear Vince,

Thanks for writing back.?? I am glad to hear that Shane Green is working 
there and doing so well.? Please give him my regards.? 

Let's plan on having you speak for our Gamma Iota Sigma dinner on the evening 
of 2/23.? It is my understanding that you are going to be in town anyway for 
John Martin's ""new economy"" seminar.? Will you be needing a hotel 
accommodation for that evening?? If so, please let me know and I will have my 
secretary arrange accommodations for you.

Concerning class presentations, I am curious when whether we can try to 
arrange a date.? I am teaching two undergraduate sections of a business risk 
management course from 11-12:20 and 12:30-1:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays this 
spring.?? I also am teaching a graduate version of the same course from 
3:30-4:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but when you come I will probably have 
you speak to the undergraduate classes and have my graduate students attend 
either of those sessions.? The spring semester starts January 9 and ends May 
1, and the following dates are already taken for other speakers, exams, or 
spring break: 

Thursday, February 15 - Midterm exam 1
Tuesday, March 6 and Thursday, March 8 - no class (spring break)
Thursday, March 15 - presentation on risk adjusted discount rate 
methodologies by Dr. Richard Derrig, Automobile Insurers Bureau of 
Massachusetts
Tuesday, April 3 - Midterm exam 2

Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to 
schedule a presentation.? Considering the fact that the presentation would be 
scheduled for around the middle of the day, it would probably be technically 
possible for you to make your visit into a day trip (back and forth from 
Houston) in case if you are pressed for time.? Continental flies here from 
Houston, but unfortunately the morning flight doesn't come in until 10:45 
a.m., which would be too late for a presentation to the 11 a.m. class.

Thanks again,

Jim

Sorry for the delay in responding to your message. I was traveling
extensively
and was overwhelmed with many different projects.

I shall be glad to speak at the Gamma Iota Sigma dinner. Unfortunately, 
cannot make
a presentation to your class (it would require leaving the office for two
days in a row).

I can, however, promise to come on another day and speak to your students.

I hope everything is going well for you. By the way, your former student,
Shane Green, has joined us
for 12 month and is doing exceptionally well.

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance
& Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you
as our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate  and
graduate students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have
in mind is a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring
to my LSU classes.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to
seeing you once again.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

We have been tracking books that are not officialized on a daily basis.  This 
list goes to Sally Beck and is reviewed at the end of each week by Rick Buy.  
Rick has been vocal about taking corrective action if people forget to 
officialize.   It is imperative that we take extra care to ensure that all 
books are marked official each night before going home.  A control process 
should be implemented immediately to absolutely avoid being on the list.  

Please contact me if you have any questions (x-35242).

Jim-

I would like to take you up on your offer to have a private meeting with you and Rick Shapiro to discuss the different activities that took place in Enron's Government Affairs office in  Austin.  Considering Austin is one of our satellite offices, I think it would greatly benefit your department to get an insider's perspective on the office, its senior management, and the different interactions/complications that took place over my 5 month tenure in Austin.  

While I realize that ordinarily individuals at your level would not solicit the feedback of a 3rd year analyst, I feel that I have relevant information that could help you better access the situation in Austin.

My extension is 39837.

Regards,

CKL

     Saturday, April 21, 9:00 am
  
Enron is the proud sponsor of this year,s Multiple Sclerosis Walk in Oregon.  
As a first time sponsor for this event, Enron will receive tremendous 
exposure in our community.  We would like to encourage all employees to 
participate in this event to be held on Saturday, April 21, 9:00 am.  Dollars 
raised by this Walk fund local health-related and educational services as 
well as help support national research efforts to find the cause and cure for 
this disease.

Each employee should have received a &Be A Lifesaver8 notice about this event 
with the MS Society Walk brochure attached.  Portland employees of Enron 
Broadband Services and Enron North America have partnered to form TEAM ENRON. 
 Our goal is to have one of the largest teams in Portland - we want over 200 
TEAM ENRON members!

Our team is not just limited to Enron employees.  We encourage all employees, 
contractors, vendors, family members (including children) and friends.  This 
will be a fun gathering for TEAM ENRON and offers entertainment, food and 
activities for children.  

If you are interested in participating, please provide your REGISTRATION form 
(on the pamphlet or paper you received) to Jessica Burry or Anna Mehrer. We 
want to start counting up the number of TEAM ENRON members in order to keep 
everyone posted on our progress.

A Kick-Off meeting for all Portland employees will be held in early March.  
Incentive prizes are awarded through the MS Walk; Enron will also be awarding 
some great incentives to TEAM ENRON members.  Stay tuned for more details.

If you have any questions or you need extra REGISTRATION forms, pledge cards, 
etc., contact Jessica Burry (503-464-3800) or Anna Mehrer (503-464-3834).

Relative to the Panda deal,

1.  What feedback have you received on the Portland legal question?

2.  What is the status of the GE breakout contract for the LV units?  Panda 
has asked (twice) for this and I would like to give them a timeline for its 
delivery.  We will need a day or two to redact the sensitive commercial data 
before delivery to Panda.

3.  I will call Panda this morning and float the $250K exclusivity fee

4. Will the draft Letter Agreement be available today?  I have told Panda 
that this document would come first with the Facility Agreement and LLC 
Agreement to follow.

5. Stephen Thome is scheduled to be in Houston this afternoon.  I will bring 
him up to speed.

FRANCE:
PDVSA sees Enron LNG deal soon, seeks gas funds.

06/07/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

NICE, France, June 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA) said on Wednesday it expected to sign a contract with U.S.
energy company Enron by June 30 to construct an LNG plant in Jose with an
annual capacity of two million tonnes.

It has signed an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell , ExxonMobil and Mitsubishi
to begin construction of a four-million-tonne LNG plant in Paria by end of the
year.
""We could sign the contract to start the project (with Enron) by June 30...The
plant should be operational by 2004,"" Domingo Marsicobetre, chairman of
PDVSA's gas division, told reporters at the world gas congress in Nice.

""The project development agreement was signed with Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi
last month. In September we will declare the viability of the project and then
create a (separate) Venezuelan LNG company (to run it). The milestone is
December,"" Marsicobetre said.

The Paria plant was expected to be operational by 2005, he said, adding that
the consortium hoped to explore further oil and gas in the Orinoco delta
platform, south of Trinidad, to add a second and third train to the plant. ""In
August a decision will be taken by the shareholders,"" he said.

PDVSA would supply associated gas to the Jose plant, in which it would also be
a shareholder. The facility aimed to export mainly to the Caribbean and the
United States, he said.

The Paria plant was designed to export LNG to the north-east United States,
Spain and Portugal.

Marsicobetre said PDVSA Gas was seeking between $6 billion and $10 billion in
private investment to develop the production of non-associated gas, its LNG
projects and the Venezuelan gas grid.

Expanding non-associated gas and the gas grid would each absorb 30 percent of
that total sum while the two LNG facilities would need some $2.6 million. The
cost of developing oil and gas production in the delta platform was not
included in that calculation, PDVSA Gas executive Nelson Mava told reporters.

""If we move in a fast track we can have twice that investment,"" Mava said.

He said Venezuela, the world's seventh largest gas producer with proven
reserves of 146 trillion cubic feet (tcf), was counting on the development of
non-associated gas to meet rising domestic demand.

Venezuelan gas consumption was forecast to more than double by 2009, rising to
4.2 billion cubic feet a day from the current level of 1.8 billion. That meant
the percentage of gas in the fuel mix would rise to 55 percent from 42, Mava
said.

Of the current 142 tcf output, 132 tcf was associated and 14 non-associated.
But there were unexplored reserves of non-associated gas of 6-20 tcf onshore
and 40-60 offshore, he said.

chicken and egg problem--I think I'd rather try to stimulate customer demand

purchased power, even with piracy stand-by rates of UDCs), and then 
simulanteously get/put pressure on reducing stand-by rates. So---your 
position, to answer your question, is unreasonable.

"Mike, Clint-

I've done some more research on water usage and have some revised consumption 
rates which are less than what I told you last week.

Using the rates that I have listed below, if you run 5 days/week (weekdays), 
16 hours/day (not 15 as I previously mentioned) say 6 am to 10 pm, at GE's 
worse case consumption rate (+20% margin) , the tank will just be empty 
Friday night (10 pm) at the end of the 16 hour run.  I then takes 
approximately 42 hours to refill the tank.  (filling is completed by late 
Sunday afternoon)

At GE's ""expected"" consumption rate (no margin), the consumption rate is so 
much better that you could potentially run for 15 days straight, at 16 
hours/day before you exhausted the tank.

Next week when we run the performance test, we will know exactly what the 
actual consumtion rates will be.  In addition, I think (hope) that there 
might be some additional capacity in the demin plant.  The 120 gpm number is 
the guarantee from the vendor and at that rate the water quality is better 
than what we need.  I'm going to see if I can get someone to increase the 
flowrate until we are just at the limits for water quality.  I'll let you 
know what that number is. 

I do agree with you in that extra demin capacity is a no brainer.  Hopefully 
by the end of next week, I will know exactly how much extra we would need.

By the way, there is one additional piece of info that I was informed of 
today.  I been told that there is some language in the participation 
agreement that says our variable O&M costs increases after we exceed 1300 
hours of operation.

Hope this helps.  If you have questions, give me a call.  I'm in Austin all 
week.

Thanks,
Eric Booth

Consumption/Make-up Rates:
Demin plant make-up rate: 120 gpm
Demin Tank capacity:  300,000 gallons

Maximum or worse case Consumption rate of the plant with all four units 
running full load:  236 gpm  (this has a +20% margin included by GE)
Therefor, when the plant is running, net drawdown rate on the tank is 
(236-120) = 116 gpm

Expected consumption rate for the plant with all four units running at full 
load:  197 gpm (this does not have any extra margin included)
Therefor, when the plant is running, net drawdown rate on the tank is 
(197-120) = 77 gpm"

All,
?
Attached is my  current draft of the long-awaited white paper.? This version 
does not  contain significant sales language (why this is sorely needed) or 
advantages  over competing approaches, nor does it discuss the pros and cons 
of options  within the proposal.? Please do not circulate this  version.
?
Apologies for the  delay, but I fell behind due to both business and personal 
crises.? I would  hope to distribute a version including your input to the 
group before Monday's  S&P meeting.? Unfortunately, that means getting 
comments back to me by  Thursday preferably or Friday a.m. at latest.? Feel 
free to edit right in  the document (redlining is turned on). Enron has not 
yet endorsed this  paper.

   An exaggerated, especially glamorized, estimate of oneself; conceit.

[From French bovaryisme, after Emma Bovary, a character in Flaubert's
novel Madame Bovary.]

   collective unconscious. She is, and can be, everyone.""
   Alan Franks, France's best-kept secret, The Times of London,
   Aug 12, 1995.

This week's theme: fictional characters who live on in the dictionary.

With respect to Deutsche Bank (""""DB""), we have one credit issue remaining, DB 
would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as 
Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat 
hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured 
loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill 
Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this 
remaining issue.

With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was 
so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was 
sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message and the means of delivery.  On the means of delivery, I 
am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.  Is 
there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a 
letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be 
sent)?  Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead 
in to the article?  

With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Sara

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks
Simon

"? Sources report that SoCal Chairman, John Bryson, and Governor Davis were 
roommates together at Stanford in the early 60's.  This longstanding 
relationship may provide some explanation for SoCal's willingness to 
negotiate with the governor and the governor's determination to reach a 
solution with SoCal.

? Voluntary bankruptcy reportedly is ""not an option"" for SoCal.  However, the 
possibility remains that SoCal's creditors will take them into involuntary 
bankruptcy.  If the state's purchase of the transmission assets is delayed, 
it appears that the possibility of this occurring will increase.

? However, the agreement by the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets 
is actually a Memorandum of Understanding. The agreement reportedly was 
rushed for ""political purposes,"" but the details still remain to be decided.  
It is possible, the 60-day deadline stated in the memorandum may have to be 
extended.

? PG&E reportedly refused to part with its transmission assets in its 
negotiations with the governor.  PG&E makes more money on transmission than 
distribution of power, the opposite is true for SoCal."

Please see the attached file and notes on this years pigging activites from

They have yet to receive any historical sampling data either.  Please

"I set up the simulation model.  The margin follows a mean-reverting process.

I seperarted the data into two category, margin >0.04  and margin <0.04.
Then I estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets.
I got higher mean reverting speed than that I estimated using the whole data 
set.

The high MR speed surpresses the probability at high payout side.
Since the MR speed is sensitive to where I divide the data, so Bob will run 
a few senarios.

I put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium 
calculation, so the
the result in E18 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal 
pricing.
I also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar 
worth.

Relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread 
option
approach that Bob and Lee set up.  

Look like we got a reasonable model.



Stinson:
I'd like to have you check my set up for the simulation model.

Lee and Douglas:
You can play with the model, and let me know what do you think.

Bob:
We need  run different price curve senarios using the simulation model.   
plus different MR speed.

Bob and Sarah,

Further to our conversation on Wednesday night, we have identified the top 10-15 counterparties from both a terminated and non-terminated perspective that we want to begin working on.  Of the non-terminated, 6 are counterparties that should be sent demand letters.

Shari Mao will be providing you today a list of those counterparties that owe us money and should be sent demand letters.  Lynn Shivers will be pulling these contracts as well as those for the overall top 10 to 15 and we will begin the binder process and get you copies of the contracts as soon as possible.  We will also do the credit agg check for collateral and any overlap with other commodities.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin"

 First of the month  industrials are coming along fine.  I will finalize my 
pathing tomorrow, Thursday,  and set up buybacks and swings by the
    end of day Friday.
 
     The industrial ""Buyback & Deficiency Deals"" worksheet  has captured the 
necessary data to help Gas Control & the on-call scheduler as well as  
      myself and Client Services.
      I  will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day Friday.

Subject: Industrials

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

"Daren,
I'm not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me.  If you 
are not, could you please let me know who I need to speak to.
For meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3/00 production forward, this deal is set 
up under the wrong Sitara #, therefore the volumes are not pulling in Sitara.
  The sitara # that it is currently attached to is # 149421 which this deal 
was only for 1/00 production.  The new Sitara number that we should be using 
is
Sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and Sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032 
).  I have attached an example  to help see what I am talking about.
( this was for 2/00 production )
Could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is 
something that I need to do.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties."

Subject: Story of the ant and the grasshopper

THE CLASSIC VERSION -
    The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a
fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
in the cold.

THE MODERN VERSION -
 The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a
fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.
    Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and
demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while
others are cold and starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures
of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable
home with a table filled with food.
    ""America"" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?
Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
when they sing ""It's Not Easy Being Green.""
    Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS
Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything
they Can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves
by Those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill
refers
to it as ""Temperatures of the 80's.""
    Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where
the news stations film the group singing ""We shall overcome"". Jesse then
has
the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.
    Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has
gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax
hike on the ant to make him pay his ""fair share"".
    Finally, the EEOC drafts the ""Economic Equity and Anti-Ant Act"",
retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to
hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay
his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.
    Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a
Defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of
federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare
recipients who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM
when there are no talk shows scheduled. The ant loses the case.
    The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of
The ant's food while the government house he is in, which just happens to
be
the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't maintain it. The
ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
bought
by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing
before a wildly applauding group of Democrats announcing that a new era of
""fairness"" has dawned in America.
    The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house,
now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once
peaceful neighborhood.

Remember to Vote .!!

Our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for Tuesday, December 11 at 11:30 AM.    So dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation.  The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A).   The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room).  Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating.  

Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1.  We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have.    

At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing.   We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets.  All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered.  You need not be present to win.

Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey.  My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family.  The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen.  Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up.  While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time.  At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence.

I'm looking forward to our get together next week.  To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season.

I know I've been heavily bearish and saying that a close above $19.40 would get
me back into a neutral tone, but I'm going to stick with even the near term bear
view for one more day. The market is reacting bearishly to what I see as neutral
stats. Distillate demand is high, due to run cuts and exports, but the
fundamental window of opportunity may have passed us by, By that I mean that the
traditional late Q1 rally is usually brought on by run cuts combined with cold
weather. Weather is not cooperating and gasoline has been flowing over here.
Price action for the past three days has been firm, especially the past two with
solid spread action. Still can't get behind the move, fighting it a bit, a
strong settle today has to change the short term bear strategy. I am still
extremely worried about the possibility of Russian oil companies ignoring the
OPEC quota and jumping over themselves to raise hard currency.

Northwest Natural In Talks With Enron Over Portland Utility

Enron Corp. is in advanced discussions to sell its Portland General Electric utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $1.8 billion in cash and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give Enron a minority stake in Northwest, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The discussions are at a very delicate stage, and some important points need to be finalized, these people caution. The current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn't a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could be announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to assume roughly $1 billion in debt.
Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment. 
If a transaction is consummated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agreement to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell apart in part because of the California energy crisis. 
A purchase of Portland General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a market capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more than 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Wash. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon. 
The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whose executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwest's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating officer of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. 
By buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when prices are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people familiar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is somewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transaction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in Northwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the transaction with debt and equity offerings. 
Shares of Northwest Natural were trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10. 
For Enron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-year ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility business proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selling off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And California's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for Enron to do business. 
Enron, which also owns a major gas-transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and businesses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of physical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere. 
It isn't clear where Enron will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale. Its broadband telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it would invest $250 million in it this year, down from a formerly projected $750 million.

a planned sale to Sierra Pacific Resources collapsed.

LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Enron Corp is in advanced talks to sell its Oregon-based Portland General utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co for $1.8 billion, the Wall Street Journal's online edition reported. 
Citing people familiar with the matter, it said talks were at a delicate stage and financing could be a problem for Northwest, which has a market value of only about $650 million.
But a deal could be announced in the next few days with Northwest assuming also some $1 billion of debt, it said. 
Earlier this year, Enron's plans to sell Portland to Sierra Pacific Resources Corp broke down amid the California power crisis. 
In the aftermath of that deal's collapse, industry sources said Britain's Scottish Power Plc , which owns another Oregon-based utility PacifiCorp, had also held talks to buy Portland.

Enron May Sell Portland for $2.8 Billion, WSJ Says (Update3)

Enron May Sell Portland for $2.8 Billion, WSJ Says (Update3)

     (Adds sale of oil field in India in sixth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, is in advanced talks to sell its Portland General
Electric utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $2.8
billion in cash, stock and assumed debt, the Wall Street Journal
said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.

     Houston-based Enron ``is getting close to another
transaction'' involving Portland General, Chief Executive Kenneth
Lay said at a conference in New York last month. Enron spokesman
Mark Palmer wasn't immediately available to comment.

     Enron has been trying to sell the utility for more than a
year as it focuses on trading. A $3.1 billion sale to Sierra
Pacific Resources collapsed in April because the California power
crisis made it hard to win approval. Northwest Natural Gas serves
more than half a million Oregon and Washington residents.

     Enron shares declined as much as 2.5 euros, or 6.6 percent,
35.5 ($33) in Germany. They've have fallen 60 percent this year
and dropped 1.2 percent to $33.10 in U.S. trading yesterday.

     Some terms of the transaction, which includes about $1.5
billion in assumed debt, still need to be completed, the newspaper
said. An agreement on the sale of the Portland, Oregon-based
utility may be announced in the next few days, the Journal said.

                          Shift in Focus

     Enron earlier this week agreed to sell oil and natural-gas
fields in India to U.K.'s BG Group Plc for $388 million as it
moves away from owning assets such as power plants and pipelines
to concentrate on trading and brokering energy and other
commodities.

     At a price of $2.8 billion, Portland General would fetch 1.2
times sales for Enron, less than the average of four times revenue
paid for U.S. utilities this year, Bloomberg data show.

     Mergers and acquisitions in the energy industry surged at the
start of the year as electricity and natural-gas prices reached a
record high. Since then, prices of power and gas have slumped, in
turn deterring companies from making purchases.

     U.S. natural-gas prices, after reaching a record high at the
end of last year, have since plunged 76 percent to $2.413 for each
million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

     Portland General, which Enron bought in 1997 as a platform to
sell power into California's deregulating market, has 725,027
customers in 51 cities, according to the company's Web site.
Portland, Oregon-based Northwest Natural said in July second-
quarter profit more than doubled to $4.3 million amid cooler
weather and customer growth.


USA: Northwest Natural increases quarterly common div.

10/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

PORTLAND, Ore., Oct 5 (Reuters) - Northwest Natural Gas Co. , a utility serving Oregon and Washington, on Friday said its board has increased the company's quarterly dividend on its common stock to 31.5 cents from 31 cents a share. 
All dividends, including regular quarterly dividends on the company's outstanding series of preferred and preference stock, will be paid Nov 15 to shareholders of record on Oct 31, Northwest Natural said in a statement.
Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Reiten said the higher dividend is supported by the company's positive financial outlook including solid customer growth, additional earnings potential from the natural gas storage and electric generation markets, and continuing cost savings. 
The Wall Street Journal's online edition, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Friday that energy group Enron Corp. is in advanced talks to sell its Oregon-based Portland General utility to Northwest Natural for $1.8 billion. 
A spokesman for Northwest Natural, which serves about 530,000 customers in western Oregon and southwest Washington, could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Shares of Northwest Natural climbed $1.04, or 4.17 percent, to $25.99 on Thursday.

Enron to eliminate 500 jobs in Europe
LONDON -- Enron Corp. plans to cut 500 jobs in Europe, about 10 percent of its work force there, according to the company's chief executive in Europe, John Sherriff. 
The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Houston-based Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989. Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow progress toward market liberalization in the European Union. 



UK's BG Says Purchase Of Enron India Assets In Jeopardy

10/05/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. oil and gas company BG Group PLC (BRG) Friday said a disagreement has broken out that threatens to scuttle its $388 million acquisition of the Indian upstream assets of Enron Corp. (ENE), the U.S. energy group. 
Company spokesperson Nicole McMahon said BG's goal of acquiring Enron's operatorship of the offshore Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukti oil and gas field was being challenged by the fields' two other partners - state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) and Reliance Industries Ltd.(P.REL) - which jointly hold a 70% stake in the assets.
The Indian government wants ONGC and Reliance to have first option on operatorship, which was being pursued by both companies, an Indian newspaper reported Friday. 
When the transaction was announced Wednesday, BG made it clear it would walk away from the deal if it didn't get outright operatorship. 
McMahon said negotiations are continuing with ONGC and Reliance who ""have both expressed interest in being the operator of both fields."" 
""We believe we have the relevant skills and experience to be the operator,"" she said. She didn't, however, confirm that BG will pull out of the deal if didn't inherit Enron's operatorship of both Tapti and Panna/Mukti fields, located off India's west coast. 
""We would have to assess the reasons and the outcomes and consider our options,"" she said 
She said a decision will be made by the end of October. 
BG has portrayed the purchase of Enron Oil and Gas Ltd., or EOGIL, as significant, both boosting the group's global hydrocarbon production by up to 7%, and diversifying its distribution and pipeline interests in the fast-growing Indian energy market. 
About 1018 GMT, BG Group shares were flat at 272.75 pence.

INDIA PRESS: Enron Offshore Field Sale To BG May Fail

10/05/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S.-based Enron Corp.'s (ENE) plan to sell its 30% stake in two offshore oil and natural gas fields to British Gas India Pvt. Ltd. may fall through, the Economic Times reports. 
British Gas India is a unit of U.K.-based oil and natural gas company BG Group PLC (BRG).
According to the report, the Indian government has made it clear that the existing equity holders - Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) - will have the option to decide on the operatorship of the field once Enron exits. 
ONGC and Reliance together hold a 70% stake in the joint venture exploration project and have claimed operatorship rights over the Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields located in India's western coast. 
But British Gas India, which Wednesday announced its plans to take over Enron's offshore interests for $388 million, has made it clear that the deal would fall through if it didn't get the operatorship. 
""The governments role is restricted to that of a facilitator. Enron has written to us regarding their decision to exit and the new deal struck with British Gas,"" the report says, quoted India's Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Ram Naik. 
""However, it is for ONGC and Reliance who are existing equity holders to take a decision on the operatorship,"" Naik said. 
Naik said BG and Enron have struck the deal keeping in mind the existing condition and the possible consequences. ""It is for them to find a solution,"" Naik said, according to the report.

British Gas unlikely to get operatorship

10/05/2001
Financial Express
Copyright (C) 2001 Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Ltd.; Source: World Reporter (TM)

New Delhi, Oct 4: BRITISH Gas, which has bought Enrons stake in Panna-Mukta-Tapti oil and gas fields for a consideration of $388 million, is unlikely to get operatorship rights of the Panna, Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields. 
The whole deal may then fall apart as transfer of the operatorship rights for these fields was set as a major condition precedent by British Gas for acquiring Enrons 30 per cent stake in the oil venture.
Speaking to newspersons, petroleum minister Ram Naik said that British Gas would not have the first claim of becoming operator of Panna-Mukta-Tapti fields by just buying out Enrons stake. Enron is one of the partners in the in the joint venture oil property along 
with Reliance Industries and 
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). 
\""Even before the deal was clinched, all the three joint venture partners i.e., ONGC, Reliance and Enron had entered into an agreement according to which, if the operator company quits the 
joint venture, the first right of refusal lies with the other two partners. 
Therefore, the option of becoming operator in the oil property is with the remaining two partners in the joint venture,\"" Mr Naik said. 
British Gas India CEO Nigel Shaw told The Financial Express that the company would not accept anything short of full operatorship right. On being asked whether rotatory operatorship would be acceptable to the company, he said, \""No. It is too messy.\"" 
Mr Shaw had stated on Wednesday that the deal with Enron, to be transacted by October end, would fall through if it was not given the operatorship of these oil and gas field. 
Mr Naik said that ONGC, which holds a 40-per cent stake in these fields had staked its claims in these fields much before the deal was sealed between Enron and British Gas. 
Asked on the role of the government in the controversy, Mr Naik said that the Centre will act as a facilitator to help the joint venture companies reach an agreement.

INDIA: India Tata to finalise Enron bid in 3 wks - papers.

10/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 5 (Reuters) - India's Tata Power Co will finalise a bid in three weeks for U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 65-percent stake in troubled Dabhol Power Co, newspapers said on Friday. 
Officials at Tata Power , India's largest private utility, were not immediately available for comment.
Earlier this week, Tata managing director Adi Engineer told Reuters the company was in preliminary talks to buy Enron's controlling stake in Dabhol Power, which runs a $2.9 billion power project on India's west coast. 
A Dabhol spokesman said he had no comment. 
Dabhol's 740-MW generator in Maharashtra has been shut since June after its sole buyer, a loss-making local utility, stopped purchasing power and defaulted on payments. 
Enron then stopped work on a near-complete second phase generation unit that would have increased production capacity to 2,184 MW. 
The Financial Express said Indian lenders, who have an exposure of $1.4 billion to the project, will also finalise a revival package in three weeks. 
On Thursday representatives from the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) , the largest lender to the project, met finance ministry officials. 
Tata Power shares were down 3.16 percent at 93.60 rupees in early afternoon trade while the Bombay index was off 0.27 percent. 
The Hindu Business Line said the government had agreed in principle to a set of concessions suggested by the lenders to make the project viable. 
It said these included allotting special distribution zones which would buy at least half the power generated by the project's 1,444 MW second phase. 
The daily said this would involve ending the state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation's 1,400 MW sale of power to Maharashtra.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) won't buy U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) 65% stake in Dabhol Power Co., reports the Business Standard. 
BSES told the Bombay Stock Exchange it has no interest in the 2,184-megawatt Dabhol due to the ""uneconomical parameters of the project,"" the newspaper said.
Costing $2.9 billion, Dabhol, located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, is the single largest foreign investment in India to date. Newspaper Web site: www.business-standard.com

Tata Power seeks 3 weeks to firm up Dabhol offer
Our Economy Bureau NEW DELHI

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Tata Power is expected to firm up its offer for buying foreign equity in Dabhol Power Company in three weeks. 
The Indian lenders to the project, which will meet the Centre after three weeks, have asked for a heavy discount on the equity besides several concessions for taking over the $2.9 billion power project, government officials said.
Tata Power had earlier informed the lenders that it would require four weeks from the time discussions were initiated with Enron for buying its equity in Dabhol. 
At a meeting with the finance and power ministry officials here today, Indian financial institutions led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) said that payment by the prospective buyer for 85 per cent held by Enron, GE and Bechtel be made in instalments. 
Enron had earlier proposed to sell the foreign equity to domestic lenders in three instalments of 40 per cent, 50 per cent and 10 per cent extending up to January 1, 2003. Indian institutions have an exposure of over Rs 6,000 crore to the 2,184 mega watt project. 
Indian lenders have said that the dispute between all the stakeholders should be resolved before the sale of foreign equity. They have also suggested that the new promoter be provided relief like lowering the interest rate on borrowings, according DPC mega power project status and tax concessions. IDBI chairman PP Vora said after the three-hour long meeting that the lenders have been asked to explore alternatives and revert to the Centre after three weeks. Sources said that during the period, Indian lenders would prepare the roadmap for revival of the project. Negotiations with other possible suitors would also be initiated, they added. 
The institutions have said that the sale of equity be directly negotiated between Enron and the prospective buyers. While BSES has finally decided not to go ahead with its plans to take over DPC, National Thermal Power Corporation has said the project was not economically viable for it. Akin to Godbole Committee recommendations, the institutions have also recommended conversion of dollar-denominated debt to rupee loans to prevent tariff escalation. With DPC having already initiated arbitration proceedings against Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the Indian lenders would also look at the legality of sale while the issue was sub-judice. 
Today's meeting, convened by finance secretary Ajit Kumar, was attended by power secretary A K Basu, Vora and other senior executives from IDBI, ICICI, IDFC and State Bank of India apart from government officials.

Tata Power, Enron set for time-bound talks on DPC stake sale

10/05/2001
Financial Express
Copyright (C) 2001 Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Ltd.; Source: World Reporter (TM)

Mumbai, Sept 28: Tata Power and Enron are understood to be close to an agreement on entering into time-bound negotiations for Tata Power to buy Enrons stake in the troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC). A time-frame is being talked about in this connection, wherein no other party would be talked to and discussions would take place only between the two sides. 
Industry sources said the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), which is acting as a major facilitator to the stake sale, is a key player in the agreement between Tata Power and Enron. Discussions on the sale of the equity would directly take place between Tata Power and Enron, the sources said.
Tata Power managing director Adi Engineer confirmed his meeting with the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline in the presence of IDBI chairman PP Vora on Thursday. ""We have had a preliminary meeting where both the parties were apprised of the situation. We will have to wait for further developments,"" he added. 
According to sources, a time-bound agreement between Enron and Tata Power would provide an easy access to the various deals which Enron had struck at the time of commencment of work on the 2,184 mw Dabhol project. Tata Power would have to look into over 500 documents related to the Dabhol project and do the due deligence before giving a concrete offer to Enron. 
Tata Power, in a bid to expand its presence across the state, is also keen to hold hard, bargaining over the ""acceptable"" tariff of the project which would have to be restructured. Investment banking major JM Morgan Stanley, which is understood to be advising the Tatas on the deal, has already swung into action and has started collecting necessary back-up information from various sources including the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, for Tata Power. 
While no comment was available from Enron on the issue, financial institution sources said: ""Tata Power is interested in talks. It is a good thing if things work out between the two sides."" JM Morgan boss Nimesh Kampani had no comments to offer to The Financial Express when asked about the developments. 
The FIs, led by IDBI, had been keen that they would play the role of facilitator in the sale of the Enron stake in DPC, since huge sums of money are stuck in the project for the borrowers. While even BSES Ltd was being mentioned earlier as one of the contenders, the company does not seem inclined to proceed with it now. That leaves Tata Power as the chief contender for the stake sale. 
The FIs are also expected to play a role in roping in a partner for the LNG facility which is to be hived off. The names of some of the gas majors like British Gas, BP, Shell, Reliance in addition to the state-run Gas Authority of India (Gail) are being mentioned as potential partners in this connection, the sources said. The FIs are clear that any discussion on the LNG facility will have to include the new sponsor of the project.

Moody's Modi on Tata Power Plan to Buy Enron Unit: Comment
2001-10-05 06:20 (New York)


     Mumbai, Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Chetan Modi, an analyst with
Moody's Investor's Services in London, speaks on plans by Tata
Power Ltd. to bid for Enron Corp's India unit, Dabhol Power Co.

     Tata Power is India's biggest power producer and has bonds
worth $240 million trading overseas. The bonds are rated at two
levels below investment grade by Moody's, at ``Ba2'' or same as
the country's sovereign rating.

     ``Its inevitable for Tata Power to be interested in buying
Dabhol. Power is their core business and they have the expertise.
I'd be surprised if they weren't interested.

     ``Tata Power management told us they've indicated an interest
but have had no formal discussions with Enron.

     ``We will look at the deal holistically if -- and that's a
big if -- Tata decides to buy Dabhol and its implications on the
company's finances, its debt levels.

     ``We don't see a need to flag (Tata's) bonds as nothing has
happened yet. Dabhol is a big project and the problem will take a
long time to resolve. There are a number of players involved and
all are adamant not to take a haircut.

     ``From Tata Power's point of view the tariff has to be
adjusted to a level that's accepted by its customers without
external supports. The project must stand on its feet.''

     Enron wants to sell Dabhol because of a payment dispute with
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer. MSEB
stopped buying the power in May, saying it was too expensive. It
owes Dabhol $64 million in unpaid bills.
     Dabhol unit is India's biggest foreign direct investment.



UK: Enron to cut up to 10 pct of European workers-WSJ.

10/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Enron Corp N) is looking to cut its work force in Europe by up to 10 percent, or around 500 jobs, in a move to cut costs and maintain earnings growth, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 
""We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between 5 percent and 10 percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance,"" John Sherriff, chief executive of Enron Europe told the newspaper.
The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989. 
Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy-trading businesses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market liberalisation in the European Union, the paper reported. 
The company declined to be more specific about how far it would scale back individual product lines or coverage of certain geographical areas, the Wall Street Journal said. 
""Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth,"" Sherriff told the paper.

"Mark,

Unfortunately, I have been completely buried on the LDC sale process, but I 
finally had the opportunity to speak with Bruce Lundstrom a couple of nights 
ago regarding the tentative plans for the South American legal organization. 
As I told Bruce, I really had not had the opportunity to think very much 
about the proposed structure and wanted to give it some more thought before 
formulating a final opinion. Given the differences in our time zones these 
days, I thought it might be better to send you this e-mail rather than trying 
to catch you by phone.

Bruce indicated that you wanted to keep the SA legal group integrated so that 
services can be dispensed to the various business functions without being 
allocated specifically to the various business units operating within the 
region.  As you and I discussed a couple of weeks ago, I agree with this 
(so-called ""Enron Europe Model"") approach.  It seems to me to be the best way 
to maximize group cohesiveness, improve the budgeting and fee monitoring 
process, facilitate recruiting, and maintain regional legal expertise and 
core competencies. 

Bruce also wanted my thoughts on the idea of having this group report into 
the Global Asset group general counsel, rather than to you directly.  As I 
told Bruce, I have absolutely no problem, personally, in reporting into him, 
if that is what's finally decided.  The only thing I wanted to think about 
was whether the structure makes sense given the nature of the region and its 
legal activities.

That said, and after thinking through it, I do have some concerns about 
moving the group one step ""down the ladder""  within your organization 
(actually, since the group currently reports into the Enron Corp Office of 
the General Counsel, I guess it would be moving down at least two rungs).  
Regardless of whether I, or in the longer-term someone else, is the general 
counsel of this regional legal group, I would suggest that you have it report 
into you directly, rather than through any one business unit. 

First, this is a large group, the largest of the old ""EI"" groups, covering a 
big geographic area. Even after the Gas LDC's and Elektro are sold, the South 
American legal group will still have a total of 29 lawyers: 13 Enron lawyers 
(counting 1 in Houston, 5 in Sao Paulo, 2 in Rio, 2 in BA, and 3 at Vengas in 
Caracas [since Vengas is effectively controlled by Enron]) and 16  other 
lawyers within the group's supervisory responsibility at Promigas (4), TGS 
(5), Transredes (6), and Cuiaba (1, currently a vacancy following Ann 
Birosel's departure). In all, we have individual legal groups located in 
eight different cities in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela.

Second,  the group covers a lot of different areas of activity, much of which 
is unrelated to the Global Asset function. As I told Bruce, most of the 
senior Enron lawyers in the group are focused on supporting the origination 
functions for the region.  I understand these functions will continue on the 
business side under Joe Kishkill, Orlando Gonzalez and Brett Wiggs, who will 
report to Delaney/ Lavorato and not to McDonald/Hughes. The major assets are 
operated within the joint venture companies (TGS, Transredes, Cuiaba, BBPL, 
Vengas) almost all of which have legal groups that work closely with Enron's. 
As asset sales efforts are expected to increase and we are expected to start 
construction on two power projects in Brazil, I told Bruce that I would 
recommend that one or two of the gas unit lawyers (certainly Vicky Martinez 
and maybe Paula Porto) be moved to focus on the the Global Asset management 
function, to give it more transactional flexibility and native Portuguese 
language capability.  Subject to whatever is ultimately decided about the BA 
office, I assume the trading function will also continue to exist within the 
region, and that the trading lawyers will continue to be represented there as 
well.

None of this is to suggest that these groups of lawyers should be permanently 
assigned to particular functions and not made available for other functions.  
It just doesn't seem to me to be very practical, functionally, to have these 
origination and deal activities reporting into you through the one side of 
Enron Wholesale that is not directly related to the origination, trading and 
other ""deal"" side of the business. Bruce explained to me that he was 
concerned that good lawyers would be ""picked off"" by other business groups 
and not available to work on the asset side of the business, and that this 
somehow partially justified moving all the lawyers underneath the Global 
Asset group, at least initially.  I am not sure I fully understand the logic 
of that, but to be fair to Bruce, it was late here and I might have been a 
little slow.  It seems to me, however, that the Enron Europe Model handled 
that pretty well by having all of the lawyers available for work in different 
areas, as the need arises, and by having the regional general counsel perform 
the role of the ""honest broker"" in allocating attorneys to the different 
constituencies. I really don't see the need to do something radically 
different in South America, especially given the obvious comparisons between 
the two regions.

Third, I think the business guys might question the reporting structure.  One 
of the advantages of the Enron Europe Model, as I appreciate it, is that it 
allows the general counsel to allocate scarce legal resources without the 
appearance of unfairness or favoritism.  It may not be so easy to explain to 
one of the origination folks why the lawyer they want to use is unavailable 
and committed to a project on the asset side, without appearing impartial, 
when he knows the general counsel reports to the asset side of the business 
and not the deal side. It just seems to me to invite unnecessary friction 
going forward.

Fourth, aside from appearances, I think there is an advantage in ultimately 
having the staffing and legal support priorities for the region set at a 
level that has some distance from the often competing interests of the 
individual components of the separate business lines.  If there is a hard 
call to be made in allocating resources between Global Assets and the 
origination functions, it is just going to be easier for the decision to be 
made by the regional counsel in direct consultation with you, based on your 
understanding of Mark Frievert's priorities, than it would be to expect Bruce 
or any other business group general counsel similarly situated to tell their 
respective business group heads that they can't have the attorneys they want 
because another business group needs them more or has a more important or 
strategic priority. 

Finally, given the breadth of what is expected to go on down here, and the 
number of lawyers and countries involved, I would think you would want to 
receive your reports directly from the regional general counsel, rather than 
through any one of the other business group general counsels.  That is not to 
say that Bruce or anyone else would not be able to report things without 
unduly filtering them, but to some extent that happens naturally as a 
reporting structure becomes more heirarchical. I know that a balance needs to 
be struck between having too many direct reports, on the one hand, and 
reducing the quality of information flowing up to you, on the other.  For 
what it is worth, however, I would suggest that you strike the balance in 
this case in favor of direct reporting. Plus, it seems to be working fine in 
Europe, if that is to be the paradigm.

As I said, I will go with whatever is finally decided, but I thought I should 
at least give you my thoughts on the issue. If you want to discuss it 
further, please feel free to give me a call. I should be back in Houston next 
week, for a while at least.  

Hope all is well, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.

Regards,
Randy

Good morning,
We have a note out on the proposed decision on PG&E Corp. and Edison 
International.

? On January 3, the ALJ issued a proposed decision on the purchased power 
undercollection emergency at PG&E Corp. and Edison International. A final 
decision will be issued on January 4.

? The proposal contains interim rate increases of 7%-15% for different 
customer classes. The surcharges would be subject to refunds and 
substantially lower than the 26% and 30% increases requested by PG&E Corp. 
and Edison International, respectively.

? The proposed rate increases would be effective for 90 days. During this 
time the CPUC would consider a more comprehensive audit of the utilities' 
financial condition.

? Significantly, the proposal rejects the utilities' request to end the rate 
freeze. The order would also order the utilities to credit TCBA 
overcollection to the TRA undercollection balance.

? Clearly, the risk of insolvency is much higher now. If passed, the order 
will fall far short of resolving the financial crisis facing PG&E Corp. and 
Edison International. Even if the utilities avoid bankruptcy, we now 
anticipate, more than ever, a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning the 
economic value of these stocks.

Please call us with any questions you may have.
Regards,
Paul Patterson, 212-325-5876

Subject: NewPower & Enron

Mr. Skilling,
First, let me congratulate you on being appointed to CEO of Enron. Very 
exciting news!

Mr. Lay may have spoken to you about NewPowers' desire to be the premier 
energy provider to Enron employees.
- If you had a moment, please take the time to read and reflect on the 
opportunity of this project.
- As you will notice, I was assigned to lead the project and am looking 
forward to working with Enron (again).

I look forward to  the opportunity of seeing you again, while I am in Texas; 
and I hope that you will find it worth your while to provide input to this 
project.
Having a good understanding of Enron and it's culture, I strongly believe 
that your direct support will have a huge effect on the success of the 
project.

Below is the Email that Mr. Lockhart sent to Mr. Lay:

As part of NewPower's plan to enter Texas, we would appreciate your support 
to implement a plan to offer Enron Employees the opportunity to sign up to 
NewPower when deregulation opens on February 15th.  We believe that an Enron 
Employee Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity and customized offers to 
employees at Enron's partners could be a cost effective way for NewPower to 
help achieve our goal to be the branded choice of electricity in Texas  

We have developed some compelling ""Consumer Driven"" sign up incentives for 
Enron Employees such as ""Guaranteed Savings - Free December"" electricity, a 
aligned to a $20.00 NewPower ATM card and free companion airline ticket 
coupons. 
 
We would appreciate your help and support on the following:

Obtaining Enron Executive support/guidance for our proposed Enron Employee 
Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity. 
 - It would be helpful to have your personal endorsement linked to 
implementation assistance through Cindy Olson's HR group.
Guidance and support for a similar ""Customized"" offer to Enron's partners 
employees that might include Vincent & Elkins, Compaq, Arthur Andersen, 
Continental, University of Houston, University of Houston American Airlines.
   - We would appreciate any thoughts on other companies we should approach.
          - It would be helpful if you would consider sending  a letter or 
email of introduction to the companies CEO and head of Human Resources in the 
near future.
                  
To help you understand more about the proposed plan, attached, please find a 
copy of the plan highlights and draft creative that was sent by Nick Utton 
(Chief Marketing Officer) to Cindy Olson.  Nick is currently in discussions 
with Cindy on how to best implement this plan and has assigned Wilson Kriegel 
as the NewPower manager responsible for working through the details.  


I look forward to your input and help.  
This could go a long way in Texas towards our goal of NewPower being the 
national brand of ""Energy Solutions"".

"Geynille,

Thanks for calling in list to me yesterday.  Sally is trying to juggle her 
calendar in order that she will be able to attend presentation on Sept. 28.  
Her plan at this point, is to attend dinner & presentation on 28th but not 
dinner on the 27th.  Unfortunately, her schedule will not allow her to be out 
on Thursday.  She was also wondering about details of dinner - said in the 
last meeting it had been discussed to possibly do a western theme - with 
jeans (?).  Is that still on?  If not, is dinner to be held at Stone Davis 
Hall?  Can I get the address of Stone Davis & address, phone, & fax for 
Wellesley Inn for Sally's itinerary.

Thanks,

Christopher,

I believe Tracy Ngo has begun to look at it from a credit perspective.  I 
don' have any of the details.  Aquila Energy Corp. is the guarantor for 
Aquila trading subs and is not anywhere near the equivalent credit quality of 
Enron Corp.  We need to be careful of how much incremental risk we take with 
Aquila without collateral because of our significant trading positions with 
them.  Please advise when you find out more details about the structure.

I spoke to Todd Busby.  He said he is trying to set this up as a transaction 
where we could directly link the two swaps.  It is my understanding that this 
would simplify the transaction in that the credit/contracting process would 
be fairly straightforward.  He said that he needs to get his internal ducks 
in a row before he is prepared to take a step forward with us.  He will call 
me if and when this occurs.   So, this might not come to anything.  I will 
let you know if and when he surfaces so we can decisde what we should do next.

"Unless the Easter weekend brings about the resurrection of this bill, de reg 
is dead in Iowa for the 2000 session.  The House and Senate leadership 
announced today that they would not bring the bill up for a vote this year.  
The session is going to recess tonight for the holiday, they will reconvene 
on Monday, and most likely now adjourn on Wednesday.  

I am certainly disappointed that our efforts were not successful--especially 
in light of our being part of a very diverse coalition in support of the bill 
that included the coops, munis, Mid American, Alliant, industrial customers, 
school boards, low income providers,retailers, grocers, etc.

Subject: Iowa de reg update

A wild week in Iowa.  By the end of the day Tuesday, it became clear to all 
parties that the bill would not be called for a vote.  The customers were 
unwilling to give anymore on the enviroment issues and the democrats would 
similarly not back off their positions.  Mid American then switched gears to 
pull out all the stops on getting labor support in order to trump the enviro 
supporters.  Mid American put forward a proposal to the unions/legislators 
that they would commit to build 2 power plants in the state of Iowa (as 
opposed to developing in Illinois) over the next 5 years that would employ 
union labor. Mid American also had it's top management making many visits 
this week---Greg Abel and I believe also David Sokol.  (No Warren Buffet 
sightings yet!!!!)This offer created a flurry of activity on both sides, but 
at the end of the day Thursday, the state IBEW group let it be known that 
they would still not support the bill even with the Mid Am proposal.

Mid American believes that the Republicans now have a hook to force the 
democrats into voting for the de reg bill, by saying that if they don't vote 
affirmative, they are not for economic development in the rural/struggling 
areas of the state where the power plants would be built.  

WHile I may not share Mid American's positive assessment, the proponent's 
group continues it's advocacy and will meet with legilsators in their 
districts over the weekend. The senate leadership agreed to hold off 
reconvening the committee until Monday afternoon in an effort to allow any 
last minute maneuvering over the week end.

The latest from Des Moines.  The chair(republican) of the Senate committee 
had a hearing this morning to consider all of the enviromental amendments put 
forward by the Democrats and it was clear that no Dems would vote for the 
eventual bill without their amendments, so the chair recessed the committee 
without a vote.  The committee can be recalled at any time, but the general 
sense is that it will not be brought back up without at least 2 democrat 
votes guaranteed.  As is often the case in these debates, the proponents 
continue to try many strategies, but all of us agree that without direct 
intervention from Governor Vilsack, the democrats will not come around. As 
stated in my earlier message, I am not optimistic about passage.  Tempers are 
running very high and it is very possible that the utilities will try to cut 
a deal at the last minute that will negatively impact the customers (likely 
by rate impacts on envriomental/efficiency programs).  Please give me a call  
#612-339-4599 if you want any added insight.

Subject: Iowa de reg update

The Iowa customer choice bill has run into some significant roadblacks the 
last few days due to the political maneuvering of the Democrats.  As you will 
recall, the House Republicans have always stated that they needed Democrat 
votes in order to bring the matter to the floor for a vote.  Despite Governor 
Vilsack's stated support for the measure last week as well as last weekend, 
the House  Democrat leadership is unwilling to push their members, as they 
want to use this bill against the Republicans in the House races this fall. 
(The tactic they will take is that residential rates will rise in the 
Southeastern part of the state due to the Republicans passing the bill).

The primary issue that the Dems are using as a reason not to vote for the 
bill is that the enviromental protections/funds are not high enough.  The 
Republicans are unhappy about the exhorbitant amount of funds and the RPS 
that are already in the bill, and are not willing to vote for an amended bill 
that the Dems are pushing for.  The enviros and the unions are, as they have 
been for the last 6 months, the dividing force in this debate.

Therefore, the proponents coalition moved their efforts to the Senate, with 
the hope of getting a vote out this week and then move it back over to the 
HOuse.  While we had a good commitment from Senate leadership (both Dems and 
Republicans) on Monday, that support has eroded as of this morning.  We are 
trying a number of tactics, and hope that there will be some positive 
movement today and tomorrow.  Without the Governor stepping up to the plate 
and ""encouraging"" the democrats to gather the number of democrat votes 
neccessary this week, I am not optimistic about passage.

There are still two-three weeks of session left, so this debate could rage 
until then, but my sense is that if we don't get something out of the Senate 
by the end of this week or early next week, we'll be dead.  Call if you have 
any questions.

"Dear Jeff,

Happy (somewhat belated) new year.  I hope you are doing well in sunny
downtown Houston.  I am writing from Princeton where minutes ago I
happily finished my Economics exam, the last of the semester.  In
reviewing the agenda for the rest of the academic year, I thought it
might be a good time to finalize summer plans as well.
     I will be occupied with a job here at Princeton until June 3 - I am
working logistics for part of this year's reunions.  After that date, I
would need only a day or two of turnaround time before coming out to
Houston.  I could conceivably be in the office by Wednesday, June 6.
Depending upon your needs at the office and the possibility of a short
cultural study on a small island off of the coast of western Sumatra, I
could plan on being in Houston until at least early August.  Please let
me know what your plans are on the other end.

Thanks in advance for your attention.
Sincerely, Dan

people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,

"Nailia and I are taking care of circulation of relevant material from Energy 
Council of Mon. and Tue. this week. She is also following the EU-Russia 
energy dialogue. 
Would either of you like to flip through the 135 page Competition Report and 
let others in the group know your conclusions (in less than one side A4!!)? 
By the way, you should meet each other, as soon as Brendan makes it to London 
or when Jan next comes to Brussels.

Dear Nailia,

Please find attached the first conclusions of the Energy Council which took
place yesterday. You will note that the Council intends to take a position
on the proposals for the opening of the energy internal market by the
Barcelone Council in spring 2002. We will contact several permanent
representations and the Presidency of the Council to ask about Member
States' positions on this issue.

Attached you will also find the agenda for the EU-Russia summit on 17 May.

I also include the 30th Annual Report on Competition Policy which deals with
the competition policy in general and by sectors, issued today by the
Commission. The report states that competition in the energy markets will be
introduced if the following  conditions are met:
* suppliers are free to compete for customers;
* customers are free to change suppliers;
* an effective, non-discriminatory and cost reflective TPA regime is
introduced and maintained.
The report also deals with the proposal for a new Regulation dealing with
articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, setting out the competition rules
applicable to restrictive agreements, decisions and concerted practices, and
abuses of dominant positions.

Would you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Regards,

Amaia

"The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  5/26 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim"
"I realilzed we may be focusing a little too much on malin and leaving some 
rocks unturned.  I talked to Sempra and we can use them as a sleeve for 
different counterparties that we don't not have a credit agreement

$2.

"Yes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by 
your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. 
At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we 
had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had 
been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI 
buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for 
the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price 
average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of 
their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we 
sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out 
right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions 
regarding that time frame.

Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some 
discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but 
didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over 
there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to 
resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions.

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

   Enron Global Markets LLC - Office of the Chairman


Enron Global Markets (EGM) has made numerous organizational changes as its 
businesses continue to grow and expand around the world.  We are pleased to 
announce the following changes within EGM.

Financial Trading 
The Convertible Arbitrage desk has moved from EnronCredit.com to the 
Financial Trading group under Gary Hickerson.  Mike Bradley will manage the 
desk.  

Billy Lemmons has joined Gary Hickerson's group from EIM.  He is exploring 
the agriculture value chain and origination opportunities.

Transportation and Shipping
Dan Reck will be transitioning out of the coal group and will be exploring 
our rail and trucking initiatives.  These markets together represent 
approximately $105 billion notionally, and we believe there are many 
synergies between our energy, coal, and freight trading businesses.  

Enron is currently trading dry-freight through EOL and is a leading market 
maker in this new product. The shipping business is growing very quickly.  We 
have asked Pierre Aury and Scott Montcrief to co-lead our worldwide vessel 
trading businesses.  Scott will be responsible for all liquids vessel 
businesses and Pierre will manage all dry vessel businesses.  The LNG vessel 
business currently managed by Wayne Perry will remain in the LNG group, but 
will also report to and coordinate with Pierre and Scott.

Weather
Our worldwide weather operations will continue to report to Mark Tawney in 
Houston.  This business, which includes trading weather products in 10 
countries and 40 states in the U.S., is also rapidly expanding.  Mark will 
have all V@R allocation responsibility between Sydney, Tokyo, Oslo, and

DETAILS:
""Quaker Acquisition Meets the Lion's Share of Criterion""

Yesterday PepsiCo announced Quaker would be acquired for stock at an
exchange rate of 2.3 shares per OAT share with quasi collars around $40-$45
per PEP share.  CEO Roger Enrico stated the deal as modeled would boost the
""big 4"" financial metrics:  1- Top Line to 7%+, 2 - EBIT Growth to 11-12%,
3- EPS to 13-14% and 4 -ROIC + 200 basis points.  In our view, this one
appears more likely to go 2 for 4 or 3 for 4, with higher returns on our
calculations providing the most significant challenge.  As we stated in our
11/29 note, the mere act of doing the deal on a pooling basis does not
change the fact that $13.5 billion in stock will be floated (@$43.5/PEP
share)- thereby boosting the capital base by which ROIC is measured.  In
addition, we believe earnings accretion relies to some degree on integration
savings which may be ""un-bundled"" as non-strategic food businesses (and
their distribution systems) are eventually sold.

""Add More To the Core""

PEP has long maintained the higher degree of on-the-go food consumption
necessitates increased product offerings around Frito-Lay in North America.
Quaker's grain based snacks and nutrition bars may fit the bill - but can
they produce enough turns to make it inside Frito's vaunted DSD (direct
store delivery) trucks?  If so, why has PEP not previously attempted to
carve its own niche?  We expect a volume pop as newly freed up system
capacity pushes the new snacks, but do not know whether the Gatorade power
bar and Quaker Rice Cakes can produce a sustainable channel presence.  For
example, in most core products (Fritos, Doritos, Lays) PEP is the undisputed
industry leader where a viable number two player really does not exist.
Many of the newly acquired ""add more"" ideas target the morning day part and
are likely to face formidable competition from Kraft, General Mills and
Kellogg.  In short, we believe food expansion outside of salty snacks is
laudable (i.e., it may be difficult to growing at the same historic rate as
the last ten years), but PEP's impressive supply chain power and value to
retailers may not readily overcome significant execution risk and heightened
competition.

The Gator Gumshoes.

The clear-cut  winner appears to be the Pepsi bottlers.  Management is
justifiably muted in defining the Gatorade  - PBG/WH opportunity in broad
terms, why disprupt OAT's established warehouse distribution?  More to the
point, we believe management recognizes that much like SOBE, its new, albeit
smaller alt beverage brethren, significant distribution retooling at the
outset risks disruption at retail.  However, we expect the system bottlers
to create volume opportunities immediately.  For example, if only PBG's
vending and ""up and down"" street distribution capabilities were deployed,
the incremental case volume contribution could create 2% additional growth
points in the first year.  Given such new portal potential, we are therefore
puzzled by management's 9% guidance for Gatorade sales - nearly 3% lower
than anticipated 2000 results.  Is the bar being re-set to make numbers?
Might the mighty green bottle be facing saturation in existing channels as
it closes in on 85% market share? Or might the Pepsi system,  looking to
improve Gatorade margins by gradually transitioning to lower slotting fees,
be anticipating minor volume disruptions?  On this last point, we say
""minor"" because the slotting issue we allude to most likely applies to the
convenience and gas channel where Gatorade's indelible brand equity makes it
a must stock for retailers.  We believe that lower CSD volumes in 2000 are
highly instructive: Even the strongest brands face execution risk.

Do food retailers really want to empower bigger suppliers?

PEP's profit contribution to retail is well documented.  Aided by strong
brands in three categories and a very efficient distribution system, it is a
major provider of returns.  Gatorade as well as the non-snack food
businesses only augment this role.  In this light, management expects it's
relatively underutilized Tropicana ambient juice brands (Twister) to get a
boost.  Pure economics make this one inviting, but from a retailer
standpoint, (think Bentonville, Arkansas) does giving up leverage to
manufacturers matter?  Again, CSD's are illustrative of the potential risk.
Faced with an arguably better economic profit from higher CSD prices for the
category, certain retailers siezed the opportunity to boost private label
shares at lower prices.  We note that The Twister portfolio's brand equity
is not nearly as strong as Tropicana Pure Premium's, making the logically
appealing distribution opportunity somewhat easier for retailers to resist.

Coin of the Realm: Why does a company use its stock as deal currency?

Because it is likely fairly valued or even overvalued relative to debt based
alternatives.  If there is such as thing as a ""cheap way"" to spend $13.5
billion, stock swaps in GAAP world is it.  When book value equity is used,
PEP return on capital actually rises 50 via the OAT deal.  (We impact ROIC
for both Quaker's Snapple charge and this deal's anticipated write-off).
However, a share issuance, which equates to much more, will be floated.  We
estimate the consideration of this cost on an economic basis (i.e., what was
spent) would negatively impact return on capital by 400 basis points.  In
addition, while a model based on the present value of future cash flows
might produce a more favorable valuation, we see three hurdles to building
it:

1- No clear visibility on capital allocation or growth prospects for
Gatorade outside the U.S.  In our view this aspect of the deal alone may be
the ultimate arbiter of success or failure.

2- The integration of much of Quaker's food businesses may be only
temporary.

3- Execution issues on the domestic snack and isotonic businesses may yield
a bumpy set of cash flows over the next two years.

On this last point, we believe PEP's experience in restructuring during the
1997-1999 period bears some consideration.  A more brand focussed,
horizontal business model would indeed prove superior to a more vertically
integrated one that included restaurants and bottling.  However, it took
investors quite some time to realize stock price appreciation.  In the
current transaction, OAT also portends strategic value, but the benefits may
not be immediate.

Maintain BUY rating.

For the next 6 months, we see deal integration trumping PepsiCo's many
positive operational attributes.  We see the stock as range bound between
$40-45 until the close in the spring.  At that point, many of the margin
opportunities should become more apparent.  Therefore, we maintain our
12-month price target of $49.

HIGHLIGHTS:
Yogi Knows Best
Yesterday, we met with PepsiCo CFO Indra Nooyi, the de facto keeper of the
company's rigorous financial discipline.  Without the ability to make direct
inquiries regarding Quaker, (it only elicits a ""no comment"" in a Reg. FD
world), our discussion helped build the oatmeal/electrolyte mosaic to the
point where the company's interest may best be capsulated as a
""non-denial/denial"". In other words, that great pinstriped poet and
philosopher may be right on with PEP/OAT - ""It ain't over till it's over.""

Round Up the Usual Suspects
Following the rumored, and in our view, temporarily aborted plays for OAT by
PEP, KO and Danone, a faint Swiss whisper is being heard from Nestle.  Why
not just throw in Cadbury, Kraft and any other food/beverage company with an
unlevered pulse?  Not a bad thing for Quaker, in our opinion, but after
paying so much for Gatorade - we estimate a $105 takeout implies an EBITDA
multiple north of 23 times for the green stuff - only a company with a well
established global distribution system has any shot at attaining enough
return to make it work.  That leaves three - KO, PEP and MO (Kraft) with the
latter perhaps a tad preoccupied at this time.  And if Coke really is
done...

Framing Deal Criterion in a Place Called Purchase
Nooyi remains steadfast that any deal would not dilute earnings or impair
return on capital.  From our standpoint, here's the rub: these metrics point
to stock based pooling which is arguably inferior to a debt based purchase.
PEP's significant cash flow and underlevered balance sheet argue
compellingly for using debt - the after-tax capital cost is cheaper and it
would be free to dispose of non-strategic assets.  We believe such an
approach would produce more attractive returns, but cause earnings dilution
- PEP no-no.  Alternatively, a tax-free stock swap may be accretive to
earnings while the true capital cost is hidden thanks to the vagaries of
GAAP accounting.  In fact, equity capital cost in our analysis is higher and
the company would be holding a portfolio of food businesses for two years
that are for the most part lower returning assets (hot cereal being an
exception).  Hence, we believe a stock-based play for Quaker faces an uphill
battle to value creation.

AmBevolution?
We discussed Pepsi's burgeoning relationship with AmBev, the Brazilian beer
and soft drink giant.  Given PEP's relatively small (6%) soft drink share,
AmBev's distribution is critical to success.  Despite a lower implied profit
for AmBev as a Pepsi bottler vs. its own brands, Nooyi sees significant
opportunity once market execution matches that of AmBev's leading brands
such as Antarctica Guarana.  The trump card here may be AmBev's attraction
to ""Power of One"" style initiatives with PepsiCo's snacks operations.  Such
developments are encouraging, in our opinion, but our Latin beverage team
sees domestic beer as AmBev's most compelling near-term opportunity.

A little update on the hedge funds.  

Apparently, these types of customers do not contact us if they do not receive 
confirmations of their trades.  This has lead to a problem.  Smith Barney has 
indicated that they completed a January swing buy from Enron, trade date 
11/28/00.  We have no record of the trade, and the tapes have since been 
erased/destroyed.   And, of course, they never sent correspondence to us 
indicating that they lacked a confirmation.  In defense of Smith Barney, they 
might have contacted us if we had been anywhere close to timely on our 
issuance of the other confirmations.  Since our traders transacted without 
approval, we were not prepared with the special language.   I had no idea 
this trade existed until the c/p disagreed with our mark to market numbers.

John Arnold is in discussions with the counterparty.  I am supposed to be 
hearing the resolution tomorrow.  The position on the trade in dispute is 
approximately $1MM out of the money from Enron's perspective.

I will keep you posted.

"Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Best,
Jeff"
