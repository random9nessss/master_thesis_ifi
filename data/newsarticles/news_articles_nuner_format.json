    "input": "Efforts to develop the first ammonia value chain have taken another step forward with Japan’s NYK Line and Yara Clean Ammonia concluding the first charter for an ammonia-fueled medium gas carrier. NYK ordered the vessel’s construction in 2023 as the next step in a project initiated in 2021 as part of Japan’s Green Innovation Project Fund of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).\nThe companies believe this is the first commercial contract for a vessel of this type and represents a key step in putting the vessel into service. The project was designed to overcome key hurdles in the launch of ammonia as maritime fuel and to serve as a demonstration contributing to the decarbonization of shipping.\nStarting in 2021, the project was focusing on the key challenges of developing an ammonia-fueled combustion engine. They highlighted the hardly-flammable nature and low energy density of ammonia as well as the challenge that combustion generates about 300 times more N2O emissions, which need to be suppressed. The toxicity of ammonia also requires steps to prevent leakage and safety measures for the crew.\nJapan Engine Corporation and IHI Power System were working on the engine and fuel supply system. The goal was a main engine with an ammonia-fuel mixed combustion rate of up to 95 percent and an auxiliary engine with an ammonia-fuel mixed combustion rate of 80 percent or more. This, they said, would achieve an 80 percent or more reduction in GHG emissions.\nNYK and Nihon Shipyard were also working on the design of the vessel. A medium-sized gas carrier (40,000 cbm capacity) with an overall length of 590 feet (180 meters) was selected. They reported this was the currently most common size for marine transport of ammonia. The hull forms were optimized, and they set a goal of an ammonia-loading capacity equivalent to or more than that of conventional vessels.\nThe project received approval in principle from ClassNK in September 2022. After completing designs and successful tests of engines by Japan Engine and IHI Power Systems, the construction order was signed in December 2023. They said the project was in full swing toward its completion in November 2026. The vessel will be built at the Japan Marine United Corporation yard in Ariake, Japan, with a two-stroke engine produced by Japan Engine Corporation.\nYara Clean Ammonia reports the charter will provide the company with great flexibility to manage carbon emissions and product carbon intensity. The vessel’s entry into service will be a key milestone for the development of ammonia-fueled vessels.\nThe first-ever ammonia bunkering took place in 2024 as demonstrations with NYK putting into service the first ammonia-fueled tugboat. Other engine manufacturers, including MAN Energy Solutions and WinGD, each recently reported key progress in moving to full-power testing and verification of their ammonia-fueled engines. Wind GD predicted it could deliver its first ammonia-fueled engine by mid-year. DNV has forecast the first ammonia-fueled larger vessels might be delivered in 2025, while it expects the segment to expand quickly between 2026 and 2028.",

Italian media is reporting that Francesco Schettino, now age 64, has petitioned the courts in Italy for a form of early release from his 16-year prison sentence.\nSchettino was in command of the cruise ship owned by Carnival Corporation’s Costa Cruises. The ship was in service for just six years built by Fincantieri and delivered in 2006. It was 114,500 gross tons with a capacity for 3,780 passengers and 1,100 crew making a week-long cruise in the Western Mediterranean.\nOn January 13, 2012, theConcordialeft Civitavecchia, Italy, but Captain Schettino decided to deviate from the normal course to make a “salute” sailing close to Giglio island. He later blamed faults with the vessel, problems with the crew and misunderstanding of commands, and other issues, while it was alleged he was distracted by other people on the bridge.\nAs they sailed close to the island and the cruise ship sounded its horn, it struck an underwater rock outcropping that fatally ruptured the hull and flooded the electrical controls rendering the ship immediately powerless and drifting. There were 3,200 passengers aboard and over 1,000 crew. A total of 32 people would die as the vessel foundered and during a botched evacuation.\nInfamously Schettino abandoned the bridge with other officers. He later claimed he had fallen from the listing ship or that he had gone to shore to oversee the evacuation. A famous recording surfaced of the Coast Guard screaming and cursing at him, and ordering him back aboard the vessel. The cruise ship capsized, leaving passengers to fend for themselves and climb over the hull and down ladders in a rescue organized by the Coast Guard.\nSchettino was sentenced in February 2015 to 16 years in prison for dereliction of duty, multiple counts of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, and abandoning his passengers. His appeals were exhausted in 2017. He was ordered to surrender at a prison in Rome.\nUnder Italian law, Schettino filed for early release into a state of “semi-liberty” whereby he would be out of prison for the remainder of his sentence. This is available after the prisoner has served at least half their time in jail and has demonstrated good behavior.\nThe Italian media reports there are mixed reactions. The protests are expected to grow in advance of a court hearing. In addition to the 32 who died, many people were injured and carry emotional scars from the disaster. It was the largest cruise ship lost and led to extensive changes in the management of the industry. Costa Cruises paid a fine of more than $1 million in addition to settlements with the families and passengers. Carnival Corporation overhauled the management and training of its officers and in 2016 established a training center in the Netherlands.\nAn Italian court has set a hearing for March 4 to decide if Schettino will win his release from prison.",

    "input": "\nIn its latest quarterly report, Japanese industrial conglomerate Mitsubishi revealed that it is taking a $340 million hit in connection with the reduced prospects of its domestic offshore wind portfolio, which it has placed under review.\nMitsubishi Corporation has announced plans to restructure its offshore wind portfolio in Japan, citing disruptions in the macroeconomic environment. It will be reviewing the future of three projects, including the 480 MW Noshiro Mitane Oga project off Akita Prefecture, 820 MW Yurihonjo City Offshore wind farm off Akita Prefecture and the 400 MW Choshi City project off the coast of Chiba Prefecture.\nMitsubishi was selected the operator of these projects in December 2021, when Japan completed its first fixed-bottom wind auction.\n“In the wake of the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis, the business environment for offshore wind power has significantly changed and is continuing to change worldwide due to factors such as inflation, the depreciation of the yen, tight supply chains and rising interest rates. We will consider the appropriate next steps after thoroughly examining the results of our review,” said Mitsubishi.\nAcross major markets, investments in offshore wind continue to face economic pressure, especially in Europe and the U.S. In Japan, there is also a noticeably bearish market sentiment on the profitability of offshore wind projects. In the third wind auction concluded in December, at least 15 companies in the sector, including Mitsubishi Corp. and Cosmo Energy Holdings, did not participate, according to Nikkei. This is despite some of these companies having conducted environmental assessments in readiness for the auction.\nJapan heavily relies on energy imports for its electricity needs and is targeting offshore wind as a stable supply that can be tapped locally. The country’s goal is to install 10 GW by 2030 and 45 GW by 2040.\nMeanwhile, the Japanese government has signaled raising the local content goal for offshore wind farms to 70 percent from the current 60 percent. Reportedly, the expert panel reviewing the local content rules begins meeting this month and is expected to finalize its findings by summer. Some of the issues to be deliberated include the necessary degree of government support to the wind sector.\nThe tightening of the local content rules is meant to reduce reliance on foreign companies, especially in the manufacturing of wind farm core components. Currently, Japan relies on imports of these components from western companies such as Siemens Gamesa and Vestas. Japanese firms are mainly concentrated in offering services like the installation and operation of offshore wind farms.",

    "input": "A new report looking at what will be needed to spur the transition to e-fuels and the early adoption in the maritime sector concludes that targeted subsidies and a hefty GHG levy are needed to close the gap between scalable zero-emission fuels and other compliance options. The analysis was timed to the International Maritime Organization’s upcoming negotiations ahead of the Maritime Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting this summer to adopt the second phase of the strategy for the decarbonization of the shipping industry.\n“The path the sector is on now requires urgent and drastic correction from both commercial and policy actions to avoid significant risks to the sector and global trade,” warns thereportpresented by the UCL Energy Institute and maritime consultancy UMAS.  “Without maximum efficiency,” the report warns, “the transition will be more expensive, more difficult and disruptive, and more prone to failure and delay.”\nThe research set out to explore how the transition can be stimulated, coordinated, and delivered, not just by the IMO, but also national governments, regional bodies, and industry stakeholders. They analyzed the viability and costs of the IMO’sRevised Strategytargets released after the 2024 MEPC session.\nThe study concludes that the transition from fossil fuels in shipping has much in common with other transitions but that current policies of fuel standards and a flexible financial mechanism, even with a multiplier that boosts credits for e-fuel, are unlikely to start an e-fuel transition before 2040. Further, they warn the industry risks becoming locked into alternatives that could make long-term decarbonization goals more difficult.\n“This new analysis shows that the market will struggle to make an e-fuel business case before 2040, and therefore e-fuels such as green ammonia will not be available for shipping’s use in any volume,” says Dr. Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at the UCL Energy Institute. “Some suggest that the role of a GHG levy is only for addressing equity, this study shows that it is not the only role, it is also a critical enabler of shipping’s energy transition and for minimizing the long-run costs to trade.”\nGHG pricing starting at $30 per tonne of CO2e, the research warns looks unlikely to provide certainty of support to enable the energy transition to start and scale through the 2027-2035 period, and certainly would be unable to additionally support a just and equitable transition. They conclude that GHG pricing starting at $150 per tonne of CO2e, could generate sufficient revenue to support both the energy transition and ensure a just and equitable transition for affected communities.\nUsing the total cost of ownership approach, the study modeled a 14,000 TEU container vessel with different technology and fuel options. They used this to evaluate the effects of policy combinations (including a GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) requirement, flexibility mechanism, and a levy and subsidy/reward mechanism) currently under discussion at the IMO.\nThey believe the early low-cost routes to compliance could become uncompetitive within a decade. The study says that early action is needed to support e-fuels to bridge the gap between e-fuels and low-cost early compliance options such as LNG, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage. They believe that a GHG levy and targeted incentive for e-fuels, such as a subsidy/reward that would be derived from the GHG Levy, is critical to ensure the industry is moving quickly on the correct transition course. The report says that there are political, technical, economic and commercial requirements to deliver on the goals for decarbonization.",

This satisfied the demands of Yemen's Houthi rebels, who had been attacking shipping in the Red Sea for more than a year in protest of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip. Houthi leaders pledged to cease strikes on foreign shipping, with the exception of certain Israeli vessels.\nThe Israel-Hamas ceasefire has held so far, and so has the uneasy peace in the Red Sea. But the future of the detente appears tenuous: last week, U.S. President Donald Trump insisted that the U.S. will\"own\" and redevelop Gazainto a \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" requiring two million Palestinians to leave and never return. He demanded that all of Hamas' 76 remaining Israeli hostages be released by February 15 - a dramatic acceleration of the ceasefire framework that Hamas had negotiated with Israel.\nOn Tuesday, Netanyahu suggested that Hamas wasn't living up to the terms of the hostage exchange and promised to resume military action in Gaza if all 76 hostages are not returned by Saturday. Hamas asserts that it is committed to the ceasefire and hostage release agreement.\nThe prospect of renewed hostilities in Gaza has kept most large shipping companies from returning to the Red Sea, for fear of renewed Houthi attacks on shipping and skyrocketing insurance rates. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi reinforced that concern in a statement Tuesday.\n\"Our hands are on the trigger and we are ready to immediately escalate against the Israeli enemy if it returns to escalate against the Gaza Strip,\" said al-Houthi. \"Do you think the people of Gaza, who resisted the [Israeli] bombings, would sell their homeland to you?\"\nPrevious Houthi missile attacks on Israeli territory have drawn retaliatory Israeli bombing raids, devastating the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah and other critical infrastructure in western Yemen.",

Two labor unions have broken off negotiations and backed away from a tentative agreement threatening to continue their strikes until the operator meets the terms of the tentative agreement.\nThe terminal which was opened in Rotterdam in 2000 reports it handles up to a quarter of the container volume through the port, which is also the busiest container port in Europe. APM Terminals had owned the facility till selling it in 2021 to the Chinese Hutchison Ports. It is located adjacent to Hutchison’s other terminal and has an annual capacity of 3.3 million TEU.\nShortly after acquiring the terminal, Hutchison entered into a new partnership with MSC’s TIL group with a plan to develop a new automated container terminal. It would have five berths and be one of the most advanced operations in Europe. The companies reported they would open the new facility in 2027.\nWorkers at the Delta II terminal are represented by two union FNV Havens and CNV. Contract negotiations began in November 2024 and the unions set as one of their key conditions a generous severance package and financial guarantees from Hutchison for the package because according to the unions future employment is in doubt due to the plans for the new Omega terminal.\nAfter months of contentious negotiations, CNV reported on January 20 that it was planning to withdraw from the negotiations. The unions issued an ultimatum and set a January 28 deadline. After a marathon negotiating session lasting 19 hours straight and 29 hours in total, a deal was reported on January 31. It is for a three-year contract running till 2028 with a one-time payment as well as annual 1 or 1.5 percent wage increases and automatic price compensation for inflation. Hutchison agreed to the severance package but the unions demanded written financial guarantees before a February 10-11 membership vote.\nThe unions contend Hutchison informed them late last week that it needed more time for the financial guarantee. Members rejected the proposed deal and the unions said they were withdrawing from the tentative contract without the guarantee.\nWork stopped at the terminal on February 9 and remained suspended till this morning, February 11. Even after the workers went back and the gates were reopened, they were said to be staging slowdowns. Hutchison reported twice during the day it was closing the gates because of the crowds in the terminal. Hutchison confirmed it is experiencing delays in the handling of all modalities and long wait times.\nMaersk issued a statement to customers reporting, “a reduced number of moves per hour conducted at the terminal for an unknown duration. Consequently, prolonging the time vessels are operated on and significantly disrupting their normal schedules. To minimize disruptions and protect overall reliability to your supply chains, contingent decisions will be made in the upcoming days.”\nBoth unions advised members today that they expect this will “be a long-term matter.” CNV said the unions have started preparing actions while FNV predicted there will be more strikes.\nHutchison apologized to shippers for the inconvenience while warning of long wait times at its terminal.",

    "input": "A new project uniting leaders in German industry and funded by the German government looks to develop a new generation of fuel cells using methanol to provide power for cruise ships. In the zero4cruise project, the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), will be working with Meyer Werft and the Freudenberg Fuel Cell e-Power Systems, to further develop PEM fuel cell technology for large-scale maritime systems.\nThe partners highlight that the project is designed to tackle one of the maritime industry’s most pressing challenges, the development of sustainable and low-emission energy solutions for cruise ships. Several smaller-scale projects are working on fuel cells for cruise ships and demonstration projects, but the challenge is the amount of power required to sustain the operations of a large cruise ship. The project looks to build on existing technology to create large-scale fuel cell stacks.\nMeyer, which is well-known for its large cruise ship constructions including the first LNG dual-fuel ships, notes the focus of this project is on retrofitting existing ships. In addition to extending the lifespan of current ships, they note it can accelerate the decarbonization process in the cruise sector. They are particularly focusing on sustainable operations in ports and coastal areas.\nA key focus of the project is the further development of PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cell systems for large-scale maritime applications. They note by combining with methanol as an energy carrier, this technology offers great potential for supplying ships with electricity, heat, and cooling - efficiently and with low emissions.\nThe DLR Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics is responsible for the pre-development of fuel cell stacks on a scale relevant to the maritime market. This includes the consistent implementation of innovative technology approaches in the field of both LT-PEM and HT-PEM. The aim is to build prototype fuel cell stacks with 250 kW (LT-PEM) and 120 kW (HT-PEM), including performance verification in the laboratory.\nThe DLR Institute of Maritime Energy Systems is carrying out long-term tests on a 500 kW maritime fuel cell system. The aim is to simulate the real load cycles of a cruise ship to prove the long-term suitability of the system. In addition, newly developed LT and HT PEM fuel cell stacks will be tested in the Maritime Energy Laboratory to ensure development to the system level.\nThe German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology funded the project with a total of €18.7 million ($193 million). The research project kicked off in January with a team meeting in Munich.",

The Transportation Secretary Jamie Bautista in company of other senior government officials this week led the groundbreaking ceremony for the port. The $290 million NCICP is located in Tayud, a district at the northern end of Cebu City.\nThe project was first mooted in the early 2000s but experienced approval delays. However, in December the government gave the contractor the green light to begin civil works. President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. signed the project contract with the Korean company HJ Shipbuilding.\n“This project is set to improve Cebu’s cargo handling capacity, alleviate congestion at the existing facility (Cebu Baseport) as well as establish Cebu as a regional logistics hub. The construction is expected to be completed by 2028,” said Cebu Port Authority (CPA).\nThe project involves transforming 60 acres of reclaimed land into an international container port with an annual handling capacity of 395,000 TEU. The terminal will have five quayside cranes, a 500-meter berth and a water depth of 12 meters. This will allow the terminal to accommodate two 2,000 TEU feeders at any given time.\nThe NCICP project is being implemented under a bilateral partnership between the Philippine and Korean governments. The Import-Export Bank of Korea (KEXIM) is contributing around $172 million and the rest is coming from the Philippines’ national government. The International Finance Corporation of the World Bank is acting as the transaction adviser.\n“NCICP will significantly boost economic engagement between the Philippines and South Korea, especially with the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA), which came into force on December 31. Trade and cargo volumes between the two countries is expected to increase significantly in the future,” said the Korean Embassy in Manila.\nWith the Philippines working to improve connectivity and supply chains within its 82 provinces, the country has announced major port expansion projects. Last month, the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) issued tenders for the expansion of three major ports worth $14 million. The targeted ports include San Jose Port in the Province of Dinagat Islands, Roxas Port in Oriental Mindoro and Guinsiliban Port in Camiguin.",

Government and industry officials as well as the union representing the workers at the Appledore facility welcomed the acquisition calling it a new chapter for the company and UK shipbuilding.\n“Today marks the beginning of our shared journey. We are not just combining two companies; we are building a formidable team,” said Navantia’s Chairman, Ricardo Domínguez, as management conducted a visit to the Belfast shipyard and will be touring Appledore, Methil, and Arnish in the coming days.\nRiverstone Capital which had financed the Harland & Wolff Group reported the sale of the four yards was finalized for a cash consideration of £69.9 million ($86.8 million). In addition to the purchase price, Navantia UK agreed to waive £23 million ($28.6 million) of debt that had been provided between October 2024 and the closing to maintain the operations of the four yards. The bankruptcy administrators are expected to make an initial distribution of approximately £44 million ($55 million) to Riverstone Credit Partners and affiliated funds, with future distributions estimated to total around £26 million ($32 million) over the next few months. There was no word if monies would be available to the individual creditors of the Harland & Wolff Group and its shipyards.\nSeparately, Rothschild & Co is soliciting interest for the acquisition of Harland & Wolff's Islandmagee Gas Storage project, which is expected to significantly increase the UK's gas storage capacity once operational. The project was part of InfraStrata, which acquired Harland & Wolff in 2019 and later transformed into the Harland & Wolff Group.\nSpeaking to the workforce at the Belfast shipyard, Navantia’s Domínguez announced that the new owners would resume and expand the investment and recapitalization plan for Harland & Wolff, which is central to the Fleet Solid Support program for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary but had been paused in recent months. Investments into the shipyard facilities had been underway before the bankruptcy to support the FSS program, which calls for Navantia in Spain to build the hulls with integration and delivery taking place at Harland & Wolff’s Belfast shipyard.\nThe investment across the four sites will fund cutting-edge facilities, technology, and training, underpinned by a comprehensive business plan to integrate these facilities into the UK’s industrial and defense ecosystem, reported Navantia. The Financial Times reports the Spanish company has committed up to £100 million ($125 million) in investments to support the building program and to revitalize the four yards. Navantia says it looks to align the yards with the UK’s strategic priorities for national security and energy transition.\nAs part of the deal with the government for the rescue of the four yards, Navantia has reportedly committed to maintaining 1,000 jobs at the four yards. In addition, the company said the FSS program would provide 800 related jobs at suppliers across the UK.\nThe rescue marks the second time in less than a decade that the Belfast yard was been saved during administration. Appledore which also dates back to the 1850s ceased operations in 2019. It was acquired in 2020 by InfraStrata as part of its plans to build out the capabilities of Harland & Wolff.",

It was a strategic deal supported by the UK government and ensured the project to build three support ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.\nThe UK government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer was heavily involved reporting it worked closely with Navantia UK and agreed on an amendment to the existing Fleet Solid Ship Program contract on commercial terms, which made the minimum changes necessary to ensure Navantia could still deliver on the contract and build all three navy ships. The support for the sale came after the government last summer decided not to provide loan guarantees for Harland & Wolff to refinance its operations.\nIn announcing that all the necessary regulatory approvals had been received, Navantia also thanked the UK government for its support during the negotiations. The company is committed to protecting more than 1,000 jobs while making investments in the operations.\n“The completion of this acquisition marks a significant milestone for Navantia UK and demonstrates our long-term commitment to UK industry,” said Ricardo Domínguez, Chairman of Navantia. “By combining Harland & Wolff’s proud heritage and facilities with Navantia’s global expertise in defense, maritime, and renewable energy, we are creating an exceptional platform for growth.”\nNavatia acquired the facilities of Harland & Wolff’s historic shipyard as well as the facilities of Appledore in Devon, and the smaller fabrication yards Methil and Arnish both in Scotland. The yard in Belfast and Appledore will both participate in the Royal Fleet shipbuilding program building components and outfitting the three vessels which will also be built by Navantia at the Puerto Real facility in Cadiz, Spain.\nHarland & Wolff’s parent company went into administration last fall when the UK government refused to support the refinancing. Initially, the shipyards continued to operate but in mid-January, the company said it determined it was no longer possible to run the yards and they would also proceed into administration. It was reported as a step in the sale process making it possible for Navantia to buy the assets without taking on all the debts of Harland & Wolff.\nThe deal and the asset sale raised questions in the UK Parliament and concerns that suppliers would not be paid. GMB Union which represents workers at the yards today however released a message on social media saying closing the deal meant workers could relax with job security. However, the union noted that without more work the wards would continue to struggle.\nThe prior management group had acquired the storied Belfast yard from administration in 2019 and mapped a strategy to expand the business focusing on shipbuilding, repair, and opportunities in structures for the offshore energy market. They acquired the long-idle Appledore yard and the yards in Scotland and had begun to win assignments including its first new builds in 20 years. However, it also required extensive investments to modernize the facilities.\nNavantia looks to use its extensive depth in the maritime industry both with naval construction and repairs to expand Harland & Wolff’s operations.",

While much of the focus in the industry is on the need for more and larger CO2 carriers to meet the anticipated needs of the carbon capture and storage industry, this project focused on a specialized LCO2 carrier tailored to the coastal market in Japan.\nMitsubishi has been actively promoting the development of LCO2 carriers and the establishment of CCS value chains. In a project working with Nihon Shipyard Co., it is jointly pursuing the development of anocean-going liquified CO2 carrierwhile working with NYK they developed concepts for a vessel that could transport both CO2 and ammonia. Another project that also involves Nippon Gas Line looks to develop the value chain including moving the captured CO2 to Malaysia for storage under the seabed.\nDemand for LCO2 carriers is expected to grow in tandem with CCS (carbon dioxide capture and storage) projects involving marine transport of CO2 captured in Japan to storage sites. Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Nippon Gas Line worked jointly on a study exploring the need to transport CO2 captured at smaller sites in the Seto Inland Sea area and transport it to overseas storage sites.\nMitsubishi Shipbuilding in late 2023 completed the construction of a small-scaledemonstration LCO2 carrierwith a cargo tank capacity of 1,450 cubic meters. The project sponsored by the Japanese government was to develop expertise in the sector and was followed by a program to establish standard specifications and designs for LCO2 carriers along with a focus on the steps to establish a construction supply chain.\nMitsubishi Shipbuilding and Nippon Gas Line have now completed a concept study for a low-pressure type coastal LCO2 carrier for the needs of emitters in the Seto Inland Sea area. ClassNK (Nippon Kaiji Kyokai) reviewed the designs and awarded Approval in Principle for the carrier to serve in coastal transport. The study explored domestic storage sites or acting as a feeder operation for overseas shipping.\nThe companies expect the AiP certification to support the efforts to develop opportunities for highly versatile small-sized LCO2 carriers to consolidate CO2 collection in Japan for transfer through overseas shipping.\nPreviously, the companies have said the goal would be to start construction on LCO2 carriers by 2027.

The milestone is being hailed as another demonstration of the expanding prowess and capacity of the domestic shipbuilding industry.\nThe new cruise ship is being built for Adora Cruises, a Chinese company controlled by CSSC with Carnival Corporation as a minority investor, and the second time the CSSC yard has turned out a large ocean-going cruise ship. At 141,800 gross tons and 1,119 feet (341 meters) the new cruise which was namedAdora Flora Cityin October 2024, will be 57 feet (17.4 meters) longer than theAdora Magic City. Passenger capacity is being increased to 5,232 passengers.\n\"It took us less than nine months to complete the hull structure assembly, two months sooner than the first one,\" said Wang Qi, chairman of China State Shipbuilding Corp (CSSC) Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co. during the celebrating ceremony held on Wednesday morning at its builder Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co.\n\n\n\nDuring the presentation, it was highlighted that the speed of construction for the cruise ship is “on par with our European peers,” being achieved after “initially mastering the key technologies.” Cruise ships are more complex than containerships and other vessels built by the yards due to the intricacies of the hotel and its systems. The European shipyards involve numerous subcontractors and have well-developed supplier networks for all the details of a cruise ship project.\nCSSC initially partnered with Italy’s Fincantieri to develop its cruise ship construction capabilities. The design for the cruise ships is based on a class developed by Fincantieri and Carnival that has been deployed for Carnival Cruise Line and Costa Cruises. CSSC invested heavily to create new fabrication facilities unique to cruise ships.\nOne of the assertions reported to be included in thepending reportfrom the U.S. Trade Representative on the shipbuilding industry focuses on China’s co-opting technologies to build its domestic industry. The U.S. report will assert that China has engaged in forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft, and procurement policies to give its shipbuilders an advantage.\n\n\n\nThe new cruise ship, which will operate with the colloquial name ofAida Huacheng, is a refined version of the original design. In addition to the additional length, the passenger cabin design has been “optimized” with a new variety of suites and the addition of 19 staterooms for a total of 2,144. The size of the atrium lobby is being doubled and the public spaces, entertainment, and leisure areas have been “fully upgraded.”\nAmong the unique spaces being highlighted aboard the next cruise ship is the Sea Street Garden. It will be an open multi-function social space reportedly inspired by its namesake city, Guangzhou in southern City near Hong Kong. The city has the conversational identity of the Flower City. The Sea Street Garden will be a space for entertainment, leisure and healing activities, social interaction, and a coffee café. The space evolves based on the time of day.\nAdora launched cruises this year from Guangzhou aboard theAdora Mediterranea(formerlyCosta Mediterranea) in advance of the completion of theAdora Flora City.Adora Magic Cityremains homeported in Shanghai. During its first year of operation, the cruise ship reportedly completed 84 voyages and welcomed nearly 600,000 tourists.\nCSSC reported the new cruise ship is moving into the second phase of construction. It will focus on interior decoration, equipment installation, and commissioning. The construction schedule calls for the next milestone at the end of April with the first dock flotation test.Adora Flora Cityis expected to be delivered by the end of 2026.",

    "input": "\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock has lost its appeal to reverse a Customs and Border Protection ruling that allows foreign rock-dumping vessels to compete more easily for U.S. offshore wind farm contracts. The U.S. 5th Circuit ruled that GLDD's suit was speculative, finding that the harm to GLDD's business interests had not yet occurred.\nCBP ruled in January 2021 that foreign-flagged vessels could not be used to dump U.S. rock onto the U.S. continental shelf: the rock originated at a U.S. point, and would be deposited at a U.S. point on the OCS. Two months later, after a request from the American Petroleum Institute, CBP reversed itself and ruled that foreign-flagged vessels could dump the first layer of scour protection rock on \"pristine\" seabed at a new U.S. windfarm, as the seabed is not a Jones Act-regulated U.S. point before the moment when a vessel installs rock on it. The second and subsequent layers must be placed by a Jones Act vessel, CBP ruled.\nU.S. coastwise shipping interests rely upon legal protection to exclude foreign operators, which have lower capital, labor and compliance costs and can usually underbid Jones Act-qualified shipping on a commercial basis. For national security reasons, U.S. coastwise shipping is protected from global price pressure by federal law. Customs and Border Protection is tasked with defining the limits of those protections through letter rulings, advisory interpretations of the Jones Act that lay out what does and does not constitute protected coastwise trade between U.S. points.\nGLDD has invested about $200 million in a new Jones Act rock placement vessel to serve offshore wind installations, the only one of its kind in the United States, and will be the first company ever to install U.S. rock at a U.S. OCS wind farm. Its outsize investment in U.S.-built tonnage is predicated on a long-term pipeline of scour protection contracts for U.S. wind farm projects. As the sole bidder with a legally qualified ship on order, GLDD secured three rock contracts by the end of 2023, and it expected more: at the time, the industry appeared to be picking up pace. In a federal lawsuit, GLDD argued that by partially opening the market to low-cost foreign bidders, CBP's ruling reduced its ability to compete successfully for future work.\nThe American Petroleum Institute intervened in the case as an appellee, and it argued that GLDD did not have standing to sue because it had not yet lost a bid to a foreign rock placement vessel operator, and had therefore not yet suffered any harm. The district court agreed and dismissed GLDD's suit as lacking standing, without considering the merits of the case. GLDD objected, since it had already spent millions on a new ship, and appealed the decision.\nOn appeal, the 5th Circuit confirmed the dismissal of GLDD's case. The circuit court ruled that GLDD had not shown that it would face future competition from foreign flag vessels when bidding for future Jones Act rock-placement work. The judges noted that the same work could be performed without considering the Jones Act, simply by shipping the rock from a foreign port, and decided that there was too little information to assess the prospects of foreign participation in a brand new trade: no firm has yet actually moved U.S. rock to a U.S. outer continental shelf wind farm.\n\"In sum, Great Lakes has not shown injury-in-fact merely because the [CBP] letter may foster future competition. We agree with CBP that this theory of competitor standing 'sweeps far too broadly,'\" the judges ruled.",

The single-engine plane crashed on an ice floe, killing the pilot and all nine passengers aboard.\nCoast Guard search parties found the wreckage on Friday, and deployed two rescue swimmers to the surface of the ice by helicopter to investigate. They identified three victims in the wreckage; the other seven people aboard were not visible but were presumed dead because of the state of the aircraft. According to the Nome Volunteer Fire Department, the crash was not survivable. The remains of all ten victims were recovered by Monday.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) plans to conduct a further investigation, but accessing the wreckage is difficult. The ice is soft and unstable, and a winter storm is coming soon, part of the usual pattern of the Bering Sea's relentless weather. According to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy, the ice floe is drifting at a rate of about five miles a day.\nVictims of the crash included two school staffmembers and two technical staff who were in Unalakleet to service a water plant. Like many of Alaska's far-flung coastal settlements, the area is roadless and accessible only by air or sea.\nThe aircraft was a derivative of the Cessna 208, a commercially successful single-engine aircraft used around the world for passenger and cargo transport.

Known as Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, the 2.6 GW project will be the largest in the United States when it is completed at the end of 2026.\nOffshore work for the wind farm began in 2024 and the company says it has now approached the 50 percent mark with milestones in the installation. After completing the installation of 78 monopole foundations and four offshore substation foundations during the first season which ended in November 2024, Dominion highlights that the first 16 transition pieces are now in place. The completed project will have 176 wind turbines. The company continues to stage materials at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal with the next phase of monopole installations due to start in the spring.\nThe first three of the 4,300-ton offshore substations arrived in late January in Virginia. Among the next steps, Dominion reports that wind turbine tower and blade fabrication is now underway and nacelle fabrication is scheduled to begin later this quarter.\n\n\nSubstations arrived as materials are staged onshore in Virginia (Port of Virginia)\n\nWhile the project is making good progress on the installation, Dominion also revealed costs are up approximately nine percent from the November 2021 budget submitted to the Virginia State Corporation Commission. They noted that the increase, which is due to higher onshore network upgrade costs assigned by grid operator PJM, has driven the total budget to $10.7 billion up from the original estimate of $9.8 billion.\nThe company emphasized that the costs are controlled with robust cost-sharing mechanisms and an unused contingency that stands at $222 million. Dominion Energy last year sold a 50 percent stake in the project to investors Stonepeak which will cover half the costs up to $11.3 billion. Above that there is a cost-sharing mechanism. While costs are up, they also said it is only for the grid portion with other project costs including offshore having remained in line with the original budget. The company reports the project will cost the average customer 43 cents per month over the life of the project.\nAs part of the project, Dominion Energy is building the first U.S. wind turbine installation vessel at Seatrium’s shipyard in Texas. NamedCharybis, they report the vessel is now 96 percent complete. It has commenced sea trials. Its first project will be the installations for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind.\nThe company has been successful in managing the project to keep it on track and avoid some of the challenges that other projects are experiencing. It retrained DEME for the first phase of the installation using DEME’s large install vesselOrion.\nDominion’s long-term plan calls for expanding its offshore wind energy presence. In 2024, Dominion acquired an adjoining property from Avangrid which is said could provide an additional 800 MW of power. In August 2024, Dominion also won a lease from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for a site 35 nautical miles from the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The company has said the lease area could support between 2.1 gigawatts and 4.0 gigawatts of offshore wind energy generation according to BOEM’s preliminary estimates. These additional projects require planning and eventually permitting which would likely be delayed under the Trump administration’s energy policy.",

Of this we estimate 320,000 liters of diesel fuel mix has been recovered from the ship’s diesel fuel tanks.\"\nThe team has pumped out the ship's larger and more accessible tanks, he said, and they are now making progress on the smaller remaining tanks. There are 54 in total that need to be pumped out, including fuel, lube oil and bilge water tanks.\n\"The amount of diesel fuel in the liquid recovered won’t be known until the liquid is processed, although the majority of the volume of liquid recovered so far is assessed to be diesel,\" Commodore Brown said. “In addition to the liquids from the diesel fuel tanks, the salvors have recovered around 18,000 liters of lubricating oil.\"\nThe end of the pollution-abatement process is approaching, and the governments of Samoa and New Zealand are in talks about next steps, which might include wreck removal or possible compensation for local fishermen. The residents of nearby villages were banned from fishing near the wreck site for weeks due to the risk of fuel contamination.\nThose villagers are making moves of their own. After calling for financial compensation from their government and from New Zealand, they reached out to the Chinese embassy in Apia for foreign aid assistance. \"We met with the Chinese ambassador to discuss our needs, and they are willing to assist us immediately due to the sinking of the boat in our district,\" a spokesperson told Radio New Zealand. \"We talked about the individual and family needs for daily living, including monetary assistance to help with their losses.\"",

    "input": "The world's largest iceberg is slowing heading towards the island of South Georgia, where it may have serious affects on local wildlife.\nIceberg A23a is so big that it ihard to visualize: at 1.1 million acres in area, it is about 75 times larger than Manhattan (and shrinking). Fornow, it measures about 40 nautical miles by 32 nautical miles on a side, and it weighs about one trillion tonnes. Its sheer sides tower more than 1,300 feet above the water, and chunks regularly break off in the waves.\nThe berg's arrival has been a long time coming. A23a broke off of Antarctica's Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986, and began to drift off into the Weddell Sea (taking a Soviet research base with it). It ran aground almost immediately, and stayed anchored to the bottom until 2020, when it finally refloated and began to drift to the northwest. It took three years to reach the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, and finally reached the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in April 2024. This was expected to shuttle the iceberg northeast into the Atlantic, where it would melt in warmer waters.\nHowever, A23a stalled in the South Orkney Islands for much of 2024. Oceanographers say that it was likely caught in a Taylor Column - a rotating cylindrical current found above a rise on the bottom. It kicked loose from this spinning water trap late last year and drifted away towards South Georgia, which is now about 180 miles away.\nWhen it finally breaks up, the iceberg will pose a hazard to the area's sparse vessel traffic - primarily fishermen - and may block in the rugged beaches of South Georgia, home to King penguins and seals. The last megaberg that reached the island broke up in 2023, and its remains still make a mess of commercial navigation. Fishing vessels operating near South Georgia have to negotiate a shifting city of giant ice blocks to get to and from their fishing grounds. \"It is in bits from the size of several Wembley stadiums down to pieces the size of your desk,\" Andrew Newman of fishing company Argos Froyanes told BBC.\nThe ice can also make it harder for penguins and seals to access the water from their breeding grounds on shore. Mark Belchier, director of fisheries and environment for the government of South Georgia, told CNN that any impact on wildlife from beach obstructions would be \"highly localized and transient.\"",

The companies highlighted the complementary nature of their operations saying the combination expands the customer base and reach they can provide.\nWallenius SOL, based in Sweden, calls itself one of the pioneers in the RoRo sector. Today it provides regularly scheduled liner traffic between northern Scandinavia, the European Continent, and the United Kingdom. Its website highlights five vessels.\nThe company Wallenius SOL was launched in April 2019 as a 50-50 joint venture with Svenska Orient Linien (SOL) to expand its reach in Northern Europe. Dating back to 1911, SOL’s operations include tramp and liner shipping with LoLo ships between Scandinavia and the Baltics to the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as worldwide project cargoes and defense logistics.\nThe group acquires Mann reporting that it will combine the RoRo operation and use the brand of Mann Lines Logistics to further expand the logistic services for the joint business. Mann operates a 12,784 dwt RoRo built in 2017,M L Freyja, which it noted with 11,000 square meters of capacity exceeds its previous carrying capacities. The vessel has a modern hull and engine design which gives it much improved efficiency and environmental benefits. The company also provides logistics and forwarding services.\nMann is also scheduled to begin a long-term charter in 2025 of a second slightly larger RoRo currently building in Spain at Cantiere Navale Visentini. The new vessel will have a loading capacity of 3,000 lane meters plus around 200 cars on two car decks.\n“This acquisition, will among other things, result in a larger fleet and an expanded port network stretching from the Baltic countries to North West Europe,” says Elvir Dzanic, CEO of Wallenius SOL. “The integration of services will enhance our expertise, broaden our offerings, and foster thriving partnerships. With Mann Lines Logistics’ knowledge and years of experience operating container services in Northern Europe, we are well-equipped to deliver even greater value to the industries and communities we serve.”\nIn addition to the complimentary routes in the Baltic and North West Europe, the companies said it would extend its service range to Ireland, Spain, and beyond. It will add about 200 customers to Wallenius SOL.\nIt is the second step this year announced by Wallenius SOL to expand its operations. At the beginning of the year, the company launched an expanded route with the charter of the container vessel, Peyton Lynn C, with a capacity of 860 TEU. It expanded its LoLo service to include the Port of Tornio, Port of Pite, and Port of Rotterdam. It reported it would provide enhanced network connectivity in the Bay of Bothnia and strengthen access to deep-sea routes via Rotterdam alongside Antwerp.",

The vessel operating under charter as theMaersk Saltorois reported to be back underway after drifting for 23 days in the Pacific after a main engine failure.\nThe 116,850 dwt containership was built in 2015 by Hyundai in South Korea. Like theDali, she is also sailing under the flag of Singapore and managed by Synergy Marine under charter to Maersk. She has a capacity of 9,971 TEU. The vessel previously drew attention when U.S. officials boarded it in Baltimore in September 2024 to conduct an inspection due to it being a sister ship to theDali.\nThe vessel'smain engine failedwhile it was in the Pacific traveling to China after having departed Chile on December 27. The tug company Pacific International reports that its Marshall Islands Towing and Salvage Company deployed a tug on January 22 which took aboard four technicians in Kosrae, in the Federated States of Micronesia, before proceeding to the stricken vessel. TheMaersk Saltorowas reported to be adrift approximately 550 miles west of Pohnpei, also in Micronesia.\nTemporary repairs have been completed according to reports in the Chilean media and the vessel was able to get back underway on February 5. The schedule is now showing the ship will reach the Nansha New Port in China on February 17 depending on weather conditions during the remainder of the voyage. It will be a month behind schedule and then continuing to Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Ningbo. It is unclear when or where permanent repairs will be completed.\nA spokesperson for Maersk confirmed to the Chilean media that they were monitoring the situation and in contact with the vessel’s owners. They said the ship and crew as well as its cargo were in no danger and the owners assured them the refrigerated containers were continuing to operate during the breakdown.\nThe breakdown has drawn extensive attention in Chile as the vessel was part of a seasonal service known as the Cherry Express. Growers are concerned because the vessel was loaded with 1,353 refrigerated containers of cherries shipped to China to coincide with the Lunar New Year’s celebrations. The worry is that the long transit times will affect the quality of the shipment and decrease its value in addition to the impact of the late arrival.\nPrices of cherries are already reported to be depressed this year. They are one of Chile’s largest exports with the media saying 120 million boxes were sent to China. Reportedly 25 containerships were part of the seasonal service with more than 17,000 containers of cherries shipped from Chile’s port of San Antonio.",

    "input": "\nTrailer theft is commonplace in America, and homeowners and contractors go to great lengths to keep thieves away from their toy-haulers and cargo trailers. But the Port of LA's police department recently busted a much larger and more organized trailer theft scheme: the department uncovered a ring of local thieves who were making off with dozens of chassis from container terminals and reselling them as new, making off with millions of dollars in ill-gotten profits.\nA joint investigation by the LA Police Department and the LA Port Police revealed the existence of a large-scale trailer theft ring that had likely been working in the Port of LA since last year. Authorities believe that the criminals accessed container terminals on port grounds; stole empty chassis that were stored and awaiting use; and relocated them to a storage yard in Gardena. There, the gang allegedly removed all the identifying marks from the chassis, repainted them, put new VIN numbers and markings on them, and resold them to unwitting buyers as new chassis.\nIn a raid on the 14500 block of South Avalon Boulevard in Gardena, 10 miles north of the Port of LA, police found 24 stolen chassis with a value of about $600,000. Given the scale of the scheme and the value of each chassis, the police believe that the theft ring was earning millions of dollars in revenue.\nGardena resident Denis Fuentes, 25, was arrested at the storage lot and now faces potential charges of receiving stolen property. The investigation is still under way, and additional arrests are expected soon; the port police are gathering information and are interested in receiving any relevant tips from the public.\n“The Port of Los Angeles [is] the busiest port in the United States so stopping this theft was important for everyone involved,” said LA Port Police spokesperson Lt. Rosario Ferrara. “Our investigation into these activities continues to evolve, but we hope this arrest sends a message to other criminals targeting the Port complex.”",

    "input": "\nSpeculation continues within the different sectors of the shipping industry on when vessels might return to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. The head of the Suez Canal Authority expressed an optimistic prediction of the end of the first quarter, while shipping companies such as Maersk had said the second half or even late 2025.\nAnalysts warn that much of the outlook depends on the second round of the peace talks due to start for Gaza. The first phase of the ceasefire has held with hostages held by Hamas and Palestinians detained by Israeli exchanged despite a general uneasiness before each exchange.\nThe Arab nations, however, were quick to denounce Donald Trump’s repeated statements that the United States would take ownership of Gaza and redevelop it as the “Riviera of the Middle East.” Trump repeated the comments to the media on Sunday, saying Palestinians would not be returned to Gaza but relocated to our countries, causing widespread concern of potential unrest and a collapse in the peace talks. Saudi Arabia has said there will be no peace without a Palestinian state. The Houthis threatened to renew their attacks if the ceasefire collapsed.\n“A week ago, there was a light at the end of the tunnel,” commented Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime and a well-known industry analyst, told The Financial Times. He said, “The likelihood of a return to the Red Sea is reduced.”\nSuez Canal Authority Chairman Osama Rabie, however, speaking on Egyptian TV, said he expected to continue to see a gradual return, reports Bloomberg. He said a level of normalcy could be reached by late March and a full recovery by mid-year. Bloomberg, however, reports no more than 32 ships a day are making the transit, half the record highs of 75 vessels. The Canal Authority has also taken steps to increase capacity, recently completing additional two-way traffic lanes in the southern reaches of the canal.\n“Such a development is clearly contingent upon a positive development in the current negotiations related to the ceasefire in Gaza,” said Jensen. He pointed out that this Red Sea crisis has reached 448 days, with so far, few vessels having returned.\nLast week, the Suez Canal Authority highlighted that a Liberian-registered tanker that was attacked last July made an uneventful transit of the Suez Canal, its first in more than eight months. They pointed to it as a sign of the gradual return that they are predicting.\nAttendees at a Lloyd’s oil industry conference, however, continue to take a wait-and-see attitude. Barbara Harrison, vice president of crude supply and trading at Chevron, was quoted as saying the industry was waiting to see which ship would be first.\nThe managing partner of Energy Outlook Advisors, Anas Alhajji, took to social media on Sunday, February 9, to announce that the first LNG-laden carrier in about a year was crossing the Red Sea. He reported theSalalah LNG(145,500 cbm) was carrying Omani LNG. Built in 2005 and registered in Panama, the vessel is operated by Oman’s state-owned Asyad Shipping Company.\nMedia reports are speculating the LNG carrier is going to Turkey. The vessel’s operators appeared to be still cautious as no destination was displayed on its AIS, and instead, it had a message saying “armed guards onboard.”",

    "input": "While saying that it believes U.S. retailers continued to frontload imports of key products for several months ahead of a potential dockworkers strike and tariff increases, the National Retail Federation data now points to a slowing of month-to-month container volumes at the top U.S. ports. The trade association lowered its near-term forecast in the Global Port Tracker for U.S. container import volumes while saying it believes retailers continue to engage in diversification efforts to adjust supply chains.\n“Unfortunately, it takes significant time to move supply chains, even if you can find available capacity,” said Jonathan Gold, Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy at the NRF. “Retailers have engaged in mitigation strategies to minimize the potential impact of tariffs, including frontloading of some products, but that can lead to increased challenges because of added warehousing and related costs.”\nThe Global Port Tracker lowered its forecast for December 2024’s volume by 100,000 TEU at the major U.S. ports projecting the final number will be at 2.14 million TEU. While that would still be more than 14 percent ahead of 2023, it is down nearly one percent from November 2024. Further, the trade group lowered its January 2025 forecast by 50,000 TEU projecting the total at 2.11 million TEU. While that is up nearly eight percent over 2024, it would be another consecutive monthly decline. February 2025 is also projected to be down to 1.96 million TEU because of Lunar New Year factor shutdowns in China.\nThe NRF notes that the total for 2024 however rivaled the peak of 25.8 million TEU in 2021. It expects the final tally for 2024 at 25.5 million TEU which would be nearly 15 percent ahead of 2023. Strong consumer demand and low unemployment in the final months of the Biden administration contributed to continued strong retail sales and demand.\nPort cargo “could be badly hit” if tariffs on overseas Asian and European nations increase prices and prompt consumers to buy less, said Ben Hackett, Founder of Hackett Associates. He notes that Trump’s now delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico would initially have minimal impact at ports because most imports from either country move by truck, rail, or pipeline. In the long term, tariffs on goods that receive final manufacturing in Canada or Mexico but originate elsewhere could prompt an increase in direct maritime imports to the U.S. predicts Hackett.\nThe NRF is forecasting that container imports will begin to show month-over-month growth (as well as year-over-year) in the spring as retailers stock up for summer sales. March is forecast at 2.14 million TEU, up 11.1 percent year-over-year; April at 2.18 million TEU, up 8.2 percent; and May at 2.19 million TEU, up 5.4 percent. The current forecast however shows the increases could be short-lived with June container imports forecast at 2.13 million TEU, down 0.6 percent year-over-year and reversing the month-over-month gains.\nRetailer imports are forecast at 12.71 million TEU for the first half of 2025. That would be a 3.6 percent increase over the first half of 2024.",

HTS did not attack Russian forces, even though Russia had bombarded HTS and its allies for most of Syria's 13-year civil war, but the Islamist group did cancel Russia's 49-year operating lease on the commercial portion of the seaport.\nAs HTS advanced, Russian Navy's Mediterranean Flotilla left Tartus en masse and took up station off the coast.

The report details that installed capacity grew by 15 percent in the past 12 months as leading countries accelerated installations and new countries also adopted the increasingly accepted source of renewable energy.\nThe report calls out several key firsts including that global capacity surpassed 80.9 GW, the first time it has been at that level coming from a base of 70.2 GW just a year earlier. Additional countries are also making process with the first projects including the introductory offshore wind projects in Indonesia, Chile, and Malta which were confirmed in 2024.\nRecently, Greece mapped out its first project while on the other side of the globe, Australia finalized additional zones and reported progress with its likely first projects to win regulatory approval. The United States officially commissioned its first commercial-scale offshore wind farm in 2024 while others are proceeding in the construction phase.\n“Our latest EnergyPulse Insights report shows that the global offshore wind market is continuing to grow at an extraordinary speed year after year, as more countries look to seize the industrial, economic, and environmental opportunities which the technology offers,” comments RenewableUK’s Chief Executive Dan McGrail.\nThe report however also shows a continued concentration among a few countries while others work to accelerate the next phase of growth. Two countries, China (adding 6.9 GW) and the Netherlands (adding 1.7 GW) accounted for 63 percent of the total capacity added in the offshore segment in 2024. Further, for the first time, a single country, China (41 GW installed) now accounts for more than half the industry’s current capacity.\nThe first offshore wind farm, Vindeby installed in Denmark, was commissioned in 1991. The UK entered the sector in 2003 and by 2008 had become the leader, a position it maintained till 2021. China took the lead in 2021 and two years later in 2023 was over 31 GW. The UK remains second but far behind with 14.7 GW installed and Germany is third at 8.5 GW.\nThe growth is set to continue predicts RenewableUK reporting that the number of projects in the global offshore wind pipeline has increased from 1,461 to 1,555 over the last twelve months. It notes that the number of countries involved in the sector is up from 41 to 44 as new markets continue to emerge.\nThe project pipeline they believe looks strong when considering offshore wind farms at all stages of development. The report reviews fully operational, under construction, consented, in the planning system, and early development projects.\nChina has the largest defined pipeline with 247 GW across 437 projects, while the UK remains in second place with 96 GW across 123 projects. The U.S. has significant potential according to the report with its 79 GW of defined projects placing it ahead of Germany which has 68 GW and Sweden which was reported with 55 GW. Sweden, however, recently blocked many of the projects due to concerns raised by the military for defense and of course, Donald Trump has taken steps since his inauguration to stop the progress in the U.S. industry.\nRenewableUK also used the report to highlight the opportunities in the UK. It is urging the UK government to maximize its investment in new offshore wind capacity. Wind energy became the UK’s largest source of electricity surpassing gas in 2024. In the upcoming Allocation round 7, 13 UK offshore wind projects with a total capacity of 7.3 GW are eligible. The government received 72 responses during the consultation round and is expected to launch the next auction in March.\nSupporting the growth are also developments in new technology. Media reports indicate Siemens Gamesahas received consent to proceed with the development of a prototype 21 MW offshore turbine that will rial the largest announced in China. RewnewableUK emphasizes a large potential saying the industry cold surpass 254 GW by the end of 2030 while expect the emerging floating offshore wind segment could have 3.9 GW installed by 2030.",

    "input": "Efforts to develop the first LNG import terminal in South Africa are continuing to make progress with 2026 now targeted for a final investment decision. A terminal operator agreement was signed which provides for the design, development, construction, and operation of the terminal which would be located at the Port of Richards Bay on the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa.\nTransnet Pipelines, a division of the state-owned group and that operates nearly 2,000 miles of pipelines, has formed a joint venture with Vopak Terminal Durban, part of Royal Vopak, for the planned LNG terminal. Transnet National Ports Authority appointed the joint venture known as Zululand Energy Terminal in August 2024 to develop and operate the LNG terminal. It followed the first RFP which was awarded in January 2024.\nZululand has now executed a 25-year concession for land in Richards Bay to be used for the terminal. The company has full rights to the land designated for the terminal and reports it is a key step in the process.\nAccording to the companies, the LNG terminal is a pivotal development in South Africa’s efforts to ensure energy security as the country faces a looming “gas cliff” and the gradual decommissioning of coal-fired power stations. The terminal will support flexible power generation while fostering industrial growth in KwaZulu-Natal and beyond.\nThe project calls for the development of a floating storage unit with a capacity of 135,000 to 174,000 cbm which would be supported by an onshore regasification unit. In the second phase, they plan to replace the FSU with onshore storage.\nZululand Energy Terminal reports it is in an advanced stage of its capacity allocation process, with negotiations ongoing with a select group of potential customers. It initiated an RFP in September 2024 to identify key stakeholders critical to the project’s success. With the new agreements, it reports it can proceed with binding agreements with potential customers. A final investment decision is expected in 2026, contingent on customer commitments.\nRoyal Vopak has been active in South Africa since 1997. It owns and operates two terminals in the country and expects to leverage its expertise to develop this new project.\nTransnet in August 2024 also asked for expressions of interest from companies for a second project to support the LNG terminal. It plans to transition the existing Lilly Gas Pipeline which connects to Durban from transporting Methane Rich Gas to regasified LNG. Lilly currently transports approximately 500 cbm of MGR annually and has key offtake points along its route. The LNG project they report will benefit from the industries connected to the Lilly Pipeline.\nOfficials have said this LNG terminal project represents a significant milestone for South Africa. They highlight that it will provide the infrastructure necessary to meet growing energy demands, support the energy transition, and stimulate economic growth. South Africa will join a growing number of countries around the world working to develop LNG import capabilities.",

    "input": "\nNorwegian oil major Equinor has announced a major cutback to its renewable-energy ambitions, and says that it plans to focus on maximizing shareholder value going forward.\n\"Equinor has high-graded the project portfolios in renewables and low-carbon solutions, and reduced cost and early-phase spend,\" the company said in its quarterly report. \"The portfolio is expected to deliver more than 10 percent life-cycle equity returns.\"\nThe company said that circumstances have changed since it last set its renewables targets - especially in the United States, where the political and economic winds have shifted against offshore wind development. Equinor said that these pressures have had an effect on its credit evaluation, leading it to reduce its investment target for renewables for 2030 by about 25 percent.\n\"The reduced investment program is in line with our commitment to ensure a capital structure that can support a solid investment grade credit rating,\" Equinor said.\nOn the oil and gas side, Equinor expects production to increase by 10 percent  to 2.2 MMboed by 2030, thanks to strong performance at its core Norwegian continental shelf operations. Equinor plans satellite field development and increased recovery from existing assets to help support long-term production at low cost.\nEquinor posted operating income of $8 billion and a net profit of $2 billion in the fourth quarter. It continues to invest in share buybacks, including a $5 billion buyback program for 2025 alone. \"Equinor is well positioned for further growth and competitive shareholder returns. We expect to deliver industry-leading return on average capital employed, above 15% all the way to 2030,\" said CEO Anders Opedal.\nEquinor has been in retreat from renewables investments for some time. Last August it closed its offshore wind operations in Vietnam, Portugal and Spain, citing inflation and supply chain delays. In September, it dropped out of a proposed blue hydrogen pipeline project that would have supplied power plants in Germany, citing lack of demand for the natural gas-based product.\nIt has, however, invested in growing its position in offshore-wind leader Orsted. Last year, it announced that it has acquired a cumulative $2.5 billion stake in the Danish company, just shy of 10 percent.\n“Equinor has a long-term perspective and will be a supportive owner in Ørsted,” said Anders Opedal, CEO of Equinor, in announcing the stock position. “This is a counter-cyclical investment in a leading developer, and a premium portfolio of operating offshore wind assets. The exposure to producing assets complements Equinor’s operated offshore wind portfolio of large projects under development.”",

    "input": "\nThe Port of Luanda in Angola is set to become a battleground of competition for two giant Arab companies after AD Ports officially commenced operations at the port under a long-term concession. AD Ports, the Abu Dhabi-based operator, announced that it has begun the long-term management and development of a major multipurpose terminal and associated logistics business at the port.\nThe company ventured into Angola in April last year after signing agreements with local firms Unicargas and Multiparques that saw it acquire an 81 percent stake to operate the terminal and a 90 percent shareholding in another logistics business. The company managed to secure a 20-year concession granting it the rights to operate the Noatum Ports Luanda terminal, with an option for a 10-year extension.\nAD Ports operations of this terminal set the ground for competition with Dubai-headquartered DP World for cargo business at the port. Since 2021, DP World has been running another multipurpose terminal under a 20-year concession and is investing $190 million to rehabilitate the existing infrastructure and acquire new equipment to improve efficiency.\nThe two giant operators will now be competing for a bigger share of business at the port, which handles about 76 percent of Angola’s container and general cargo volumes. It also provides maritime access to landlocked neighbors, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia.\nAD Ports hopes that its intended investments amounting to $250 million over the next two years in modernizing the terminal and expanding the logistic facility will be instrumental in attracting business. Over the lifespan of the concession, the company is committing to invest $380 million.\nKey investments will go towards upgrading the terminal to a general cargo, container, and roll-on-roll-off (RoRo) terminal, making it the only one with 16 meters (52.5 feet) of depth. This will ensure the terminal is able to handle Super Post Panamax vessels of up to 14,000 TEU. The terminal area spanning 192,000 square meters will also be re-engineered to support high-density and efficient container handling and will be equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and modern IT systems.\nAD Ports also plans to install new container handling equipment to boost container capacity from 25,000 TEU to 350,000 TEU and Ro-Ro volumes to over 40,000 vehicles. The company has already ordered three STS cranes and eight hybrid Rubber Tyred Gantry cranes for the terminal.\n“With the planned upgrade of Luanda’s multipurpose port terminal, and establishment of an integrated logistics and freight forwarding business, AD Ports is positioned to capture the growth in Angola’s container volumes, which are forecast to rise on average by 3.3 percent annually over the next decade,” said Mohamed Eidha Al Menhali, Regional CEO of AD Ports Group.\nThe start of operations in Angola by AD Ports is part of its Africa expansion strategy. Over the past three years, the company has announced more than $800 million in planned investments in the maritime and shipping, ports, and logistics sectors in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Tanzania, and Angola.",

    "input": "\nAt a press conference on Friday, January 31, at the now closed FSG Shipyard (Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft) the provisional insolvency administrators announced their rescue plan for the group’s two shipyard groups. They have reached terms for the two divisions to be sold independently of each other but also reported that investor Lars Windhorst continues to oppose the bankruptcy of the shipyard group.\n“We have managed to find two renowned strategic investors for FSG and Nobiskrug within the extremely tight time frame of just seven weeks,” said lawyer Christoph Morgen who is the provisional insolvency administrator for FSG. He also oversaw the previous insolvency of the company and the sale of the former MW Werften. According to Morgen, the best outcome has been reached for FSG ensuring the yard will resume work.\nThe group wasforced into bankruptcyin December 2024 by insurance administrators with reports employees had not been paid for weeks. There are also reports of a long list of creditors for the shipyards with many suppliers not having been paid in months. Windhorst had controlled the yards since 2000.\nUnder the terms of the provisional agreement, the Heinrich R?nner Group from Bremerhaven will acquire the FSG shipyard. The yard has been building Ro/Ro ferries and currently has an incomplete ferry in the yard for Australia’s Searoad. The Australian company is reported to support the deal and has already entered into a contract with R?nner for the completion of the ferry.\nR?nner is active in shipbuilding as well as steel construction. The company acquired the Lloyd Werft shipyard in Bremerhaven in 2022 during the insolvency proceedings for Genting Hong Kong and MV Werften.\nThe fate of the Nobiskrug operation is less clear. Lawyer Hendrick Gittermann is the provision insolvency administrator for the yards which specialize in luxury yacht construction. He reported that a notarized offer had been received from the Lürssen group, another of Germany’s large yacht shipbuilding groups. He reported that under the terms of the agreement, Lürssen would acquire Nobiskrug. Initially, it appears work and employees will be transferred to the neighboring Lürssen-Kr?ger shipyard.\nDuring the press conference, it was highlighted that neither of the shipyards can immediately resume work due to permitting and other considerations. Morgen said the deal would signal the start of investments by the acquirers to restore the operations.\nEmployees of the bankrupt companies have agreed to the formation of a transfer company. It is a German system that provides for 80 percent of their historic wages along with retraining. The transfer company will run for four months with 310 employees from FSG and 140 from Nobiskrug. The intent is for them to transfer back to the shipyards.\nMorgen reported however that late last night he and the judge overseeing the insolvency received a communication from Lars Windhorst. He reportedly offered to make available €50 million ($52 million) in a trust and would resume his role as managing director of FSG Group and the two shipyard groups.\nThe administrators said they viewed this as a delaying tactic noting that the insolvency had progressed and could not be stopped. They plan to present the plan to the court on February 1 and begin the insolvency process. Once the court rules, Morgen and Gittermann will have sole authority over the shipyards. They said as early as next week they plan to accept the offers from R?nner and Lürssen.\nGovernment officials hailed the agreements as a good outcome that would preserve jobs and the shipbuilding industry. Prime Minister Daniel Günther of the Schleswig-Holstein state and representatives of the union IG Metall joined in the press conference expressing their support for the deal.\nFSG however continues to face a lack of orders to ensure its long-term future. R?nner reported it is already in discussions with Searoad for a second ferry. They said the future emphasis would be on new ship construction contracts but they could also look to diversify such as with the construction of components for offshore wind power.\nThe two shipyard groups are among the oldest operating in Germany. Flensburger Schiffbau Gesellschaft traces its roots to 1872 while Norbiskrug traces its origins to 1895 and was officially incorporated in 1905. It built commercial ships before taking its first yacht contract in 2000. Today it is recognized as one of the leading builders of luxury yachts.",

    "input": "Despite continued global uncertainties, Maersk is forecasting the container market will grow by a healthy four percent in 2025 and that the company will remain at pace with the market. The company gave a positive outlook for 2025 after highlighting that 2024 was the third-best financial performance in its history.\nStarting 2024, Maersk had issued a cautious note citing the factors disrupting the market and a collapse in rates that overtook the market in the latter part of 2023. Faced with the problems in the Red Sea, the prospects of dramatically higher costs, and a potential slowdown in the global economy, Maersk like its peers forecast a difficult year. Instead, the company highlights all three of its business segments performed well benefitting from a significant increase in freight rates, strong volume demand, and cost discipline.\nReporting financial results for 2024 today, Maersk dramatically outperformed analyst forecasts with earnings (EBIT) up 65 percent to $6.5 billion. Revenues from the ocean shipping business were over $37 billion for the year while total revenues across all the business were nearly $55 billion. Despite longer steaming distances for the routes going around Africa and increased fuel costs, it was able to stabilize operating costs and benefit from the higher freight rates.\n“Our ability to navigate shifting circumstances and ensure steady supply chains for our customers was put to the test throughout 2024,” noted Vincent Clerc, CEO of A.P. Moller – Maersk. “We successfully capitalized on increased demand while enhancing productivity and rigorously managing costs — all of which contributed to our strong financial performance.”\nSpeaking with reporters, Clerc downplayed the focus on tariffs saying more of the outlook depends on how consumers react and demand. For the industry, he cites the continued imbalance in supply and demand as new, larger vessels continue to be delivered but he said the potential remains to largely offset the supply-side drivers with strong market demand.\nThe Red Sea and its impact on the market continues to be one of the largest uncertainties according to Maersk, which like all the major carriers, continues to divert around Africa. On the optimistic side, Clerc said they might see a mid-year return but noted that with increased capacity, rates were likely to decline and drive Maersk to the low end of its outlook. However, if the return to the Red Sea continues to be deferred till the end of the year, Maersk believes the market remains strong and it will be driven to the high end of its forecast.\nBased on the uncertainties and the “considerable macroeconomic” issues, Maersk however foresees strong declines in profits in 2025. In the worst scenario, EBITDA could be at $6 billion which would be half 2024 levels. In the strongest case, the forecast calls for EBITDA of $9 billion which would still be below 2023 levels.\nInvestors were encouraged by the performance and did not show strong concern about the outlook. At one point during the day, they drove the stock price up by 10 percent and it settled up more than six percent on the day. Maersk is seen by many as an indicator not only for the industry but also for the broader economy and trade.\nManagement emphasized its ability to adapt to the market in what will be a challenging year. While the company remains committed to its strategy, it is also taking a large risk in its shipping operations as it abandons the alliance with MSC Mediterranean Shipping and begins a challenging transition to a new approach with an overhauled route system. Most of the first half of the year will be spent transitioning to the new Gemini Cooperation with Hapag-Lloyd which uses a hub and feeder system on its key routes. The goal is to drive schedule reliability with a goal of 90 percent on time believing it will differentiate the service and support higher freight rates due to the reliability of the service.",

It, however, noted that there were an unknown number of unreported/unconfirmed incidents involving dhows and smaller vessels. They calculated that as many as 19 dhows had been hijacked and were concerned the dhows could be used as motherships for attacks on merchant shipping.\nAfter activity resumed, they warned all vessels to increase safety protocols, and Atalanta’s forces were both patrolling and conducting friendly approaches with vessels in the region.

    "input": "Regulators for New Jersey’s offshore wind energy sector announced today that they will not be proceeding with an award for the fourth round wind solicitation due to “uncertainty driven by federal actions and permitting.” It makes the latest setback for the state which has seen multiple projects delayed and withdrawn despite a strong commitment by the state’s governor to renewable energy.\nThe New Jersey Board of Public Utilities reported it will not be proceeding with an award but that it is committed to working with Governor Phil Murphy to “build a successful offshore wind industry in New Jersey.” It reported that two of the three bidders in this round withdrew and that only the Atlantic Shores project proceeded to submit a best and final offer.\nLast week, Shell reported it would bepausingits involvement in the Atlantic Shores project saying it did not meet the company’s financial criteria. Previously in 2024 Shell also sold its portion of a New England wind farm project as it says it is reevaluating its participation in the sector.\nShell is a 50-50 joint venture partner with EDF Renewables in Atlantic Shores. The project calls for a two-stage project that would provide 2.8 MW of energy to New Jersey with up to nearly 200 turbines. It would be about 9 miles off the New Jersey shore near Atlantic City and Sea Girt. The project gained approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) in October 2024 for its construction and operations plan,\n“A number of reasons led to this decision, notably Shell backing out as an equity partner in the Atlantic Shores project and backing away from the American clean energy market, as well as uncertainty driven by federal actions and permitting. The Board concluded that an award in New Jersey's fourth offshore wind solicitation, despite the manifold benefits the industry offers to the state, would not be a responsible decision at this time,” said Christine Guhl-Sadovy, President, New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.\nThe state’s fourth solicitation called for 1.2 to 4 gigawatts of offshore wind generation capacity. The application window closed on July 10, 2024. Reports indicate the Corio-Total-Rise joint venture Attentive Energy and RWE-National Grid venture Community Offshore Wind also submitted initially but later withdrew from the process.\nGovernor Murphy had also announced in May 2024 that the state would be accelerating its schedule for future offshore wind solicitations. The fifth round he reported would be brought forward to the second quarter of 2025. It was previously scheduled for the third quarter of 2026.\nNew Jersey has struggled to get its offshore wind industry going. Ørsted had the two most advanced projects, Ocean Wind, but canceled them in 2023. The state awarded additional projects in January 2024 with 1,342 MW to Attentive Wind Two and 2,400 MW to Leading Light Wind. Problems with securing a turbine supplier however prompted Leading Light Wind totwice delayits application with the NJBPU. In December 2024, it asked for a delay till May 2025.\nThe New Jersey projects have faced strong local opposition. Donald Trump supported the efforts using New Jersey to highlight his opposition to offshore wind energy. Last week he posted on social media that he hoped the Atlantic Shores project would be “dead and gone.” The new Trump administration has imposed a moratorium on new leases in federal waters and is expected to delay the review of pending permit applications.\nAtlantic Shores issued a brief statement last week on January 30 saying it was still committed to New Jersey and delivering the state’s first offshore wind project.\nBased on these developments, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority reported today it is accelerating strategic review of options and alternatives for the New Jersey Wind Port. The state was planning the development of a large port facility to support the construction operations for offshore wind. The port facility was to be located in Salem, New Jersey.",

Turkish shipbuilder RMK Marine reported today, January 29, that the hull of the Neoliner Origin has been floated for the first time.\nThe vessel was imagined by a French team that seeks to build a commercial vessel that is primarily powered by wind. When the Neoliner Origin enters service later this year it will operate up to 80 percent of the time primarily on wind power. The vessel has a backup diesel motor which will also be used for maneuvering in port.\nNeoline and RMK agreed to the project in 2023. Construction began in November 2023 and the assembly in February 2024. The company previously said it was targeting July 2025 for the commercial maiden voyage. It will sail from Saint-Nazaire, France to Baltimore, Maryland with planned stops in the French territory Saint-Pierre and Miquelon and Halifax, Canada.\nIn recent updates, the company reported that the 88 blocks that make up the vessel were in place and the garage ramp was being installed. The foundations of the SolidSail system were also in place. The diesel engine, gearbox, and reversible shaft generator were also completed with only the rigging to still be installed. The sail system and rigging have been completed by Chantiers de L’Atlantique and at last report was being transported to the shipyard in Turkey.\n\n\nNeoliner Origin will mostly use its sail for propulsion power (Neoline)\n\nThe Neoliner Origin will be 446 feet (136 meters) in length with nearly 3,000 square meters of sail. The vessel will use two Solidsail carbon masts developed and built by Chantiers de l’Atlantique with each mast standing nearly 250 feet (76 meters) and the ability to tilt for clearance and navigation in port. Other unique elements include retractable anti-drift plans and an ultra-efficient weather routing system. Wind will be the primary propulsion for the vessel but it will have an auxiliary engine used while maneuvering or in emergencies.\nThe vessel will have a loading capacity of 1,200 linear meters with a 2.8-meter width or a capacity of 265 TEU. The maximum weight will be 5,300 tons of cargo. The company highlights the design permits the ship to transport different types of cargo. There will also be accommodations for 12 passengers.\nNeoline’s plan called for two demonstration vessels to begin the commercial service. With two vessels, Neoline plans to offer a sailing every two weeks. The vessels are projected to have a speed of 11 knots providing an 8-day crossing time across the Atlantic. It will take an additional four days to reach Baltimore.\nIt has reported interest from a range of French industrial companies, including companies such as Renault Group, Groupe Beneteau, Manitou Group, Michelin, Jas Hennessy & Co, Clarins, Longchamp, Rémy Cointreau, and La Fournée Dorée.",

The companies entered into a partnership agreement for the operation of a Disney-themed cruise ship to be launched in Japan.\nOriental Land reported in July 2024 that it planned tobuild a cruise shipwith the Walt Disney Corporation for the Japanese market that would be operated as part of the Disney Cruise Line. The company said it would invest up to $2.2 billion for the development of the Japanese cruise operation. The cruise ship was ordered from Germany’s Meyer Werft as the fourth member of the Disney Wish class (144,000 gross tons). The ship will be tailored to the Japanese market and run shorter duration cruises from Tokyo.\nUnder the terms of the new agreement, Oriental Land and the NYK Group will work together toward Oriental Land’s goal of providing family entertainment cruise experiences. They look to combine the OLC Group’s expertise in offering immersive settings and excellent hospitality, which has been developed through its well-established theme park and hotel operations, and the NYK Group’s cruise operations and shipping experience. Oriental Land, which opened the first Disney theme park in Tokyo in 1983, will use its experience along with Disney while NYK will provide the ship operation and management experience.\nThe new Disney cruise ship is a further expansion of NYK’s cruise operations which are soon to include two Japanese cruise ships. NYK has been operating Asuka Cruises currently with theAsuka II(formerCrystal Harmony) and this summer will add a new cruise shipAsuka III. The new cruise ship was recentlyfloated outat the Meyer Werft yard in Papenburg, Germany, and is currently completing outfitting. Historically, NYK operated a single cruise ship marketed only in Japan.\nDisney Cruise Line has announced an aggressive expansion plan to grow its fleet. The company started cruise operations in 1998 with the first of two cruise ships built by Fincantieri. It expanded with two cruise ships built by Meter Werft and in 2022 started its next phase of growth with theDisney Wish, the first of three 4,000-passenger LNG-fueled cruise ships also being built by Meyer Werft. The second cruise ship,Disney Treasure, entered service in December 2024 and the third,Disney Destiny, is due for delivery in 2025. The company said in its earning report that theDisney Treasurewas “off to a spectacular start.” They reported strong bookings for the sixth cruise ship of the fleet.\nThe success of the cruise line prompted Disney in August 2024 to announce an order for four more cruise ships all to be built by Meyer Werft. The company recently detailed that it will add a fourth ship in the Wish class and then will launch a new class of smaller cruise ships with three ships each approximately 100,000 gross tons and with accommodations for approximately 3,000 passengers. They will be delivered in 2029, 2030, and 2031.\nDisney Cruise Line is also launching operations this year from Singapore. The company is completing the construction of the former Global Dream acquired incomplete after the bankruptcy of MV Werften and Genting Hong Kong. The ship is being completed as theDisney Adventure(208,000 gross tons) for year-round short cruises from Singapore.\nThe Japanese Disney-branded cruise ship is expected to begin operations by 2029.

    "input": "Alfa Laval which has been working to expand its solutions to aid the maritime, offshore, and other heavy industries with the challenges of decarbonization is adding anti-fouling solutions to its offerings. The company based in Sweden has signed an agreement to acquire NRG Marine and its Sonihull Ultrasonic Antifouling solutions.\nThe acquisition is part of Alfa Laval’s strategy to provide customers with environmentally friendly solutions that can contribute to improving operations and addressing goals for net zero operations and decarbonization. Alfa Laval is adding applications that contribute to improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and extending the lifecycle of assets for the maritime sector as well as offshore oil and gas operations.\nBiofouling is becoming an increasing concern both due to its operational impact as well as the growing focus on environmental considerations. Key regions such regions such as Australia and New Zealand have increased their biofouling regulations creating concerns for ships operating in the region. Several cruise ships drew attention when they were turned away from ports primarily in New Zealand due to biohazards that were identified on their hulls. It resulted in delays and costly impromptu efforts to clean the underwater surfaces.\nThe International Maritime Organization is also discussing the issues and the risks of spreading invasive species while operators are also seeking solutions to save fuel and operating costs. Similarly, the oil and gas sector continues to seek safe applications to prevent and clean growth from its stationary underwater surfaces.\nNRG Marine reports it set out in 2006 to develop an environmentally friendly anti-fouling technology against a backdrop of increasingly stringent legislation governing the use of poisonous biocides in marine coatings. Its offering is a proactive technology that utilizes ultrasonic microscopic bubbles that implode, creating agitation that disrupts the surface environment. The system operates continuously and is a non-invasive method that passively cleans the surface.\nUltrasonic anti-fouling technology they report is emerging as a promising alternative to other methods. It does not require harsh chemicals or removing the ship from the water to clean the hull. The companies highlight it is a sustainable technology that is cost-effective for the operators and can be installed on any ship with no requirements for through-hull fittings.\n“The inclusion of ultrasonic anti-fouling technology into our portfolio is another addition to our decarbonization toolbox,” said Sameer Kalra, the President Marine Division of Alfa Laval. “By addressing the critical problem of biofouling with this advanced technique, we will enable our customers to meet both business and environmental objectives.”\nAlfa Laval, which traces its origins to the 1880s, is well-known in the marine sector for its pumps, as well as its systems for fuel, oil, water, and other applications. It has been expanding its product lines with solutions including ballast water treatment, air lubrication, heat transfer, and exhaust gas as well as its participation in Oceanbird, a wind-assisted propulsion technology. The company expects to close the acquisition of NRG Marine in the second quarter of 2025.",

With these steps in place, the contract will be presented in the next two weeks to the rank-and-file followed by a vote scheduled for Tuesday, February 25.\nSpeaking in front of the union’s Wage Scale Committee and more than 200 delegates, ILA President Harold Daggett said, “I believe it is the greatest ILA contract, and the greatest contract negotiated by a labor organization.”\nThe ILA delegates after the presentations unanimously approved the tentative agreement that is in the form of a Memorandum of Settlement between USMX and the ILA and supplements and amends the current Master Contract. That cleared the way for a ratification vote by the ILA rank-and-file members.\nUSMX separately reports that its membership unanimously approved the Master Contract at its membership meeting last month.\nTerms of the contract have not yet been announced and in particular the agreement about automation and semi-automation at the terminals. Wages issued reported settled with a better than 60 percent increase as well as terms for benefits.\nThe terminal operators were pushing for productivity improvements noting that the ports lack space for expansion and need to keep pace with increased volumes and demand. Reports said they have proposed to keep the existing language which forms a committee to review any proposed new systems or automation while calling for systems the ILA described as semi-automation.\nThe ILA was adamant that it would never accept any automation or semi-automation. The leadership called for a rollback on previous agreements.\n“This was the hardest and most complicated contract to bargain possibly in the history of the ILA,” said Daggett. “With the changes we’ve seen across our industry, we knew what this contract meant for securing the future.”\nThe ILA struck for three days in October while the Biden administration pressured the employers to make wage concessions. In December, President-elect Donald Trump came out strongly supporting the ILA and its position against automation.\nA final agreement on the contract terms was announced on January 8, a week ahead of the deadline and after several breakdowns and contentious allegations from both sides. If approved, the new agreement and all its benefits, are retroactive to October 1, 2024. The new contract would be in effect until September 30, 2030.",

    "input": "The new governing power in Syria, Islamist group Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham, has renegotiated CMA CGM's container terminal lease at the port of Latakia and will allow the French liner to continue to operate the facility under modified terms.\nCMA CGM signed a contract to run Latakia’s container terminal back in 2009, under the regime of then-President Bashar Al-Assad. The initial lease was for a period of ten years, renewable for five years upon mutual agreement. Upon expiration of the contract in 2019, CMA CGM renewed it until 2024, despite the intense international pressure on Syria over the ongoing civil war. In 2024, CMA CGM was invited by the Assad regime to renew once more, this time for a far longer term of 30 years.\nAssad's Ministry of Transport favored allowing CMA CGM to renew the contract, and noted at the time that CMA CGM did not withdraw its investment when sanctions and economic collapse hit Syria. By contrast, Philippine operator ICTSI backed out of its long-term lease at the Tartus Container Terminal in 2013, after the start of the Syrian civil war. After ICTSI's departure, the Tartus lease was transferred to a Russian operator (since revoked by HTS).\nAccording to Reuters, HTS' ports authority has decided to keep CMA CGM on at Latakia, with changes. The authority announced Wednesday that it had reached terms on a revised contract for the French liner's participation at Latakia. The changes are said to include a revised lease duration and revised revenue split between the operator and the government.\nThe European Union is moving gradually to lift sanctions on the Syrian economy, allowing EU shippers to resume regular cross-Mediterranean trade with Latakia and Tartus for the first time in a decade. The prospects of economic renewal in a peaceful Syria may be attractive for business interests and for CMA CGM; Karam Shaar Advisory, a consultancy specializing in the Syrian economy, noted that CMA CGM founder Jacques Saade's family had ties to Latakia, potentially giving the firm an additional reason to stay.",

The new ship namedMein Schiff Relaxmarks the first time the line has worked with Fincantieri after a long-term partnership with the shipyard in Turku, Finland.\nAt 161,000 gross tons,Mein Schiff Relaxis the largest for the German brand and the first of the company’s ships to operate on LNG. It was built as a dual-fuel ship immediately capable of operating on LNG or Marine Gas Oil and it will be able to transition to alternatives including bio- or e-LNG when it becomes available in the market. Last year, TUI also introduced the first methanol-ready cruise ship,Mein Schiff 7, which was built at Meyer Turku and with the addition of some pending components is expected to commence operations with methanol.\nFincantieri received the order for the two ships from TUI in July 2018 with the steel cutting for the first ship commencing in June 2022. The ship was floated out from the yard in Monfalcone, Italy in November 2023 and began its first sea trials last October. The first trials focused on the performance of the vessel and especially maneuverability. In December, it received its first LNG load and at the end of the month commenced sea trials operating on LNG.Mein Schiff Relaxis the second cruise ship delivered by Fincantieri fueled with LNG.\nThe Mein Schiff operation has been one of the fast-growing taking advantage of the strength of the cruise market in German-speaking countries. It was launched as a rival to Carnival Corporation’s successful AIDA brand with TUI’s first ship, acquired from Celebrity Cruises, sailing on its first cruise in May 2009. Today the brand has eight ships including Relax, with the oldest having been built just a decade ago.\n“Eleven years ago, we took delivery of our first newly built ship,” says Wybcke Meier, CEO of TUI Cruises. “With theMein Schiff Relax, we are now opening a whole new chapter in the field of premium cruises.”\nThe new ship is 1,070 feet (326 meters) in length with 1,945 passenger cabins and accommodations for 3,984 passengers and 1,535 crew. In addition to being the largest ship of the fleet, it has innovations for relaxation, 14 restaurants including more variety and a new Asian restaurant, and redefined spa and wellness areas. The ship features the cruise line’s first two-deck “freedom suites,” as well as introducing inside, outside, and balcony cabins for solo travelers.\nIn addition to the dual-fuel configuration,Mein Schiff Relaxfeatures new catalytic converters meeting Euro 6 standards, a generative turbine using residual heat from the diesel generators, and a shore power connection for ports. It also has a highly efficient waste treatment system capable of transforming organic materials into recyclable components through a thermal process.\nThe cruise ship enters service at the beginning of March and will sail for the first year around the Canary Islands before moving to Germany in mid-2026. TUI has planned an innovative christening ceremony for the new ship on April 9 in Malaga. She will meet up with fleet matesMein Schiff 5andMein Schiff 7. In addition to a celebrity performance, the three cruise ships will share the event with a gala dinner and cocktail aboard each ship and special culinary dishes from the restaurants on the new ship being served aboard all three ships.\nMein Schiff continues its rapid growth after introducingMein Schiff 7in June 2024. The next introduction,Mein Schiff Flowwill take place in Spain in August 2026.",

    "input": "A pilot project involving Wärtsilä, MAN Energy Solutions, and the research institute SINTEF and working with Norwegian shipping company Solvang is ready to launch its pilot test for a new onboard carbon capture and storage system. According to the companies, launching the pilot testing is an important milestone in the project which began in 2021 and conducted its first tests in 2022.\n“Onboard carbon capture combined with existing cleaning technology is a significant shortcut to decarbonization of the world’s deep-sea fleet. This stands out as one of the more promising solutions for future vessels,” says Edvin Endresen, CEO of Solvang.\nOver the past few months, the 2019-built LPG tankerClipper Erishas been in dry dock for a full retrofit. The vessel which is 18,000 dwt arrived in November at the Seatrium Admiralty yard in Singapore and the companies report the team was at the yard on January 16 marking the completion of the installation project.\nSeatrium was contracted to install a seven-megawatt capacity carbon capture system from Wärtsilä. The capture system uses amine scrubber technology to pull about 70 percent of the CO2 out of the exhaust gas from the main engine. The CO2 stream will be chilled, liquefied, and stored on board the vessel for later offloading. Part of the project added large tanks visible on the deck of the vessel. Seatrium carried out engineering, procurement, upgrading of electrical and automation systems, and integration of the carbon capture and compression/storage system.\n\n\nThe retrofit adding the carbon tanks is taking place in Singapore (Solvang)\n\n“The introduction of carbon capture and storage capabilities on board the Clipper Eris is a major leap forward for maritime sustainability,” says Roger Holm, President of Wärtsilä Marine. “It represents a system change that has been made possible by close collaboration between our companies.”\nTheClipper Erisis the first vessel to be outfitted with this version of the technology and the pilot is scheduled to run for a year. The Norwegian shipping company received funding from the Norwegian State, through Enova, in 2023, making it possible to start the pilot project.\nFor OCCS to be a success on a larger scale, Solvang notes that more shipping companies and industry stakeholders must see the benefits and join in. Solvang CEO Edvin Endresen points to challenges with infrastructure and global regulations that need to be addressed for OCCS technology to succeed in the shipping industry.\n“CO2 can be recycled and used in land-based industries, but the global infrastructure for discharge for shipping needs to be developed fast. In addition, IMO must implement global regulations with benefits and penalty schemes for achieving the set goals. Predictability is necessary for the industry to invest in solutions for reducing CO2 emissions,” says Endresen.\nSolvang hopes this technology becomes a milestone for the world’s trading fleet on route to zero emissions. The company highlights that it has seven new vessels under construction, all designed and ready for installation of OCCS technology.",

But investigators can add at least one more recent incident to the list: in January 2022, a Turkish ship may have dragged anchor under way and severed a subsea power cable in the Kattegat, between Sweden and Denmark. On January 20, 2022, the Konti-Skan 2 cable - a decades-old HVDC link between the Swedish and Danish grids - went out of service when it \"suffered a fault due to external impact.\" Swedish utility Svenska Kraftnät found evidence of an anchor-drag track on the bottom, and it appeared to line up with the AIS trackline of the product tankerSelin D.The vessel slowed down for nine minutes in the same region and same timeframe as the cable break, according to Kraftnät.\nThe utility filed suit against the owners of theSelin D, alleging that the master of the vessel \"caused the damage through gross negligence and with the knowledge that such damage would likely occur.\" The owner's lawyers assert that theSelin Ddid not cause the damage, or - if proven otherwise in court - did not cause any alleged damage intentionally.\nKraftnät's lawsuit seeks nearly $6 million in compensation. The case was filed in late 2023, but was little-known to the public until this week, when Dagens Nyheter covered thestory.\nSelin Dis a 2003-built product tanker with a checkered inspection history. It has since been resold to an Italian operator, and has been renamedIevoli Star.As for the Konti-Skan 2 cable, it will soon be replaced with a new modern HVDC link. The existing Konti-Skan 1 and 2 are expected to age out of service by the 2030s, and the new cable will have nearly 50 percent more power transmission capacity.\nSubsea cables do get severed in accidental anchor-drag and trawling incidents every year, but the rapid-fire cluster of cases in the Baltic is unusual. One vessel, the Russia-linked \"shadow fleet\" tankerEagle S,has been detained by Finnish police on suspicion of severing multiple cables on Christmas Day; nine members of the tanker's crew are under a travel ban and could face criminal charges.",

    "input": "\nWork is underway to build what is being billed as the most sustainable cruise ship. Known as Captain Arctic, it is designed to present a new level of luxury expedition in the Arctic.\nGoltens highlighted the keel laying and its role in the development of the new ship. The ceremony took place on November 22 marking the start of the construction of the 70-meter (230-foot) hull which Goltens notes is also a first for the UAE.\nThe concept for the ship was developed by Sophie Galvagnon who has worked for nearly 20 years in the commercial shipping industry. She notes for a decade she has led expeditions into the Arctic but the trips have become “disconnected from the traditional ways.” Expedition cruising started with a focus on the destination but in recent years the cruise industry has focused on luxury amenities aboard the ships and add-ons such as submarines and helicopters.\nGalvagnon reports she and the team spent the past two years designing the innovative ship, convincing the market of the opportunity, and funding the project. They launched a French company, Selar, which they believe will present a new approach to sustainable tourism.\nThe Captain Arctic represents the company says a new vision in luxury cruise expeditions. The vessel has accommodations for just 36 passengers and will carry a crew of 24. There will be no set itineraries and schedules but instead, it will be a unique adventure offering chances to encounter polar bears, navigate through ice, and kayak among grounding icebergs.\n\n\n\nThe ship will be powered by five 35-meter-high (115-foot) retractable solar sails. Built to endure the harshest weather, they will be made of aluminum and fitted with 2,000 square meters of solar panels. The ship will have shaft generators and batteries to store power. The heating onboard will be from a pellet boiler that uses recycled wooden waste pellets. The ship will have an engine, using biofuel made from vegetable oil, but seeks to operate almost exclusively on the sails and solar power.\n“Beyond tourism, our first ship will support science through zero emission logistics and remove over five tons of plastic annually,” Galvagnon writes on social media. She says the ship will produce 90 percent less emissions.\nThe project is a partnership between Goltens and Chantier Naval de l'Ocean Indien (CNOI), based in Port Louis, Mauritius. Bureau Veritas is the class society for the vessel. Selar on its website shows the first trip in November 2026 with the Captain Arctic sailing from Troms?, Norway.",

    "input": "\nThe first demonstration of the new Trump administration’s efforts to derail the offshore wind energy sector emerged as the Department of Interior began reversing steps taken in the last days of the Biden administration. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management canceled meetings for the review of an offshore wind project while the Department of the Interior highlighted that it was taking “steps to streamline processes that will enhance efficiency and innovation.”\nBOEM announced it was canceling the virtual public meetings scheduled by the Biden administration to begin comments and review of the Construction and Operations Plan submitted by Vineyard Mid-Atlantic. The first meeting had been scheduled for February 6, followed by sessions on February 11 and 19 for comments on the plan. It, however, noted that written comments could still be submitted before the March 3 deadline.\nThe prior administration on January 14 launched the review process for the wind farm that would be developed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and be located approximately 20 miles offshore New York and 36 miles offshore New Jersey. The lease was awarded in 2022 as part of the auction for the New York Bight and the construction plan called for 2 GW of electricity from up to 117 wind turbines, enough to power more than 700,000 homes.\nThe Department of the Interior and BOEM said in announcing the cancellation that it is implementing President Trump’smemorandumtemporarily halting offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. The memorandum also pauses new or renewed approvals, rights-of-way, permits, leases, or loans for offshore wind projects pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices.\nThe new Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, however during his first day in the position on February 3, signed measures to “immediately identify all emergency and legal authorities available to facilitate the identification, permitting, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, distribution, exporting and generation of domestic energy resources and critical minerals,” and to “expedite the authorization” of key projects. Burgum said there would be an emphasis on deregulation and unlocking resources in Alaska following Trump’s directions.\nDespite the new policies and move away from offshore wind energy, two projects highlighted that they are continuing to move forward. Equinor today, February 5, announced its year-end financial results and detailed its outlook including a continued commitment to the Empire Wind project. It completed the financing for the 800 MW project at the end of 2024 and highlights a low cost of entry as well as the utilization of project financing which along with future tax credits will cover the remaining CAPEX for Empire Wind. At the right time, it will also bring in a partner for the project which is due to be completed by 2027.\nThe commitment to Empire Wind comes as the company reported it is “high-grading its portfolio, reducing the investment outlook for renewables and low carbon solutions, and improving cost across the organization” as part of an effort to improve returns and free cash flow generation. Equinor said it was proceeding with Empire Wind, “a project in a challenging market with returns under pressure and uncertainty,” while reiterating that it will continue to deliver above 10 percent equity return on its current and renewable assets in operations.\nSimilarly, Dominion Energy highlighted its continued commitment and progress for its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. It reported yesterday that the installation has reached the halfway mark and that the offshore work remains on budget and on time. Due for completion at the end of 2026, the project with 176 wind turbines and a capacity of 2.6 GW, is slated to be the largest offshore wind farm in the United States.\nDominion holds rights for two other offshore wind projects in the mid-Atlantic region while Equinor has another one in New England and one in the mid-Atlantic. Those are listed as longer-term prospects, and likely to be delayed by the new Trump policies.",

    "input": "The NTSB report on a 2023 bridge strike says the captain of a tow vessel and barge company managers’ ineffective voyage planning and failure to conduct required checks caused a towed crane to strike the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan. They failed to confirm the air draft and bridge clearance, and the result was $665,000 in damages to the crane as well as $145,000 in damage to the underside of the bridge.\nThe towing vesselNickelena(103 feet) was regularly employed to move barges transporting construction equipment to sites around the Great Lakes. In May 2023, they were hired to tow a barge transporting a 160-foot-long boom crane and 5-foot “rooster” sheave on a deck barge from Escanaba to a construction project at Sault Ste. Marine, Michigan. It was a standard assignment, including the fact they would have to transit under the Mackinac Bridge, a roadway suspension bridge that connects the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan.\nThe crane was secured on the barge on May 6, and the tow commenced. After leaving the port, the captain ordered the tow line increased to 500 feet, and they proceeded. He left the bridge to rest but planned to return before 0200 when they were due to pass under the roadway bridge. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration determined there was no traffic and minimal wind effect at 0200, and the NTSB reports the tow was moving at 8 knots within the marked channel.\nThe first contact with the bridge was with the stiffening truss below the roadway, at the top of the truss’s bottom chord (about 155 feet above the water). The report indicates given the configuration of the crane, the wires securing the crane boom would have hit first, and then when they parted, the boom would have contacted the top of the chord. As the barge continued forward, the boom would have been pushed backward, and its angle and height above the water would have increased, leading to damage higher up on the bridge. At some point, the boom contacted the upper diagonal truss, about 183 feet above the water, before folding back and collapsing on the barge.\nThe engineer aboard the tow vessel was on deck while there was a crewmember at the helm. They did not report hearing the contact, but said when they looked aft, they noticed they could not see the crane’s boom.\nThe investigation showed that the captain and the managers of the barge company did not attempt to verify bridge clearance and instead accepted the word of the managers supervising the loading of the crane, who told the captain, “Everything’s secured, ready to go.”\nThe NTSB determined the managers made a visual evaluation that the angle of the crane boom was between 50 and 60 degrees, and the boom was 140 feet. The Load Moment Indicator on the crane was not working, so they relied on their judgment. They decided against lowering the boom to decrease the angle because they thought it would reduce the stability of the barge.\nTowing vessel operators are required to have a towing safety management system (TSMS), and voyage planning would have been part of the process. The company operating the vessel, Basic Towing, told investigators they had a TSMS, but the NTSB says no documentation was found that a navigation assessment was conducted and no attempt by the captain to verify the tow was safe for the intended route.\nThe water under the bridge was higher than average, with clearance at about 153 feet instead of the normal 160 feet. However, it did not matter because the analysis showed the boom was at approximately 62 degrees, which equated to a height of 162.3 feet. The report says the boom needed to be at about 55 degrees to pass under the bridge at the center of the channel. The visual evaluation also underestimated the length of the boom by 20 feet. The NTSB reports the boom was 10 feet too high for clearance.\nThe erroneous estimates provided by the managers set off the chain of events. However, the captain, who was responsible for ensuring the safety of the transit, did not confirm the boom height, nor was there an attempt to verify the bridge’s vertical clearance.",

    "input": "Oil major Shell is continuing to reduce its involvement in renewable energy and offshore wind including effectively ending its involvement with the U.S. offshore wind energy sector. Buried within today’s year-end 2024 financial report is a note that results include impairment charges of more than $1 billion “mainly relating to renewable generation assets in North America.”\nThe company has been moving away from its previous push into renewables as part of a strategy that CEO Wael Sawan described as “simplification” which is helping to deliver over $3 billion in cost cuts since 2022. Commented on renewable energy the company said it was “high grading its portfolio.”\nThe bulk of the $1.085 billion impairment charge is being taken in the fourth quarter ($996 million) and relates to the company’s decision to “pause” its involvement in a joint venture to develop New Jersey’s Atlantic Shores offshore wind project. Shell New Energies US and EDF-RE Offshore Development (a subsidiary of EDF Renewables) won U.S. federal approval in October 2024 for the construction plan for a two-stage project that would provide 2.8 MW of energy to New Jersey with up to nearly 200 turbines. The project was bid into New Jersey’s fourth round of wind solicitations.\n“We just don’t see that it fits both our capabilities nor the returns that we would like,” Shell’s Chief Financial Officer Sinead Gorman said in a call with reporters reports Bloomberg. “So we took the decision to effectively write that off and pause our involvement.”\nWhen the construction plan was approved it was highlighted the project would be the first offshore wind project in New Jersey. The lease dates to 2015 when it was awarded to US Wind and later transferred in 2018 to EDF and later into the joint venture with Shell. The project, which would be about 9 miles off the New Jersey shores near Atlantic City and Sea Girt, faced strong local opposition and was used by Donald Trump to highlight his disapproval of offshore wind.\nWhile opponents of the project hoped today's announcement would mark the end of the effort, Atlantic Shores issued a statement saying it intends to continue progressing New Jersey’s first offshore wind project and its portfolio in compliance with its obligations to local, state and federal partners under existing leases and relevant permits. Trump wrote online last week he hoped the project would be “dead and gone.” EDF did not comment, but Atlantic Shores wrote in its statement, \"Business plans, projects, portfolio projections and scopes evolve over time – and as expected for large, capital-intensive infrastructure projects like ours, our shareholders have always prepared long-term strategies that contemplate multiple scenarios that enable Atlantic Shores to reach its full potential.\"\nShell in March 2024 also announced it hadsold its 50 percent positionin SouthCoast Wind Energy to joint venture partner Ocean Winds North America as part of the realignment of its renewables portfolio. Shell had entered into the joint venture in 2018 for the project which was then known as Mayflower Wind. Ocean Winds has continued to pursue the project and BOEM recently approved the construction plan. It calls for an approximate capacity of 2.4 GW in a lease area about 30 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and 23 miles south of Nantucket, Massachusetts.  The project however has faced delays as it is still negotiating its power purchase agreements with Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\nShell's continued move away from renewable energy came as the company reported a 16 percent decline in profits for 2024. While raising its dividend, the company said operations were performing well but cited lower margins for LNG, lower oil and gas prices, lower demand, and weaker margins for its refinery operations. Earnings were $23.72 billion down from $28.25 billion in 2023 and the $1 billion impairment in renewables was part of a larger net impairment charge of $2.2 billion expected in the fourth quarter.",

The project will be jointly developed by Ørsted in partnership with Poland’s largest power group, the state-controlled PGE.\n“With today’s announcement, we’re ready to build Baltica 2, a flagship project for offshore wind in Poland,” said Rasmus Errboe, Deputy CEO and Chief Commercial Officer for Ørsted. “We’re satisfied with the value creation of the project, which has an attractive risk-reward profile.”\nBaltica 2 will be located approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) off the Polish coast near Ustka, which is located west of Gdansk in central Poland. The project which will consist of 107 Siemens Gamesa 14 MW turbines, will have a capacity of 1.5 GW and is one of two planned by the partnership.\nThe companies highlighted that Poland’s energy policy singles out offshore wind to be developed until 2040 to be a key technology to make Poland a low-emission economy. Poland has committed to 5.9 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 11 GW by 2040.\n“The Baltica 2 offshore wind farm, the largest renewable energy project currently under development in the Baltic Sea, will diversify Poland’s energy production, enhance energy security, and provide cleaner and more affordable energy,” said Dariusz Marzec, CEO of PGE.\nHelping to support the financial case for the development, Baltica 2 has a 25-year inflation-protected contract for difference (CfD) in place with the Polish state. The initial price was set in 2021 and is being adjusted to inflation. The price per MWh will be annually adjusted to inflation. After the CfD ends, Baltica 2 will receive the market price for electricity or enter new power purchase agreements.\nAnnouncing that they had taken the final investment decision, the companies reported all major component and vessel contracts had been signed. The wind farm has obtained all permits and has signed a grid connection contract with the Polish transmission system operator PSE.\nA broad team of contractors has been aligned to implement the construction. It will be installed by Cadeler and Fred. Olsen Windcarrier, while Van Oord will be installing foundations and offshore substations.",

One of the victims was a well-respected skipper with five decades of experience.\nAt about 2200 hours on Thursday night, the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax received an EPIRB signal from the 18-meter fishing vesselFortune Pride,located about 10 nautical miles southeast of her homeport of Sambro, Nova Scotia. The center mobilized two rescue vessels to the scene, along with a Cormorant SAR helicopter and a Hercules search plane. Conditions were difficult, including 12-foot swells, fog and rain.\nOne rescue vessel found three survivors on Thursday night, including one who was unconscious. They were evacuated to a hospital, and one later passed away.\nThe next morning, a helicopter aircrew found an additional crewmember in a life raft. The man was unresponsive when rescued and was later pronounced dead.\nOn Saturday, the owner of theFortune Pridereleased the names of the deceased: skipper John Allen Baker, a well-known and respected name in Atlantic Canada's fishing industry; and deckhand Phil MacInnis. The two other crewmembers have been released from the hospital and are in good physical health.\nAt the time of the capsizing,Fortune Pridewas reportedly carrying about 20 tonnes of silver hake and was standing by offshore. The owner's last contact with Baker was about an hour and a half before the sinking, and at the time, the skipper reported no issues; he was waiting for daylight to make the transit into port.\nCanada's Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the casualty. The owner has stressed that the vessel was in good material condition prior to the capsizing. \"It was a good, seaworthy, steel boat. That boat has been at sea for a long time,\" owner Jose Teixeira told the Canadian Press.\nBaker was a local legend in Nova Scotia's fisheries. He had five decades of experience on all types of fishing vessels, and his services as a skipper were in demand. He had survived a previous sinking in 2013: While he was serving as skipper aboard the fishing vesselGentle Lady,a heavy load of sea cucumber shifted in heavy swells. The crew fought to correct it, but the boat took on a port list, flooded and capsized. Baker and his crew abandoned ship into a liferaft and were adrift at sea for six hours before a Good Samaritan rescued them.\nAccording to local legend, Baker later recovered the wallet he had left inGentle Lady'swheelhouse in the rush to abandon ship. Four years later, it came up from the bottom while he was dragging for clams on another vessel.",

    "input": "Royal Caribbean Group which operates 66 ocean-going cruise ships announced today, January 28, that it will be entering the fast-growing river cruise segment through its upper premium brand Celebrity Cruises. The company was attracted to the river segment which it sees as highly fragmented by its strong growth rates, high return on invested capital, and profitability.\nCEO Jason Liberty told investors the expansion into river cruising was an exciting opportunity for guests and the company’s shareholders. Referencing the segment as a “complimentary high margin, high ROIC business,” he said it fits nicely within the portfolio. He noted that about half of their customers have experienced or intend to vacation on a river cruise presenting strong opportunities for cross-selling to customers not only of Celebrity Cruises but its other brands, Silversea Cruises, and Royal Caribbean International.\n“We see river cruising as an exciting growth opportunity that aligns with our strategy of turning the vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations, expanding our ecosystem of vacation offerings, and broadening our reach into adjacent lines of businesses,” said Liberty during the corporation’s earnings conference call today.\nWhile Celebrity becomes the first of the major brands to expand into river cruising, it is not a new strategy. Crystal Cruises under Genting Hong Kong’s ownership entered European river cruising. Viking started as a river cruise company and a decade ago expanded into ocean cruising and more recently expedition cruising. Analyst C. Patrick Scholes of Truist Securities noted today that Viking has “basically owned” the river cruise sector. Viking currently has 82 river cruise vessels mostly deployed in Europe and has plans to reach 93 river cruise ships by 2027.\nScholes said Truist’s initial take was that it would not be head-to-head competition between Viking and Celebrity. Viking, he notes is considered a luxury brand offering an inclusive product while Celebrity will likely have a different price point marketing to the broader, contemporary cruise segment. Liberty mentioned to investors the opportunities for add-on sales noting that river cruise passengers “spend a disproportionate amount of their time and money on travel.”\nFew details were provided on Celebrity Cruises’ plans for its new river operation. They said it would be launching in Europe in 2027 but CEO Jason Liberty referred to river cruising as a global segment. Ask by analysts, he said there were opportunities in many parts of the world.\nCelebrity reported an initial order of 10 “transformative” ships that it says would be innovative and elevate the river cruise experience. Speaking to the company’s customers in a video, Celebrity Cruises’ CEO Laura Hodges Bethge alluded to expansive views with large glass windows, innovative open deck spaces, and elevated design features. Royal Caribbean also referenced sustainable technologies, reimagined onboard and shore experiences “that raises the bar for river cruising.”\nReports indicate the initial order for the 10 river cruise ships went to the Netherlands’ TeamCo. The shipyard’s website shows 16 river cruise ships delivered over the past decade and most recently in 2024 to Amadeus. The size of river cruise ships varies based on the limitations of the rivers but the ships traditionally accommodate 150 to 200 passengers. Scholes estimates each ship will cost Celebrity $30 million for a total shipbuilding commitment announced today of $300 million.\nOn the investor conference call, Royal Caribbean Group said its plan is for delivery of “a couple of ships in 2027,” and then about four a year.\n“Our ambitions go far beyond that,” Liberty told investors. He said they were “very intentful,” in calling it an “initial order,” saying that river cruising “is not a hobby for us.” Based on shipyard capacity to build four vessels a year, Liberty said it was not likely that they would be waiting till 2027 to order more river cruise vessels.\nThe expansion in river cruising comes just days after Celebrity announced it had ordered a sixth large cruise ship of its Edge class from Chantiers de l’Atlantique. This year it will be introducing theCelebrity Xcel. Royal Caribbean International last year also ordered an Oasis class cruise ship from France and an additional Icon class cruise ship in Finland as well as options for up to two more ships. The group noted its newbuild pipeline currently includes a total of eight ships on order.",

    "input": "\nThe Port of Brisbane, Australia is celebrating its decision to invest in a real cruise terminal after passenger movements at the Brisbane International Cruise Terminal (BICT) crossed the two million mark, a development that comes just two and half years after its opening.\nBICT, which was constructed at a cost of US$110 million, achieved the two-millionth-passenger milestone on Saturday after P&O Cruises Australia’sPacific Encountercalled at the port.\nThe call could be the last that the 2,600-vessel makes at its Brisbane homeport under thePacific Encountername. This is because the ship is set to be rebranded intoCarnival Encounterafter Carnival Corporation announced it was ending the P&O Cruises Australia brand in March 2025.\n“Carnival’s long-term partnership with the world-class BICT has helped in the success of Queensland’s growing cruise industry. As Carnival Cruise Line prepares for an exciting expansion in March, whenPacific Encounterjoins the CCL fleet asCarnival Encounter,we can’t wait to continue to deliver our guests unforgettable holidays from Brisbane, all year round,” said Peter Little, Carnival Corporation Country Manager.\nThe hitting of the two million passenger mark is a significant achievement for BICT, which was opened in June 2022 and is touted as a strategic asset in Queensland’s cruise tourism industry. The decision to build the terminal was approved in 2017, with construction completed in 2020. Its commercial opening was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nPrior to its construction, cruise ships longer than 270 meters had to call at the Port of Brisbane’s cargo terminals. This caused most cruise lines to bypass the city altogether, taking with them significant economic benefits. It is estimated that every time a vessel calls in Brisbane, it contributes around US$620,000 to the economy. Over the next decade, cruising is projected to contribute around US$700 million to the Queensland economy. During the 2024/25 season alone, the port expects to welcome over 150 cruise calls from 13 different cruise lines.\n“Achieving two million passenger movements through our world-class terminal highlights the integral role of BICT to Queensland’s cruise tourism industry,” said Neil Stephens, Port of Brisbane CEO.",

    "input": "\nOn Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, repeating a policy from his first term. The announcement includes metal imports from Mexico and Canada, the largest foreign suppliers for the American steel market.\nU.S. steelmakers stand to benefit from the announcement. Independent economists say tariffs will allow U.S. producers to raise prices, strengthening American steelmakers' balance sheets. The tariffs Trump imposed in his first term increased prices by nine percent and raised American steelmakers' earnings by $2.4 billion in 2018 alone,accordingto the Peterson Institute for International Economics. American steel consumers' costs increased by an estimated $5.6 billion during the same period, the institute estimated.\nShares in America's biggest steel producer, Nucor, have risen by 10 percent over the last month following news of tough tariff policies, and the company is supportive of Trump's approach. \"Nucor applauds the first steps taken by President Trump in his America first trade agenda,\" Nucor President Leon J. Topalian said in a statement last week. \"We look forward to working with President Trump to enforce our trade laws and strengthen American manufacturing!\"\nTrump's Sunday announcement was greeted with disapproval in Canada, which has the most to lose from higher import prices in the U.S. market. \"This is the next four years. Shifting goalposts and constant chaos, putting our economy at risk,\" responded Ontario Premier Doug Ford in a statement.\nOverall, more than $80 billion worth of steel and iron imports and nearly $30 billion worth of aluminum imports will be affected. If the metals tariffs are not reversed in negotiations, as occurred earlier this month with blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico, American shipbuilders will be among the steel users most affected by an increased cost of materials. The U.S. shipbuilding industry's biggest customer by value - the U.S. Navy - will likely see future newbuild and repair costs rise if tariffs take hold, according to defense analysts.\n\"Costs [for shipbuilding] are going to go even higher,\" said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the pro-business think tank American Enterprise Institute, speaking to Navy Times last month. \"Delays will get even longer. Nothing good is going to come from this for shipbuilding; it can only make a bad situation worse.\"\nTariffs are part of Trump's plans for a revival at U.S. Steel, the second-largest producer in the United States and a onetime icon of American industry. On Friday, Trump said he would block plans by Japanese giant Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel, as the Biden administration did in January. However, he said he would \"mediate and arbitrate\" a lesser investment by the Japanese firm. \"Tariffs are going to make [U.S. Steel] very successful. And I think it has good management,\" Trump said.\nSources close to U.S. Steel and Nippon Steeltoldthe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that executives at both firms were surprised by Trump's plans.\nThere may be additional tariffs coming soon: On Sunday, Trump briefly previewed a plan to impose reciprocal tariffs when other nations place duties on U.S. goods. \"It won't affect everybody, because there are some where we have similar tariffs, but the ones that are taking advantage of the United States, we're going to have a reciprocity,\" he said.",

    "input": "An inadequate anchoring operation and failure to use available charts to identify depths and a charted rock led to the loss of a cargo vessel operating in the U.S. Virgin Islands reports the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The bureau issued a report highlighting a series of errors during a storm that contributed to the total constructive loss of a small cargo vessel valued at $1.5 million and aheroic actionby the U.S. Coast Guard to rescue 12 people from the stranded ship.\nThe cargo vesselBonnie G(780 gross tons), built in 1981, stranded on the rocks off St. Thomas in the USVI on October 4, 2023, while it was waiting out bad weather which had prevented it from docking. The ship, which had been built as an offshore supply vessel for the Gulf of Mexico oil platforms, had been converted in 2020 to cargo operations. It was sailing between San Juan, St. Thomas, St. Croix, and other local islands in the Caribbean. It was 172 feet long and registered in Vanuatu.\nThe cargo ship loaded in St. Croix with six passenger vehicles, an industrial truck, a trailer, scissor lift, a refrigerated container with fruits and vegetables, and other cargo ranging from beer and whiskey to medical supplies and books. It departed St. Croix with 12 people aboard at 1550 for an anticipated 7.5-hour trip to St. Thomas.\nThe captain told NTSB that he was aware that there was a tropical storm to the north and consulted weather reports. There was a small craft advisory and a forecast of winds 10-15 knots with gusts to 25 knots and seas up to 9 feet. The captain determined the weather was “acceptable” and decided to get underway.\nWhen they reached Red Point on St. Thomas around midnight, the weather had deteriorated and the port advised that a barge had broken away from its mooring and was partially blocking the dock for theBonnie G. The captain decided to anchor to wait out the storm. He told the investigators he through the area was maybe 23 to 26 feet deep, so he ordered 135 feet of chain and set a watch and alarms before leaving the bridge.\nAn able-bodied seafarer was on watch and at 0120 the captain returned to bridge after hearing a nose. Saying that everything appeared “normal” the captain left the bridge, but at 0300 the AB alerted the captain the vessel was drifting. The AB was ordered to heave the anchor as the captain planned to get underway, but the AB reported back the anchor chain had parted. Minutes later moving at 0.8 knots theBonnie Gran aground on a rock.\nUnable to get the vessel free, the captain told the USCG that they needed to abandon ship. The USCG crew reported conditions were a sustained 24 knot wind, gusting to 33 knots, and seas 4 to 8 feet with less than 1 mile of visibility. They were able to recover the people from theBonnie G.\nTheBonnie Gremained on the rocks and was latersalvagedby DonJon-SMIT. It had flooded and had extensive damage leading to it being declared a loss.\nNTSB cites a series of errors. They believe the captain made an erroneous assessment of the water depth which was actually 68 feet where he attempted to anchor not the 23 to 26 he assumed. He did not check charts available in the vessel and “an inadequate scope of chain” was deployed when anchoring. NTSB believes that led to the anchor chain parting.\n“When anchoring a vessel, a length of anchor chain that is five to seven times the water depth (scope, or ratio of anchor chain to water depth) should be used; even more anchor chain should be used in adverse weather,” the report said.\nGetting underway, NTSB reports the captain also did not use the available onboard navigational chart to identify a rock nearby, and when maneuvering after the anchor chain failed, he inadvertently steered directly onto the rock and grounded the vessel. As a result, the hull was breached just forward of the engine room.\nThe chief engineer told NTSB he was in the engine room and saw the flooding and became fearful. NTSB reports the forward watertight door in the engine room of theBonnie Gwas open and not secured before the crew abandoned the vessel. Investigators determined that had the watertight door been shut as required, it is likely that progressive flooding of the engine room and aft spaces would not have occurred, limiting vessel damage.\nNTSB concludes the report warning when anchoring, mariners should review navigational charts and other sources to become familiar with nearby hazards. The heavy weather conditions increased the risk and the potential of having to get underway on short notice.",

    "input": "\nHapag-Lloyd released preliminary financial results for 2024 coming in at the top of the profitability forecasts the company had already revised upward in October 2024. As the first of the major carriers to release results it also gives a glimpse into the financial strength of the sector despite what was seen as a very challenging year.\nThe preliminary figures show an anticipated quadrupling of earnings in the fourth quarter from a nearly breakeven level in 2023 to a profit of $1.4 billion in the December quarter of 2024. For the full year, the company is anticipating a slight year-over-year increase in profitability to $5 billion (EBITDA). Revenues for the full year are projected to be up more than 8 percent to $20.7 billion.\n“The increases can primarily be attributed to higher transport volumes combined with a stable average freight rate, which stood at $1,492/TEU and thereby remained at the prior-year level (2023: $1,500/TEU),” said Hapag in its release. It reported that revenues rose, “particularly owing to stronger demand for container transports. Transport volumes increased by roughly 5 percent, to 12.5 million TEU – despite the rerouting of ships via the Cape of Good Hope due to the security situation in the Red Sea and the associated longer voyage times.”\nIn October 2024, Hapag reported that based on recent higher-than-expected demand and improved freight rates – and despite increased transport expenses – it was increasing its forecast for the year to EBITDA in the range of $4.6 to $5.0 billion. It however had warned, “Given the highly volatile development of freight rates and persistent major geopolitical challenges, this forecast remains subject to uncertainty.”\nThe company said it would announce its 2024 results on March 20. At the same time, it will comment on the outlook for the year ahead and release its projections.\nAnalysts have speculated that the industry could face strong challenges in 2025 as freight rates are already under pressure and potentially could collapse when the Red Sea routes are restored. Excess capacity that was helping to offset the longer transit times around Africa would flood back into the market with the Red Sea routes restored while there are also fears about fundamental changes in trade patterns if Donald Trump proceeds with his threats to impose tariffs.\nInvestors, however, today drove the price of Hapag-Lloyd’s shares up by nearly 1.5 percent while others such as Maersk and NYK were up nearly 2 percent. Share prices for the container segment were under pressure for all of 2024 as investors heard repeated cautions from industry executives over the volatility in the sector.",

Introduced in 1982 as theSong of America(37,500 gross tons), she was one of the largest cruise ships in the world and an innovator that would see 40 years of service first in the American market, later in Europe, and finally in the Greek Islands.\nShe had been retired in 2023 by her last owner, Greece’s Celesytal Cruises which had operated her for 11 years with her final name ofCelestyal Olympia. She was sold in early 2024 to a flag of convenience company which renamed herBella Fortunaand shortly after she departed for an anchorage off the UAE flying the flag of Liberia. It is often a way stop on a one-way trip to be recycled while getting the ships outside the European Union and the restrictions on licensed scrappers.\nAs of the first of the year, the cruise ship’s name was shortened toFortuand her flag moved to Comoros. She departed the UAE on January 22 with her status listed in the databases as “to be broken up.” She is bound it appears to beaches of India’s infamous Alang.\nWhen she was introduced in 1982, Royal Caribbean boasted that she was state-of-the-art. In the first preview brochure for consumers released in 1981, they wrote, “Every innovative maritime feature, every one of ‘tomorrow’s’ cruise concepts, will be part ofSong of Americatoday.” The company had gone into business a decade earlier the brainchild of an American entrepreneur Edwin Stephan with investments from Norway’s Wilhelmsen and I.

First to increase capacity, Royal Caribbean stretched two of its ships but instead of rebuilding its third smaller ship, turned to the famed Wartsila shipyard in Finland to build what becameSong of America.\nThe new ship was 705 feet in length with accommodations for 1,400 passengers and 500 crew. Externally she was sleek and advanced designs including taking the cantilevered lounge on the ship’s funnel by making it larger, with an interior entrance and elevator, and wrapped fully around the funnel. She used the design concept of “vertical separation” that places the public spaces and lounges aft and cabins mostly forward. She also innovated with a half (tween) deck of cabins in front of the extra-height main lounges. Passenger cabins however were still the small, standardized box Stephan had envisioned to encourage passengers to spend their time on deck or in the bars and lounges. (There was no casino in 1982, only a handful of slot machines placed in a discreet hallway.)\nKeeping with a Royal Caribbean style her public spaces were all named from Broadway shows. The lounges were Can Can, Oklahoma, and Guys and Dolls, while the dining room was Madame Butterfly. She took over the “milk run” as the weekly cruises from Miami to Nassau, San Juan, and St. Thomas were known and was an instant success due to her comforts.Song of Americawas part of the second generation of modern cruise ships all of which were around 40,000 gross tons and had accommodations for 1,000 or more passengers. They were larger than the first generation introduced in the late 1960s and provided a stepping stone to larger and finally the mega cruise ships of today.\nThe ship was christened by renowned American opera singer Beverly Sills, and on her maiden voyage the passenger list included former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalyn. Just six years later,Song of Americawould be eclipsed by Royal Caribbean’s new 70,000 gross tonSovereign of the Seas, but she remained a workhorse for the company. She was also among the company’s first ships to homeport beyond Miami.\n\n\nRemarkably unchanged she spent her last decade in the Greek islands as Celestyal Olympia (Celestyal Cruises)\n\nSong of Americaleft Royal Caribbean after just 17 years. She went to a UK operator and was renamedSun Bird. She helped to build the UK market before being sold to the Cypriot firm Louis Cruises. Instead, she would sail on charter to another British firm Thomson Holidays as theThomson Destiny. As part of the TUI family, Thomson evolved into Marella Cruises but before the transition seeking to modernize the fleet the now 30-year-old cruise ship was returned to her owners. She became theLouis Olympiaand laterCelestyal Olympiawhen the company was rebranded. She cruised the Greek Islands in the summer and spent winters in layup.\nRemarkably unchanged since her introduction in 1982, she was finally retired late in 2023. She had outlived most of the second and even the third generation of modern purpose-built cruise ships. With her goes the link to the heady days of growth, but before cruise ships had water slides and water parks or any of the modern amusements. Passengers lounged in the sun by day, saw a floor show or a movie in the evening, and enjoyed their time at sea. She was a pioneer and then a throwback to the simpler, earlier days of cruising.\nPost script: The former MV Song of America beached in Alang, India on February 1, 2025.",

In a newly released audit, the GAO finds issues with record keeping, alignment with national security considerations, and efforts to ensure the competencies needed to address cybersecurity risks.\nAware of cyber dangers and the continuing concerns raised in Congress and elsewhere about Chinese-made cargo cranes, the Biden administration in 2024 directed the Coast Guard to take steps to enhance cybersecurity and reporting especially from ports. USCG released in January 2025updated rulesfor cybersecurity in the marine transportation system.\nThe FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act included a provision for the GAO to review cybersecurity risks to the maritime transport system, including vessels and facilities. GAO reports it analyzed data on cybersecurity risks, statutes and regulations, and the Coast Guard documentation and inspection data from 2019 through June 2024. Based on its findings, the GAO is making five recommendations to be addressed by the USCG command.\nThe report highlights that owners and operators of U.S. maritime facilities and vessels rely on systems that are connected to internal and external networks and that they face heightened cybersecurity risks. They note that ports have been affected by cyber incidents and that the potential impacts of future incidents could be severe.\n“The Coast Guard provided guidance for and inspects facilities and vessels that are subject to cybersecurity-related requirements,” they write in the report. “But it can’t readily access complete information on these inspection results – which can make oversight harder.”\nThe GAO found that the Coast Guard cannot readily access complete information on inspection results specific to cybersecurity from its system of records. They recommend updating the system to provide ready access to complete information on all cybersecurity-related deficiencies. GAO says this would provide better oversight and position the service to prevent cyberattacks.\nThey also concluded the USCG cyber strategy did not fully address all the key characteristics needed for an effective national strategy. Other issues included not fully addressing leading practices to ensure its cyber workforce has the competencies needed to address risks. They write that the USCG has not fully assessed and addressed competency gaps for its cyber workforce.\nTheGAO reportdetails its five recommendations to address these issues within USCG. They also note that the Department of Homeland Security, of which USCG has been a part since 2003, concurred with GAO's cybersecurity recommendations.",

They report after the successful studies efforts are now underway to advance these research projects to on-ship trials as soon as possible.\nFugitive emissions happen across the LNG supply chain ranging from loading to engine delivery. While short-lived they represent another source of harmful unburnt methane entering the environment in addition to the more widely discussed methane slip where unburnt methane enters the exhaust during the combustion problem.\nThe Safetytech Accelerator launched its flagship Methane Abatement Maritime Innovation Initiative (MAMII) in September 2022 bringing together industry leaders, technology innovators, and maritime stakeholders with a focus on measuring and mitigating methane emissions in the maritime sector and also seeks to promote the adoption of solutions to reduce and eliminate methane emissions. This latest effort involved industry leaders Chevron, Carnival Corporation, Shell, and Seapeak as well as three technology supplies.\nThe group reports that identifying, quantifying, and mitigating fugitive emissions is another element of the effort. It says that it is another essential element to achieve industry-wide decarbonization goals.\nThree companies and their technologies were the focus of the completed technology feasibility studies. Xplorobot which provides handheld devices and an AI-powered platform to detect and measure fugitive emissions studied the warm side of the gas fuel line evaluating the efficacy of the technology in detecting and quantifying methane emissions. For this technology, the next step is to deploy the kit in the field to further validate and optimize the technology.\nA second study explored acoustic cameras from Sorama evaluating the viability for monitoring on LNG carriers. Strategically placed and handheld cameras detect the emissions by visualizing sound and vibration fields in 3D. A six-month pilot scoped the use of four fixed cameras aboard. They believe it demonstrated a capability to quickly identify the source of emissions and would provide a cost-effective option for ship operators.\nFramergy studied its technology which would be used to store and purify methane to significantly reduce emissions during planned and unplanned venting events. The methane would be captured and stored at a lower pressure than conventional methods using the company’s filtering membrane made of a metal-organic framework material. Captured methane has the possibility of reuse or sale.\nThe Safetytech Accelerator reports the three studies show the potential to detect, measure, and mitigate methane emissions on LNG-powered ships. While methane slip – the unburnt release of methane during combustion – remains the largest source of methane emissions, they believe this work adds another critical element to the overall effort addressing methane emissions. The group is also supporting efforts to reduce emissions from engine exhausts.\nThe Anchor Partners for the MAMII effort total more than 20 leading shipping and energy companies. Beyond the four companies that participated in these studies, others working with the effort include MSC, Lloyd’s Register, GTT, NYK, Mitsui O.S.K., CMA CGM, and others.",

The effort includes new legislation that would codify protocols into law.\nEU members have grown concerned about the risks posed by the anonymously-owned, questionably-insured Aframaxes and Suezmaxes that serve Russian oil terminals in the Baltic Sea. These vessels lift oil that is priced above the G7 \"cap\" on tanker services, and are flagged, owned, insured and classed using non-Western service providers. Many have extensive lists of inspection deficiencies, and many more are near (or past) the standard 20-year retirement age of a crude oil tanker.\nIn addition, four separate anchor-drag incidents severed subsea cables between NATO nations in the Baltic over the last year, and one involved a shadow fleet tanker. The damage has raised concerns that Russian intelligence agencies may be paying vessel crews to carry out intentional, hard-to-prove \"hybrid\" attacks on subsea infrastructure.\nOfficials told Politico that EU nations are assembling the legal framework for a more forceful response after incidents like these. The objective would be to seize the offending vessel quickly; the legal rationale could be environmental protection or counter-piracy operations, the diplomats said. If necessary, national laws could be enacted to justify action against poorly-insured vessels - though any direct interference with ships outside the 12-nautical-mile line would have to contend with UNCLOS' provisions for freedom of navigation in international waters.\n\"We cannot block all the sea, but we can control more,\" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told Politico. \"There are lots of opportunities.\"\nCovert options are also possible. On Sunday, the aging tankerKoalawas preparing to depart the Russian port of Ust-Luga when she suffered a series of engine room explosions. Three separate blasts were reported as the vessel was preparing to depart, according to the security services-linked account Baza. According to the regional governor of Leningrad, the explosions were a \"man-made incident,\" and the tanker remains afloat and securely moored at the pier.\nMultiple Russian sources reported Monday that three holes have been found inKoala'shull near the engine room, thanks to a mini-ROV inspection of the exterior. Russian security services believe that the tanker may have been mined, Baza reports. No explosives have been found aboard, but security services are inspecting the interior of the vessel with K9 teams and a thorough ROV survey continues.\n",

The payments were made through a Swiss contractor - a former employee who only did business with Trafigura and was known as \"Mr. Non-Compliant,\" prosecutors said.\nOver the course of the Angolan chartering and bunkering contracts, the arrangement netted Trafigura $144 million in profits - a return of nearly 3,000 percent on the $5 million bribe.\nTrafigura denied wrongdoing, but prosecutors showed the court an extensive collection of memos and emails detailing the network of shell companies used to route the payments. Ultimately the court found Trafigura guilty and sentenced the firm to pay about $150 million in fines and compensation - nullifying its profit from the contracts.\nFormer COO Mike Wainwright was also convicted of orchestrating the corrupt scheme, and was sentenced to 32 months in prison (including at least 12 months before probation). He plans to appeal, and that process will place the sentence on hold.\n\"The court found Mr. Wainwright guilty based on general assumptions and disregarded key evidence that shows he was not involved in any bribery scheme,\" Wainwright's lawyer said in a statement.\nThe Angolan official and one other individual were also found guilty, but were not named due to Swiss privacy rules.",

As part of a program to boost capacity, the Navy helped a previously unknown company, W International, to set up a fabrication facility in South Carolina to build modules for HII Newport News - starting with components for the Ford-class aircraft carrier program. In 2022, quality issues were found with these modules and W International began shedding contract volume. It eventually came under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible misappropriation of funds, focused in part on its complex ownershipstructure.\nIn December, W International sold essentially all of its assets to Huntington Ingalls Industries. The purchase includes a 45-acre complex, nearly 500,000 square feet of covered manufacturing space, and an extensive array of tooling and production equipment for complex metal fabrication. (Outgoing HII Newport News President Jennifer Boykin emphasized that HII had not bought W International as a legal entity - just its plant and equipment.)\n500 employees were invited to stay on under HII's management at the newly-renamed plant, now known as Newport News Shipbuilding - Charleston Operations. 99 percent of them accepted the offer, HII said in a statement Monday.\nHII now plans to grow the site and use it to build modules for its own submarine construction pipeline. As the plant gets rolling, HII plans to create hundreds of additional jobs in the area.\n\"HII is committed to going where the labor is to increase shipbuilding capacity,\" HII President and CEO Chris Kastner said in a statement. \"This lets us efficiently add trained talent and state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities to the urgent job of building ships, making it a unique opportunity to immediately accelerate throughput at Newport News Shipbuilding.\"",

A letter of Intent for the ships was first announced in April 2024 with Reuters reporting today the finalized order is being valued at approximately $9.34 billion for the vessels to deliver between 2030 and 2036.\nNorwegian’s CEO Harry Sommer explained the order as a long-term growth strategy for the brand and reserving critical construction slots. He said it would be a new class of cruise ship that expands on the company’s strategies while also setting new standards for innovation, luxury, and sustainability. It was part of a larger corporate strategy that also ordered two ships for the company’s ultra-luxury Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand and two additional vessels for the premium brand Oceania Cruises.\nThe four cruise ships for the company’s namesake contemporary segment brand have increased approximately 20 percent in size from the original announcement and will rival the largest cruise ships ever built in Italy and by Fincantieri. The four ships for Norwegian Cruise Line are now reported to be approximately 226,000 gross tons with 5,100 lower berths and a total occupancy including crew of over 8,300 people.\nNorwegian has lagged behind the other major cruise brands (Royal Caribbean International, Carnival Cruise Line, and MSC Cruises) in the size of ships. Norwegian’s current largest cruise ship is theNorwegian Encoredelivered from Meyer Werft in 2019 at 169,000 gross tons and a capacity of just under 4,000 passengers. Norwegian’s largest capacity cruise ship is theNorwegian Escape(4,200 passengers) introduced in 2015, but the brand adjusted its strategy to focus on a more spacious design.\nThe new contract expands the relationship with Fincantieri which is also building the innovativeNorwegian Primaclass which started as a smaller, more luxurious large ship design with accommodations for 3,100 passengers each on theNorwegian Prima(2022) andNorwegian Viva(2023). Norwegian expanded the third and fourth ships of the class,Norwegian Aqua(2025) and Norwegian Luna (2026), by 10 percent to 156,300 gross tons and 3,500 passengers. The fifth and sixth vessels of the class due in 2027 and 2028 will be further increased by 10 percent in size and built to be methanol-ready for future fuel.\nFincantieri said of today’s order its value “is considered very important.” The Italian shipbuilder recovered its cruise ship construction position after the pandemic and as of July 2024 had 27 cruise ship construction orders including yachts, luxury, and large vessels. It was part of a 96-ship backlog for the group valued as of July 2024 at over €41 billion ($42.7 billion) counting soft backlog (i.e. provisional orders).\nThe new cruise ships for Norwegian will be built at the company’s yard in Monfalcone, Italy with the first ship due in 2030. The sister ships will follow at two-year intervals in 2032, 2034, and 2036.\nNorwegian’s new vessels will rival an order placed by Carnival Corporation with Fincantieri in July 2024 for three 230,000 gross ton cruise ships for Carnival Cruise Line. Those ships were reported each at 230,000 gross tons with over 3,000 passenger cabins and a capacity of approximately 8,000 passengers. Carnival’s first ship is due in 2029 followed by deliveries in 2031 and 2033. The Industry’s largest cruise ship, however, will be the Star of the Seas due to enter service for Royal Caribbean International this summer at approximately 250,000 gross tons and 5,600 passengers (double occupancy).\nCurrently, the largest cruise ship built in Italy, by Fincantieri, is theSun Princessfor Carnival Corporation’s Princess Cruises. Delivered in 2024, the ship is 177,882 gross tons with accommodations for approximately 4,300 passengers. She will be joined by a sister shipStar Princessin October 2025.\nWith Norwegian finalizing its order, each of the four large cruise brands has placed significant additional large ship orders over the past 12 months. Analysts note that the industry has been capacity constrained since the restart after the pandemic, with demand outpacing the addition of new berths. The investments in new ships are seen as a further demonstration of the corporation’s confidence in the future growth of the cruise industry.",

    "input": "As the offshore wind energy sector continues to evolve, operators especially in the maintenance and operations phase are faced with the challenges of lowering costs and increasing efficiency.  Norway’s Ulstein has developed a new hybrid design for a smaller service vessel that they believe fills a critical gap in the market and reduces costs for the operations of the wind farms.\nWhile the world needs more renewable energy sources, costs continue to be a significant challenge for offshore wind. To achieve financial viability, developers have been looking to larger projects, but Ulstein focused on an approach with could lower CAPEX by 50 percent, operating costs, and contribute to making smaller, closer-to-shore wind farms more economical for the developers.\nCurrently, they point out the walk-to-work sector relies mostly on the larger Service Operation Vessels (SOV) which can stay onsite for an extended period and typically accommodate up to 100 people. Day projects are supported by the crew transfer vessels.\n\n\nSmaller SOV fills a gap in the market and offers 50 percent lower CAPEX and OPEX (Ulstein)\n\nUlstein’s proposal for the SX250 is a vessel that can bridge the gap between CTVs and the current large SOVs. Its smaller vessel would measure approximately 47 meters (154 feet) and provide accommodations for 32 to 40 individuals. It would have a top operating speed of 10 knots and use the designer’s Twin X-Stern to enhance seakeeping capabilities.\nAccording to the company, the vessel would be suited for sea conditions up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) and best for small to mid-sized wind farms located in areas with calm or moderate sea states. These could be closer or shore or in shallow waters.\nAnother concept is for the smaller SOVs to work in unison with the larger vessels. According to Ulstein, two of three of the SX250 could be managing smaller jobs at the wind farm while the traditional, larger SOV focuses on the larger tasks.\nThe new vessel concept Ulstein says relies on existing off-the-shelf hardware and technology to ensure effective walk-to-work operations while reducing CAPEX and OPEX. The vessel can be customized with different arrangements and topside equipment and depending on the operational needs, various setups such as a gangway system, a daughter craft, deck storage, or a work or observation ROV.\nFilling the perceived gap in the market Ulstein says provides a unique opportunity to lower CAPEX and OPEX by up to 50 percent versus the current vessels. As a smaller vessel, it also contributed toward the push toward sustainable operations and presents a unique new solution to support the broader building out of the offshore wind sector.\n",

    "input": "\nLast week, Taiwan reported peak wind production levels with presence of a strong northeast monsoon off its coast. The state-owned utility company Taipower said that wind power generation started to rise on Thursday, surpassing 3.1 GW by early hours of Friday morning. This record output accounted to 10 percent of the total electricity generation in Taiwan.\nThe peak production is a positive outcome as Taiwan doubles-down on investments in the offshore wind sector. In January, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MoEA) issued an updated plan for the renewable energy, targeting to install 8.2 GW of solar and offshore wind by the end of 2026. This will see renewable energy account for 20 percent of electricity generation by 2026.\nIn addition, Taipower reported on the steady growth in Taiwan’s wind power generation. The output has rose from around 3 billion kilowatt-hours in 2022 reaching nearly 10 billion kWh last year. These levels of wind power are helping Taiwan meet peak electricity demand during the evening hours while solar power provides a stable output during the day.\nOne of Taiwan’s largest offshore wind farms, the Yunlin project, entered operation last week. The Yunlin wind farm is now producing clean energy at its design capacity of 640 MW. It is located in the Taiwan Strait, between 5 and 11 miles off the west coast of Taiwan, and comprises 80 wind turbines connected to two onshore substations in Yunlin County. The development and operation of the wind farm is led by a consortium comprising Skyborn Renewables, TotalEnergies, EGCO Group and Sojitz Corp.\n“We are pleased with the completion of the Yunlin offshore wind farm. This project realized with our partners will help Taiwan reach its 2025 target of 5.7 GW of offshore wind power,” said Olivier Jouny, Senior Vice President Renewables at TotalEnergies.",

    "input": "\nExcitement over the impending departure of the famed ocean liner ssUnited Stateswas building last week before a further delay appeared prolonging her stay in Philadelphia. The new owners of the liner, Florida's Okaloosa County, have been trying for months to start the final voyage of the now 75-year-old liner as she heads toward a new chapter as the largest artificial reef.\nOn Wednesday, February 5, Okaloosa County announced that after months of delay, it had finally received all the necessary approvals for a large ship dead tow as defined by the U.S. Coast Guard. At high tide around 0600 on Thursday, February 6, the plan was to yank the 53,000 gross ton liner from Pier 82 where she has been docked since July 1986 after the vessel returned from having been stripped of her interior fittings in Turkey and Ukraine.\nThe ssUnited Statesdespite having been out of service since 1969 remains fabled in the annals of shipping history. Design by American’s renowned naval architect William Francis Gibbs, she entered service in 1952. On her maiden voyage, she shattered the Atlantic speed record for a passenger liner with an average speed of over 35 knots and 72 years later remains the fastest passenger liner to have ever crossed the Atlantic. The liner is rumored to have touched 40 knots during her “top secret” speed trials.\nThe non-profit SS United States Conservancy, which acquired the ship in 2011 and sold her to Okaloosa County in October last year for $1 million, wrote in an announcement, “After completing comprehensive due diligence involving extensive testing and reporting to local, state, and federal agencies, Okaloosa County has now received final approval from the U.S. Coast Guard to begin moving the ssUnited States.”\nThe delays had centered on concerns from the U.S. Coast Guard to ensure a proper dead ship tow plan was in place for the nearly 1,000-foot liner. The review included safety precautions and planning for the tow as well as questions regarding the stability, appropriate amount of ballast, and the structural integrity of the vessel.\nThe first step of the complicated tow plan calls for a lateral move from the north side of Pier 82 to the south side of Pier 80. That would ensure she was floating freely, and final preparations would be completed for the next phase which starts her final trip with her next stop in Mobile, Alabama.\n\n\nThe liner's first move will be lateral from Pier 82 to Pier 80 before being moved into the Delaware River (Allan Jordan photo)\n\nThe departure from Philadelphia was scheduled for February 8, which in an odd quirk of fate is 75 years to the day from when her keel was laid in the dry dock at New Port News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. Tugboats were to maneuver the ssUnited Statesfrom Pier 80 into the Delaware River at approximately 0330. She was due to proceed downriver during low tide at approximately 0430. Complicating the maneuver are the roadway bridges passing over the river (Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322), and the Delaware Memorial Bridge (I-295) along her route. The Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) has determined it will suspend traffic on the bridges as the liner passes underneath. On at least one of the bridges, the liner’s funnels and mast only have a few feet of clearance to the underside of the bridge. Near the mouth of the Delaware River, she will be secured to an ocean-going lead tug for the trip to Alabama.\nFirst, it was announced that the lateral move was delayed to the second high tide of the day at approximately 2020 on Thursday, February 6. Then, during a last-minute meeting with the U.S. Coast Guard and others, further questions arose related to the towing of the vessel.\n“Plans to move the ssUnited Statesfrom Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Mobile, Alabama, have been delayed due to follow-up details requested by the U.S. Coast Guard to ensure a proper tow from Pier 82 to Pier 80. Because of the delay of the pier transition, the departure tow out of Philadelphia originally planned for February 8 has been delayed. A new date has not been set for departure,” the Conservancy announced in a follow-up posting on social media.\nThe Conservancy added that it understands the frustrations brought about by the continuous delays of the vessel’s voyage and called for more patience. The delay is indefinite with no target date announced for the next attempt to move the liner.\nOkaloosa County has estimated it will be a two-week journey for the liner to reach Mobile, Alabama. Upon arrival, the vessel will undergo an extensive remediation removing oil from her fuel tanks and other contaminants. Her iconic profile will be lost as her two massive funnels and her radar mast are to be dismantled and all the windows removed. There are also plans for unspecified modifications to ensure that when the vessel is deployed, it will land upright underwater. The preparation processes are anticipated to take about 12 months.\nOkaloosa County highlights that the exact location along the Gulf Coast where the ssUnited Stateswill be deployed as an artificial reef has not been set. It is expected to be about 20 nautical miles south of the Destin-Fort Walton Beach area.\n“As the world’s largest artificial reef, the story of the ssUnited Stateswill be told to thousands of divers from around the world as they explore her unique design and features. She will also benefit her surrounding ecosystem and become home to countless marine species that will thrive from the presence of her structure,” said Okaloosa County.\nThe County added that due to her size and the depth, the vessel will be home to a wide variety of marine life from iconic reef fish such as red snapper to pelagic species of fish like wahoo. The County is also helping the Conservancy with plans to establish an on-shore visitor’s center and museum dedicated to the liner and American design.",

    "input": "The first new cruise ship built to sail under the Japanese flag in nearly 35 years was floated at the Papenburg, Germany shipyard of Meyer Werft. NamedAsuka III, she is part of a wave of expansion for the Japanese cruise market.\nThe new NYK cruise ship left the building hall on Saturday, January 18, and is now alongside the fitting-out berth. Coming out of the hall, the 52,250 gross ton cruise ship paused so that its funnel could be placed aboard. As is typical, the ship which is approximately 755 feet (230 meters) in length is also at maximum height in the hall and requires the additional clearance outside the hall for the funnel to be fitted.\n\n\nFunnel placed after the cruise ship is floated out (Meyer Werft)\n\nThe cruise ship, which is powered by LNG, was ordered in March 2021 making her the first large cruise ship ordered after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Steel cutting began in September 2023. The first block which weighed 345 tonnes and was 80 feet (24.6 meters) long was placed in the dry dock in December 2023 to begin assembly of the new cruise ship.\nNYK has a long heritage in passenger shipping and has maintained cruise operations for the Japanese market with a series of newly built cruise ships. The firstAsuka(built in 1991) was sold and replaced with the currentAsuka II(built in 1990) which was originally operated by NYK’s American cruise company Crystal Cruises. She was transferred to Japan in 2006.\nThe new cruise ship is also unique in that it is not being built in Japan, unlike her predecessors. NYK opted to tap the expertise of Meyer with cruise ships, but the yard notes the vessel is being uniquely outfitted for the Japanese market. It has 385 passenger cabins and will accommodate approximately 740 passengers with a crew of 470. Among these elements tailored to the Japanese market is a spa that includes a Japanese-style open-air bath. The ship also features large, luxury suites, and will offer a variety of dining and entertainment options.\n\n\nRendering of the completed Asuka III (NYK)\n\nTheAsuka IIIis expected to make her conveyance to the North Sea in the spring. Delivery is currently scheduled for the summer with the ship operating a delivery cruise from Germany to Japan. She will be homeported in Yokohama.\nNYK is expanding its cruise offering maintaining the olderAsuka IIwhich also operates from Yokohama.

Last week, Canada’s Minister of Transport and Internal Trade Anita Anand announced an investment of up to $17 million for the Halifax Port Authority. Part of this funding includes $15 million for development of the Halifax- Hamburg green shipping corridor.\nHalifax and Hamburg ports signed a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU) to establish a green shipping corridor back in 2022. With the funding now available, Halifax will prepare for the green transition by establishing a hydrogen production facility, electrifying port equipment to reduce emissions and launching an incentive program to shift freight traffic from road to rail. In addition, the port will ready bunkering facilities to accommodate and refuel alternative fuel-powered vessels.\n“Transport Canada’s Green Corridor investment will help to competitively position the Port of Halifax for the future. Around the world, there is interest to decarbonize shipping. The awarded funding will help fund feasibility work, assessments, new equipment and workforce development here at the port,” said Fulvio Fracassi, CEO of Halifax Port Authority.\nThe remaining $2 million will go into financing the Ship to Shore Crane infrastructure project. This is targeted at expanding terminal capacity and boost efficiency when servicing larger vessels at the Port of Halifax.\nMeanwhile, the European North Sea Port has strengthened trade and energy cooperation with five Canadian ports, located in the south west region of the country. These include Montreal, Quebec, Saguenay, Sept-Îles and Trois-Rivières ports. This initiative is expected to improve connectivity of supply chains between the Saguenay- St. Lawrence maritime corridor and the North Sea corridor. In addition, the ports pledged to collaborate and achieve results together in areas such as decarbonization and knowledge transfer.\n“Canada is North Sea Port’s fourth most important trading partner in terms of cargo throughput. Our location in western Europe is of great strategic importance for cooperation with these five Canadian ports,” said Maarten den Dekker, the Chief Sustainability Officer of North Sea Port.",

By using the proven design of gas turbines, the companies believe it will be possible to develop a new engine that can unlock the benefits of ammonia to provide carbon-free emissions in new applications including shipping.\nBaker Hughes offers a broad line of gas turbines ranging from 5.7MW to 130MW which it highlights cover virtually every application across the oil and gas value chain, and in other industries. Power plants, LNG, and pipeline transmission, the company reports have widely adopted its gas turbine products and now it looks to develop the new small-size ammonia turbine which will be suitable for marine applications as well as for onshore and offshore applications and electric generation and mechanical drive. Gas turbines were explored for several ships including cruise ships starting about 20 years ago, but many cruise lines moved away from them saying they are costly to operate.\nUnder the new partnership, Baker Hughes will work with the shipbuilding group Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Power Systems. They look to combine expertise for a new small-size turbine for ammonia applications that will leverage Baker Hughes’ small-size gas turbine technology and Hanwha’s ammonia combustion system.\nHanwha reports it has already tested successfully a proof-of-concept of the combustor, with 100 percent ammonia as the fuel gas, and Baker Hughes completed its initial turbine feasibility studies in 2024. The two companies target to complete the full engine test with ammonia by the end of 2027, after which the turbine (~16MW power range) will be commercially available for orders.\n\"This collaborative development of a low-carbon ammonia gas turbine will be a significant turning point in the global shipbuilding and shipping industry, accelerating the transition to eco-friendly fuel propulsion for ships,\" said Son Young-chang, vice president and head of Hanwha Ocean's Product Strategy Technology Institute.\nThe ammonia gas turbine to be developed through this collaboration will be based upon the proven, small-size turbine technology of Baker Hughes, and a newly-developed ammonia combustion system created by PSM, a US-based Hanwha subsidiary. The gas turbine will be capable of 100 percent ammonia combustion, and dual fuel operation with a natural gas and ammonia blend.\n“It is expected to be a game-changing technology for large ship owners, enabling a completely carbon-free mode of propulsion,” predicts Hanwha. The shipbuilding group looks to incorporate the ammonia gas turbine into its designs for LNG gas carriers and containerships which it expects to have available by 2028. Hanwha Power Systems and Hanwha Ocean obtained in September 2023 approval in principle from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) to apply ammonia gas turbines to LNG carriers.\nBaker Hughes reports that it is currently exploring how its small-size gas turbines can accelerate the transition from diesel motors to turbines powered by ammonia and hydrogen. In January 2024, the company announced the completion of the successful testing of the world’s first 100 percent hydrogen turbine, which is now commercially available and with orders under execution.",

Expansion of the port’s facilities is proceeding with the soft opening of MSC Cruises’ new terminal at the eastern end of Dodge Island further expanding capacity and preparing the port for the entry into service of the next mega cruise ship.\nThe port handled a total of 10 cruise ships on Saturday, February 8. It was the first time the port had docked that number of cruise ships in one day and it ranged from the world’s largest cruise ship,Icon of the Seas, to multiple vessels from Norwegian Cruise Line, Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International, and other lines including Oceania Cruises, Virgin Voyages, and Holland America Line.\nAccording to the port they were expecting close to 68,000 passengers. The 10 cruise ships (Carnival Magic,Carnival Sunrise,Zaandam,MSC Seascape,Norwegian Escape,Norwegian Gem,Sirena,Icon of the Seas,Independence of the Seas, andScarlet Lady) have a double occupancy capacity of approximately 32,000 passengers and a total capacity of approximately 38,000 passengers (excluding crew). The port counts embarking and disembarking passengers separately for the total number of people passing through its facilities in a single day.\nIt comes as PortMiami roared back into first place in the cruise industry handling 8,233,056 passengers in FY2024. Miami has been the largest homeport for years but briefly was eclipsed by Port Canaveral, Florida during the restart from the pandemic.\nPreviously, PortMiami had handled eight cruise ships in a day and set a passenger record at approximately 67,500 people in a day. A December 2023 day that had the potential to see 70,000 passengers was disrupted by bad weather. However, the port’s expansion continues.\n“PortMiami is the departure choice for all major cruise lines,” said Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. “It is no surprise PortMiami and the cruise industry continue to break records.”\n\n\nMSC Seascape was the first cruise ship to use the new $360 million Terminal AA (MSC Cruises)\n\nTheMSC Seascapebecame the first cruise ship to dock at the new Terminal AA this weekend with the official opening for the terminal scheduled for next month. Ceremonies are set for March 6, but the 4,500-passenger cruise ship kicked off the operation this weekend.\nMSC Cruises built the terminal in cooperation with PortMiami and it included removing land and creating a new seawall to make the channel wide enough to accommodate the 135-foot-wide cruise ship at the berth. MSC first announced plans for the terminal in 2018 as part of its growth plans for the North American cruise market. Fincantieri Infrastructure, the land-side construction arm of the Italian group, began construction of the terminal in March 2022 which was reported to be costing approximately 350 million euros ($360 million).\n\n\nPortMiami removed land from the island to widen the channel to accommodate cruise ships at the new terminal (MSC Cruises)\n\nWhen completed Terminal AA will have access to three berths, including handlingMSC World America, the new 215,860 gross ton cruise ship with accommodations for over 6,700 passengers due to enter service in April 2025. The terminal was designed to handle up to 36,000 passengers a day. It has been billed as the largest cruise terminal in the United States.\nPortMiami is also undertaking upgrades to its existing terminals to support growth. Terminal F was already rebuilt and the next step class for the overhaul and rebuilding of Terminal G for Royal Caribbean Group, including the ability to handle a 7,000 passenger Icon-class cruise ship. The revamped Terminal G is due to be available in 2027.",

It comes after a record volume at the port in 2024 and is the fourth monthly volume record set in the past 40 months as Shanghai continues to be the world’s busiest container port.\nThe Shanghai International Prot Group reported today, February 5, that the container port complex exceeded a monthly throughput of more than 5 million TEU. It is also the first time the port has handled more than 5 million boxes in a month. The previous monthly record was set last July (2024) when the port complex exceeded 4.8 million TEUs, with prior records in January 2022 and August 2021. The port complex set an all-time single-day high handling 172,080 TEUs during the day and night on July 21, 2024.\nPort officials called it an auspicious start for the new year following on a record-setting level in 2024. Last year, the port had a throughput of 51.5 million TEU. It was the fifteenth year in a row that Shanghai had the highest container port throughput and is only rivaled by other Chinese port complexes as well as Singapore which exceeded 40 million TEU in 2024, making it the largest container port outside China.\n“The performance of Shanghai Port in the first month of the new year reflects the active foreign trade and strong resilience of the country's economy,” SIP Group said in its announcement. “Looking ahead, Shanghai Port will continue to make efforts in digitalization, intelligence, and greening, continuously improve port operation efficiency and service quality.”\nPort officials said their efforts would consolidate its leading position as an international hub port, and contribute to the creation of a Chinese-style modern port. They highlight a new model for handling empty containers and inland container hubs along with efforts to promote coastal cabotage, and cross-border e-commerce while empowering and focusing on the construction of the Shanghai International Shipping Center to continue the growth.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department today, February 5, reported that the U.S. trade deficit continued to surge driven by all-time high imports. December 2024’s trade deficit was reported at $98.4 billion, up approximately 25 percent, and the second-largest trade deficit on record topping the previous peak in March 2015. Imports drove the gap reaching approximately $365 billion up 3.5 percent for the month while exports declined nearly 3 percent to $266.5 billion.\nAnalysts point to the strength of the U.S. economy and consumer spending in the Biden economy as well as the rush to bring goods onshore ahead of Trump’s promises of increased tariffs. The expectation is that January 2025 figures will show a similar record-high import level and trade gap. Trump imposed a 10 percent tariff increase on China as of February 4 with the threat of 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico delayed till next month and potential tariffs on goods from the European Union.",

It follows CMA CGM’s order in the second quarter of 2024 order for a dozen 15,000 TEU liquefied natural gas vessels from Hyundai Heavy Industries.\nCMA CGM, which is currently ranked third with a capacity of over 3.8 million TEU, has been investing in the energy transition as part of a fleet modernization and expansion program. As of the third quarter of 2024, the group highlighted more than 40 operational alternative fuel vessels and a total investment of $18 billion for 131 vessels by 2028 that will be capable of running on low-carbon energy, including biomethane, biomethanol, and synthetic fuels.\nThe new order represents a strong start for HD KSOE which announced a target of $18.05 billion for orders in 2025, which while a 34 percent increase over the 2024 target projects a decline in total orders versus those booked in 2024. The group reported orders valued at over $20 billion in 2024. This first order of the year represents 14 percent of the group’s target for 2025.\nThe order continues the strong buildout for LNG-powered vessels and specifically containerships. DNV’s Alternative Fuel Insight database shows a total of 641 LNG-fueled vessels with 142 containerships in service. It reports LNG represents 10 percent of the current order flow and based on orders, the LNG-fueled fleet will double to 1,273 vessels by 2030.\nSpeaking at the Davos Forum in Switzerland this week, Executive Vice President of HD Hyundai Chung Ki-sun pointed to the continuing efforts in shipbuilding to lead the transition to alternative fuels. The group is focusing on a digital transformation outlining its blueprint for the future of the shipyards. HD Hyundai is partnered with big data company Palantir Technologies and highlighted a strategy for a 30 percent improvement in productivity and a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030.",

    "input": "\nGerman LNG terminal operator Deutsche ReGas has terminated a charter agreement for a full-size FSRU that it brought in last year, when Germany was working hard to bring on extra capacity to replace Russian gas volumes. In a statement, the company said that it was losing money on the arrangement and blamed Deutsche Energy Terminals (DET), a state-owned company set up to organize LNG imports and ensure the security of the nation's energy supply.\nThe cancellation affects the Energos Power, a 174,000 cubic meter FSRU that started operations at the port of Mukran in February 2024. The Energos Power is the larger of the two FSRUs in the Deutsche Ostsee LNG import complex at Mukran; together, the two FSRUs have a receiving capacity of more than 13 billion cubic meters a year. It is the only privately-financed FSRU terminal in the country.\nAccording to ReGas, DET has been auctioning the services of its regulated import terminals at prices below a government-approved minimum cost-covering level, creating \"distortions\" in the gas marketplace and pricing out ReGas' private operation. ReGas has previously warned that its operations could be undercut by the state entity.\n\"DET's ruinous pricing policy since December 2024 is one of several reasons for terminating the sub-charter contract. Deutsche ReGas regrets having to take this step,\" said Ingo Wagner, managing partner of Deutsche Re-Gas. \"We continue to be in close contact with the federal government on this matter. In the event of a supply bottleneck, ReGas believes that an immediate solution can be found at any time.\"\nGermany's LNG terminals are underutilized, and Wagner told reporters last month that ReGas has faced \"unequal competition\" from DET since December. ReGas says that because of state subsidies, DET can market its services below cost.\nFor its part, DET says that it complies with all regulatory requirements and has been successful in marketing its import services. DET's utilization rate was higher than ReGas' rate in 2024, and DET sold all 50 available slots to 17 different companies in its December and February auction rounds. The average price in the December auction was about 10 cents per mmBTU, and the average in the February auction was about 30 cents per MMBtu.\n\"Our offer was well received by the traders and all the slots we offered were marketed. At the same time, we are looking ahead as the currently declining storage levels must be replenished in good time during the year,\" said Dr. Peter Röttgen, Managing Director of DET, in a statement last week.\nThe FSRUs are part of a strategy to replace Russian gas, but according to the Financial Times, Germany's government favors an agreement to restart pipeline gas imports from Russia if a peace deal is reached in Ukraine. If actualized, the sole surviving pipeline of the Nord Stream 2 project would be reactivated - reducing gas prices and undercutting the competitiveness of German FSRUs. The far-right Alternative fur Deutscheland (AfD) party, which is leading in the polls in the run-up to Germany's March election, has vowed to restart Nord Stream.",

The list of companies selected to buy and operate tonnage for QatarEnergy includes China Merchants Group, Shandong Marine Group, China LNG Shipping, Mitsui OSK, COSCO, Shandong Marine Energy, MISC Berhad, K-Line and Hyundai Glovis.\nThe new QatarEnergy LNG tankers, a mix of QC-Max and Q-Flex LNG vessels, are being built in China and South Korea. 43 of the vessels will be chartered-in by affiliate QatarEnergy Trading, to transport the portion of Qatar’s gas exports that are not covered by long-term supply contracts. This will reinforce its aspirations to become a leading global LNG trader.\nThe largest shipowner in the newbuild program isNakilat, formally titled the Qatar Gas Transport Company Limited (QPSC). Nakilat is a publically-quoted company headquartered in Doha, whose shareholdings are dominated by the Qatari state and members of the royal family, but which also includes a broad spectrum of Qatari institutional as well as private shareholders. Qatari shareholders and pension funds hold about 40% of the company. With a targeted annual dividend yield of 5%, this means that a cross-section of Qatari society is benefitting from Nakilat and Qatari gas earnings, and which by sharing out wealth and prosperity also has a political stability dividend. It is a model being replicated in Oman, where Asyad plans to float an initial 20% of its shares via an IPO on the local Muscat Securities Market, with a block of shares reserved for Omani institutional and private investors.\nNakilat also operates the floating storage regasification unitFSRU Exquisite, stationed in a channel of the Indus River east of Karachi.  It also owns the specialist Erhama Bin Jaber Al Jalahma Shipyard at Ras Laffan, and is tied into Milaha, the Qatari logistics company, via a shareholding.",

    "input": "The rivalry between China and South Korea’s shipbuilders continues to heat up. While there is growing concern due to China’s apparent domination of the market, South Korea’s shipbuilders achieved strong results in 2024 and continue to carve out the high-end market.\nAfter posting a dismal new order performance in December booking only six percent of new orders versus 82 percent by the Chinese shipbuilders, South Korea’s industry rebounded to the leadership position in January 2025. It is the first time in several months South Korea received the largest percentage of new orders and it also demonstrated the success of the industry’s focus on higher-value projects and ships.\nAccording to data from Clarkson Research the South Korean industry booked 62 percent of the global orders in January based on tonnage. It received orders for 900,000 CGT (compensated gross tons). That compared with the Chinese yards which received just 19 percent of the tonnage ordered or 270,000 CGT.\nSouth Korea’s orders were led by 12 LNG carriers booked at HD Korean Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering as well as an LNG carrier order for Samsung Heavy Industries. In addition to being higher-value orders, they are also large vessels. South Korea’s orders were for 13 vessels compared to 21 smaller, lower-value vessels ordered from Chinese shipbuilders in January.\nChina continues to still dominate the overall orderbook with a backlog of 91.51 million CGT or 58 percent of the vessels (by tonnage) on order. South Korea has 24 percent of the orders (by tonnage) or a total of just over 37 million CGT. Veson released a market analysis this week with its VesselsValue data highlighting that Chinese shipowners committed to $123 billion in newbuild orders in 2024. The orders were mostly for tankers followed by bulkers and then containerships. Chinese yards have just begun to break into the international market for LNG and other gas carriers.\nSouth Korea’s companies have a positive outlook for 2025 with HD KSOE reporting it increased its forecast by 30 percent versus its 2024 target. It however represents a decline from the actual orders booked in 2024. Samsung Heavy Industries has not yet reported 2024 results and its forecast but commented that its outlook is slightly higher than last year. Hanwha Ocean has commented that it anticipates stable growth in 2025.\nThe positive outlook among the South Korean shipbuilders was in part driven by the strong financial performance recorded in 2024. Ship prices were approaching two-decade highs further contributing to the profitability of the sector.\nHD Hyundai Heavy Industry reported an overall nearly 50 percent increase in operating profit with a better than 10 percent increase in consolidated revenues for 2024. Specifically, within shipbuilding, HD Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering (KSOE) saw profits jump 400 percent to a profit of more than $960 million. Sales were up 20 percent to $17.5 billion.\nHanwha Ocean continued the turnaround from the former Daewoo Shipbuilding (DSME) achieving its first profitable year since 2020. It reported sales of nearly $7.5 billion with an operating profit of $166 million.\nThe return to profitability was not limited to South Korea’s largest shipbuilders. Mid-sized HJ Shipbuilding reported an annual profit of $6.3 million. This was achieved despite a nearly 13 percent decline in revenues.\nThe Korean shipbuilders are refining their business strategy. KSOE for example continues to increase its focus on green technologies and automation while also booking orders for LNG carriers. The company plans to make its first bid next month for a U.S. Navy-related repair contract and is targeting two to three contracts in 2025. Hanwha Ocean won the first two U.S. Navy contracts in 2024 for repairs to an MSC dry cargo and ammunition ship and then an oiler. Hanwha is targeting six USN MRO contracts for 2025 in addition to the construction of LNG carriers, submarines, and LNG dual-fuel containerships.\nHD Heavy Industries and Hanwha Ocean reportedly have reached a partnership agreement for the export of naval ships as they continue to seek more international work. The companies were also encouraged by building relationships with the U.S. Navy in 2024 which Donald Trump has signaled he supports. Trump has said the U.S. could use the capabilities of the South Korean shipbuilders as he pursues a buildout for the U.S. Navy.",

The agents discovered five containers in one of the bulker's holds, filled with 76 tonnes of contraband cigarettes.\nThe agents also found two go-fast speedboats stowed aboard the ship, each fitted with four 300-horsepower outboards - a powerful arrangement typical of smuggling operations. The bulker was also carrying a tank of 10,000 liters of gasoline to supply the boats, which would not be necessary if the small launches were merely part of the cargo.\nCustoms agents suspect that theKokoohad been set up as a \"mother ship\" for running illegal cigarettes to shore using the speedboats. The scale and sophistication of the scheme suggests organized crime, according to the Australian Border Force, which helped with the sting.\nThe vessel's master was arrested and presented to the Noumea Criminal Court. In short order, the court sentenced him to a suspended prison sentence of 10 months, a fine of $350,000 and confiscation of the entire cigarette cargo, along with the speedboats. The value of the seized tobacco is estimated to be about $35 million on the legal market.\n\n\nImages courtesy ABF\nThe ABF believes that the cigarettes were intended for the Australian market, based on the brand markings on the packages.\nThe investigation began long before theKokoowas boarded. The ABF tracked and monitored it as it approached and loitered near the Australian coast, then informed authorities in New Caledonia when the bulker changed course. French armed forces and intelligence units in New Caledonia tracked the vessel in advance, and the port authority in Noumea facilitated the boarding.",

NameFour Seasons I, the new cruise ship is also part of the emerging trend seeing luxury hotel brands leveraged into the cruise industry.\nThe companies report the design brief for the cruise ship called for mixing a superyacht that evoked mid-century glamour with the luxuries of the Four Seasons brand. Designer Fredrik Johansson, partner and executive director of Tillberg Design of Sweden, says the cruise ship’s design captures the glamour of Aristotle Onassis’ superyachtChristina Oand the jet-setting lifestyle of fictional secret agent James Bond (007).\nFincantieri received the order in July 2022 valued at approximately $1.25 billion for the cruise ship with options for two additional vessels. The project is being led by Marc-Henry Cruise Holdings and investors Fort Partners and licenses the Four Seasons brand. Before the first construction block was set in the dry dock in July 2024, Four Seasons Yachts exercised the option for a second vessel valued at more than $417 million and due for delivery in 2026.\n\n\nRendering of the Four Season I (Four Seasons Yachts)\n\nFour Seasons Iwill be a 34,000 gross ton cruise ship measuring 679 feet (207 meters) in length. It has 95 luxury suites featuring large balconies and floor-to-ceiling ocean views. The most distinctive of the suites is a multi-level 457 square meter (nearly 5,000 square foot) Funnel Suite. The designers highlight that each of the suites provides 50 percent more living space per guest and the vessel will have the highest space ratio in the industry. It will feature a 1-to-1 staff-to-passenger ratio.\nAmong the unique amenities is a 66-foot outdoor pool. According to the company, it is a unique design for lounging in the Four Seasons’ style. It also will feature a choice of multiple restaurants, a large spa, and areas for children. There will also be a marina for boating and water activities.\n\n\nCruise ship was floated on January 23, 2025 (Marc-Henry Cruise Holdings)\n\nWork on the yacht began with the keel laying on July 9, 2024, and the vessel was floated at the shipyard in Ancona. It is now beginning outfitting with Fincantieri scheduled to deliverFour Seasons Ibefore the end of 2025. The cruise ship is due to enter service in January 2026 in the Caribbean before repositioning to the Mediterranean and Greek Islands in the spring.\nFour Seasons follows Ritz Carlton into the cruise segment.

The Premier Alliance replaces the former working arrangement known as The Alliance with the companies emphasizing their commitments as they prepare to proceed without former partner Hapag-Lloyd.\nThe agreement was originally filed for approval with the FMC on October 28, 2024. The FMC however quickly responded and reported on November 5, 2024, that it had requested additional information. The review process was delayed to collect the data which the FMC said was necessary for completing an economic analysis of the competitive effects of the agreement.\nThe FMC deemed the responses complete on December 26. The regulations then give the commission 45 days to review a newly filed agreement or the responses before the agreement automatically goes into effect. As with the review for the Gemini Alliance between Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd which faced a similar delay, the FMC said it lacked the ability to challenge the agreements, but that alliance agreements are subject to the strictest standards for ongoing monitoring by the commission.\nThe approval comes just days after Gemini launched and the first vessels transitioned to the new route system for Maersk and Hapag. The companies look to shake up the industry and their cooperation is reshaping working relations across the entire sector.\nThe new alliance covers issues such as vessel sharing, exchanging vessel slots, and the ability for the three companies to discuss and agree on issues such as the size, number, and operational characteristics of vessels operating under the agreement. The three companies said in September 2024 that they had determined to continue their working relationship and enhance it including a separate agreement with MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company.\nHMM, ONE, and Yang Ming have also reported they will be increasing service on key routes and adding new vessels to make up for lost capacity. HMM, for example, is returning with a trans-Atlantic route after having ended its prior service in 2018. ONE has also announced new services to the East Coast of South America and India.\nThe Alliance was launched in 2016 as one of the three working relationships in the industry. It started operations in April 2017. The companies reported it involved 260 ships, calls at 82 ports, and covered 31 different services on the major trade routes.",

At about 1500 hours, the bow ramp suddenly collapsed on four crewmembers, killing two at the scene. One more later died at the hospital, and the sole survivor was seriously injured.\nThe island declared a two-day period of mourning for the lost men, and Croatia's ministry of maritime affairs launched an investigation.\nOn February 3, just six months after the casualty, the ministry released its findings. It determined that the vessel's master and the operating company had disregarded the ship's Safety Management System, which had procedures for how the crew should operate the ramp. The company had not systematically trained the crew to manage a known fault condition in the ramp's hydraulic system: when the hydraulic power shut off, the ramp could fall down.\n\"The crew on the ship did not know how the ramp functions. Some knew that the ramp could drop when the hydraulics are shut off, but the majority did not. The shipping company is responsible to inform them,\" said senior investigator Capt. Sinisa Orlic.\nThe ministry recommended legal action against the CEO of the state-owned ferry operator, Jadrolinija, and against the captain.\n\"[The victims] died due to the lack of a system of managing safety in the Jadrolinija Company. Please allow me at this moment to take the opportunity, in the name of the Croatian state, to express a public apology and deep regret to the families of the deceased seamen. Your most loved ones did their job professionally, responsibly and with dedication, but due to neglect and irresponsibility on the part of others, they unfortunately died,\" said Maritime Minister Oleg Butkovic in an accompanying statement.\nWithin a day of the report's publication, the Croatian government announced that the entire board of Jadrolinija would be dismissed. After a meeting with senior government officials, CEO David Sopta agreed to step down voluntarily, avoiding possible criminal or administrative charges.\n\"Although I personally do not feel guilty for the tragedy, which was caused, according to the published report, by a number of different factors, I have felt moral responsibility from day one,\" said Sopta in a statement.\nA spokesman for the Croatian government confirmed to Index.hr that senior ministers \"will make a decision to dismiss the entire management board of the company at Jadrolinija.\"",

The U.S. has maintained a base on the site since 1956 and each year MSC-charters cargo ships and a tanker to make the challenging voyage to resupply the base for the coming year.\nThe first of the two vessels on the annual trip is theOcean Giant, a 17,590 dwt general cargo ship built in 2012 and operated by Florida-based Seabulk. She arrived at the base on January 26 and today, February 11, Military Sealift Command Pacific reports the offloading of supplies was completed.\nWhenOcean Giantarrived this year she was also transporting new 24-foot pieces for a causeway vital to moving the supplies to the station. It is replacing the ice-pier at McMurdo which was made up of rebar and frozen seawater but was unusable this year due to severe damage.\n\n\nOcean Giant offloaded 380 pieces of cargo (Photo by Marie Morrow, Military Sealift Command Pacific)\n\nOnce the causeway was assembled and moved into place,Ocean Giantwas able to moor and begin the cargo operations. The ship’s crew and members of Navy Cargo Handling Battalion ONE began the offload of 380 pieces of cargo, consisting of containers filled with mechanical parts, vehicles, construction materials, office supplies and electronics equipment, and mobile office units; supplies needed to sustain the next year of operations at McMurdo Station.\nOcean Giantwill also load 360 containers of retrograde cargo for transportation off the continent. This includes trash and recyclable materials for disposal and equipment no longer required for the station.\nShe was scheduled to depart on February 9 and the first stop on her return journey to the United States will be at Lyttelton, New Zealand.

She will also be offloading cargo and when she departs she will also be retrieving the causeway.\nMarie Morrow, MSC’s representative in Antarctica commented “Operating in the remote and challenging environment of Antarctica is unique to the ODF mission. Everyone involved has an important role to play and it is truly a joint mission. The ship operation takes teamwork and coordination from the ship’s crew, all elements of the Joint Task Force (United States Coast Guard, Army, Navy, Air National Guard), civilian contractors, and New Zealand Defense Force integrated into cargo operations.”\nOperation Deep Freeze as the mission is known is a joint service, on-going Defense Support to Civilian Authorities activity in support of the National Science Foundation (NSF), lead agency for the United States Antarctic Program.

The well-planned working environment will help attract and retain high-caliber crews, both male and female, drawn from a nation committed to its national service program. Sensors, navigation and weapons systems are optimized for operations in congested and shallow waters, as found in the Malacca Straits and the South China Sea.\nFuture Republic of Singapore Navy Invincible-class Type 218SG submarine RSS Invincible coming into Kiel, Germany - December 9, 2022#rssinvincibleSRC: webcampic.twitter.com/JNJEGZeGCH\nDiesel-powered, the Invincible submarines can travel at 10 knots surfaced, 15 knots underwater. With an air independent propulsion system for battery charging, the submarines can remain submerged for an estimated 45 days without snorkeling. Cruise endurance is unknown. With a total of ten 21- and 26-inch torpedo tubes, the submarines should be able to launch heavy torpedoes, anti-ship missiles and mines, and to deliver special force teams underwater through an airlock.\nThe submarines have been brought into service relatively quickly because the Singaporean Navy’s 7th Flotilla has built up a cadre of experienced crews through its previous operation of smaller Swedish Archer-class submarines, which will now begin to be retired from service.\nIn service, Singapore will face significant operational challenges.  As a small island state, deployed submarines underwater will provide a valuable hinterland; but conversely, the boats will be particularly vulnerable while in port, even if a protection-from-view shed has been built wharfside to hide their presence or absence.\nTwo further submarines in the class, RSS Illustrious and RSS Inimitable, are due in service by the end of 2025. The overall cost of the program has been estimated as $1.8 billion. A fifth boat may also have been ordered. Other nearby nations may well be tempted to replicate Singapore’s submarine development programme, but Singapore has a 25-year head start.",

A NOAA acoustic buoy captured the sound of the underwater blast from miles away - one of the first hints that the dive had ended in tragedy.\n\nAccording to evidence uncovered by an ongoing Marine Board of Investigation inquiry, the Titan accumulated a long list of safety issues in the years leading up to the casualty. The sub (and an earlier prototype hull) partially sank at the pier, ran out of battery power while submerged, lost its forward dome during a recovery, and failed to drop weights on multiple occasions.\nFormer Oceangate employees testified that co-founder and CEO Richard Stockton Rush III chose not to pursue classification or a Coast Guard Certificate of Inspection (COI) for the novel design, despite repeated warnings from third-party engineering consultants and his own staff. Rush was aware of the experimental nature of Oceangate's commercially-operated vessel: before the disaster that claimed his life, he told a conference audience that \"when you're outside the box, it's hard to tell how really far outside the box you are,\" adding that Oceangate was \"pretty far out there.\"\n\"These [conventional] research subs that are out there, they were never meant to make money.

The 24 crewmembers abandoned ship onto the pier, and the vessel's stern settled until it made contact with the bottom, Morspas said. No leaks of oil have been reported, and the cargo tanks are all believed to be intact.\nAmbrey reports that the blast holes inKoala'shull are substantial, measuring up to 12 feet by six feet. The damage \"strongly suggests that the explosions were caused by limpet mines,\" the consultancy said in a statement.\nAmbrey added that other vessels with \"a similar trading profile\" have also been damaged by explosions - a previously unreported detail of the challenges facing Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of sanctions-skirting tankers.\nKoalais a 22-year-old Suezmax tanker owned by a Turkish firm and managed by a company in Cyprus. At the time of the casualty, she was in Ust-Luga loading a cargo of mazut - a Russian grade of heavy fuel oil, which is not covered by the G7's calibrated sanctions on Russian energy exports.\nLimpet mines are just one of the challenges Russia faces in exporting its petroleum to global markets. According to Reuters, persistent Ukrainian attacks on refineries and the growing impact of U.S. sanctions on the \"shadow fleet\" have curtailed Russia's ability to process or ship out its oil production. An estimated 12-14 percent of Russian refining capacity is offline because of Ukrainian drone attacks, and about a third of all Russia-linked tankers have been blacklisted by EU and U.S. sanctions. Without the means to either use or move their oil, Russian energy firms may soon exhaust storage options and could begin shutting in production, three Russian oil executives told Reuters this week - the first time since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine that this measure has been considered. Oil revenue accounts for 30-50 percent of the Kremlin's budget, and it is essential for financing the Russian military.\nIndian refiners - Russia's biggest oil customers - are working hard to fill the gap by finding new, unsanctioned tankers and operating companies to enter the \"shadow fleet\" trade, according to Bloomberg. About 14 percent of India's monthly oil imports are riding on the effort; if replacement tankers can't be found by March, Indian refiners will have to make up the balance with more expensive oil from other suppliers, like Middle Eastern producers - leaving millions of barrels of Russian crude undelivered.",

The ice flow was reported to be drifting endangering the fishermen.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Ministry reports 31 specialists and 17 units were dispatched and they used a Mi-8 helicopter and a Khivus helicopter. The authorities had to convince the extreme sports enthusiasts of the danger and to abandon their positions.\nIn the final count, 109 people were removed from the ice flow. The helicopter evacuated 44 people back to land while 65 were taken aboard the hovercraft.\nWinter fishing is a popular sport in the Sakhalin region along the Pacific coast. The region is known for its harsh winters. In the past, the rescue services have also had to go to the aid of vessels that become trapped in the winter ice flows.",

The UK government is a strong supporter of the carbon capture and storage approach and has been moving forward with licensing for potential projects.\nCarbon Catalyst, a UK company that was founded in 2020, reported working with its partners the first test commenced on February 10 at the Project Poseidon site. The operator for the project, Perenco UK, a large independent energy producer, is a partner in the project and undertook the injection tests. Wintershall Dea, a large German gas and oil producer, is also a partner having acquired a 10 percent working interest from Carbon Catalyst in late 2023.\nThe UK Government awarded Carbon Catalyst three Carbon Dioxide Appraisal and Storage Licenses in August 2023, as the company began to build its portfolio. It has one site, Poseidon which encompasses the Lehman gas fields which is located in the southern North Sea sector on the UK Continental Shelf. It includes depleted gas reservoirs and saline aquifers in which the captured CO2 would be injected. Lehman is connected via pipeline to the PUK Bacton Terminal in the East Anglia region of England. The pipelines will make it possible to receive the CO2 at the terminal from various sources and send it offshore for injection.\nLast August, the companies reported Petrodec’s Erda rig was positioned at the site and specially for the injection of CO2. They undertook the successful recompletion of the H27 well to be used for the tests.\nIt is anticipated that Poseidon will target an initial annual injection capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2, scaling up to an ultimate annual injection rate of 40 million tonnes. With a potential 1 billion tonnes storage capacity, Poseidon is set to become one of the largest Carbon Capture & Storage projects in Northwest Europe. Carbon Catalyst highlights that it is ideally positioned to serve Greater London and the Southeast of England.\nFollowing the injection test, the Poseidon Joint Venture will progress towards a Final Investment Decision (FID) which it anticipates in 2027. Tentatively, the first commercial CO2 injection for permanent storage could begin in 2029. Based on its size, it is projected the project could run for 40 years.\nCarbon Catalyst plans to build out a portfolio of projects across the North Sea. In addition to the Poseidon licenses, the company has rights to a site, Orion, located further to the north near the Humber region of England, one of its historic industrial zones. Orion would have a capacity of 126 mt and is targeted for 2031.\nDenmark completed the world’s first injection test in 2023 at the INEOS-led pilot Project Greensand also located in the North Sea. Norway’s project Northern Lights has also completed testing and building of its terminals. The Norwegian project recently received its first two CO2 transport vessels and is undertaking commissioning before it starts commercial CCS operations.",

    "input": "\nTowage provider Svitzer is known for its global scale, but it's also making a name for itself in low-carbon towing. Together with customer Hoegh Autoliners, it recently rolled out its first very-low-carbon towing service, powered by carbon insetting from biofuel consumption across Svitzer's global fleet. To find out more about the ideas that power Svitzer's green transformation, TME spoke with head of decarbonization Gareth Prowse (left).\nTME: Could you tell us about your background and how you came to work in maritime decarbonization?\nI started with a marine biology degree and a PhD in organic pesticides and ecotoxicology. Following that, I ended up in the coatings industry doing environmental and human risk assessment for marine paint products, particularly anti-fouling solutions. As my career progressed and corporate social responsibility and sustainability became more important, I focused on how coatings can drive emissions reduction in vessels.\nThree years ago, I was fortunate enough to join Svitzer as head of decarbonization to set the strategy and direction of travel for our tug fleet. For years I was around the industry looking in, and it's been great to be inside the industry looking out for a change.\nWhat does it take to reduce emissions across a fleet of 450 tugs worldwide?\nSo I think it's a bit of a hackneyed statement these days, but it’s true that there's no silver bullet, no single solution that's really going to help you to achieve your goals when it comes to decarbonization. We need flexibility in our approach. We have to consider vessel age, equipment, operational profile, and regional limitations with respect to biofuel and shore power availability.\nOur strategy operates across three key themes: behavior, equipment, and fuel. Solutions range from slower transit speeds to shortening transit distances to using drop-in biofuels. Each region has different macroeconomic drivers and regulatory frameworks, which influence available solutions. For example, biofuels are widely available in Europe but less so in Australia, so we need different solutions for different regions.\nWhat's different about decarbonizing smaller vessels compared to large ships?\nThe scale is completely different. While large vessels might need hundreds or thousands of tons of fuel for a single bunkering, we might use just 40 tons of diesel every two weeks. With batteries and methanol, we might only need 100 tons of alternative fuel per year. This creates opportunities to work with suppliers who deal in smaller volumes that wouldn't be practical for large container ships.\nBut the challenges aren't necessarily easier - they're just different. We're caught in a gray area between large ship regulations and road transport solutions. For example, when people talk about ammonia as the future maritime fuel, that makes little sense for small vessels. We need solutions that fit our scale of operations and operational profiles. On top of that, scaling solutions across so many vessels is not without its challenges, and we don’t have a lot of space on board to accommodate some of the more cutting-edge options, like carbon capture systems.\nSpeaking of small-scaled solutions, can you tell us about the new Robert Allan / Svitzer TRAnsverse tug design?\nOur TRAnsverse tug design completely rethinks traditional tug operations, and will be way more efficient than the standard vessel that you can buy today. Instead of focusing on static bollard pull - the absolute power a tug can deliver when stationary - we've arranged the thrusters differently, with one at the front and one at the rear in combination with a unique tow connection, allowing the vessel to generate higher dynamic pulls while using less power. This makes the vessel more capable and more efficient than standard tug designs. Tow tank data, CFD modeling and time spent in the simulator, indicate that we get double-digit reductions in fuel consumption relative to the current fleet. We’re now seeing the same results from the real data generated by Svitzer Taurus, the first TRAnsverse vessel to go into operation.  Since the best liter of fuel is the liter you didn't use, we're super excited to see these operational results and really see what it can do.\nThis efficiency also makes it easier to implement battery power and other alternative fuel solutions where we may need to compromise on the energy density of the fuels we expect to use in the future. We're currently building a hybrid version, scheduled for service in Gothenburg in 2026. The vessel will be a fully electric platform, which will use battery power in combination with methanol range extenders to maximize the operational range of the vessel and ultimately the work it can carry out.\nWhat changes are you making across the existing fleet to boost efficiency?\nWe're seeing benefits from several approaches. We have five vessels using the SYDRIVE systems, where we can connect both thrusters to one engine through a gearbox system, optimizing fuel consumption. We've been working with battery-enabled vessels for around 10 years now, and as we renew those batteries, we're moving from traditional lithium-ion to newer chemistries like lithium iron phosphate (LFP), which offer better energy density and discharge rates. This allows us to go from 500kw per vessel to 1.3 MW per vessel. This should have a dramatic effect on fuel used during operation and will help us to sharpen how we operate vessels with batteries to maximize fuel efficiency.ds\nWe see significant opportunities for battery vessels across our fleet, but it is crucial that we that we can get access to shoreside charging infrastructure. We have built significant experience working with biofuels, both HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) and FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) at high blend levels (B80+) - that's a significant lever. And we can see methanol availability developing in the future. Essentially, it's about being ready to pull all of these levers in combination so we can make the most of them when they become available to us.\nThat said, we're not complacent about revisiting old challenges and old questions to see if we can do something different with available technologies, as well as the future stuff. We also need to make sure that it's sustainable in the way that we approach it, so we're always looking at the business case and which option is the lowest cost of abatement.\nCharging is often a challenge for battery-electric vessels - how do you work with ports to enable charging infrastructure?\nIt's early days, but we're finding that partnership models are key. Many ports want to support decarbonization but face financial and infrastructure constraints of their own. What we see in some of our locations is that the local grid is poor, or there isn't much of it at all. Sometimes just getting enough shore power to keep the lights on is challenging, because the financing to develop port infrastructure isn't there.\nPartnership models can help address the funding gap. We're seeing new companies emerge that will take on all the cost of installing shore-side equipment and then recover their costs through energy pricing, so everybody wins. That's one of the things that we've learned often - these things are not easy to solve on your own, but by talking with ports and figuring out what their pain points are, you can solve it together.\nThe challenge is that the tug sector is not as heavily regulated on emissions as larger vessels (over 5,000 gross tons), so there's less external pressure driving change. We're stuck in this gray area where the regulation doesn't drive the change, so investing comes with risk. Some of the solutions are expensive, and customers' willingness to pay for the cost difference is limited. This holds us back from progressing as fast as we may like, but we’re laying the groundwork for future opportunities when other stakeholders are ready to go.\nWhat role does crew behavior play in reducing emissions?\nOur \"Aim for 8\" program uses AIS tracking and machine learning to monitor vessel speeds and determine optimal speeds for different operations. While behavioral changes alone won't get us to our targets, they're crucial for change management. About 80% of our fuel is burned during the working phase, so we're particularly interested in optimizing operations during active towage. The program helps gamify fuel optimization and engages crews in finding solutions.\nThis engagement is especially important as we introduce new technologies like methanol-powered vessels and battery systems, which require new training and procedures. When crews understand why changes are necessary and see their role in the solution, they understand why we're asking them to do things differently.\nMore often than not, I find people are “on board” with decarbonization. They see it as important, and they want to drive the change. Mariners can be part of the solution. If you find a great idea and it works, we want to can scale that very quickly across 450 vessels - even if it isn’t all of them, we should be able to find enough to have an impact.\nWhat lessons have you learned that might help other operators?\nFirst, everyone needs to be aligned on looking for solutions and challenging existing practices. We use a pilot-scale-policy approach: test ideas on a small scale, and if they work, expand them. If it works on one tug, does it work on 10? If it works on 10, does it work on 20? And if it works everywhere, then you can just set it as a policy. This startup-style thinking helps us validate hypotheses about what works for our operations, customers, and ports.\nI think you really need to have that explorer mindset - you should never underestimate or ignore the fact that at the end of the day, you're in a competitive market and you have to serve customers. Focus on opportunities that reduce operational costs while providing environmental benefits. If you can eliminate the \"green premium,\" it's easier to make the business case for sustainability investments, so never lose sight of the return on investment - that CO2 reduction per dollar spent is really important.",

    "input": "\nLack of proficiency in the steering gear operation and change of control modes due to ambiguous procedures caused a containership to strike a navigation beacon while departing the Port of Melbourne in May 2023. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) released its report saying it found an incomplete understanding of how the steering gear operated among the ship’s engineers and ambiguous language in the company’s fleetwide procedures.\nThe boxship CMA CGM Puccini (6,300 TEU) was transiting the Yarra River in Melbourne, Australia on May 25, 2023, when it hit a navigational beacon. The initial investigation showed erratic behavior by the ship leading the ATSB to investigate why the steering gear was not performing correctly. The 2004-built ship, registered in Malta went off its intended track towards the edge of the navigable channel causing it to strike the beacon. The pilot aboard and the crew reported the rudder was responding erratically to helm orders.\nInvestigators pieced together the cause of the erratic steering, determining that it was due to a hydraulic bypass valve being left open by the crew after an AMSA port state control inspection the day before the incident. This resulted in the steering system hydraulics being incorrectly configured for normal operation.\nIt was established that with the hydraulic bypass valve being left open, the steering operated sufficiently well with minimal load on the rudder to pass pre-departure visual inspection. However, when the hydrodynamic loads on the rudder increased, with increasing ship’s speed and rudder movements, the open bypass valve allowed leakage of hydraulic oil and system pressure around the pump leading to erratic response of the rudder.\n\n\nCMA CGM Puccini severely damaged the beacon while departing Melbourne, Australia (ATSB)\n\nATSB determined that several officers on board were not as proficient with steering gear operation and change of control modes as was required by regulations. The situation was complicated by the fact that the steering terminology used on board and within the CMA CGM fleet was not clearly and explicitly defined. For the giant shipping liner, the official fleet terminology was “steering gear failure” and did not recognize common industry terms such as “emergency” and “local steering.”\n“The ship’s responsible officers had an incomplete understanding of how the steering gear operated, and therefore incorrectly configured the steering system hydraulics,” said Angus Mitchell Chief Commissioner. The report notes they were unaware of the dangers and further AMSA told the investigators manipulation of the steering hydraulics was not required for the demonstration during the inspection.\nThe ATSB final report on the incident shows that in the early hours of May 25, CMA CGM Puccini sailed from Swanson Dock in Melbourne after route safety checks under the conduct of a pilot and initially with two tugs in attendance. During the turn to leave Swanson Dock, the master and chief mate noticed that the rudder response appeared sluggish, as if only one steering pump was running (both pumps were operating). Neither raised their observations with each other, or the pilot, and there were no alarms to indicate a pump had stopped or other abnormal conditions.\nBy 0436, the ship was moving along the channel in Yarra River after both tugs had been dismissed and a few minutes later passed under the Westgate bridge at a speed of 6.6 knots when the helmsman reported that the rudder was not responding to the wheel. With its speed increasing, the ship moved further off course and tracked toward the western edge of the dredged navigable Yarra River channel striking navigation beacon 32. At the time, the ship’s speed was 7.7 knots.\nThe two tugs were nearby and returned, and helped control the ship’s erratic movement. The ship was then moved to Webb Dock for inspection. The ship sustained minor paint damage but the beacon was significantly damaged.\n“Any loss of steering can imperil the safety of the ship, and life at sea,” said Mitchell. “Unclear or ambiguous operating instructions and terminology should be corrected as soon as they are identified.”\nCMA CGM has taken measures to address the ambiguity by revising the steering guidance across its fleet. The liner’s fleetwide “steering gear failure” procedure has been amended and titled to become the “emergency steering procedure.”\nPorts Victoria has also updated the harbor master’s directions for Melbourne to enhance towage requirements while transiting the Yarra River. This now includes advice for the crews of ships that experience a main engine or steering failure while transiting port waters.\nTop photo byBahnfrendof CMA CGM departing Fremantle in 2020 (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

    "input": "Less than a month into the new Trump administration the U.S. conducted what it calls a “freedom of navigation” exercise sending two U.S. Navy vessels through the politically sensitive Taiwan Strait. Chinese spokespersons reacted angrily in what they perceived as a show of force and a possible signal of the new Trump administration's stance toward China.\nChina continues to aggressively press its reunification claims for the island saying it would only wait so long. Chinese nationalists have controlled the island since 1949 and the declaration of the People’s Republic of China. They reject the demands of the communists saying the island is independent, and its fate is controlled by the people.\nThe U.S. frequently sends vessels or aircraft through the strait. Media reports suggest the U.S. conducted transits eight times in 2024, with the last vessel going through the strait in October and a plane overflying the strait in November.\n“The transit occurred through a corridor in the Taiwan Strait that is beyond any coastal state’s territorial seas,” said Navy Commander Matthew Comer, a spokesperson at the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific Command reporting this week’s transit.\nThe U.S. Navy did not provide extensive details. It simply said a guided-missile destroyer, USSRalph Johnson, and a Pathfinder-class survey ship, USNSBowditch, made the transit between February 10 and 12.Ralph Johnson, assigned to the 7th Fleet and Indo-Pacific Command, had made a similar transit in August 2024.\n“Two U.S. naval vessels sailed through the Taiwan Strait from north to south starting on the 10th. During this period, ROC Armed Forces maintained full control over the surrounding sea and airspace, with the situation remaining normal,” reported the Ministry of National Defense, ROC (Taiwan). It regularly monitors the activity and reports that 30 PLA aircraft, 7 PLAN vessels, and 1 official ship were detected around Taiwan.\n“The U.S. action sends the wrong signals and increases security risks,” said a spokesperson for the PLA. It noted that its forces are on constant high alert while saying its navy and air force were deployed to “monitor the whole process of the U.S. vessels’ passage and effectively managed the situation.”\nIt is the second regional activity by the U.S. this month. The U.S. Navy highlighted a planned exercise involving the Royal Australian Navy and the UK Royal Navy sailing with a U.S. ship in the South China Sea. It took place between February 6 and 7 involving the guided-missile destroyer USSBenfold, RAN Hobart-class guided-missile destroyer HMASHobart, and RN River-class offshore patrol vessels HMSSpey.\n“Regular military engagements between the defense forces in the Indo-Pacific will help maintain regional security and stability,” said Commodore Jonathan Ley, Joint Force Maritime Component Commander for Australia’s Headquarters Joint Operations Command.\nAccording to the statement issued on the exercise, the three ships practiced their ability to exchange data using their tactical datalink systems, while the maneuvering exercise trained the crews’ ability to sail alongside each other in various conditions, improving the self-defense and communication capabilities of the three countries.\nChina regularly monitors these exercises. It issued a statement this week highlighting its own exercise saying it participated in a multi-country event organized by Pakistan.",

A brief video run by state news shows a delivery device emerging from below the water, then blowing off its nosecone and ejecting a folding-wing drone into the air.\nThe Iranian Ministry of Defense has officially unveiled the “Hadid 110,” an Autonomous Unmanned Drone with low radar and acoustic signatures. It is capable of target identification using AI-powered image recognition and can be launched from an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).pic.twitter.com/yTgkxto2vl\nThe ministry said that - unlike most drones - this munition is autonomous. Once launched, it operates without a man in the loop or human remote control, and finds and destroys its target using AI. This eliminates the need for a radio link to a control station, reducing vulnerability to electronic countermeasures.\nFor Western operators, AI-controlled lethal munitions are a matter of ethical concern, but the U.S. and many other nations are moving ahead rapidly in developing the technology - led by Ukraine and Russia. Both militaries have thousands of hours of combat video feed from drone operators on the front line in Ukraine, and that footage is key for training AI models how to identify real military targets.\nIran has an active and well-developed drone program, and has previously used long-range loitering munitions to attack shipping. It has even converted a small boxship into a \"drone carrier\" specifically for this purpose. its proxy force in Yemen - the Houthi rebel group - has used hundreds of shore-launched drones to attack Western merchant vessels and warships in the Red Sea. If practical in real-world use, Iran's new submarine-launched drone could begin its flight from a position closer to the target vessel, reducing the time available to detect and defeat it.\nIran's ministry of defense claims that the new AI-driven drone can be launched from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), increasing stealth and lowering risk to Iranian personnel. The underwater delivery device portrayed in Wednesday's video bears visual similarity to Iran's small torpedo-shaped AUV, evidence of which has been captured by U.S. forces in the Houthi conflict.",

    "input": "The crude oil tankerCordelia Moon(163,000 dwt) continues to have a string of bad luck. The vessel listed as owned by a company in the Seychelles and managed from India has been known to be in the Russian oil trade and that has put it in harm’s way more than once.\nThe tanker which was built in 2006 and is registered in Panama is now finding itself caught in the expanding reach of the U.S. sanctions imposed by the Biden administration against Russia. Bloomberg was first to report the tanker had arrived off India’s Vadinar Port on February 9 but was denied docking rights to unload. Four days later it is still sitting off India according to its AIS signal.\nThe vessel is laden with Russian oil loaded having departed Novorossiysk on January 10. According to the report on Bloomberg, there are approximately 1 million barrels aboard coming from one of the producers, Surgutneftegaz, which has been sanctioned by the United States.\nIndia has reportedly decided not to receive cargoes or ships that have been sanctioned. Bloomberg quotes India’s Oil Minister Pankaj Jain as saying the country had decided not to accept shipments from sanctioned companies if they were loaded after January 10. India had previously turned away Russian cargoes due to Western pressures and recently China’s Shandong Port Group also said it would not be accepting sanctioned tankers.\nBeing in the Russian oil trade has not been good for theCordelia Moon. The tanker was bound for Suez after having offloaded in India when the Houthis targeted the vessel on October 1. The tanker’s captain told the authorities that in the first wave of attacks, they spotted several splashes. The Houthis claimed a launch of eight missiles and one drone against the tanker. During the second attack, the vessel’s port ballast tank was punctured. The Houthis released spectacular images showing the moment of explosion on the ship’s hull.\nAfter completing repairs, the tanker was transiting the Bosphorus bound for Russia for its next cargo when it experienced engine troubles. The Bosporus was closed on December 26 by thedisabled ship. The Turkish authorities stepped in and towed it to an anchorage.\nIt is unclear what is going to happen with theCordelia Moon. The Indian Oil Minister told Bloomberg he was not aware of the case.\nToday, Reuters highlights that U.S. sanctions are beginning to have an increasing impact both on Russia and Iran. The sanctions they report are driving up costs. With fewer ships available Reuters says transport costs have risen for the oil. They report costs are being driven up for Indian and Chinese refineries which have been the largest customers for the oil.",

The crew of the fishing boat confirmed that the alleged pirates abandoned the vessel after stealing personal objects and two skiffs belonging to the dhow and as forces from the Atalanta operation approached the hijacked vessel.\n“The immediate presence of ATALANTA forces in the area, especially the helicopter, was decisive in the fishing vessel liberation,” writes EUNAVFOR Atalanta. It reports that naval and air assets were deployed in the area, conducted an intensive search, and succeeded in locating the dhow which had been reported as hijacked on February 9. The attack took place off Eyl, on the northern coast of the semi-autonomous Puntland region of Somalia.\nThey highlighted the involvement of a Japanese maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft in this operation along with the Combined Maritime Force. They also closely coordinated with the Somali forces and the Yemeni Coast Guard.\nTheAl Najmawas released when sailing very close to the Somali coast.  The incident is again being classified as an armed robbery at sea because the pirates kept the vessel in territorial waters. A similar case happened in December 2024 when a Chinese fishing vessel was also seized off Somalia.\n\n\n\nAfter the Yemeni vessel was released, the naval forces went aboard for a security check and to confirm the condition of the 12 individuals aboard the vessel. No one was reported injured during the incident.\nThe Atalanta boarding team also proceeded to collect all possible evidence of the incident, which is still under investigation. The operation in the past has been successful in apprehending some of the pirates and turning them over to the local authorities for prosecution. Last year, Atalanta apprehended six individuals during an incident. Since the operation began in 2009, it reports a total of 177 pirates have been transferred to competent authorities with 145 convicted.\nAfter the Yemeni dhow was freed, it reported a malfunction of its engine. The teams from Atalanta assisted the vessel.\nEUNAVOR Atalanta continues to warn vessels in the region to remain vigilant to any piracy-related events. The activity resumed in November 2023 after a long pause. Atalanta received reports of 23 incidents to the end of 2024. It, however, noted in previous reports that there were an unknown number of unreported/unconfirmed incidents involving dhows and smaller vessels.",

    "input": "Spire Global reported it has filed a lawsuit against Kpler for a failure to close the acquisition of its maritime group while also warning shareholders of potential debt problems if the deal is not completed. The suit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a declaratory judgment that Kpler breached its obligation and to proceed with the closing of the acquisition.\nKpler, a data and analytics platform,agreed to acquireSpire Maritime, a provider of satellite-powered data for real-time global vessel tracking, from Spire Global with a cash payment based upon an enterprise value of $233.5 million plus an additional $7.5 million for a 12-month transition service and data provision agreement. At the time, Kpler said the acquisition would improve its satellite AIS offering, significantly enhancing real-time visibility and analytics for the maritime and commodity markets. It was the third acquisition for Kpler following the 2023 deals for FleetMon and MarineTraffic.\nSpire Maritime built its niche with real-time capabilities drawing from the proprietary satellites enhanced with analytics. Spire emphasizes that the deal does not include any part of the company’s satellite network or operations.\n“The company believes all the conditions to closing contained in the purchase agreement have been satisfied,” Spire Global reports. It asserts that the “buyer has failed to consummate the closing.” Spire says it believes the failure to close is not consistent with the terms of the agreement which did not give an option to delay closing once all the conditions had been met.\n“Buyer (Kpler) has cited various reasons for declining to close which the company (Spire Global) has rejected,” it writes in the filing. The case was filed on February 10 but Spire warns that there is no assurance that the transaction “will be consummated on the terms contemplated or at all.”\nSpire Global had told shareholders it would use the proceeds to repay its debt. The strategy calls for focusing on its satellite network, technology, and infrastructure that serves the aviation, weather, and space services sectors.\nBefore entering into the purchase agreement with Kpler, Spire Global had also entered into a forbearance agreement with Blue Torch Finance so that its lenders would not exercise rights and remedies with respect to certain events of default. The forbearance expired on December 24, 2024, with Spire warning that the leaders have the right to accelerate and declare its debt due and payable.\n“If the transactions do not close, the company will not have sufficient cash to repay the balance of the loans outstanding,” warns Spire Global. The finance agreement was due to mature on June 13, 2026.\nGiven the delay in the closing with Kpler, Spire Global tells investors it intends to seek additional equity or debt financing.\nThe company is also in discussions with the New York Stock Exchange after having failed to file its financial report for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Spire Global explains it is in the process of restating its financial results for the 2022 and 2023 years and this is delaying the financial reports. The NYSE set February 19 as the deadline but Spire Global warns working with its outside accountants it does not expect to finalize the restatements until the end of February or in early March. Spire is discussing an extension with the NYSE until March 31 for the filing for the June 30, 2024 quarter.",

According to the group it was done to mark the approaching third anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to highlight the dangers of the shadow fleet.\nA team of fifteen activists from Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Poland, and Ukraine led the effort. It included at least one rigid high-speed boat which was successful in getting alongside the tanker while others displayed banners with now familiar messages such as “Oil Kills.” The team painted the word in large yellow letters on the side of the ship.\n\"We have painted \"RISK\" on the side of this tanker to draw attention to the huge environmental risk that all the old rusty Russian shadow tankers pose to nature and the marine environment. We cannot just sit and wait for an accident to happen that leaves our coasts and birds smeared in oil,\" said Danish Greenpeace activist Nicoline Hagen.\n\n\n\nThe targeted vessel is theProsperitya chemical tanker built in 2006 and operated for Russia’s Sovcomflot before the imposition of sanctions designed to disrupt the Russian oil trade.

    "input": "\nThe fire that destroyed the fishing vesselThree Girlsoff the coast of Maine in 2024 was likely caused by a spray of hydraulic oil, according to an investigation by the NTSB. The crew all abandoned ship and survived, in no small part because of timely and creative action by the vessel's master.\nOn August 11, theThree Girlswas under way in the Gulf of Maine on a routine trip, and had five crewmembers and a fishery observer aboard. At about 2050 hours, the crew was hauling in nets and running all hydraulic systems at full power when the captain smelled something burning. He checked the engine room and encountered thick smoke - so thick that he could not clearly see where the fire was coming from. He determined that the blaze was too serious to fight, and he ordered the crew to prepare to abandon ship.\nThe master went to the wheelhouse to make a mayday call. Though the smoke was chokingly thick, he managed to get the call out, and the Coast Guard launched response assets. Before leaving, the master also shut down the winch engine - but could not shut off the main engine or generator (which was still powering the vent fans for the engine room) because there were no remote shutoffs on board. The vessel also lacked ventilation louvers or remote shutoffs for the ventilation fans to cut off oxygen to the fire.\nTo prepare to abandon ship, the mate ran to the accommodations area to retrieve the vessel's immersion suits. He retrieved five suits before smoke and fire forced him out of the space, leaving the crew one suit short. The master instructed the rest of the crew to don the available suits, and he volunteered to abandon ship without wearing one.\nInstead, the crew inflated the life raft on deck, the master climbed in, and the crew pushed the raft down the trawler's stern ramp with the master in it - allowing him to stay dry. The rest of the crew followed down the ramp and into the water, then climbed into the life raft.\nAs a Coast Guard rescue helicopter approached, the master set off two  rocket flares to ensure that the raft was spotted quickly. He turned down an assist from a Good Samaritan fishing vessel, concerned that a transfer from the raft to the hard-hulled fishing boat would be risky for his crew in choppy conditions, and waited for a Coast Guard rescue boat from the cutterWilliam Chadwick.The cutter took all survivors aboard at 2314 hours, and no injuries were reported.\nThe fire burned through the night, destroying most of the engine room, accommodations and wheelhouse. The vessel stayed afloat, but the blaze was hot enough to warp the bulkheads and deckplates.Three Girlswas declared a total loss at a value of $1.3 million.\n\nCourtesy NTSB\nThe Coast Guard, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the NTSB inspected the boat after the fire. They found evidence that the blaze had been hottest near the hydraulic return oil filter housing, next to the winch engine. Based on the fire pattern, they believed that the likely cause was a spray of hydraulic oil from the filter housing, a hydraulic hose fitting or hose segment. A fine high-pressure hydraulic oil spray could have reached uninsulated parts of the winch engine's exhaust system, igniting and then burning through other nearby flammable materials. Most serious engine room fires begin with a spray of fuel or oil onto hot exhaust components.\n\"After an engine room fire ignites, it is imperative to remove the sources of available fuel and ventilation to the fire to prevent it from spreading,\" NTSB concluded. “Vessel designers, builders, owners, and operators are encouraged to install, regularly test, and have emergency drills that incorporate remote shutoffs for all machinery within these spaces to ensure the machinery can be remotely stopped from outside the space where it is situated. Additionally, to prevent the reintroduction of oxygen to the space, vessel designers and owners should ensure that the ventilation, both natural and forced draft, can be completely and remotely secured to all engine rooms.\"",

The shipbuilding has been working on its project as one of several that believe the new generation of small nuclear reactors will be the solution to maritime decarbonization.\nInterest in nuclear-powered propulsion for merchant ships dates back to the 1950s when it was seen to hold great promise. The United States was the first country to successfully build and operate a demonstration cargo-passenger ship, NS Savannah, which provided many insights into the industry but also showed the practical challenges of nuclear propulsion. Japan and Germany also tested concepts but Russia currently is the only country operating nuclear-powered commercial shipping with its icebreakers and one containership run by the state.\n\"Nuclear-powered vessels can be a game-changer in the current shipbuilding market, where carbon neutrality is emerging,\" said Patrick Ryan, Chief Technology Officer of ABS. The classification society has conducted studies for the U.S. on the future of nuclear propulsion. Ryan said, \"ABS and HD KSOE will contribute to accelerating the commercialization of marine nuclear technology in the global shipbuilding market.\"\nKSOE had proposed concepts and in 2024 obtained Approval in Principle from ABS for a design model applying Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. It is one of several concepts the industry is looking at for the next generation of nuclear-powered merchant ships.\n\"HD KSOE is strengthening cooperation not only with major classification societies but also with international regulatory bodies to establish international regulations necessary for the commercialization of nuclear-powered vessels,\" said Park Sangmin, Head of HD KSOE's Green Energy Research Lab. \"Starting with the land-based SMR reactor manufacturing project, we aim to develop a marine nuclear business model by 2030.\"\nSince February last year, HD KSOE has been accelerating related technology development through joint research on next-generation SMRs with TerraPower. In December, the company secured an order to manufacture the main equipment for TerraPower's Natrium reactor, which is being constructed in Wyoming.\nIn the maritime sector, KSOE unveiled an advanced design for a 15,000 TEU containership using SMR technology. The new design model features enhanced economic efficiency and safety by incorporating actual equipment and safety design concepts KSOE reports.\nHD KSOE has also optimized the space previously occupied by large engine room equipment to accommodate additional containers, enhancing the economic efficiency of the design concept. The company has also applied a marine radiation shielding system using a double-tank method with stainless steel and a coolant based on light water to ensure safety. The shipbuilder announced that in collaboration with global energy technology company Baker Hughes, they have applied a supercritical carbon dioxide-based propulsion system, which would improve thermal efficiency by approximately five percent compared to existing steam-based propulsion systems.\nHD KSOE plans to establish a marine nuclear demonstration facility at its Future Technology Test Center in Yongin, South Korea to verify safety designs.\nThe company is committed to advancing the design concepts. HD Hyundai’s business strategy for the shipbuilding operation focuses on advanced technologies, green shipping, and automation. Using this approach it looks to maintain leadership in the high-value vessel segment of the shipbuilding market.",

    "input": "Meyer Turku one of the handful of shipyards in the world with the expertise to build large cruise ships announced the appointment of the former CEO of Wärtsilä Jakko Eskola to lead the shipbuilder. Eskola has more than 20 years of experience before retiring from Wärtsilä in 2021 and held leadership positions at other Finnish companies including Cargotec, Kalmar, Suominen, and Varma, and he holds a Master of Science in Engineering.\n“By handing over the chairmanship of the board to Jaakko Eskola, we are once again sending a strong signal of our commitment to Turku Shipyard, in which we as a family have invested heavily for over ten years,” said Bernard Meyer.\nHe becomes chairman as the shipyard continues a solid orderbook with Royal Caribbean International but also looks to attract new projects. A long-term relationship with TUI’s Mein Schiff Cruises came to an end in 2024 when the yard deliveredMein Shiff 7. Carnival Corporation built four of its large LNG-fueled cruise ships at Turku but the latest orders went to the sister yard, Meyer Werft, in Germany.\nMeyer Turku is currently building the second of Royal Caribbean International’s mega cruise ships,Star of the Seas, which at 250,000 gross tons will be the largest cruise ship in the world. It is due to enter service later this year. Work has also begun on the third cruise ship of the class, rumored to be namedLegend of the Seas, with the first blocks lowered into the dry dock in October 2024. The ship is due for delivery in 2026. Royal Caribbean also ordered a fourth vessel of the class for delivery in 2027 and took options to build a fifth and sixth Icon Class ship.\nThe yard is also building two new Turva class patrol vessels for the Finnish Border Guard. The first will be delivered in 2025 and the second in 2026.\nMeyer took ownership of the Turku shipyard in 2014 from STX Europe and the following year increased to 100 percent ownership. The yard trades its origins to 1737 and came to fame in the 1960s till 1990 as part of the Wärtsilä shipbuilder along with the facility in Helsinki. Historically, it built cruise ships including the first in the modern cruise industry for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, car-passenger ferries, and special vessels including icebreakers. It encountered financial difficulties in the 1990s. Meyer recently had to cede ownership of its yard in Germany as part of a rescue package from the German state.\n“We have implemented several measures to turn our operations profitable again,” said Tim Meyer, CEO of Meyer Turku. “We have developed our organization, streamlined our processes, implemented a new enterprise resource planning system, and launched a development program.” While the yard delivered theIcon of the Seasin November 2023 as the world’s largest cruise ship, reports indicate as the lead of the class the company lost money on the construction due to the complex nature of the project.\nEskola joined Wärtsilä in 1998 with a background in international projects and corporate finance. He advanced at the company becoming President of Wärtsilä Marine Solutions and as of November 1, 2015, CEO and President of the company. Eskola was replaced in the spring of 2021 by Håkan Agnevall but continued as a senior advisor to the board and executive team until retiring on June 30, 2021.\nTom Johnstone, Chairman of the Board of Wärtsilä Corporation, credited Eskola with developing Wärtsilä into a smart technology company for the marine and energy markets.",

Australia is moving to increase its influence in the region to counter China and today China responded angrily after an incident in the air over the South China Sea where China says Australia “deliberately infringed upon China’s rights and interest.”\n“We urge Australia to abandon its fantasy of speculation and adventure, strictly restrain the actions of its frontline naval and air forces, and not be willing to be a follower and thug, stirring up trouble in the South China Sea and harming others and itself,” said Defense Ministry Spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang answers reporters' questions.\nThe exchange of words came after Australia yesterday expressed its concerns following what it called “an unsafe and unprofessional interaction,” between a Chinese plane and a Royal Australian Air Force maritime patrol aircraft. Australia contends for decades it has undertaken maritime surveillance activities in the region over the South China Sea, but on Tuesday, February 11 a Chinese aircraft encroached and released flares close to its aircraft.\n“Australia expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a safe and professional manner,” said the Australian Government Department of Defence. Other nations including the Philippines, which is dealing with its own assertions of Chinese expansionism, quickly responded also expressing concern over the incident.\nChina responded saying Australia “complained first and spread false narratives.” Zhang asserted that the Australian aircraft had “ignored the main road in the South Chian Sea,” and intruded into Chinese airspace.\n\n\nKimbe Port, West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea\n\nThe Albanese government has been working to reign in China to protect Australian interests. At the end of last week, it was announced that the government through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific would be providing loans to the Government of Papua New Guinea for a port infrastructure upgrade program. Speculation is that the step was taken to block attempts by China to lead the port upgrades. China has been currying favor and increasing influence through its port projects worldwide, including the operations of terminals at the Panama Canal which led to Donald Trump’s assertions China is now running the Panama Canal.\nAustralia is providing an A$95.7 million (US$61 million) loan which will support the upgrade of Kimbe Port in West New Britain Province. The port plays a critical role in trade handling 90 percent of the palm oil trade in the Province, which is one of the country’s largest exports. The work is scheduled to begin in early 2025 and conclude in 2026, and it will increase resilience against climate impacts and enhance freight services.\n“The project reinforces Australia’s commitment to supporting PNG’s economic growth and regional connectivity and will improve infrastructure reliability, strengthen supply chain efficiency, improve connectivity, and boost local economic opportunities,” said Australian officials announcing the project.\nThe Kimbe Port project is the first of five major upgrades Australia is supporting in Papua New Guinea, with Oro Bay, Daru, the Lae Tidal Basin, and Kavieng also set to benefit from improved port facilities. The project to upgrade ports across Papua New Guinea is expected to cost A$621.4 million (US$395 million).",

The Georgia Port Authority has been investing in the facilities after deciding to concentrate RoRo volumes in Brunswick while Savannah becomes devoted to container handling.\nDuring a State of the Port event on Wednesday, Georgia Ports President and CEO Griff Lynch highlighted the growth of the Colonel’s Island Terminal reporting it handled more than 2 million tons of Roll-on/Roll-off cargo in 2024. Brunswick achieved a record year, handling 901,912 units of autos and heavy equipment in 2024 with autos up 13.3 percent and heavy equipment up 160 percent. Brunswick also took the top spot in the nation at 600,000 tons for RoRo exports.\nThe operations in Georgia have been expanding rapidly in part due to the increased investment by car manufacturers in facilities in Georgia and the Southeast. The Port of Baltimore had long dominated the U.S. market for RoRo volumes. In 2023, Baltimore handled a record 765,019 tons up 42 percent. That consisted of approximately 847,000 cars and light trucks.\nBaltimore’s 2024 volume was of course impacted by the harbor being closed for weeks after the containershipDalidestroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge in late March. Georgia became the destination for vehicle carriers that were diverting from Baltimore. The Georgia Ports Authority handled 80,600 units of RoRo cargo in April 2024, an increase of more than 44 percent or 24,760 units versus April 2023. Approximately 9,000 import vehicles and 1,000 high/heavy equipment they reported had been diverted from the Port of Baltimore.\nAcross-the-board improvements in our shipping channel, berths, rail capacity, storage, and processing capacity will help ensure that as their volumes grow, our customers will continue to enjoy world-class service and make long-term gains in their business,” said GPA Board Chairman Kent Fountain.\nGPA highlights that $262 million in improvements at the Port of Brunswick were completed in 2024, adding new warehousing and processing space, as well as 122 acres of RoRo cargo storage. Construction has also started on a new railyard on Colonel’s Island, which will increase the port’s capacity to export vehicles arriving by rail.\nPhase I of the new railyard will increase the port’s annual rail capacity from approximately 150,000 autos to more than 340,000 by mid-2025. Phase II will bring annual rail capacity to 590,000 units, greater than three times the current capacity. More than 90 percent of vehicles moving by rail in Brunswick are U.S.-made exports.\nSeparately, construction on a fourth RoRo berth is in the planning stages and is expected to start in the summer of 2025. The new berth should be complete in 2027 and will more efficiently accommodate vessels carrying 10,800+ car equivalent units (CEU).\nPort officials highlight that one of the challenges they need to plan for is the increase in the size of the vessels and their capacity. Wallenius Wilhelmsen, which signed a 20-year agreement with the GPA in April 2024, reported in November that it was adjusting its orderbook. The company has a total of 14 Shaper class vessels on order, eight of which with a capacity of 11,700 CEU and six with a capacity of 9,300 CEU vessels.\nBrunswick the GPA highlights has become a center of excellence for RoRo. They highlight the future berth, processing and land, connectivity, and harbor modifications all designed to support growth in the sector.",

    "input": "\nA Dutch project contributing to the development of autonomous navigation continues to make progress. By 2023 it had developed critical data and demonstrated its concepts with a Damen patrol boat, and now the vessel is being upgraded for the next round of testing in the summer of 2025.\nKnown as the Fieldlab Autonomous Sailing Technology (F.A.S.T.) project, it is working with a Damen Stan Patrol 900 patrol boat at its core, as it works to lay the foundation for groundbreaking developments in autonomous ship technology. The boat is 8.6 meters (28 feet in length) and has an operating speed of 15 knots and a top speed of 21 knots.\nThe organizers highlight the ability to increase efficient, sustainable operations while increasing safety through autonomous operations. Critically they also point to the potential to help alleviate crew shortages.\nCommenting on what makes the project unique, Eef Uittenbogaard, project manager at Alewijnse said,“It’s the combination of innovation, close collaboration with the client, and the speed at which we adapt. This is truly a ‘fast’ project. As a company, we are contributing to progressive, rapid developments that will benefit not only the maritime industry but also the world.”\nAlewijnse, a systems integrator that develops tailored electrical and automation solutions is one of the partners in the project. The project involves collaboration with Damen Naval, the Province of Zeeland, the Municipality of Vlissingen, the HZ University of Applied Sciences, TU Delft, and other companies. Together the companies report they will lay the groundwork for autonomous sailing using a remotely operated vessel at the testbed in the Port of Vlissingen.\n\n\nDuring a prior phase of the testing (Alewijnse)\n\nThe main test bed is the Damen Stan Patrol 900, a 1990-built polycat. The test vessel is currently undergoing a transformation, with its two diesel engines being replaced with slightly more powerful electric motors. The boat will also be equipped with cameras, sensors, radar, Lidar, GPS, and wind and speed measurement instruments. These sensors will replace the traditional eyes and ears of a helmsman.\n“As a co-creator, Alewijnse is excited to contribute to the electrical scope of the project,” said Uittenbogaard. “With our 135 years of expertise and experience, we can collaborate with Damen and provide the complete package, from engineering and panel construction to the efficient placement of electrical components for propulsion and energy supply.”\nAccording to the companies participating in the project, it is just the beginning, with more ambitious programs designed to apply the technology to much larger ships to follow.",

Plans call for the liner to depart Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Monday, February 17, to be towed to Mobile, Alabama.\nAfter numerous delays, tugs and crews handled the nearly 1,000-foot liner timed to the midday high tide on the Delaware River. After having been at Pier 82 since 1996, the lines were released and tugs diagonalized her across the slipway moving the stern first and then the bow. She was resecured to Pier 80 on the north side of the slipway where she will remain until Monday, February 17. Reports are that there is a final planning meeting on Saturday to prepare for the momentous tow.\nMonday morning, tugboats will maneuver the ssUnited Statesout into the Delaware River channel and then proceed with the tow down river at low tide at approximately 11:18 a.m. (local time). The ship will pass under various roadway bridges, including the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322), and the Delaware Memorial Bridge (I-295) along her route. The Delaware River Port Authority has said it will be coordinating bridge closures as she passes underneath, but because it is a federal holiday road traffic is expected to be lighter than a normal workday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SS United States Conservancy which continues to work with the liner’s new owners, Okaloosa County, Florida, is following the move. They plan to livestream the tow under the Walt Whitman Bridge on theirFacebook page.\nFor the tow, she will be secure to a more powerful tug. According to the tow plan, it is the Vinik No. 6, a twin screw tug, rated at 5,700 horsepower. Okaloosa has said the tow plan will be adjusted utilizing real-time route planning, which will adjust the ship's course every six hours based on weather and currents. They plan to post a track of the ship's courseonline.\nThe tow is expected to require approximately 14 days. When she reaches Mobile, she will be docked at the Modern American Repair & Recycling Services facility where the remediation work will proceed. Lose paint, PCBs, and other contaminants need to be removed as well as the fuel in her tanks. All the windows and portholes are to be removed and her funnels and radar mast dismantled and handed to the Conservancy which will explore incorporating them into a visitor’s center and museum to be in the Destin-Fort Walton Beach area. The plan says it will require a year to prepare the liner for her reefing.\n\n\n\nIn a farewell gesture to Philadelphia, a group of volunteers went aboard yesterday afternoon and positioned lights on the ship. At dark, her bridge front was illuminated in green in honor of the Philadelphia Eagles football team that last weekend won the Superbowl. The city was hosting a victory celebration for the team today.\nA few loyal fans of the liner were at the fence line of the pier today to watch as she began her final trip. It comes 75 years after the keel was laid for the liner in the dry dock at Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company. In 1952, at an average speed of 36 knots, the ssUnited Statesbecame the last liner to capture the speed record for an Atlantic crossing. She remained in commercial passenger service, and in later years also did a few pleasure cruises, before being retired in 1969. She passed through a succession of owners between 1980 and 2024, with plans to resume her service or to convert her to a static attraction.\nAfter owning the ship since February 2011, the Conservancy relinquished ownership after becoming involved in a dispute with the operators of the pier. A court ordered the ship to vacate the pier. Unable to relocate the ship, the non-profit sold it to Okaloosa Country in October 2024 for $1 million as part of a $10 million plan to turn the famous ship into the world’s largest man-made reef.",

Despite strong demand in the LNG carrier segment, the company believes there are stronger opportunities in the FLNG (floating liquefied natural gas) as it redirects all of its focus to that segment.\nThe sale price for the vessel which was built in 2003, is $24 million before transaction-related expenses and it is unencumbered.Golar Arctichas a capacity of 140,000 cbm and is a stream turbine vessel, a growing rarity in the industry. The vessel reportedly offloaded its last cargo in Taichung, Taiwan over a week ago and its AIS signal shows it is anchored off Malacca City, Malaysia awaiting orders. Golar reports the transaction is expected to close, and the vessel is to be handed over to its new owner, within Q1 2025.\nGolar, which started its life at Gotaas Larsen in 1946 was an early entrant into the LNG market after having made investments in other segments including an earlier investor in the cruise ship business. Gotaas Larsen in the 1960s acquired Eastern Steamship Lines, an early cruise pioneer from Miami, and was the third investor joining Wilhelmsen and Skaugen in Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines.\nGotaas-Larsen entered the LNG shipping market, ordering the LNG carrierHilliin 1970 and became Golar LNG in 2001. It then embarked on its first significant LNG carrier newbuilding program. Efforts to develop its first FLNG began a decade later in 2012 and by 2024 they reported the company was down to just two gas carriers.\n\n\nFuji LNG arriving in China to begin conversion into an FLNG (Morten Skjong)\n\n“The sale of theGolar Arcticmarks the conclusion of Golar’s planned exit from the LNG shipping segment, 50 years after taking delivery of our first LNG carrier in 1975. Over the last 50 years LNG shipping has been the foundation for Golar’s pioneering maritime LNG infrastructure advances, including FSRUs and FLNGs,” said Golar CEO Karl Fredrik Staubo.\nThe company’s other remaining LNG carrier,Fuji LNG(115,000 cbm) was acquired in 2023 with the intent to convert the ship. She discharged her final cargo as an LNG carrier in January 2025. Chief Technical Officer at Golar LNG, Morten Skjong, reports she will be the donor vessel for Golar LNG's third FLNG conversion (the Mk II FLNG). She arrived earlier today at Yantai CIMC Raffles Offshore to start the conversion. They expect she will be available starting in Q4 2027 becoming the company’s fourth FLNG.\n“Golar’s transition into a focused FLNG infrastructure company is now complete. We look forward to expanding our market-leading FLNG position,” said Karl Fredrik Staubo.\nIn January 2025, Golar LNG also reported it had entered into an agreement to sell its shares in Avenir LNG to Stolt-Nielsen Gas for approximately $40 million. Golar along with Stolt Nielsen and Höegh built Avenir LNG into one of the largest small-scale LNG shipping companies. Avenir has a fleet of five LNG bunker/supply ships with two more under construction. The sale was a further part of Golar LNG's refocusing to its FLNG business.\n\nTop photo byKees Tornof Golar Arctic in 2019 -CC BY-SA 2.0",

The company celebrating the naming of its newest containershipONE Sparkle(138,000 dwt) which it reports is the first owned and operated newbuild for the company.\n\"The naming of ONE Sparkle represents another important milestone for ONE,” said Jeremy Nixon, CEO. “This vessel is our first owned newbuilding, and it also showcases our commitment to sustainable shipping with its innovative design and alternative fuel capabilities. As we expand our owned fleet, these advanced vessels will play a crucial role in meeting our environmental targets while enhancing our service reliability.\"\nThe company was established in 2017 through the integration of the container operations of K-Line, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), and NYK Group. The first sailing was in 2018 and by its fifth anniversary, the company was highlighting had more than 165 services connecting 120 countries. Today, the fleet is up to 255 ships with a capacity of 1.97 million TEU placing ONE sixth on Alphaliner’s ranking of the largest carriers.\nNixon in 2022 mapped out the second stage of growth for the company reporting plans to invest $20 billion by 2030. He said the time had come for the company to begin placing its own orders for newbuilds and to own its ships. By 2030, Nixon said that they would contract for a total capacity of 1.2 million TEU, but approximately half of that would be replacements for existing capacity. AlphaLiner calculates the company currently has 47 vessels on order representing 610,558 TEU of capacity. In 2023, ONE also joined with the investment group as Seaspan was taken private. They operate OneSea Solutions as the ship management company which is jointly owned by ONE and Seaspan.\nONE Sparklewas part of an order for new ships being built by HD Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea and a parallel order placed with Nihon in Japan. Nixon said today during the naming for the new ship that it is part of a series of 20 large ammonia/methanol-ready vessels that will be built in Korea and Japan and scheduled for delivery in 2025 and 2026.\nONE Sparklehas a capacity of approximately 13,800 TEU and it is 1,00 feet (335 meters) in length. Among the advanced environmental features is the design enabling the future conversion to methanol or ammonia as its fuel. The hull design was also optimized for improved energy efficiency and it is outfitted with the latest energy-saving devices. Integrated smart technology will ensure optimal vessel performance. It also has the capability to employ shore power. The ship was classed by ABS and is registered in Singapore.\nThe new vessel is due to head out on its final sea trials in a week before her handover. Once delivered, ONE says the vessel will strengthen its competitive position in the service it is deployed to, and showcase the company’s commitment to sustainable shipping practices.\nThe company continues to grow its operations announcing new routes trans-Atlantic as well as Far East to South America and using ports such as Vietnam. It is also set to take a major role in the reformulated Premier Alliance that went effective this month. The cooperation between ONE, HMM, and Yang Ming is going it alone after Hapag-Lloyd withdrew to start its new cooperation with Maersk.",

The goal is to create a system that is more environmentally friendly and the project also highlights it has the potential for automation.\nMitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), MOL Drybulk, and Tsuneishi Shipbuilding cooperated for the test which was performed on one of MOL Drybulk’s bulkers while at the shipyard. Furukawa Electric is developing the system for rust and coating removal, leveraging the technology it cultivated in industrial lasers. MOL reports that by applying the metal processing technology developed by Furukawa for processes such as welding, cutting, and surface treatment, the goal is the optimization of irradiation conditions for rust and paint removal in the undercoating of ships.\nFurukawa Electric, with the cooperation of MOL and MOL Drybulk, has been developing since 2021 a rust and coating removal system for onboard maintenance, utilizing the surface treatment solution based on \"InfraLaser\" technology cultivated in industrial lasers. Additionally, since 2022, Furukawa Electric and Tsuneishi Shipbuilding have also been conducting demonstration experiments to apply the same system to ship repairs.\n\n\nClose up of the removal test as the companies also study automation of the task (MOL)\n\nDuring ship repairs, rust and coatings are removed for hull inspection and repainting. However, the current sandblasting method, which removes rust and coatings by blasting abrasive materials against the surface, scatters waste materials and paint as debris, necessitating recovery efforts. Due to increased environmental laws, many shipyards are also required to erect barriers or coverings to limit the area where the debris travels.\nBy replacing this with a laser-blasting method, the companies believe it will generate minimal waste, dust, and noise. They expect to reduce environmental impact and improve occupational health, especially in shipyards.\nHaving completed the successful field trial of the \"Infralaser\" rust and coating removal system the companies report they will accelerate the development of an innovative laser application system for ship repair that can replace the conventional sandblasting method for rust and paint removal and coatings.\nThey will also continue to study the automation of the system by taking advantage of the laser's zero reaction force, aiming to achieve labor savings and automate the ship maintenance and repair process.",

    "input": "\nThe cruise market in India is continuing to grow drawing increased attention from multiple companies. Mostly it has been a port of call for cruise ships transiting the Indian Ocean, but it has also begun to develop a domestic cruise business.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has designated cruise tourism as a priority sector. Cordelia Cruises which is the sole firm active in the market currently says India’s cruise industry is poised to substantially boost both domestic and international tourism while generating significant employment opportunities for the nation’s youth. Having launched operations in 2021, the company reports it has carried over 530,000 passengers and is operating close to its full capacity.\nThe board of the parent company, Waterways Leisure Tourism, reports that it has decided to pursue expansion including fundraising efforts. The group is targeting a funding of Rs. 800 crores ($92 million) possibly through an initial public offer.\nCordelia was the latest effort to start a domestic Indian cruise line following a similar effort that started before the pandemic known as Jalesh Cruises. The firm did not survive the pause in operations during the pandemic and its sole ship theKarnika(ex.Pacific Jewel,Crown Princessbuilt in 1990) was sold for scrap. The assets of the company wereacquiredby Waterways.\nThe company operates a sole cruise ship, theEmpress(48,500 gross tons) with accommodations for 1,840 passengers. When the ship was introduced in 1990 as theNordic Empressshe was considered pioneering by incorporating mega-ship designs into a smaller vessel. She operated for Royal Caribbean International on short cruises later becoming theEmpress of the Seasand for a time operating for the company’s Spanish company Pullmantur as theEmpress. She was sold to lower costs during the pandemic.\nCordelia reports it will be in the market for two secondhand cruise ships each with a capacity of approximately 2,000 passengers.\n“We are in discussions with major cruise companies from the U.S. and Europe who are looking to divest ownership of their smaller ships with passenger capacities ranging between 2,000 to 2,500 guests per ship, as they transition to newer vessels with capacities of 5,000-7,000 guests,” said Jurgen Bailom, President & CEO of Cordelia Cruises.\nWhen asked if Cordelia has already closed a deal for the ship purchase, Bailom responded, “We have multiple offers from existing cruise lines as they upgrade their fleets with larger ships. Given the current market dynamics, it is an opportune time for us to expand our fleet.”\nResorts World Cruises which was started by Genting after Star Cruises and Dream Cruises collapsed, also reports it is planning to enter the Indian cruise market. Schedules were announced for theResorts World One(75,000 gross tons exSuperStar Virgo) to offer cruises from Mumbai between March and June 2025. The company highlighted that it would be tailoring its product to the Indian market with a variety of offerings and entertainment, thematic cruises, and authentic cuisines from around the world, including certified Indian vegetarian, Jain, and halal food. The launch however was deferred till 2026 due to a fleet redeployment as Resorts World Cruises adds its third cruise ship to the fleet this spring.\nOther cruise lines including Costa have occasionally based a ship for short periods in India working with local companies to market the cruises. With India’s emerging middle class and the efforts by Prime Minister Modi to expand India’s economy, cruising stands to benefit and is poised to realize the developing opportunities.",

    "input": "\nWith Russia’s footprint in the Mediterranean facing uncertainty, the deal for a naval base in Sudan has reached a new milestone. Last week, Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) foreign minister Ali Youssef Ahmed al-Sharif was in Moscow, where he met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Although the negotiations for the base were not part of the meeting, Ali Sharif said there was no disagreement on the deal, assuming that the SAF can win or reach a stalemate in its two-year civil war against the breakaway Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n“There was a deal which was signed and there are no obstacles. We are in complete agreement,” said Sharif.\nRussia signed an agreement with the government of Sudan for the naval base under the regime of former dictator Omar al- Bashir, who was ousted in a coup by his former generals back in 2019, leading eventually to the SAF’s rule over most of the country. In 2021, SAF leaders said that the government would review the deal to align with the country’s interests.\nThe ongoing civil war in Sudan since 2023 has stalled progress on the base deal. A logistical base for Russia is Sudan - the first in Africa - could provide Moscow with desperately-needed access to a regional basing arrangement. Russia’s 50-year foothold in the Mediterranean at the port of Tartus, Syria, is endangered and may already be lost. The setbacks facing the Russian Mediterranean flotilla has likely sent Moscow on an overdrive for an alternative base. It remains to be seen if Eastern Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar or the government of Algeria might offer a base to the Russian Mediterranean fleet, or if such a basing arrangement could be a suitable replacement for Tartus.\nEither way, the willingness of Sudan to offer Russia a base is still good news for Moscow. As a logistics support point for the Russian navy, the Port of Sudan could easily accommodate four warships, including nuclear-powered ones. Some analysts believe that the base would restore Russia’s permanent presence in the Indian Ocean. Russia lost this privilege at the end of the Cold War: the Soviet-era naval base in Berbera, Somalia closed in 1997, and the Nokra base in Eritrea (then part of Ethiopia) closed in 1991.\nBut given its location, the Port of Sudan base would have serious limitations as an alternative launch pad for reconstituting Russia’s Mediterranean Flotilla.\n“The logistical constraints of negotiating Suez Canal, particularly in cases of requiring emergency maintenance, are significant. Operationally, canal transits also clearly signpost ship movements to adversaries,” argue naval experts Edward Black and Sidharth Kaushal.",

    "input": "MAIB has published its final accident investigation report into the capsizing and foundering of stern trawlerNjord, which went down about 50 nautical miles north-east of Peterhead, Scotland in 2022. MAIB found that post-construction modifications had reduced the vessel's initial stability, and that a large haul of fish was enough to capsize the vessel.\nOn March 5, 2022, the 27-meterNjorddeparted Peterhead to fish in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, with a crew of eight on board. In the early hours of the following morning,Njordarrived at a position about 130 nautical miles north-east of Peterhead and put out its fishing net over a gas pipeline from the Sleipner A gas platform. The vessel towed its net along the pipeline until 1100, when the net was hauled in. The catch was the largest the crew had ever seen, the equivalent of roughly 30 tonnes of fish.\nNjordwas a 1992-built trawler with a setup not commonly found in high-seas fisheries. Her net reels were at the stern, but recovery of the catch occurred on the starboard bow. The cod end had to be hauled up over the starboard rail using a winch and lifting frame, and then the fish were fed into a hatch in the foredeck for processing.\nCourtesy MAIB\nThis time around, the catch was 30 times as abundant as usual. The crew towed the cod end around to the starboard side using a power block, then used a loop of line and a winch to haul up about one tonne of fish at a time into the hopper on the foredeck. After about ten lifts and ten tonnes in the hopper, theNjordhad a list of about 10-15 degrees. The crew went below to start processing the catch.\nWithin an hour, they had only processed and stowed about three tonnes of the fish, and the skipper wanted to move more quickly. He ordered them to haul up more of the catch and fill the hopper again. Two more lifts went well enough, but on the third lift, the vessel took on a heavy list from the weight of the fish hanging from the net reel and the winch on the bow.\nAs the list increased, theNjordbegan to downflood, and the situation changed very rapidly. Despite efforts to cut loose the net, theNjordslowly rolled over to starboard, and the crew escaped by climbing out onto the port side of the hull and walking up onto the upturned keel. For floatation, they had only one life ring for eight people, and no immersion suits. None of the life rafts popped to the surface; it is likely that they were all caught in the vessel's rigging and deck gear.\nThe vessel's EPIRB self-activated at about 1340, and the Norwegian Coast Guard launched a response. A SAR helicopter dispatched from the Johan Sverdrup oil platform arrived on scene at about 1416 and stood by as the OSVOlympic Challengerapproached to conduct a surface rescue. As theChallengerprepared to launch its fast rescue boat, theNjordsuddenly began to sink from beneath the survivors' feet. Within moments, all eight fishermen were in the water: six who were hanging on to one lifering, and two who were attempting to swim to stay afloat.\nThe SAR helicopter crew deployed their rescue swimmer to try to save the two men who had nothing to hang onto. The first fisherman to be hoisted up was retrieved alive, though he was briefly unconscious and had ingested water and diesel. The second was pulled up six minutes later. By the time the rescue swimmer got to him, he had sunk below the surface, and he was retrieved in an unresponsive state. Despite medical attention he did not recover.\nThe SAR helicopter recovered one more survivor from the life ring group, then headed for shore; theOlympic Challenger'sfast rescue boat saved the last five survivors.\nIn 2021, before the casualty voyage, theNjordhad been modified with the addition of two prawn net reels and an icemaker towards the stern, but no evaluation was made of the effect on stability. MAIB reconstructed the vessel's stability based on the best available figures, and found that the vessel may have failed the test on one of seven standard loading conditions (though the findings were not definitive).\nAdditionally, MAIB found that progressive flooding began rapidly through an unapproved and undocumented drain pipe that had been installed through a watertight bulkhead on the starboard side. Assuming that the valve on the drain had been left open, modeling suggested that the passageway probably began flooding through the drain at about 17 degrees of inclination, and a load of about 4 to 7.5 tonnes on the net would have been enough to start the process.\n\"It is likely thatNjordwould not have capsized had the valve on the drain been closed, as it should have been, while the vessel was at sea,\" MAIB concluded.\nThat reduced downflooding angle, combined with the extreme luck of a 30-tonne catch, may have been enough to sink the ship - and the crew may have been willing to overlook the danger signs, especially in flat-calm surface conditions.\n\"It is likely that the new experience of such a large catch led the crew to perceiveNjord’sheavy listing as normal under the circumstances. A large catch meant significant remuneration for all of the crew as share fishermen, and their delight might have influenced their judgment of and consideration towards safety,\" wrote MAIB. \"Had the net been cut away immediately, and the additional fish not been added to the hopper, the vessel might have been saved.\"\nMAIB noted that the crew were incredibly lucky that the EPIRB had floated free. The captain did not manage to get off a VHF distress call before the capsizing, and if the EPIRB had not activated itself and reached the surface, it is likely that the entire crew would have perished in the cold water.",

    "input": "\nThe Russian container line FESCO is further expanding its Intra-Asia service to include a new port call in Pasir Gudang, Malaysia. This becomes the second port of call for FESCO in Malaysia.\nFESCO entered the Malaysian shipping scene almost six months ago, with a service at Port Klang connecting to the Vietnamese port of Ho Chi Minh City. The route is served once a week, with a transit time of three days between the ports.\nThe addition of Pasir Gudang will expand the geography of the FESCO Intra Asia Service (FIAS) between Malaysia and Vietnam, according to the company. The service is served by a 400 TEU containership from the FESCO fleet. The first departure from Pasir Gudang took place on February 8.\n“Pasir Gudang is one of the largest ports in Malaysia, which is literally next door to Singapore. Our team did a great job for FESCO to receive permission for cabotage transportation from the Malaysian authorities. On the very first voyage, we sent cargo not only from Pasir Gudang to Russia via our hub in Ho Chi Minh City, but also carried out domestic transportation between Malaysian ports,” said German Maslov, Vice President of FESCO’s Liner Logistics Division.\nMaslov added that FESCO is planning to expand FIAS to Thailand and also studying the possibility of adding a second vessel to the service. FESCO wants to develop FIAS as an Asian feeder line to deliver additional cargo volumes to Russia from markets such as Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India and Thailand.\nThe ramp-up of FESCO’s service in Southeast Asian countries follows the launch of a subsidiary enterprise, DBF Logistics Vietnam, back in December. Besides FIAS, the new company will ensure smooth operation of the FESCO Vietnam Direct Line, which connects Russia’s Far East Port of Vladivostok and Vietnam’s Haiphong and Ho Chi Minh City.\n“The container transportation market is actively developing between Russia and Vietnamese ports. We transported 25,700 TEU last year. Therefore, we essentially grew several times over in three years,” said FESCO’s Group President, Pyotr Ivanov.\nMeanwhile, as the West tightens economic sanctions against Russia, there is a noticeable drop in the amount of liquid cargo handled at Russian ports. Last week, the Russian Commercial Seaports Association reported that cargo handling in major ports fell by 1.6 percent year-on-year to 71.6 million tons in January. Liquid cargo transshipment fell 6.1 percent to 37.3 million tons, including 8.5 percent to 21.2 million tons of crude oil and 5.1 percent to 11.6 million tons of oil products. However, handling of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose 4.4 percent to 3.4 million tons.",

    "input": "The battle lines are being drawn for the next round of alternative fuel debate and the steps that will contribute to the IMO’s emission reduction goals. A group of NGOs, including the well-known T & E (European Federation for Transport and Environment), joined with major shipping lines including Hapag-Lloyd calling for the IMO to exclude biofuels from its list of green alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. They argue it would be unsustainable and could produce more harm than good.\nA study commissioned by T&E and conducted by Cerulogy reports that nearly a third of global shipping could run on biofuel in 2030 up from less than 1 percent today. They point out that while well intention in its original concept to reuse waste oil, the price advantage of biofuels could result in unsustainable demand.\nThe report concludes that waste biofuels will likely be able to cover just a small portion of shipping’s projected biofuel demand as their availability is limited. They highlight that major carriers including MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and CMA CGM have invested in the use of biofuels derived from used cooking oil and animal fats. However, with the supplies limited, they conclude that just 2.5 to 3 percent of shipping could run out of used cooking oil and animal fat biofuels by 2030.\nThe vast majority (60 percent) of biofuels they argue will have to come from palm and soy. This they theorize would put pressure on vegetable oil prices. They point to a doubling of the use of palm oil biofuels in the EU between 2010 and 2020 following the introduction of a law promoting biofuels in cars.\nCountries such as France, Norway, and the Netherlands, T&E notes, have already restricted or stopped using palm and soy biofuels domestically, while the EU itself has excluded the use of food crops from its flagship shipping fuels regulation (FuelEU). There was a large debate on the competition for food supplies if the oils were also to be used as biofuels.\n“As things stand the IMO risks doing more harm than good. Palm and soy biofuels are devastating for the climate and they take up vast amounts of land,” argues Constance Dijkstra, shipping manager at T&E. “Instead of creating new problems, the global shipping community must focus on green fuels made from hydrogen. Burning crops is never the answer.”\nThe report speculates that the fuel-intensive shipping industry would need vast amounts of farmland, possibly 34 million hectares in 2030 - the total area of Germany - to produce enough crops to meet the increased biofuel demand from the shipping industry. T&E argues this could have serious impacts on food supplies. Land that could be used for farming would need to be converted to growing biofuel crops while burning vegetable oil in ships will deprive supermarkets of a staple food item.\nThis poses a serious climate problem, warns T&E, as palm and soy are responsible for two to three times more carbon emissions than even the dirtiest shipping fuels today, once deforestation and land clearance are taken into account.\nThe release of the report coincides with the start of the Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG) in advance of the upcoming IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in April. The April session is a key step in designating the tactics the IMO will take to meet its goals for cutting shipping emissions.",

    "input": "\nThe Trump administration has signed off on permitting approvals for two major oil and gas export projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast: the Texas GulfLink offshore oil loading terminal, and the Commonwealth LNG plant in Louisiana. Both projects had been awaiting approval for years under the Biden administration.\nTexas GulfLink (TGL) is one of several proposed deepwater oil loading terminals on the Gulf Coast, all designed to carry vast quantities of U.S. crude to buyers overseas, primarily in East Asia. America's Gulf Coast seaports are too shallow to accommodate fully laden VLCCs, so to load an export cargo in Texas, the world's biggest tankers have to take on several smaller parcels from smaller tankers via reverse lightering. This adds to the cost of VLCC export and reduces competitiveness on long-haul trades to Asia - though VLCCs aren't needed for transatlantic deliveries to Europe, the destination that currently dominates the Gulf export trade, according to competing firm Enterprise Products Partners.\nIf built, TGL would be located about 30 miles off the coast of Brazos County, Texas. Sponsor Sentinel Midstream says that it is the \"only proposed offshore crude oil export terminal whose design complies with all current safe maneuvering guidelines for VLCCs at a [single point mooring].\" Like Enterprise Products Partners' Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT), TGL would facilitate more oil sales to Asian buyers, supporting U.S. jobs in E&P.\n\"Today, we are unleashing the full power of American energy,\" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy in announcing the Maritime Administration's approval for the TGL project. \"With this approval, we are increasing our energy revenue and unlocking our vast oil resources—not just for domestic security, but to dominate the global market.\"\nThe approval does not necessarily mean that TGL will be constructed immediately. The commercial picture for VLCC loading has changed, according to Enterprise Products Partners CEO Jim Teague; SPOT, which is pursuing the same client base, may be suspended soon if it cannot secure more customer interest in a cooling market for Texas-to-Asia oil shipping.\nLast week, the Department of Energy approved a gas export license for the 9.5 mtpa Commonwealth LNG plant in Louisiana, the first project licensed under the new administration. The Biden White House had frozen approvals for new LNG plants pending a review of greenhouse gas impacts, but Trump revoked the freeze on his first day in office. Commonwealth has been waiting for its export license longer than any other project.\n\"Today's actions demonstrate that President Trump is prioritizing the American energy industry, and we are both pleased and grateful to have achieved these important regulatory objectives,\" said Commonwealth CEO Farhad Ahrabi in a statement.",

After a strategic review of EUNAVFOR Aspides and its results, the council extended the mission till February 28, 2026, with an anticipated cost of over €17 million ($17.8 million).\nAspides was launched on February 8, 2024, as a defensive mission to protect shipping in the Red Sea, including the Bab al-Mandeb and the Gulf of Aden as well as a broader reach to the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, and the Strait of Hormuz. The EU set it up to protect shipping but did authorize it to return hostile fire compared to the U.S. operation which had a more offensive mandate to stop the Houthis’ actions.\nPatrols and protection missions commenced in February 2024 as well as supporting search and rescue and other operations. Aspides’ command reports that in its first year over 640 merchant ships were supported with over 370 receiving close protection escorts. Vessels are required to request assistance from the forces. Warships participating in the effort include French destroyers, the Italian destroyersCaio DuilioandFederico Martinengo, and the more recent addition of the Greek vessel Hydra. Other countries contributed staff to the effort which is under the command of Read Admiral Vasileios Gryparis of the Hellenic Navy.\nAs part of its defense of merchant shipping, Aspides reports it has destroyed four ballistic missiles, 18 UAVs, and 20 USV drones. A total of 50 seafarers were also rescued both from vessels damaged by the Houthis as well as from other marine incidents in the area. Aspides protected the salvage mission and the efforts to tow the burning takerSounionlast year.\nThe decision to extend the mission came despite the Houthis a month ago promising to participate in the Gaza ceasefire and no longer target international shipping. No hostilities have been reported since mid-January. The Houthis said they would continue to target ships associated with Israel and have threatened to resume the attacks if the ceasefire collapsed.\nThe Council also expanded the mission for Aspides to further ensure maritime situational awareness. It said that Aspides should be able to collect information on arms trafficking and shadow fleets. Aspides will be sharing this information with a range of international organizations to enhance coordinated law enforcement efforts.\n\n\nSome of the components seized by the Yemeni Coast Guard (US CENTCOM)\n\nU.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) reported last week that the legitimate government of Yemen and its Coast Guard was able to interdict a shipment of materials from Iran to the Houthis. The Yemen Coast Guard interdicted a dhow in the southern Red Sea that CENTCOM says was destined for Hodeidah port and reportedly originated in Iran.\nThe dhow had a 40-foot container containing qualitative military equipment, including cruise missiles' structures, jet engines used in cruise missiles and suicide drones, and reconnaissance drones, in addition to marine radars, a modern jamming system, and an advanced wireless communications system. It is the first interception reported by the Yemeni Coast Guard, but CENTCOM has reported several seizures in addition to its efforts to destroy stockpiles of weapons in Houthi warehouses.",

Efforts are coordinating with the owners of the vessel and a hired salvage contractor to survey the ship after the crew was rescued.\nTheMSC Baltic IIIblacked out and did not have time and distance to use its anchor to prevent the ship from going around on Saturday morning, February 15. Rescue teams said the efforts on Saturday were hampered by a snowstorm and blizzard-like conditions. Royal Canadian Air Force Captain Matthew Cox who was one of the pilots of the rescue helicopter told CBC it was among the “trickiest maneuvering” of his career. He called it “one of the most challenging things I’ve done as a pilot.”\nCox and the team were able to hoist 20 crewmembers from the grounded cargo ship during the storm. He told CBC that four of the crewmembers were in need of medical assistance but were stable when they got them ashore.\n\n\n\nThe Canadian Coast Guard set up a two-nautical mile emergency zone around the vessel and reports they are establishing a staging area in Lark Harbor, Newfoundland, on the west shore near where the vessel went aground. The CCGSHenry Larsen, which stood by during the rescue, is remaining in Corner Brook to facilitate operations. The CCGSJean Goodwillloaded equipment in Canso, Nova Scotia, and is now in Charlottetown, Price Edward Island on her way to the scene.

    "input": "\nCore Power, a startup that is working to develop opportunities in the maritime sector using a new generation of advanced nuclear technology, outlined its vision to develop floating nuclear power plants that can be levered into nuclear-powered merchant shipping. The company will develop a U.S.-anchored maritime program named Liberty in honor of the mass-produced World War II Liberty ships.\nLast month, Core Power announced it was partnering with Glosten todesigna floating nuclear power plant that could be installed at U.S. ports. Naval architects and marine engineers at Glosten are focusing on the barge operational concept, design, regulatory path, site location approvals, and identification of potential suppliers for fabrication and installation of the barges which could produce about 175GWh of power per year.\nCEO Mikal Bøe of Core Power provided more details on the vision during a presentation in Houston last week. The first part of the Liberty program he said will see the mass production of floating nuclear power plants (FNPPs). The expertise gained in rolling out FNPPs on a large scale he predicted will pave the way for the second part of the program, which involves developing nuclear propulsion for merchant ships.\n“The Liberty program will unlock a floating power market worth $2.6 trillion, and shipyard construction of nuclear will deliver on time and on budget,” said Bøe. The company expects to open the orderbook for the floating nuclear power plants in 2028 and reach full commercialization by the middle of the next decade.\nUsing well-established shipbuilding processes and leveraging an already-skilled workforce, he envisions a modular production line for the power barges. Mass production will be possible says Bøe because they will employ advanced nuclear technologies, such as molten salt reactors. He points out that the new technologies are inherently and passively safe meaning they do not require the larger facilities and exclusion zones.\nEmploying the floating concept will make it possible to move the barges to ports and coastal locations to supplement local power capacity. Larger-capacity generation units would be anchored further offshore. The central shipyard will carry out the commissioning, maintenance, refueling, and waste management, making it simpler to choose locations for the barges. They will not require extensive site preparations. Core Power will also support the creation of the necessary framework for licensing, insurance, and export control.\nLearning from the first phase, they will then focus on developing the supply chain and workforce. They look to leverage the program internationally which will support the growth of the applications. They also believe it will lay the groundwork for nuclear-powered commercial vessels.\nCore Power reported last November that it was working with Westinghouse, one of the pioneers in nuclear power. The companies are focusing on the reactors that would be placed aboard the barges.\nSeveral companies are looking at applications of the new smaller reactor technologies to provide easily positioned power stations. Samsung Heavy Industries in partnership with Seaborg, a Danish start-up pursuing next-generation nuclear technologies, is also developing floating nuclear power plant barges using Compact Molten Salt Reactor technology developed by Seaborg. This concept is also targeted at the opportunities to bring new power sources to remote areas and developing countries.",

    "input": "\nA Chinese state-owned enterprise has taken over the ownership of Zhoushan Wison Offshore Engineering, the Wison Group unit that the Biden Administration sanctioned for supporting Russia's LNG export ambitions on the Arctic coast of Siberia.\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, Wison supplied power generation modules for Novatek's Arctic LNG 2 project, which is heavily sanctioned. The modules were to be installed on Arctic LNG 2's barge-based liquefaction trains. After the modules were completed at Wison's plant, the company allowed them to be shipped to the Arctic LNG 2 construction site via a series of complex transshipment operations, which appeared designed to obscure the movements of the large and expensive project cargo. Two of the vessels involved - Hunter Star and Nan Feng Zhi Xing - have been sanctioned before for chartering activity in Russian energy projects.\nAfter the Treasury announced that Zhoushan Wison would be sanctioned, parent company Wison New Energies pledged to avoid \"any new Russian business\" and said that it would sell its entire stake in its Zhoushan unit. It emphasized that Wison New Energies would not have any shareholding in the company after the sale.\nLess than one month after sanctions on the yard were announced, a new owner has emerged: the state-owned Nantong Economic and Technological Development Zone Holding Group, a subsidiary of Nantong's municipal government. It is a Class I state-owned enterprise, with access to preferential credit terms. (Nantong is a five-hour drive away from Zhoushan, on the other side of Shanghai, but is home to another Wison facility.) The shipyard has been renamed Zhoushan Tongzhou Offshore Engineering.\nThe sanctions designation was limited to the Zhoushan unit, and Wison is still in the offshore construction industry. It broke ground in early February on a new, unsanctioned shipyard complex called Wison New Energies Qidong Yard. This plant will compete in the same market as the sanctioned Zhoushan yard, and will be a \"strategic pillar\" for completing the same large-scale EPCIC contracts, like FLNGs, FPSOs and plant modules.",

    "input": "Officials in Hong Kong are hailing the launch of bunkering operations to fuel LNG ships. It provides another competitive tool for the port which along with other major ports in the region including Singapore and Shanghai are offering LNG bunkering operations.\nKunlun Energy Co., controlled by PetroChina, reported the first official bunkering operation on February 14 taking place in the southern anchorage of Hong Kong’s Cheung Chau. The company’s bunker vessel was positioned alongside theZim Aquamarine(81,681 dwt) to load 2,200 tons of ultra-low temperature LNG. Using an advanced bunker system, the operation took about seven hours.\nThe 7,000 TEU vessel was recently delivered from the shipyard and is now in service between the Far East and the Mediterranean. The companies report the refueling in Hong Kong will meet the ship’s fuel requirements for the entire voyage.\nThe bunkering service will be offered with the company’s vessel. It is equipped with two independent \"C\"-type cargo tanks with a maximum capacity of 8,500 cubic meters, providing customers with one-stop customized services, including cold storage, degassing, and LNG bunkering.\nIn late January, a test bunkering was also carried out with a Zim vessel,Zim Amber, another ship of the same class. The service has now been officially inaugurated with Hong Kong port officials reporting the goal is to bunker 200,000 tons of green fuels annually by 2030. According to data provided by PetroChina, by the end of 2024, it had supplied approximately 15.8 billion cubic meters of gas to Hong Kong, with an annual supply of about 1.5 billion cubic meters. Adding ship bunkering is being called another important milestone.\nHong Kong joins as many as 100 bunkering ports worldwide with most major shipping ports now having capabilities to supply LNG. According to the trade group SEA-LNG, the bunkering infrastructure to support LNG as a marine fuel has developed rapidly. It can now be delivered to vessels in some 96 ports, including most of the main bunkering ports, with a further 55 ports in the process of facilitating LNG bunkering investments and operations.\nThe group highlights the dramatic growth in the LNG bunker fleet. DNV calculates there are 65 supply ships now in service. This compares with just six LNG bunker vessels in 2019. DNV reports that an additional 16 LNG bunker vessels are currently on order. Europe and Asia each have about a third of the LNG bunker fleet, with the Americas third at 17 percent.\nGlobally there are over 650 LNG-fueled vessels now in service. The size of the fleet is expected to double over the next eight years to 2033.\n",

    "input": "\nThe Southampton Crown Court, UK, on Friday, February 14, sentenced the master of a North Sea cargo ship and the company operating the vessel for their involvement in causing a fatal accident in 2021. The master, who was reported to have been on his first voyage in command, pleaded guilty to failing to operate the vessel following the safety management plan while the shipping company was found guilty in a four-week trial for failing to operate its ships safely.\nThe trial stemmed from the December 13, 2021, incident when theScot Carrier, a 4,700 dwt general cargo ship, collided with a small, self-propeller Danish barge theKarin Høj. They were sailing in the busy shipping lane between Denmark and Sweden and the small barge capsized killing the two crewmembers aboard.\nSwedish authorities immediately said they suspected drunkenness and detained the Scot Carrier after the vessel initially left the scene of the collision. The ship’s second officer who was navigating the vessel was extradited to Denmark for trial. The British officer, Mark Wilkinson, pleaded guilty to charges ofnegligent manslaughterfor his role as helmsman. He was sentenced in 2022 to spend 18 months in a Danish prison.\n“This was an accident waiting to happen,” said Southampton Crown Court Judge Peter Henry during Friday’s sentencing. He criticized the “laissez-faire attitude” toward safety aboard the ship and the operator’s culture which included regularly not maintaining lookouts despite requirements.\nWilkinson was alone on the bridge of the vessel at 0325 when the collision occurred. The UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) had previouslydetailedthat the second officer was distracted and that the warning alarms on the navigation systems were turned off. He was said to have been chatting with a woman over the internet and made what became the fatal course correction without checking his surroundings.\nIn the new trial, additional details came out. The master Sam Farrow, age 33 of London, confirmed that he suspected the first officer was intoxicated and had relieved him of his watch that night. According to the reports, Farrow was also distracted making a phone call to his mother when he handed over the watch to Wilkinson. The court was told basic safety requirements were being routinely ignored, but they believed that he was aware the Wilkinson had also consumed alcohol before coming on watch. Wilkinson in his trial said he did not believe he was intoxicated.\nAccording to the court, Farrow did not take safety action despite being aware that Wilkinson was failing in his duties as officer-of-the watch and permitting consumption of alcohol on the ship. Farrow pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight months in jail, suspended for 12 months, and £25,000 ($31,550) in costs. Media reports indicate he will have to carry out 200 hours of unpaid community work and pay a victim surcharge, to avoid prison time.\n“The failure to provide lookouts was the undoubtedly the single biggest failure, but the failure properly to oversee and enforce bridge discipline amongst the crew introduced additional distractions from the safe operation of the vessel which aligned to create the hole in the model and led directly to the collision,” concluded Judge Henry.\nIntrada Ships Management which operates Scotline was found guilty of failing to operate a ship in a safe manner. The judge sentenced the company to a £180,000 fine ($227,000) and a further £500,000 ($630,000) in costs. Media reports said Intrada spent £1 million (nearly $1.3 million) on legal fees.\nThe issue of shipping companies not posting lookouts at night has been highlighted by the authorities regarding several incidents. In October 2023, another Scotline vessel managed by Intrada Ships Management,Scot Explorer, was involved in acollisionoff the Danish coast. The vessel hit an LPG carrier which was drifting while undertaking engine repairs. MAIB reported the master of theScot Explorerwas also alone on the bridge and distracted while the ship was on autopilot. Intrada was again cited for not maintaining proper watches with a lookout and committed to enhancing its safety protocols and training.",

    "input": "China is conducting drills that simulate the reunification of Taiwan by force, according to the U.S. military's top officer in Asia. China's navy and air force routinely operate in the Taiwan Strait and on the eastern side of the island, often during periods of elevated tension; at a conference in Hawaii last week, Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. Sam Paparo suggested that these drills are rehearsals for the main event.\n\"[China's] aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan right now are not exercises, as they call them. They are rehearsals,\" Adm. Paparo said. \"They are rehearsals for the forced unification of Taiwan to the mainland.\"\nPaparo called for a radical acceleration of efforts to rearm, starting with \"procurement at the speed of combat, not at the speed of committees.\" He noted that ongoing conflicts in the Mideast and Ukraine have eaten into available stocks of munitions that will be needed in a the high-end fight with China, adding more pressure to find ways to rebuild America's arsenal. He predicted a major role for AI, and for 3D print-on-demand parts. \"It isn't future tech, it's current capability,\" he noted.\nOn the other side of the Pacific, as Paparo spoke, China's forces were on the move. From January 28 through February 12, China's Eastern Theater Command carried out combat patrols around Taiwan, deploying surface combatants, fighters and bombers. The drills overlapped with the transit of a U.S. Navy destroyer and an MSC auxiliary survey ship through the Taiwan Strait: From Feb. 10-12, the destroyer USSRalph Johnsonand the USNSBowditchmade their way south through the strait, completing the first U.S. Navy transit of the waterway since the beginning of the new administration. Taiwan Strait transits are intended to challenge China's claim to control over the full 80-mile width of the strait, most of which falls outside of the limits of China's territorial seas.\nThe Canadian warship HMCSOttawafollowed suit with a similar transit over the weekend. China objected strenuously, and the People's Liberation Army carried out a large-scale exercise with nine ships and more than 40 aircraft around Taiwan on Monday.\nTaiwan's defense ministry pushed back in a strongly-worded statement. \"The Taiwan Strait is absolutely not within the scope of China’s sovereignty,\" Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement. \"Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is not only a matter of concern for Taiwan, but also a common concern for free and democratic countries around the world.\"\nIn the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard sent a patrol to within 35 nautical miles of Palawan, outside of Philippine territorial seas but much closer to the nation's home islands than normal. An unusual three-ship CCG task force made the journey - at about the same time that Philippine diplomats were traveling to Munich for a high-level international security dialogue, including discussions of the tensions in the Spratly Islands.\n\"Usually, they [the China Coast Guard] go sort of one or maybe two at a time, so taking three ships is sending a particular message of strength,\" maritime security analyst Ray Powell told GMA.\nIn Munich last weekend, former Chinese vice foreign minister Fu Ying made clear that China would not allow continued Philippine control of Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal, two reefs located within the Philippine exclusive economic zone. For 25 years, the Philippine military has maintained a garrison on a decaying shipwreck on Second Thomas Shoal, and China has demanded that Manila must remove Philippine forces from Philippine waters.\n\"If the Philippines can take new rocks, how can you stop others? . . . That’s a red line no one should be allowed to cross,\" former vice foreign minister Fu said. \"How can you stop China from taking more? We’re capable, there’s no problem, but we are exercising constraint.\"\nIn a rebuttal, Philippine foreign secretary Enrique Manalo said that when China \"applies its own domestic laws to certain areas within our exclusive economic zone, then it really does create the kind of tension that we have been experiencing.\"",

    "input": "\nMaersk and India’s Cochin Shipyard have entered into a memorandum of understanding to explore ship repair, maintenance, and shipbuilding in India. The Danish company becomes the first major carrier to plan regular maintenance activities in India which will be in support of the government’s goals to develop shipbuilding into one of India’s leading industries.\n“The first Maersk vessel repair at Cochin, planned already for 2025, will mark the beginning of what we envisage as a long-term collaborative relationship,” said Leonardo Sonzio, Head of Fleet Management & Technology for A.P. Moller – Maersk. The collaboration the companies reported will initially focus on vessels up to 7,000 TEU for afloat repairs and up to 4,000 TEU for dry-docking, with capabilities expected to expand over time.\nCochin Shipyard, which was incorporated in 1972 as a fully owned Government of India company, is India’s largest shipbuilder both for the navy and private projects. Last year, the company invested more than $100 million to open a new ship repair facility encompassing more than 42 acres in Cochin Port. Media reports indicate that the company is currently repairing four to five ships at a time in the yard while it also has orders for 65 newbuilds.\nLocated on the southwest coast of India, the yard is close to major shipping lanes and can offer advantages in technology and low-cost labor. The agreement with Maersk will explore ship repair, dry docking, and new building opportunities as well as sharing technical expertise. The companies plan to work together on joint training programs and skill development.\nIndia is reported to have 32 shipyards but a report cited inadequate policy support, limited private investment, and inefficiencies in the operations which are holding back the growth of the industry. The government however in 2024 outlined an aggressive plan to expand the shipbuilding industry.\nThe Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) is developing a new shipbuilding support program that will incentivize Indian shipyards to grow. Detailing the plan the ministry said the aim is to propel India into the top ranks of global shipbuilding nations, targeting a position among the top 10 by 2030 and the top five by 2047, from its current 22nd place. The government projected that the business could be worth $62 billion by 2047. It would also drive growth in related industries which would add $37 billion to the economy and create around 12 million jobs.\nMedia reports in India and South Korea noted recent activities designed to support the shipbuilding industry. The Indian government organized and led a delegation to meet with Korea’s shipbuilders. In a reciprocal visit, Hanwha Ocean is reported to have toured the shipbuilders including Swan Engineering, Cochin Shipyard, Hindustan Shipyard, and L&T Shipyard. Media reports in South Korea indicate that Hanwha Ocean is exploring an agreement with India’s shipbuilders.\nKorean shipbuilders are currently handicapped by a lack of capacity with all the building slots booked years in advance. The industry is also focused on rising costs and competition from Chinese shipyards.\nThe U.S. Navy and the UK’s Royal Navy have also sought to build relationships with the Indian shipbuilders as part of a complex series of political moves to strengthen ties with India. The U.S. Navy sent an MSC vessel for the first time in 2022 for an overhaul at an Indian shipyard and now three of India’s yards are approved to bid for projects. The Royal Navy also started in 2024 sending auxiliary ships to Indian shipyards.",

The at-sea apprehension of an alien illegally present in the U.S. and a vessel’s captain with an active arrest warrant, underscores the critical role we play in both immigration enforcement and national security.” said Lt. Cmdr. Nina Mcdonald, Enforcement Division Chief at USCG Sector Corpus Christi. “Alongside our partners, the Coast Guard will continue to uphold the rule of law and disrupt illicit activity along our nation’s maritime border.\"\nUnder the Trump administration, the Coast Guard has a new emphasis on border enforcement.

It has a nameplate capacity of about 1.5 million barrels a day, equal to roughly two percent of the global seaborne-traded oil supply.CPC confirmed that seven explosives-laden drones attacked the Kropotkinskaya pumping station on Sunday night, the pipeline's largest station within Russia. The strike took the station out of service; while the line has not fully shut down, \"crude transportation through the Tengiz-Novorossiysk pipeline system is being maintained at reduced flow rates,\" CPC said.\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully struck two major Russian oil installations in Krasnodar Krai.Early in the evening, seven Ukrainian drones struck the Kropotkinskaya pumping station, the largest on the Caspian Pipeline, reportedly slashing total system capacity.pic.twitter.com/3IQPFXTO8W\nUkrainian drones cripple Russia’s largest Caspian Pipeline pumping station, Kropotkinskaya—cutting off oil transit to Novorossiysk. Some added color for the talks in Saudi Arabia.pic.twitter.com/vpHMl6TICm\nThe CPC was subject to frequent interference by Russian interests in the early months of the war, but up until last weekend, it had not been targeted by Ukraine. The pipeline is part-owned by Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and Eni - all tied to Ukraine's Western allies - and it carries Western-owned oil from Kazakhstan's prolific oil fields on the Caspian Sea.\nNearly 90 percent of the CPC's oil volume is Kazakh-origin, but an attack on the CPC would impact Russian energy revenue. Russian state oil company Transneft controls the pipeline and owns 31 percent of its shares, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in profits annually for the Russian state.\nThe attack could have an even bigger impact on Western oil companies. Chevron is counting on $4 billion in free cash flow from its Tengiz oilfield investments this year, and $5 billion in 2026, according to theICIJ. A pipeline slowdown or shutdown could temporarily crimp deliveries.\nChevron told Energy Intel in a statement that its Kazakh joint venture continues to produce oil and export it via the CPC pipeline \"uninterrupted.\"\nKazakhstan, which depends heavily on oil exports for foreign exchange revenue, has the biggest stake in CPC's performance. It is a neutral party in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and 80 percent of its oil exports are delivered via the CPC pipeline.\nFront month Brent and WTI futures ticked up by just under one percent after news of the pipeline slowdown.",

The vessel told the authorities that there was a fire aboard, and it was later reporting no propulsion or steering capabilities.\nBuilt in 2000, the Malta-registered ship is a Conro, a unique combination of containership and RoRo, favored by Grimaldi. The Italian shipping firm is one of the few that continues to operate this type of vessel and the company recentlybuilt moreships of this style in China.\nThe UK MCA called the RNLI asking for lifeboats to be deployed.

The vessel was southbound in the Dover Strait traveling from Antwerp, Belgium to Le Havre, France when the fire occurred.\nBy the time the lifeboats reached the vessel, the ship reported its crew of 28 was all accounted for and there were no injuries. They reported the fire had been contained to one deck and the onboard fire suppression system had been used.\nThe lifeboat crews reported they did not have to board the vessel and were later given permission to stand down returning to station. The Dutch Coast Guard also dispatched one of its surveillance aircraft to monitor the situation.\nThe French rescue vesselAbeille Normandieis reported to be standing by the disabled cargo ship. The DutchMultratug 35has also arrived on scene.\nAnother Grimaldi Conro,Grande Costa d’Avorio, made headlines in July 2023 when afirebroke out while it was loading Port Newark, New Jersey. Two local firefighters were killed aboard the vessel and the fire burned for days destroying the garage section of the vessel. The U.S. Coast Guard has been leading the investigation focusing on a pusher vehicle being used to position cars being loaded on the Grimaldi vessel for causing the devastating fire. It also prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to issue an alert on the dangers of shipping used cars. The vessel was reconditioned for a return to service while a final report on the fire is still pending.\nTop photo byHuhu Uetof Grande Brasile in 2013 -CC BY-SA 3.0",

The gear gradually decomposes into microplastic, which enters the marine food chain with unknown consequences for the ecosystem (and for consumers of seafood).\nBut long before they break down, abandoned nets ensnare turtles, fish, sharks and other creatures, reducing the health of marine fisheries and taking a toll on threatened species. To fight this long-term threat, WWF Germany has worked with Accenture and Microsoft AI to put together an AI-driven ghost net identification platform.\nThe process starts with sonar data, obtained by organizations of all kinds (oceanographic research groups, offshore energy companies, and government sources) and donated to the projcet. When this data is uploaded into the cloud-based AI identification platform - GhostNetZero - the system automatically scans the sonar data for the telltale signs of drifting ghost nets. Previously, the only way to do this was to search the data manually - a time-consuming process, if proven to work. WWF Germany has used manual sonar searches for its cleanup work in the past, and has removed more than 20 tonnes of abandoned nets from the bottom of the Baltic.\nBut to maximize the platform's impact, WWF Germany says that it is looking for new participants from industry. Any group with high resolution sonar data to share can help out. In return, partners get the right to use the group's partnership logo.\n\"The combination of sonar search and AI-supported detection enables a quantum leap: the seabed is mapped all over the world and there is a huge amount of data. If we can specifically check existing image data from heavily fished marine zones, this is a real game-changer,\" WWF Germany project manager Gabriele Dederer told Oceanographic Magazine.",

The newOOCL Iris(16,868 TEU) while a smaller vessel by dimensions, surpassed the capacity record set four years ago highlighting the benefits of investments the state is making in its ports and advancements in container shipping.\nTheOOCL Iriswas recently delivered as the second of a class of 10 new NeoPanamax containerships Orient Overseas Container Liner (OOCL) is putting into service. The ship was named on December 3, 2024, at the Nantong COSCO KHI Ship Engineering Co. (NACKS) as the first of the class completed by this yard and the second overall as Dalian COSCO KHI Ship Engineering Co. (DACKS) is also building half the class.\nOOCL highlights it is their first new NeoPanamax class in more than a decade with the prior vessels entering service in 2013 and 2014. Starting in 2023, the company also added a class of ultra-large container vessels, the industry’s first 24,000 TEU ships.\nRepresenting the next generation of NeoPanamax containerships, OOCL Iris, along with NACKS-built sistersOOCL BauhiniaandOOCL Sunflower, not only comply with the latest environmental regulatory requirements, but also set new benchmarks in areas such as environmental design, energy efficiency, digital intelligence, safety, and onboard comfort by incorporating the latest technological innovations and intelligent solutions. These vessels feature an advanced energy efficiency system that provides recommendations for speed optimization and trim adjustments. The system monitors real-time fuel consumption and power usage of the main engine, generator, and boiler, offering valuable optimization suggestions. Additionally, the OOCL Iris has received three \"Smart Ship\" notations, as well as the Enviro-friendly notation (ENVIRO) and Sustainable notation (SUSTAIN-1) from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS).\nFor Charleston, it means the vessel which is 1,204 feet in length (367 meters) has a rated carry capacity of 16,868 TEU surpassing theCMA CGM Marco Polowhich at 16,020 set the previous record in May 2021. The CMA CGM vessel was the largest containership in the world when it was introduced in 2013 with an overall length of 1,299 feet (396 meters). Advancements in loading and stacking permit the new OOCL vessels to carry five percent more boxes (TEU) on a smaller-dimension vessel.\n\n#SCPortsproudly welcomed the OOCL Iris to the Wando Welch Terminal Tuesday, setting a new record for the largest vessel to call the Port of Charleston, at 16,828 TEUs.????:@mpeacock28pic.twitter.com/aew3hldVyS\n\nThe height of the new vessel made for some interesting images as it passed under Charleston’s Arthur Ravenel Jr. roadway bridge (Route 17). The bridge is listed with a clearance of 186 feet (57 meters).\nThe ship proceeded to Charleston’s Wando Welch Terminal as the last stop on its U.S. rotation. The port emphasizes its capital investments meaning a ship of this size has any time access regardless of tides. The berth now has a 54-foot depth and a 52-foot channel. TheOOCL Irishas a design draft of 47.6 feet (14.5 meters).\n“SC Ports’ strategic infrastructure investments allow us to continue welcoming the largest ships calling the U.S. East Coast,” said SC Ports President and CEO Barbara Melvin. “Charleston’s harbor depth and widened turning basins, taller ship-to-shore cranes and highly productive terminals and maritime community all work together to provide fluidity to our customers’ supply chains.”\nSC Ports highlights an investment of nearly $3 billion to modernize port infrastructure, expand cargo capacity, and build rail infrastructure. Last year, it reached an agreement with its unions after a standoff that had delayed the use of its expanded terminals.\nTheOOCL Irisand her soon-to-be-introduced sisterOOCL Sunflowerwill be taking advantage of the NeoPanamax sizing on a route from China and Far East ports to New York, Savannah, and Charleston.

Investigators are exploring terrorism or sabotage but will not rule out mechanical failures or previous collision damage.\nThe Port Authority for Savona in Northern Italy issued a statement confirming what it called “anomalies in the unloading procedure.” The crude oil tankerSeajewel(108,888 dwt) arrived in the port on Friday, February 14 from Algeria and was directed to one of the oil terminal buoys to begin offloading. Built in 2009 and registered in Malta, the Aframax tanker has been operated by Greece’s Thenamaris since 2021.\nPort officials said the “anomalies” were observed overnight between Friday into Saturday and the supervisors as a precaution suspended the offloading operation. No spills or injuries were reported among the 23 crewmembers aboard, but they are seeking to verify the origin of the anomalies.\nAccording to media reports in Italy, the crew aboard the vessel heard two loud bangs. They reported an ingress of water and a survey of the hull revealed two damaged plates. The inner hull held and there was no leak.\nThe Savona Prosecutor’s Office became involved and they also brought in an elite team of divers to inspect the underside of the vessel. According to the reports, they confirmed three things. First, there is a hole about a meter in length in the hull. The hull plates are bent inwards indicating an external force, and they found dead fish in the area near the damage to the hull.\nItaly’s anti-terrorism unit has also become involved in the investigation. The prosecutor’s office is not providing further details and the shipping company also confirms an investigation is underway. They are not responding to questions if the divers found residue from explosives or how or when an explosive could have been attached to the hull.\nMedia reports quickly traded the tanker’s past activities with the RussianTankerTacker online site showing the vessel had made frequent stops at Russia’s Novorossiysk and traveling to Turkey. Ukraine’s news agency was quick to report the vessel had transported Russian oil on at least three occasions, in February, March, and May 2024.\nIt is the second incident in just a matter of days that has raised questions of sabotage or terrorism targeting tankers in the Russian oil trade. Just over a week ago, Russian authorities reported a Cyprus-owned tanker,Koala, had an engine room explosion while docked at Ust-Luga. Reports quickly began to question the theory it was an engine room incident and the maritime security consultancy Ambrey Intelligence reported the tankerexperiencedthree blasts saying it was likely hit by limpet mines.\nAmbrey stated that other vessels with \"a similar trading profile\" have also been damaged by explosions.

The company’s AmFELS shipyard in Brownsville, Texas released the first photos of the vessel as it undergoes trials.\n“Charybdis is 96 percent completed and complies with U.S. Jones Act regulations, allowing it to operate seamlessly in U.S. waters for domestic offshore wind projects,” writes Seastrium. “One of the largest WTIVs of its kind globally, theCharybdisis designed to handle current and next-generation wind turbines up to 12 megawatts or larger.”\nDominion Energy had reported recently that the vessel was undergoing its trials as it moves toward commissioning. Seatrium reports that it recently completed jacking trial and main crane load testing. The vessel’s sea trials have also begun.\nWith a length of 472 feet, width of 184 feet, and depth of 38 feet, it is equipped with a 426-foot crane capable of lifting up to 2,200 tonnes. It will accommodate up to 119 people.\n\n\nCharybdis is reportedly 96 percent complete and on schedule to deploy later in 2025 at Dominion's Virginia offshore wind farm (Seatrium)\n\nWork began in December 2020 on the ship and it waslaunchedin April 2024. It was originally reported that the target for delivery was late 2023, but it has fallen back with the companies now saying it remains on schedule for delivery in 2025. Later this year it is expected to begin work at Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project where it will continue to work through the completion of the wind farm expected by the end of 2026.\nAs the first of its kind in the U.S. and with domestic shipbuilding to meet the requirements of the Jones Act, the cost of the vessel has skyrocketed. Original estimates placed the cost at between $500 and $500 million but the company later adjusted it to an estimate of $625 million. In August 2024, the company told investors the latest estimated costs, including financing, was $715 million.\nDespite the cost increases for the vessel and the project, Dominion Energy continues to espouse the value of offshore wind and the construction it will make to operations. The company says the overall project for the offshore work remains on budget, although it recently increased costs related to the transmission lines. It said theinstallationwas past the 50 percent mark offshore and on schedule.\nOther than a few currently permitted projects, the U.S. offshore wind energy market is expected to stall during the Trump second term. The vessel as the first U.S. vessel will be well-positioned for domestic installation projects and it is likely to enter the international market where large install vessels also remain in short supply.",

EUNAVFOR Atalanta reports it was informed of the suspect incident that took place on February 17, and it is investigating.\nFew details have been provided so far on this latest attack other than it took place off Garmaal, which Atalanta reports is near Eyl, where past attacks took place. It is along the northern coast of Puntland a semi-autonomous region in Somalia and notorious for piracy.\nThe suspect vessel is reported to be a Yemini-flagged dhow. Atalanta is working with the Yemeni Coast Guard and the Puntland Maritime Police Force as well as the international Combined Maritime Forces.\nThis incident comes ten days after another pirate attack on the Yemeni-flagged dhow,Al Najma. The vessel which had 12 crewmembers aboard was seized near Ely on February 9. The EU naval forces began a search to locate the vessel and when they approached the dhow thepirates fledafter robbing the crew. It was liberated on February 13.\nAfter the two recent incidents, Operation Atalanta is strongly recommending merchant and other vulnerable vessels register on the Maritime Security Centre Indian Ocean (MSCIO) website and its Voluntary Registration Scheme (VRS). Atalanta says this will provide the most effective monitoring and response by ATALANTA forces and their partners in countering maritime security threats.\nYesterday, it also highlighted its ongoing efforts through what it calls “Friendly Approaches.” Atalanta teams engage directly with fishing men at sea, providing guidance on security measures, understanding their challenges, and reinforcing trust in the waterways.\nAtalanta’s data shows a pattern of attacks, and in 2024 the wave began in January and continued through the first quarter. Last year, there were five incidents reported in January versus this year when it was quiet between November when a Chinese commercial fishing boat was seized and last week when the Yemeni dhow was seized.\n",

    "input": "\nOver the past year, Vietnam has accelerated its land reclamation program in the Spratly Islands, building out acreage and enlarging its military bases at a faster pace than any other claimant. At its largest facility on Barque Canada Reef, it has dug out a ship channel large enough to accommodate the largest existing destroyers and cruisers, according to a new paper released by China's Ministry of Natural Resources.\nThe paper, published in the latest edition of the Chinese-language Journal of Tropical Oceanography, describes a method to combine free data from American and European satellites to precisely chart out the depth of the channel - without the need for on-site surveying or permission from the base's operator. NASA'sICESat-2 satellitehas laser sensing capabilities that can reach down to 30 meters below the surface, enabling depth detection with high precision. When combined with high-resolution optical imaging from the EU's Sentinel satellite constellation, this laser data enables unauthorized charting of sensitive installations like Vietnam's newly-built naval base.\nAccording to the ministry's measurements, the channel has enough depth to accommodate warships up to the size of the PLA Navy's Type 055 destroyers, which draw about 22 feet of water. This is significantly less than would be needed for the equivalent U.S. Navy vessels, the Ticonderoga-class and the Arleigh Burke-class, which both require more than 30 feet of depth.\nThe paper also assessed the scale and speed of the land reclamation campaign. Vietnam appears to have added nearly 500 acres to Barque Canada Reef in just two years, and the harbor was added just last year. Coauthor Fu Dongyang wrote that the changes \"have profoundly reshaped [the reef's] topography,\" but there is still room to grow. The shoal has about 16,000 acres of natural coral flats that could be converted to support strategic military uses, as China has done with the reef flats at nearby Mischief Reef, Fiery Cross Reef and Subi Reef.\nVietnam has been clear about the purpose of the expansion. The Spratly Islands are contested by Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia, with the largest share located within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). China claims ownership over the entirety of the archipelago under its \"nine-dash line\" policy, and has the most extensive military presence.\nFor Vietnam, the bases provide a security perimeter far from home. “We will resort to every means possible to make sure we can defend and safeguard our legitimate interests in the [South China Sea],\" Vietnamese foreign policy director Le Dinh Tinh told the Washington Post last year.",

Several cable harnesses were severed, and an investigation is under way into a suspected sabotage attack, according toSpiegel. The Rostock prosecutor's office has confirmed that it is investigating the case.\nLate last year, an unknown saboteur dumped dozens of kilos of metal filings into the oil sumps of the main engines aboard the brand new corvetteEmden,according to multiple German media outlets. The contamination was detected and cleaned out, but if it had not been spotted, it would have quickly destroyed the engines.\nLast week, German Navy Vice Adm. Jan Christian Kaack told the press that \"more than one unit\" had been sabotaged, without going into specifics. Troublingly, he added that German naval bases have reported a pattern of attempted security perimeter breaches, both from the shoreside and from the waterside. He added that uniformed German Navy personnel have been approached in public while en route from base to their homes.\n\"The growing threat from Russia is more urgent at the beginning of 2025 than it was two years ago,\" Kaack told reporters, without specifying whether the suspected security threats within Germany were Russian.\nThe suspected attacks are just part of abroader patternof sabotage targeting Europe's security forces and its infrastructure. In early 2024, three German-Russian dual nationals were arrested on suspicion of planning an attack on the U.S. military base at Grafenwohr, a training facility for Ukrainian servicemembers. The main suspect, identified as Dieter S., stands accused of plotting an extensive series of arson and explosive attacks within Germany, with targets including rail lines and a manufacturing plant.\nSome NATO security forces also suspect - but have been unable to prove - that the four back-to-back subseacable breaksin the Baltic over the past year are an intentional act of sabotage, potentially linked to Russian intelligence.\nTop image:German Navy frigate Emden (F266) at Blohm+Voss, 2023 (Dkvtig / CC BY SA 4.0)",

It follows the news yesterday, February 17, that Maersk has entered into anagreementwith Cochin Shipyard first for repairs of smaller vessels of the fleet and targeting shipbuilding.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month spoke of the value of the planned investments into the sector and expected boosts to the economy. He has called for a mega cluster to focus on shipbuilding to take the country to a top 10 shipbuilding by the end of the decade and a top 5 by 2047. Modi said the business could be worth $62 billion by 2047.\nThe new budget for the country includes a Maritime Development Fund to provide financial assistance and level the costs for India’s shipbuilders to make the industry more competitive. They also provided a concept to leverage India’s well-established ship recycling operations primarily at Alang to attract newbuild business. The budget calls for a credit for shipowners that recycle vessels in India that would be applied to the cost of newbuilds at the Indian shipyards. A 10-year extension till 2025 was also provided on the duty charged on raw materials, components, and parts used in the manufacture of ships.\n\n\nModi and Macron received a presentation from Saadé at CMA CGM's Fleet Center (PM Modi)\n\nDuring his visit to Europe, Modi met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the CMA CGM Group headquarters in Marseille. He also discussed issues with group Chairman and CEO Rodolphe Saadé. CMA CGM highlighted its 34 years of operations in India and Saadé made a presentation and provided a tour of the group’s fleet center.\nIndia media is reporting that Saadé told Modi that CMA CGM was committed to sending a “study team” to look at the shipbuilding capabilities and repair opportunities. They also reportedly agreed to explore registering some ships in India.\nThe Indian media outlet ET Infra is reporting Christine Cabau Woehrel, Executive Vice-President for Assets and Operations, CMA CGM Group, will visit India this week to explore potential opportunities for shipbuilding and repairs in the country. It is also quoting sources that CMA CGM will sign a similar memorandum of understanding to the one Maersk announced yesterday. CMA CGM and Cochin will according to the report announce plans for ship repairs and newbuilding following Maersk’s lead.\n\n\nToft meeting with India's Minister of Commerce and Industry (Piyush Goyal on X)\n\nIndia’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, posted messages on X this week showing a meeting with Soren Toft, Chief Executive of MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company. He wrote that they had a productive meeting discussing the vast growth potential in India’s shipping and logistics sector, focusing on investments in inland container terminals, shipbuilding, maintenance, and container manufacturing. He said the talks centered around “deep-sea vessel partnerships and policy reforms to enhance the nation’s global maritime competitiveness while fostering growth, innovation and self-reliance in the sector.”\nThe state-owned Cochin Shipyard is seen as the first beneficiary of the new interest because it is the only yard with a 300-meter dry dock according to ET Infra. However, it notes that Swan Defense and Heavy Industries is also expected to meet with CMA CGM. Another yard, L&T Shipbuilding (Larsen & Toubro) also broke into the international market in the past few years, first winning maintenance contracts for U.S. Navy support ships and recently from the UK Royal Fleet Auxiliary.\nIndian shipbuilders have built smaller, specialized ships for Europeans. Maersk is set to start the next level with its agreement which calls for wet dock repairs for ships up to 7,000 TEU and dry dock for ships up to 4,000 TEU. Maersk said plans were underway for the first project to start in 2025.",

We are committed to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin,\" said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a statement.\nFor the first time, the EU has placed restrictions on Russian seaports that are used for evading the G7 price cap on Russian oil. Kozmino, the terminal responsible for exporting the ESPO blend to Pacific buyers, has consistently violated the cap since it was imposed; Primorsk, Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk also routinely export Urals grade crude at prices over the limit.\nAdditional measures include a phased ban on Russian aluminum imports, along with new sanctions on specific Russian officials and banks.\n\"We keep supporting Ukraine and we keep sanctioning the Russian aggressor, because this is the right thing to do, preserving international rules and order,\" one EU diplomat told the FT.\nSeparately, European officials have leaked an early outline of a Franco-British plan to deploy a small peacekeeping force to Ukraine after a possible end of hostilities. The plan would comprise about 30,000 servicemembers, primarily for defending Ukraine's airspace and its sea lines of communication. The scheme would not put Western troops near the front line, where they could come into contact with Russian forces.\nThe position broadcast by the U.S. government focused on the commercial opportunities of a rapprochement with Moscow. In a statement Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said that it was negotiating with Russia to establish \"future co-operation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities,\" along with a Ukrainian peace deal that Russia and the U.S. will determine.",

These budget flags are among the lowest-performing options available in terms of fleet quality, but they offer the light regulatory touch and rock-bottom affordability that a small minority of shipowners seek out.\nThe newly-emerging flags of choice for the sanctions-busting fleet include Cambodia, Eswatini, Gabon and Guinea-Bissau, ICS understands. Gabon is well-known as a host of the Russia-serving \"shadow fleet,\" and has grown by leaps and bounds since the start of U.S. sanctions on Russia's oil exports. The new arrivals give unscrupulous owners extra options for \"flag-hopping,\" the practice of frequently changing registries to evade enforcement. All are low performers on ICS' annual ranking of flag state performance, found alongside well-known names on the Paris MOU Black List.\nFlagging arrangements of this type are associated with questionable safety enforcement. One of these states - the landlocked kingdom of Eswatini (Swaziland) - isn't even an IMO member state. Last year, authorities in the UAEbannedall Eswatini-flagged ships from their ports over safety concerns, and the IMO has designated the privately-run flag administration as \"fraudulent.\"\n\"Eswatini’s emergence as a flag state presents a distinct concern as it is not a member of the UN IMO and is therefore not a signatory of its international maritime Conventions. ICS strongly encourages Eswatini and other new flag States to prioritize IMO membership and the ratification and implementation of IMO Conventions to demonstrate their commitment to global maritime governance and the responsible operation of those ships registered with their fleets,\" said ICS Secretary General Guy Platten.\nPlatten noted that shipping's success depends upon following global rules, and recommended that owners check ICS' flag state performance tables when deciding which nation to choose to regulate their ships. \"It is vital that flag states adhere to their obligations to enforce the highest global safety standards,\" he said.",

According to a spokesperson for Grimaldi Deep Sea, the vessel’s operator, the 28-member crew was removed from the vessel for their safety while salvage teams are joining the effort.\nThe first reports of afire aboardthe vessel which was sailing from Antwerp, Belgium to Le Havre, France were issued at approximately 0935 (local time) on Tuesday, February 18. The UK’s Coastguard dispatched lifeboats from the RNLI in Ramsgate and Dover. After using the vessel’s fire suppression system, the first fire was reported extinguished and the lifeboats were released.\nThe vessel which was built in 2000 and is registered in Malta was reportedly repositioned approximately 12 nautical miles off Ramsgate in southeast UK. A salvage tugMultratug 35was standing by the vessel along with the French Coast Guard’s rescue vesselAbeille Normandie.\n“At approximately 1625 hours (LT) the crew informed the authorities that a second fire had broken out on another deck of the vessel,” said the Grimaldi spokesperson. At approximately 2000 it was determined that the crew should leave the vessel and they boarded the vessel’s lifeboat. They were transferred to one of the assisting tugs and later taken to shore by the Ramsgate lifeboat according to HM Coast Guard. No injuries were reported to the crew.\n\n\nThermal image appears to show the fire spreading in the RoRo cargo area while boundary cooling is underway (Kustwacht)\n\nGrimaldi reports the situation continues to evolve. Currently, `tugs are providing boundary cooling to contain and limit the fire. The Belgian Coast Guard and Netherlands Coast Guard are also monitoring the situation. The Dutch report thatMultratug 36andKamarahave also arrived on scene. Smit Salvage has been retained by Grimaldi and was expected to reach the vessel as of midday Wednesday.\nImages supplied by the Netherlands Coast Guard show the fire burning in the RoRo cargo area of the vessel. The dangers of transporting vehicles, and specifically older, second-hand vehicles has been the topic of frequent discussions by insurers and other authorities. Eclectic vehicles are also considered to be a high danger in transport. In 2019, Grimaldi experienced fire on two of its vessels,Grande AmericaandGrande Europa, leading to calls for increased fire safety. These fires lead to new regulations about handling hazardous materials. A fire also broke out on a third Grimaldi vessel in 2021 while it was loading in Port Newark, New Jersey and that incident killed two local firefighters who had boarded the ship. The investigation is focusing on a \"pusher\" car used to position vehicles being loaded on theGrande Costa D’Avorio.\nThe vessel is loaded with a mix of rolling cargo (cars, vans, trucks), containers, and cargo destined for various West Africa ports. Grimaldi reports at this time the cause of the fire remains unknown but it will conduct a full investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\n",

Currently finishing construction at Chantiers de l’Atlantique in France, the new ship recently completed its second and final sea trials before delivery.\nThe new mega cruise ship underwent deep-water intensive systems tests during a final sea trial in the Atlantic Ocean announced MSC Cruises. The sea trials checked the performance of the ship’s engines, maneuverability, fuel consumption, safety systems, speed, and stopping distances. The ship will now receive her final finishing touches at the shipyard in Saint Nazaire, France before being officially delivered to the cruise line on March 27.\nAt 216,638 gross tons, theMSC World Americais almost a quarter larger than the cruise ships the company has been deploying in the American market. It is part of an effort to expand the brand’s presence in the United States which has also seen MSC open new homeports in Port Canaveral, Florida, and Galveston, Texas, and plans to send a cruise ship to Alaska.\nShe is the second ship of the class following theMSC World Europawhich was introduced at the end of 2022. Last year, MSC also exercised options for two more ships of the class, with MSC World Asia due to enter service in 2026 cruising in the Western Mediterranean. A fourth ship as yet unnamed is due to enter service in 2027.\n\n\n\nMSC World Americais scheduled to be named in Miami, Florida on April 9 and enter service that weekend sailing to the Caribbean. MSC will be the second company to have a cruise ship of over 200,000 gross tons in the U.S. market following Royal Caribbean International. Both Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line last year also ordered ships of this size to add to their fleets late in this decade and the next decade.\nThe addition marks a key step for MSC Cruises which has been building cruise ships for just 20 years and began in the 1990s with a series of small, secondhand cruise ships.MSC World Americawill be the 23rd cruise ship for the company which today rivals the three traditional brand leaders (Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, and Royal Caribbean International) in size and scope of operations.\n\n\n\nMSC highlights that theMSC World Americais being tailored to the U.S. market with re-imagined venues and concepts. She has seven onboard districts including bars, restaurants, entertainment, and leisure facilities. She will feature 18 bars and lounges, 19 dining venues, including four main restaurants and two buffets, as well as six specialty restaurants. The ship introduces a new Greek restaurant, a branded Eataly restaurant, a sports bar, and a comedy-karaoke club.\nMeasuring 1,093 feet (333 meters) in length, MSC constructed what is being billed as the largest cruise terminal in North America located in Miami to serve as her homeport. The ship has 22 decks and 2,614 passenger cabins. She will accommodate 6,762 passengers and have a crew of 2,138.\nThe ship incorporates the advanced technologies seen in the cruise sector, including being LNG dual-fueled. She has shore power connections and an advanced wastewater treatment plant.\nHer arrival coincides with one of the strongest cycles in the cruise industry with many brands reporting record booking positions and strong pricing. PortMiami which last year set a new record of nearly 7.3 million passengers, looks forward to the arrival of the MSC World America which will continue to the continued growth of the port.",

The cargo ship, which will be 7,800 dwt, is designed to transport timber from Norway to Europe and will be the first to operate on ammonia and electricity.\nThe order was placed by Skarv Shipping, a joint venture between Pear Group and Greig Edge, which was launched to initiate and develop sustainable short-sea shipping in northern Europe. The ship will be built by China’s Huanghai Shipbuilding and is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2027.\nDetails were not provided on the power system but the companies believe this will be one of the world's first four-stroke ammonia-powered vessels. It will measure 354 feet (108 meters) with a hold capacity of 10,200 cubic meters.\nThe ship is designed to sail most efficiently at low speeds, which they report helps ensure economically viable operations despite the higher cost of ammonia compared to traditional fuels. A 160-cubic ammonia tank, mixed with MGO (Marine Gas Oil) as pilot fuel, will provide enough fuel for a 14-day round trip from Norway to the continent.\n\n\n\n“The design and operation of the vessel consider the risks associated with using ammonia as fuel. Safety will be a primary focus and will be developed in close cooperation with class, manufacturers of green technology, and LMG Marin as ship designer. The ship will be outfitted with highly advanced safety systems, alongside operational safety procedures and crew training,” says Jan Øivind Svardal, CEO of Skarv Shipping.\nThey also highlight that the new ship will be equipped with a battery and it will have shore power access.\nLMG Marin developed the concept design for the vessel and the contract for its construction was negotiated with NorBroker Shipping & Trading, a partner of Viken AT Market. Once the vessel is completed, Arriva Shipping will take the ship on a long-term charter and manage the commercial ship operation for Viken AT Market.\nViken reports it ships approximately one million tons of Norwegian timber to the European continent each year. It uses conventional diesel-powered ships, although the partners have been working to launch a new generation of more efficient ships.\nThe ammonia-powered vessel is said to follow on and be an updated version of other recent orders placed by Skarv Shipping for the commercial operations for Peak CSL Group.\nArriva Shipping has entered into an agreement with the Chinese shipyard Jiangsu SOHO Marine Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. to construct a new dry cargo vessel with a cargo capacity of 8,000 deadweight tons and will employ a 2 MW battery hybrid system.

A focus on long-term value and a strong balance sheet has paid off, according to Ardmore. To find out more about its secret to success, TME spoke with Ardmore's recently appointed CEO, longtime tanker executive Gernot Ruppelt.\nTME: Can you tell us a bit about your career and how you came to Ardmore?Ruppelt:I found the maritime business partially by choice, partially by coincidence, and decided to build a life around it. I've been in the maritime industry my entire career, committed to this exciting, very international line of work. I've worked across the globe in five different countries, across three continents - Europe, Asia, and US. I've been with Ardmore since 2013, and as Chief Commercial Officer I led the commercial strategy and developed our trading capabilities, now operating in Europe, Singapore, and Houston.Before Ardmore, I spent five years in New York as a tanker broker with Poten & Partners. During that time, I was engaged in various project-based businesses, including chemical tankers. I was transacting with Ardmore Shipping when the company was in its early stages, still in startup mode. I recognized then that this was a unique company, with founder and former CEO Anthony Gurnee being very different from anybody I had dealt with.My career started at Maersk when I joined their management fast-track program. I worked for Maersk in Germany, where I'm from, then Singapore and Denmark, and ultimately the US.Can you tell us a little bit more about Ardmore? There have been some big changes, including your recent promotion.I officially became CEO in the middle of September 2024. By then, we had gone through a long-established and well-staged transition process that was initiated by the board in 2020 and kicked into high gear about a year ago.\nLooking at Ardmore as a business, we have always found ways to evolve over the past 15 years of our existence: expanding the fleet, the public listing in 2013, and really evolving our commercial strategy from a simple, high-quality time charter portfolio to a fully-fledged global trading platform.We have continuity in terms of strategy and our values, and at the same time we always look to develop and improve. Take as one example the joint venture we have with Anglo Eastern - Anglo Ardmore Ship Management - and many other ways to keep innovating as an organization.\nOur company emphasizes internal progression, and we've created this dynamic culture where Ardmore is truly a career escalator.  People are encouraged to step up when opportunities arise. We also have a great, fully independent board with real diversity in terms of industry background and specialization.Can you tell me about current market conditions and what you expect over the next three to five years?Some of the biggest impacts on our industry - whether it was COVID, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or more recently, the situation in the Red Sea - were caused by black swan events, and therefore by definition impossible to predict in advance. Today, a great deal of uncertainty remains. But here's what we do know: The product tanker fleet is getting really old. Newbuild ordering activity has picked up recently, but when you compare the number of ships on order to the number that are about to age out of service, the ratio is roughly one to four. That's going to have a positive impact on markets.We'll continue to see oil consumption and demand for oil products play an important role in the energy mix moving forward. There is also increased focus on a whole range of emerging transition fuels, such as biofuels, and the feedstocks to generate those new fuels and various different blending components.Shipyards are extremely busy in East Asia and newbuild prices have gotten higher. Do you think it's going to be more difficult for owners to introduce new tonnage into the market?If you wanted to order a ship today, you'd be looking at a 2028 delivery. As far as Ardmore is concerned, we are in no rush to execute ship acquisitions, while we always monitor the market for opportunities. In the meantime, we continue to execute on our well-established capital allocation policy: we've paid down debt significantly, lowering our break-even point. We've returned capital to shareholders and reinvested in the business in very meaningful ways.Last year, we sold our oldest ship and bought a 2017-built one, picking up incremental fuel efficiency and more cargo versatility. We've also reinvested in efficiency upgrades on existing ships, some providing 30-40 percent returns on investment or more.AI and digital tools are increasingly important for competitiveness. How are you seeing these tools helping your operations today?It's huge. Last year, we completed the rollout of an AI-supported voyage optimization system called DeepSea AI. This goes beyond just optimization of waypoints - it helps make trade-off decisions between marginal cost-saving opportunities and marginal revenue opportunities in real time. While concepts like profit optimization aren't new, the level of granularity now allows us to factor in ambient conditions and fuel costs to create much more dynamic control all throughout the voyage.We're also embracing AI integration in our onshore corporate processes. You don't have to be a technology firm to be good at technology adoption. Some products are available off the shelf, some virtually free, and with the right culture and mentality, you can find nearly limitless ways to innovate through technology adoption.Regarding decarbonization, what kind of strategies are you pursuing?Our mantra around decarbonization is finding opportunities to integrate performance with progress, rather than choosing between financial performance or decarbonization. We've worked with Value Maritime on CO2 capture-ready scrubbers, which provides interesting optionality for closed-loop operation  and carbon capture.We're engaged with customers around potential long-term projects for alternative fuels, though we're not at the point of making purely speculative investments. For now, we're focused on increasing fuel efficiency and making ships more sustainable and cargo versatile to ensure performance and optionality in the long run.What are you seeing with geopolitical uncertainties on the horizon?There are two layers to consider for product tanker demand. The bottom layer is consumption and overall oil demand, combined with how long these products have to travel.  The second layer is arbitrage, which can be driven short-term by events, weather or other factors. Geopolitical disruption is one facet, but there are other long-term trends - like refinery dislocation and a changing product demand slate - that are disconnected from geopolitical drivers.When trades get reorganized, it creates a need for flexibility and optionality, which is good for product tankers. As long as these trade shifts and arbitrage swings continue, it continues to bode well for tanker markets.Do you have any closing thoughts?We're really pleased with the company we've built over the last 15 years. We have a team and culture that's excited and ready for what the future holds for Ardmore, and we look forward to continuing to develop the business in the years to come.",

    "input": "\nAfter many months of delays, the famed ocean liner s.s.United Statesdeparted her Philadelphia berth at midday on Wednesday, February 19. It is the first step on her final journey to becoming the world’s largest artificial reef sunk off the coast of Florida, and it drew wide attention from onlookers.\nThe ocean liner which still holds the title from 1952 of the fastest large passenger ship to cross the Atlantic had become a fixture on the Delaware River. She docked in an industrial part of the Port of Philadelphia in 1998. She was returning from Turkey and Ukraine where her interiors had been stripped to prepare for a possible new career as a cruise ship which never proceeded. For the past decade, the non-profit S.S. United States Conservancy sought to repurpose the vessel but in the end, was forced to sell the ship after losing a court fight with its landlord that controlled the Philadelphia pier.\nLast week, the vessel was shifted north across the slipway to the adjoining pier to begin the final preparations for the tow, which was later delayed by 48 hours due to weather concerns. High wind warnings delayed the departure one final time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt midday today, tugs positioned along the liner, pulled her out of the slip, and turned her south in the Delaware River. She paused off Pier 80 while the Vinik tug that will be taking her to Mobile, Alabama attached to the anchor chain hanging from the prow.\nThe trip downriver began at around 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, with two tugs on each side and one more on the stern to guide the vessel. The first obstacle was the Walt Whitman Bridge and she reached it just before low tide when the clearance under the bridge would be greatest. Road traffic on the bridge was temporarily stopped for her to pass underneath but images showed the roadway lined with vehicles from the roadway authority and personnel out watching the spectacle as the liner with its two massive funnels transited downriver and under the bridge. Reports were that she would have less than 10 feet beneath the roadway. When she arrived nearly 30 years ago, a radar antenna and a small signal light mast were removed for clearance under the bridge.\nSmall groups of loyal supporters of the liner and curious onlookers gathered at points along the river in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey enduring freezing air temperatures to see the unique sight of the graceful liner underway. Despite being rust streaked, peeling paint, and missing elements such as her lifeboats, she still had a majestic profile far different from the images of today’s cruise ships.\n\n\n\nReports are that it will take 24 hours for the tow to reach the mouth of the Delaware and enter the Atlantic Ocean. The trip to Mobile, Alabama is projected to take about two weeks and the new owners, Florida’s Okaloosa Country, arranged livestream tracking online to follow her path.\nOnce she reaches Mobile, the process for decontamination will continue removing PCBs, asbestos, and other harmful materials. Her fuel tanks need to be emptied of what remains from 1969 when she was last under steam in operation. The funnels, radar mast, and windows all are to be removed before the hull is reefed and the loose paint and decking materials are removed.\n\n\n\nTo many, it seems an ignominious ending to one of the most famous ocean liners. Setting the record at an average of greater than 35 knots, and rumored to be able to achieve speeds of 40 knots, she remains the fastest ocean liner ever built. At nearly 1,000 feet in length, she was sized to be able to transit the Panama Canal and had added military considerations so that she could have converted to a troopship in time of war. Her designer insisted there would be no wood in the passenger areas to make her fireproof and used only lightweight materials to reduce her weight to ensure her speed. She carried former and future U.S. president and many dignitaries, businessmen, military and government personnel, as well as regular travelers and even some immigrants during her career which numbered nearly 800 Atlantic crossings and a handful of cruises.\nCompetition from the jet airplane and government cost-cutting doomed the liner and in 1969 after just 17 years of commercial service her owners, United States Lines, laid up the ship. A symbol of the nation, many expected the government would relent and she would return to service. Instead, the Maritime Administration acquired her in 1973 and later sold her to a real estate developer.\nA succession of owners proposed plans to reactivate the ship, or later to convert her to a static attraction. Okaloosa County acquired her for $1 million in October 2024 and expects to invest up to $10 million in the project to reef the liner, which is expected to take place in 2026.",

The teams are trying to develop a salvage plan as concerns are rising as “ripples” have been spotted on the hull of the 680-foot (207-meter) containership.\nA spokesperson for the Canadian Coast Guard said they are trying to determine if the deformation on the hull came from the grounding or if the vessel is moving on the rocky shoreline. Salvage crews were able to board the ship on Monday, but yesterday, February 18, they encountered 3-meter (10-foot) seas and 30-knot winds. The Coast Guard reports two attempts were made to get aboard but called off due to safety concerns.\nThe owners of the vessel are reportedly working with the Coast Guard and are also looking to bring in additional salvage resources. The Telegram newspaper in Newfoundland reports the owners have retained an offshore service vessel Avalon Seas to assist in the salvage and are also considering hiring a larger, salvage tug.\n\n\n\nNo attempt will be made to pull the vessel off the rocks however until they have been able to complete survey the hull. They want to inspect the ship internally and are also hoping to have divers check the hull if the seas permit. One hope is that the cove where the ship is could become choked with ice that might help to shield the waters from some of the weather.\nThe Coast Guard has not yet determined how much fuel oil is aboard theMSC Baltic III. On Monday, the icebreaker CCGSAnn Harveyarrived on scene and was able to launch its Fast Rescue Craft for a visual assessment. They have also conducted aerial surveys and reported no pollution at this time.\nWorking with MSC, the Coast Guard reports they have determined there are approximately 470 containers aboard but over half are empties. The remainder are loaded with material including food, lumber, and paper supplies. There was no indication of hazardous cargo.\nAnother Canadian Coast Guard vessel, CCGSJean Goodwillhas been delayed due to ongoing work to maintain shipping lanes. As soon as operationally possible, she will also transit to the area off Newfoundland.\nAmong the options the Coast Guard reported will be considered is possibly removing some of the containers or pumping the fuel from the vessel. One concern is if it would be possible to get another vessel alongside. The Coast Guard said it was also considering pumping the fuel to the shore.\nTheMSC Baltic IIIremains wedged up on the rocky shoreline which continues to raise concerns. Bruce English of the Coast Guard told The Telegram the vessel is a big ship, and she is in a bad spot.",

The ceremony took place in Yangzhou, China, and fell on the ninth anniversary of the reorganization of COSCO Shipping into its current form as the sprawling state-controlled entity.\nChinese officials celebrated the achievements of the vessel reporting that COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry identified 163 research topics to address in developing a large methanol-fueled vessel. They report receiving 31 invention patents related to the methanol energy technology for the vessels.\nDesign for the vessel was executed by COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry in Yangzhou to overcome difficulties such as methanol special coating and overall jacking of the upper structure. They report established a methanol system test and methanol filling management system.\nThe series of ships are being equipped with the first domestic WinGD methanol dual-fuel main engine, methanol dual-fuel generator, and Alfa Laval's first methanol dual-fuel boiler. They also equipped a methanol fuel barge and supply system. Intelligent systems were fitted to optimize energy consumption and create energy-saving metrics. The vessels are reported to achieve excellent energy utilization ratios.\n\n\nMethanol bunkering systems were developed for the new vessels (COSCO Shipping)\n\nChina Martine Fuel Jiangsu Company worked with COSCO Shipping to develop the bunkering systems for the vessel including for terminal tank trucks. The processes were certified by China Classification Society and the first refueling of the new vessel took place on December 26 at the shipyard.\nThe first vessel was namedCOSCO Shipping Yangpuand it is completing outfitting. It will also become the first methanol-fueled containership deployed on a transpacific route. It has a large methanol storage system that will enable it to complete a one-way voyage between the Far East and the West Coast of the United States in “pure methanol mode.”\nEach of the vessels of the class has a capacity of 16,136 TEUs on par with Maersk’s methanol class launched with the Ane Maersk (16,000 TEU) which was introduced in January 2024. TheCOSCO Shipping Yangpuhas an overall length of 366 meters (1,200 feet) and a beam of 51 meters (167 feet).\n\n\nSecond ship of the class was floated in December 2024 from the COSCO Heavy Industries shipyard (COSCO Shipping)\n\nConstruction on the first vessel began in April 2024. In December 2024, COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry floated out the second vessel of the class,COSCO Shipping Carnation.\nCOSCO placed an order of four methanol-dual fuel 16,000 TEU container ships in 2023 after an initial order in 2022 for 12 methanol ships each with a capacity of 24,000 TEU which will be deployed for COSCO and OOCL.

Even when combined with regional programs like the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), \"compliance-driven green shipping corridors are unlikely to form\" because of the high cost of new e-fuels - unless supported with some amount of subsidy.\nMore than 60 different green corridor partnerships have been announced to date, by UMAS' tally, some more advanced in planning than others. Since green fuels will be far more expensive, and will need new support infrastructure, the details of each corridor - and how it is affected by changing regulations - are needed to evaluate the business case. UMAS examined specific vessel classes, cargoes and routes, estimating total cost of ownership for four different fuel choices for each one. The authors then estimated the cost gap between the least-expensive compliance option and the cost of running purely on e-fuels on a green shipping corridor. Over time, the cost difference adds up: In one example based on a 45,000 cubic meter gas carrier, the extra cost of participating in a 100-percent e-ammonia green corridor amounted to $72 million over four years.\nLess ambitious options exist and cost far less - for example, running on natural gas-based blue ammonia - but the price differential for a pure e-fuel operation is daunting without support. More complex policy arrangements - like pooling agreements that allow the greenest participants to sell \"overcompliance\" credits to other shipowners - could help incentivize green corridor development, but ultimately some amount of subsidy will likely be required, especially in the early years when IMO regulations are just beginning to phase in.\n\"The most important role Green Corridors can play is to coordinate and kick-start the value chain for tomorrow’s shipping fuels. Participants in corridors will need to be creative in how they leverage a range of regulations, but it’s clear from this work that the scale of their impact will depend on policymakers delivering targeted support for e-fuels,\" said Jesse Fahnestock, Director of Decarbonization at the Global Maritime Forum.",

Transoceansurviveda debt restructuring in 2020 and went on to acquire two major rivals, Songa Offshore and Ocean Rig. Under Thigpen, Transocean overhauled and expanded its fleet and added the world's first 8th-generation, 20,000 PSI-capable drillship. It is now the largest provider of offshore drilling services by revenue and has the most technologically advanced fleet in the industry (though China's state-owned COSL leads by unit count.)\nAs part of a multiyear plan, Thigpen will step aside and be replaced in the CEO role by Keelan Adamson, the company's current president and COO. The transition will take place over the course of the next few months.\n\"Throughout his three decades with Transocean, where his experience has taken him from the drill floor to the executive level, Keelan has helped to shape the foundation of the company and position Transocean for sustained success as the industry’s market leader,\" said Transocean board chairman Chad Deaton.\nAn aeronautical engineer by training, Adamson joined Transocean in 1995 and held rig management roles throughout the company's global operations. He was promoted to run the North American region, then headed up a variety of VP-level roles at headquarters before taking over as SVP of Operations in 2017. He has been at the helm as COO since 2018, adding the title of president in 2022.\nThigpen will continue in his current role as CEO until the handover is completed, and will then (subject to shareholder approval) take over as chairman of Transocean's board. Deaton will continue on as the board's lead independent director.\n\"Transocean is a resilient and strong organization, made stronger by leaders like Keelan whom I have had the pleasure of working closely with for the past decade. Keelan is the right person to lead Transocean as we build upon the company’s position as the leader in offshore drilling,\" said Thigpen in a statement.",

The frigate arrived separately, transiting the Torres Strait and passing off the coast of the Northern Territories before meeting up with Weishanhu.\nAccording to the FT, the Chinese task force approached about 150 nautical miles east of Sydney, within Australia's EEZ. It also spent time on the other side of the Tasman Sea, near New Zealand's shores, and Australia has been working closely with its neighbor to monitor the PLA Navy's movements.\n\"We have not been informed by the Chinese government why this task group has been deployed into our region, and we have not been informed what its future plans are,\" New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins said.\nZunyiis a Type 055 cruiser, newly commissioned in 2023. The 13,000-tonne Type 055 is China's largest and most advanced surface combatant, equipped with 112 VLS cells and an advanced AESA radar system.Hengyangis a Type 054A multirole frigate commissioned in 2008. She has 32 VLS cells for air defense missiles and antisubmarine missiles, plus separate deck launchers for another eight antiship missiles.\n\"I've instructed that Navy and Air Force assets be deployed to make sure that we are watching exactly what the task group is doing. We'll do that in a manner that is safe and professional. That's very much our right,\" Australian deputy prime minister Richard Marles told media last week. He noted that the transit is unusual, but not unprecedented.\nIt is the latest in a long series of encounters between Chinese and Australian forces. On February 11, a Royal Australian Air Force P-8A maritime patrol aircraft was operating over the South China Sea when it experienced \"an unsafe and unprofessional interaction\" with a PLA Air Force fighter. The Chinese jet fired off flares near the Australian patrol plane, creating risk for the P-8A and its crew, Australia's defense department said.",

    "input": "\nUS Central Command has belatedly confirmed that on January 28, the US Coast Guard Sentinel Class cutter USCGCClarence Sutphin Jr.intercepted a dhow in the Arabian Sea and discovered a consignment of Iranian arms and explosives on board.\nThe consignment consisted of components for medium-range ballistic missiles and unmanned sea drones, plus military-grade communication and network equipment and anti-tank guided missile launcher assemblies.\nThe delay in releasing details of the seizure may have occurred because the US Coast Guard boarding party are also likely to have gathered material which after analysis proved that the consignment had been dispatched from Iran and was en route to Houthi forces in Yemen.\n\nArms, explosives and equipment seized by USCGC Clarence Sutphin Jr on January 28 (NAVCENT)\nThe seizure conforms to a well-established pattern, confirmed in annual United Nations Panel of Expert reports. Materiel destined for the Houthis is loaded onto nondescript dhows, manned by stateless crews, from warehouses controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force Unit 190 in Chah Bahar, Bandar Abbas and elsewhere. The material is transshipped to fishing vessels from the Yemeni coast, and is then smuggled over beaches and through to Houthi-controlled areas.\nIn the last year, however, some smuggling dhows have sailed directly into small fishing ports in Houthi-controlled areas of the Red Sea. The Unit 190 logistic plan is to assume that some loads will be intercepted and lost – but if consignments are spread across numerous vessels, enough materiel will get through.\nThe seizure indicates that Iran still has undiminished intent to keep the Houthis well-supplied, maintaining the dispersed threat that Iran orchestrates through its control of the Axis of Resistance. Hezbollah and Iranian-linked militias in Syria may be much diminished as part of this constellation, but the Houthis remain a potent contributor to the Iranian-controlled capability, and much valued because the Houthis disperse the threat. Stocks of missiles and drones expended before the ceasefire came into effect in the Red Sea, or destroyed by US, Israeli and UK air strikes, all need to be replenished.\nThe Iranian leadership is nervous about the intentions of the new Trump administration, as well as the threat to the Iranian nuclear program from Israel. Ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon have provided Israel additional space for maneuvering, and previous attacks on Iran have weakened its air defenses.\nIn a speech in Tabriz on the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei acknowledged the increased risk of attack and said that Iran’s ‘capability to counter hard threats is at an \"excellent level.\"  Almost all of Iran’s ballistic missile capability - which is spread across 25 underground complexes - remains intact, and would be capable of launching a much heavier attack than Iran’s Operation True Promise-2 launched against Israel on October 1, 2024. Senior IRGC leaders have echoed the threat of an Operation True Promise-3.\nIran is also building up that missile inventory. To meet the solid fuel needs for its production of ballistic missiles, Iran successfully landed 34 containers loaded with sodium perchlorate when the MVGolbondocked in Bandar Abbas last week. Sodium perchlorate is processed into ammonium perchlorate rocket fuel, demand for which Iran is unable to satisfy from domestic sources. A sister ship, MVJairani, planned to have a similar load on board and is still on its way back from Shanghai.",

    "input": "Swedish authorities confirmed this morning, February 21, that they have launched an investigation into newly discovered damage on another undersea Baltic transmission cable. News of the investigation came as the European Commission’s Executive Committee mapped out new steps to protect critical infrastructure including calling for enforcing sanctions against the shadow fleet.\nFew details have been provided on the latest incident other than a brief statement from the Swedish Police saying they were investigating “a suspected cable break in the Baltic Sea within the Swedish economic zone. The preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage was initiated so that the police can have access to the tools needed to clarify what happened and whether it is a new or old injury.”\nThe Swedish Coast Guard confirmed that its patrol boatKBV 003is on its way to east of Gotland. According to the media reports, the cable runs past Gotland and through the Swedish zone while connecting Finland to Germany.\nSeparately, Cinia Communications, the Finish state majority-owned company, issued a brief statement reporting, “Some disturbance has been detected on the C-Lion1 submarine cable between Finland and Germany.” This would be the third incident involving the same cable which was damaged in November and December 2024. Cinia, however, is reporting today “The disturbance does not affect the functionality of telecommunications connections running in the cable and the data traffic continues flowing normally.” The company however has submitted a request for investigation to Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).\n“No realm of life is free from threats or hostile behavior today,” said Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission reporting the planned actions by the EC High Representatives. “Today we are taking steps to protect cables, detect and anticipate threats more quickly, and repair damage as fast as possible. We should mobilize all our strengths, military and civil capacities to ensure surveillance and attribute attacks quicker, sanctioning those responsible of sabotage. Would-be perpetrators must also be deterred.”\nThe Joint Communication issued after the meeting in Helsinki maps out specific actions that they said will be progressively rolled out in 2025 and 2026. This comes in addition to the current efforts by member states and NATO to increase monitoring in the Baltic. The High Representative body said the steps being introduced are a range of measures to bolster the resilience of this critical infrastructure, address prevention, detection, response, recovery, and deterrence.\nForcing on the deterrence aspect, the plan calls for “Enforcing sanctions and diplomatic measures against hostile actors and the ‘shadow fleet', making full use of the Hybrid Toolbox to address hybrid campaigns.”\nPrevention will include stepping up security requirements and risk assessments on submarine cables while the body is calling for funding the development of new and smart cables, allowing for redundancies and enhancing resilience. They want to enhance threat-monitoring capabilities and improve the efficiency of response and recovery efforts.\nBy the end of 2025, the Commission and the High Representative are expected to present, amongst other actions, the mapping of existing and planned submarine cable infrastructures, a Coordinated Risk Assessment on submarine cables, a Cable Security Toolbox of mitigating measures, and a priority list of Cable Projects of European Interest.",

    "input": "Russian authorities are denying media reports that another one of the decrepit fleet of ancient cargo ships operating on the Sea of Azov is in distress. The media is saying the vessel was taking on water while the authorities insist the vessel was in port and repaired.\nThe general cargo ship Pavel Grabovsky, built in 1979, loaded a cargo of 3,000 tons of corn and departed Rostov-on-Don bound for Turkey.  After passing the city of Azov, the vessel reportedly encountered ice and was damaged on February 16 without issuing a distress call.\nThe media indicated the vessel struck ice and the crew was attempting to control the flooding with its pumps. However, at some point during the week, the crew realized they were not able to control the flooding and asked for permission to return to Azov.\nThe reports vary from here with the media saying the ship had too deep a draft and due to water levels was unable to reach the port and went aground. The icebreakers Kapiran Demidov and Kapitan Chudinnov were reported to be making their way to assist the vessel.\n\n\n\nTASS issued an official report denying the media accounts and saying the vessel had reached Azov and repairs were made. They however are admitting the vessel went aground but said it was due to weather conditions as the cargo ship was departing Azov to resume its trip to Turkey. Citing the Ministry of Transport, TASS indicates that when the weather improves and sea levels rise, the vessel will be removed from the roadstead and the owner will make further repairs.\nThe vessel is registered in Panama and 3,100 dwt. Equasis indicates it has been under the management of a Turkish company since 2013. The Pavel Grabovsky had a similar incident in 2013 when it had to be rescued after stranding. At the time, it was registered in Sierra Leone. There was a crew of 14 aboard and they had loaded a cargo of wheat. The ship went aground in the port of Azov.\nRecords show the vessel was inspected at the end of January 2025 in Georgia. The report lists eight deficiencies but no detention order was issued. The issues ranged from problems with the life saving equipment to piping, electrical, safety of the pilot ladders, and documentation.\nAfter two incidents at the end of 2024 involving Russian sea-river tankers near the Kerch Strait at the exit from the Sea of Azov, the Russian Ministry of Transport reportedly issued aninspection orderfor all the old vessels operating in the region. Officials indicated as many as 500 shipping companies and their vessels would be subject to the inspections as part of an effort to improve the image of shipping and the response to the oil spill from one of the tankers lost in December.",

    "input": "The NTSB has released its investigative report on the deadly blaze aboard the aging boxshipStride, which sustained an engine room fire at Port of Houston early last year. The fire was caused by the installation of the wrong kind of valve, which led to an overflow of fuel into the engine room.\nOn January 8, 2024,Stridewas alongside at the Barbours Cut Marine Terminal and taking on bunkers. The chief engineer and third engineer were in the engine room to monitor the transfer, and they began the bunkering sequence by lining up valves to put diesel into the port and starboard diesel oil tanks simultaneously. Transfer began at 0305 at a slow speed, then - at the chief's request - ramped up to maximum pressure and flow rate.\nAll was normal until 0325, when the wiper - who was on the 3rd deck of the engine room - saw diesel dripping down from the upper levels. He ran to the engine control room and alerted the chief and the third engineer, who began yelling on the radio. The tankerman on the bunker barge and the captain on the bunkering tug both heard \"excited chatter\" on VHF, and the tug master ordered the tankerman to shut down transfer immediately. The tankerman shut down the pump right away and valved off the discharge. At about this point, the crewmember stationed atStride'sbunker manifold said the pressure gauge spiked to about 30 PSI, up from zero earlier in the evolution.\nMinutes later, at about 0330, a fire and explosion occurred in the engine room, sending flames up to six feet out of the open engine room hatch. The captain heard the blast and ran to the bridge to shut down all emergency stops, including the ventilation fans, the boiler and the oil pumps, and he sounded the general alarm.\nOn the captain's orders, the crew sealed the hatch and the ventilation ducts to the engine room, with three crewmembers still inside. The crew ran out fire hoses and began boundary cooling on the outside of the engine room.\nAt 0336, the chief engineer reported by radio that he, the wiper and the third engineer were still trapped. Two minutes later, a fire team suited up and attempted to enter the engine room through a scuttle, but could not because of heavy smoke. They tried again at 0345 through an entrance on the upper deck, but were repelled by the fire. At 0350, one member of the fire team made it inside, but could not locate the missing crewmembers before he had to retreat.\nShoreside fire teams began arriving at 0343, along with a fireboat, which provided boundary cooling. A local fire department leader recommended discharging CO2 in the engine room, but the master refused, since he still had people inside.\nAt 0415, the fire team finally managed to reach the engine control room. The blaze was out, but the space was filled with thick smoke. They found the victims; only the wiper was still breathing, and paramedics pronounced the chief engineer and third engineer dead on scene.\nAt the fire department's request, the engine room was sealed and filled with CO2 for 24 hours to ensure that the blaze was out.\nAfter the fire, diesel fuel was found on all decks of the engine room, dripping out of the funnel casing and coating the interior of the funnel. It was pooled in large quantities around the base of the main engine. The fire damage throughout the engine room was so extensive that the 27-year-old ship was declared a constructive total loss and scrapped.\nInvestigators found that the starboard side diesel tank had overfilled, and the pressure pushed fuel through the vent pipe, eight decks up into the funnel. The fuel then flooded out of cracks in a badly-repaired cutout section of the vent and dripped back down the funnel casing. (Class found that three of the owner's other vessels had the same cutout in the vent.)\nWeeks prior, theStride'soffgoing chief engineer had ordered the wrong valve as a replacement for the angle stop valve on the port side diesel tank. The new valve was a one-way check valve, not a stop valve, and it was installed in an orientation that prevented any diesel from going into the tank - even when the valve was nominally open.\nWhen the oncoming chief engineer lined up the valves to fill both port and starboard tanks at the same time, he was actually filling only the starboard tank, since no fuel could get past the check valve on the port side. The starboard tank rapidly overfilled, then sent the excess diesel up the vent pipe, causing the casualty.\n\"Vessel drawings contain piping symbols for equipment such as valve types, sizes, and functions. Owners, operators, and crews should carefully note all components of a vessel’s drawings and diagrams to ensure that proper spare or replacement parts are ordered to maintain functionality,\" noted NTSB. \"Crews should ensure adequate personnel are available to take frequent soundings, establish fuel tank filling rates, and communicate to the person in charge, so tanks are monitored and do not overflow.\"",

According to multiple media reports, the investigation is looking at terrorism as details also emerged on two other incidents with tankers in recent weeks in the Mediterranean.\nThe anti-terrorism unit of Genoa’s Public Prosecutor’s Office has reportedly become involved in the incident that damaged the Greek-ownedSeajewel(108,888 dwt) overnight between February 14 and 15. The Port Authority of Savona, Italy confirmed earlier this week that offloading operations had been suspended afteranomalies were observedwithout specifying what happened.\nThe chief prosecutor told Reuters they have taken the data from the vessel’s “black box” as part of an investigation into possible terrorist activities. The report indicates divers found a 28 x 47-inch hole in the hull of the tanker. Previously the report said the plates were driven inward indicating external force. They also cited the presence of dead fish in the area.\nThe vessel’s owner Thenamaris of Greece confirmed that the crew was safe while also mentioning that there were third-party individuals involved in the offloading. They said the Greek authorities were also investigating and in the same statement said the investigation involved a second tanker,Seacharm(112,000 dwt) which had been damaged in January while sailing to Turkey.\nThat caused widespread speculation fueled by a report by Lloyd’s List that detailed yet another previously unreported incident involving a tanker. The reports indicate the product tankerGrace Ferrum(50,000 dwt) was damaged while at anchor in Libyan waters and remains at the port weeks later.\nBloomberg points out that both of the Thenamaris tankers in the past had called at Russia’s Novorossiysk port and previously transported Russian oil. They state that it appears neither tanker was violating sanctions carrying Russian oil this year when they were damaged. TheGrace Ferrumhad called at Ust-Luga in the Baltic. Russian authorities also asserted that another tanker,Koala, wasattacked causing the explosionwhile it was in the port of Ust-Luga.\nThe four incidents all occurring in 2025 have prompted media speculation that vessels in the Russian oil trade are being targeted. Italian and Greek investigators will be looking into these allegations as they seek the cause of the damage to the Thenamaris tankers.\nAdding to the speculation are also the allegations that the Russian cargo ship Ursa Major operating as a military sealift ship was attacked causing it to sink in December 2024. The operator of the vesselasserted it was an attackthat sunk the vessel while the Russian fleet off Syria also came under pressure with reports of at least one fire aboard a ship being used as part of the Syrian evacuation.\nOfficials have said it is far too early to link these incidents. They could be a coincidence or possibly someone is targeting shipping supporting Russia.",

    "input": "\nHMM, which itself was the subject of takeover talks a year ago, is poised to consolidate the South Korean shipping industry. According to a report in Business Korea and other media outlets, HMM has been selected as the preferred bidder to acquire control of SK Shipping, Korea’s leader in energy shipping. The deal aligns with HMM’s declared strategy to expand beyond its primary operations in container shipping.\nSK Shipping was started in 1982 and remained a part of the SK Conglomerate until being acquired in 2018 by investment group Hahn & Co. Since then, the company has been reshaped shedding old ships and building its position in crude oil, LNG, LPG, bulk shipping, and bunkering.\nHahn has been exploring selling the crude oil tankers and then in October 2024 was reported to have retained Morgan Stanley to shop the company. Hahn paid approximately $1 billion for a stake that today is nearly 80 percent of SK Shipping with the media reports saying Hahn is seeking $2.8 billion for control of the company. The former parent, SK Group, retains approximately 16 percent ownership.\nHMM is reported to be starting due diligence after being selected as the preferred bidder. The media reports suggest a deal would be completed by as early as April.\nIn addition to discussions on the valuation, one challenge the media reports highlight is a non-compete agreement that still covers the LNG business for HMM. During the restructuring of the former Hyundai Merchant Marine, the company in 2014 sold its LNG carrier business to an investment firm and entered into a non-compete agreement in place till 2029. HMM recently explored reacquiring its LNG business but the investment firm in late 2024 delayed the sale of the unit for two more years.\nSpeculation is that HMM might proceed without the dozen LNG carriers owned by SK Shipping. HMM is expected to make an offer of $1.4 billion for the 22 crude oil tankers, 14 LPG carriers, 10 bulk carriers, and seven bunker ships. It would expand and diversify HMM’s tanker and non-container operations.\nThe sale of HMM by the state-controlled banks was canceled in 2024 when the banks failed to come to terms with Harim Group and private equity fund JKL Partners which had been selected as the preferred bidder. HMM has emphasized a growth strategy continuing after it reported its third-highest-ever sales in 2024 topping performance during the peak of the pandemic-related surge in shipping.\nHMM is currently ranked eighth in container shipping with a total capacity of just over 900,000 TEU. To increase profitability the company said it will be introducing 12 new 13,000 TEU containerships deploying them on routes to the Americas and opening a new route to Mexico. The company has an orderbook for nine additional containerships with 9,000 EU capacity and methanol or LNG fueled. HMM is also poised to enter ownership in the car carrier sector ordering ships that will operate under long-term charters to Hyundai-Glovis.",

Austin-based Saronic is planning the most ambitious infrastructure venture in autonomous navigation in the West, and it hopes to bypass shipyard labor constraints through advanced automation.\nSaronic's primary client is the U.S. Navy, and to date, Saronic's vessel classes have been at the small end. It has models measuring up to 24 feet in length, and produces them in-house. Small unmanned vessels have inherent limitations with range and weather, but have proven their battlefield value with Ukrainian forces in the Black Sea.\nSaronic has plans to build a \"larger\" autonomous vessel class, and though it has not published specifics, its promotional illustrations indicate vessels in the crewboat size range - a familiar format from the \"Ghost Fleet Overlord\" USV program. Compared to the Navy's own design-build programs for manned warships, Saronic is moving very quickly: All three of its small models went from concept to in-water prototypes in just six months, and it has grown into a 300-person company with nearly $1 billion raised in less than three years.\n\"We're going to take those same principles of mission-centric design, of affordability and scalability and the most advanced software in the world and we're going to move that into autonomous ships and autonomous shipbuilding for the Navy,\" CEO Dino Mavrookas told Defense One. He pledged billions of dollars in investment and a program to restore U.S. shipbuilding at a scale \"we have not seen since WWII.\"\nSaronic is still looking for a location for its future \"Port Alpha\" yard, but it plans to have a real facility on acreage within five years. That future yard will look different, according to the firm. Saronic's management team is not from the shipbuilding sector, and it plans to \"rethink the mechanics of shipbuilding from the foundation up, leveraging insights from the last decade of domestic manufacturing improvements.\" The objective is to remove inefficiencies through a production-line approach, saving money and improving quality.\n\"We're looking at a new class of vessels with a new way of building them, unburdened by what some of the constraints the current shipbuilding industrial base are hindered by,\" Saronic co-founder Rob Lehman told reporters.",

It is the first time that a company's top leader has been convicted and sentenced for breaching safety duties in New Zealand.\nThe sentencing stems from an August 2020 incident in which stevedore Pala’amo (Amo) Kalati was crushed by a container at the port. The containership Constantinos P was docked in Auckland discharging containers at the Fergusson Container Terminal. Kalati, 31, and a colleague were working as lashers securing the containers to be lifted off the vessel. A lift went terribly wrong when two boxes were to be hoisted but a third was still partially attached. As they were hoisted, the third container fell loose, crashing down and killing Kalati.\nFollowing his death, Maritime NZ filed two alternative charges, one against Ports of Auckland and the other against Tony Gibson, who served as CEO between 2011 and 2021. The charges were for a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.\nGibson's conviction and his subsequent sentencing mark the first time an officer of a large company has been convicted of a breach of their duties for safety in New Zealand. “Gibson had the knowledge, influence, resources and opportunity to address safety gaps and ensure that appropriate systems were in place at the port, but failed to do so,” said Kirstie Hewlett, Maritime NZ Director. She added that during Gibson’s tenure, Auckland was convicted of several offenses under health and safety legislation, with some resulting in fatalities and serious injuries.\nMaritime NZ highlighted that the case should serve as a strong reminder to the top leadership of large companies that they need to understand the risks at their businesses and put in place controls and systems that ensure workplace safety.\nPorts of Auckland was also charged and sentenced in the case, and was ordered to pay a fine of $320,000 (NZ$561,000).\nAs New Zealand’s largest container facility, Auckland handles about 850,000 TEU annually, equal to about 25 percent of the country’s containerized freight volume.",

The two companies announced today the plans to launch Seascale Energy. By combining strengths, the two companies said they aim to set a new standard for marine fuel procurement by delivering considerable cost efficiencies, transparency, and access to sustainable fuel innovations.\nExpected to launch in mid-2025, Seascale Energy will initially represent 7.5 million metric tons in bunkering volume placing it solidly among the ten largest bunker providers. It will be jointly owned and managed under a dual-CEO structure with officers ranging from Singapore to Geneva, Copenhagen, and Houston.\n“Our vision is to lead the energy transition in shipping, unlocking value for our stakeholders while addressing industry challenges around transparency, quality, and decarbonization,” said Jan Dieleman, President of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business. “Together, we are shaping a more sustainable future for marine fuel procurement.”\nCargill best known as an agricultural company and trader also operates a large shipping division. In 2021, the company launched Pure Marine Fuels as a partnership with Maersk Tankers. The two companies said they purchased over 4 million tons of bunkers annually. In a 2023 interview with S&P, Cargill highlighted its growing position in biofuels. For its shipping operations, Cargill working with Lauritzen ordered what are likely to become the first methanol-fueled bulkers due to introduction this year and next.\nHafnia leads the Bunker Alliance which has over 20 participants from the shipping industry. It reports that the alliance, with a yearly volume of over 3.5 million metric tons, purchases fuel for over 1000 vessels. It ranks among the top 10 bunkering companies in the world.\nBy consolidating bunker purchasing volumes, Seascale Energy reports it will secure even more competitive pricing and terms while providing tailored procurement solutions to meet its customers’ diverse needs. It will also offer an expanded global port network, giving customers a consistent, high-quality fuel supply worldwide.\n“As one of the largest services of its kind, led by two large-scale fuel users, we are committed to improving efficiency and addressing industry challenges to benefit our stakeholders across the maritime sector,” said Hafnia CEO Mikael Skov.\nThe joint venture reports it will offer shipowners and charterers improved transparency and scale, enabling them to secure competitive deals and benchmark performance.

TheAgogo FPSOwill be handed over by the end of the month, more than a month ahead of schedule setting a record for conversion speed, and will depart for Angola where it will operate for at least the next 15 years.\nThe Malaysian company was awarded the contract for the FPSO by Azule Energy a joint venture between BP and Eni in February 2023. Azule Energy has a 15-year charter with an option for five additional years in a deal valued at approximately $5.3 billion.\n\n\nFPSO named at the COSCO Shanghai shipyard on February 20 (Yinson)\n\nThe basis for the project is a VLCC crude oil tanker built in 2009. The 321,300 dwt vessel registered in Singapore launched a conversion that took a total of 24 months, including seven months of integration work carried out in Shanghai at the COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry yard. COSCO highlights the previous fastest conversion was 27 months for the YinsonMaria Quiteria FPSOdelivered in April 2024. The new FPSO measures approximately 1,093 feet (333 meters) in length.\nThey are highlighting the advanced technologies aboard the vessel being deployed for the first time in the sector. The vessel uses an absorbent system to clean the post production gas emissions combined with a carbon storage system. It is billed as the first carbon capture and storage system of its kind deployed on an offshore FPSO.\nBy capturing carbon dioxide from the flue gas after the combustion of the ship's gas turbines, it significantly reduces FPSO greenhouse gas emissions. According to the shipowner, the installation of this device can reduce carbon emissions by about 27%, which based on the expected rate of crude oil production will equate to an estimated CO2 emissions reduction of about 230,000 tons per year. The Agogo FPSO has a production rate of 120,000 barrels per day.\n\nChina recently completed the construction of the world's first floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The vessel is scheduled for delivery by the end of February.https://t.co/OyXok02B3Npic.twitter.com/h7ZU85HOb4\n\nTheAgogo FPSOfeatures additional cutting-edge carbon reduction technologies. These include a closed flare system, hydrocarbon blanketing, combined cycle technology, automated process controls, and an all-electric drive systems.\nThe Agogo field, which was discovered in 2019, is positioned approximately 100 miles from the coast of Angola. It is in the Atlantic near the northern border of Angola at a depth of approximately 1,700 meters. The field started production in 2020 and the new FPSO will become the third on the field.",

    "input": "The collation of four of America’s most powerful unions issued a letter calling on Donald Trump to finish the process started under the Biden Administration to sanction China for its efforts to dominate shipbuilding, the maritime and logistics sectors. Trump has stated his concern for the shipbuilding industry while in Congress efforts continue on the proposed SHIPS for America Act, which the sponsors say is the first unified effort to rebuild the U.S. merchant marine and shipbuilding.\nThe presidents of the United Steelworkers International, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, jointly signed the letter dated February 19. In it, they are, “urging your administration to enforce strong penalties against China for its unfair trade practices, particularly in shipbuilding, maritime, and logistics sectors.”\nThe five unions filed aformal complaintin March 2024 under the U.S. Trade Act and were successful in getting the Trade Representative’s Office to launch a formal investigation. The Biden Administration came out in favor of the action and carried it through to aformal report and recommendationsissued in its closing days.\nThe letter cites the report and its finding that the “Chinese Community Party advanced a systematic array of unfair trade practices and economic policies designed to dominate and control the maritime, shipbuilding, and logistics sectors.” They highlight the findings that China distributed over $100 billion in unfair support for its shipbuilding industry. They point out that China received 71 percent of the shipbuilding orders in 2024 producing over 1,000 ships last year. They report the U.S. produced fewer than 10 ocean-going commercial ships in 2024 and has fewer than 80 in service. China by comparison they report has more than 5,500 flagged ocean-going merchant vessels.\n“We urge you to take responsible action to impose tough penalties against vessels built according to the plans, policies, and actions of the Chinese Communist Party and to adopt complementary policies that rebuild America’s shipbuilding capacity and workforce,” the unions write in their letter to the president. They pointed out last year when they launched this initiative, they called for actions to deter the purchase of Chinese-built ships from entering U.S. ports.\nThe U.S. Trade Representative made recommendations calling for action. The Biden Administration agreed that responsive action was necessary but left it to the new administration to formulate the steps as part of its broader tariff program against China.\nTrump has recently made comments in interviews about the lack of U.S. shipbuilding capabilities. He has said the U.S. might call on Allies such as South Korea to bolster its shipbuilding programs.\nChina has repeatedly criticized the investigation calling it short-sighted, lacking facts, and shifting blame for the decline of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. They point to the U.S.’s decline in shipbuilding since the 1940s and 1950s and the lack of investment to modernize and employ new technologies. The investigation they said was part of the China fear program led by the U.S.\nThe call to involve President Trump comes as Senator Mark Kelly and Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon visited the Philly Shipyard recently acquired by South Korea’s Hanwha Group. While touring the facilities and the training ship State of Maine which is outfitting at the yard, Kelly highlighted the importance of strengthening the U.S. maritime industry through the bipartisanSHIPS for America Act. He said it aims to rebuild the U.S. shipyard base and expand efforts to recruit, train, and retain skilled mariners and shipyard workers.",

    "input": "\nFollowing a union complaint about unfair Chinese competition in shipping and shipbuilding, the Trump administration's trade representative has proposed unprecedented access fees for Chinese-operated and Chinese-built ships - fees large enough to change the economics of container shipping in the U.S. market.\nChina's state-led shipbuilding sector dominates the global market for new tonnage, and China is the leading shipowning nation (by some metrics). Decades of preferential funding and government support have allowed Chinese shipyards to deliver useful tonnage at prices that other international competitors cannot match.\nThe USTR's action has been coming since at least last year. The White House's office of the  U.S. Trade Representative began looking at ways to deploy Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to counter China's shipping dominance strategy in 2024. The Act gives the president broad authority to take action against foreign nations that engage in unfair trade practices. It has been used extensively in the past to counter Chinese exporters' practice of selling goods below cost to gain market share.\n\"The U.S. Trade Representative determined that China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance is unreasonable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce, and thus is actionable,\" the USTR wrote in a Federal Register notice Friday.\nThe proposed fee structure is complex and steep, and the register notice contains several policy alternatives. All would be quite costly for the operator:\n- Each U.S. port call for any vessel operated by Chinese interests will be subject to a fee of either a) $1 million per ship for any size vessel, from tugboats up to VLCCs; or b) $1,000 per deadweight tonne - a far lower price.\n- Each U.S. port call for each vessel built in China, but operated by non-Chinese interests, will be subject to a fee of up to $1 million, depending on the proportion of Chinese-built ships in that operator's fleet.\n- Operators who have newbuilds on order in China will face additional fees of up to $1 million per port call.\n- If an operator owns a U.S.-built vessel, each port call of that vessel in the U.S. could generate a refund in an amount of up to $1 million per entry. Specifics for minimum vessel size, cargo volume, voyage distance or port call duration were not provided.\nThe proposal also includes an ambitious proposal to require that an increasing percentage of U.S. exports be carried on U.S.-flagged tonnage. The schedule would ramp up fast with a one-percent U.S.flagged quota effective immediately, followed by three percent by 2027, five percent by 2028, and 15 percent by 2032. A parallel quota requiring exports on U.S.-built vessels would take effect beginning in 2028, ramping up to an ambitious five percent by 2032.\nThe USTR did not specify whether the percentage of U.S. export cargo would be measured by tonnage or by dollar value.\n",

George Wikoff, commander of US Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), has brought to a close International Maritime Exercise (IMX) 2025, completing the ninth iteration of this international naval exercise since it was first was held in 2012. This year, the main centers of exercise activity were in Aqaba (Jordan) and Bahrain, with some practical phases at sea.\nThe exercise started with senior naval staff academic discussions and brainstorming covering the naval planning process, maritime operations center procedures, and disaster response coordination.\nThe exercise then moved on to a Command Post Exercise over a distributed network, involving both naval command headquarters but also civilian maritime coordination centers such as the Seychelles’ Regional Coordination Operations Centre and Oman’s Maritime Security Centre. Scenarios were played out covering the Red Sea, the Arabian Gulf, and the Gulf of Aden and Oman. The exercise was directed by Commodore Rashid Mahmood Sheikh from Pakistan, who in a press release reported that international participation had brought different perspectives on how to deal with similar incidents at sea.\n\n\nDivers leap from a Sea Dragon helicopter for floating mine response operations during International Maritime Exercise (IMX) 2025\n\nAn operational phase at sea or afloat focused on mine and countermeasures; visit, board, search and seizure procedures; unmanned systems and artificial intelligence integration; explosive ordnance disposal; vessel and harbor defense; search and rescue; and the coordination of responses to mass casualty events.\nNAVCENT reported that more than 5,000 personnel from more than 35 nations and international organizations had taken part in the different phases of the exercise. However, NAVCENT did not publish a list of participating countries, leaving your correspondent to identify participants from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Djibouti, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Yemen and the UK. Potentially present but not spotted were any sailors from Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, whose participation at this time would be of particular political interest. The UAE withdrew its operational participation in NAVCENT-led Combined Maritime Force operations in March 2023, citing its failure to prevent Iranian ship hijackings. But in early February, the Emiratis hosted three ships from the IRGC Navy and the Sina Class fast attack craft IRINS Zereh (P235) on a port visit to Sharjah, suggesting some sort of realignment of interests.\n\n\nPoseidon aircraft conducts a low elevation flight over participating ships in the Gulf of Oman\n\nIn coordination with IMX 2025, US Africa Command has been simultaneously holding Exercise Cutlass Express. Cutlass Express has had the same phases as IMX 2025 – academic, Command Post Exercise, and practical training – but covers participating nations from the East African coast and the Western Indian Ocean. This year’s participants are Belgium, Comoros, Djibouti, France, Georgia, India, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal, Seychelles, Somalia, Tanzania, Tunisia, and the UK. The exercise is directed from the Naples headquarters of the US 6th Fleet. The geographical focus of this year’s exercise was Mauritius, Seychelles, and Tanzania, and involved nine maritime operation centers located throughout the region.\n",

Teams reported that they were not surprised by finding oily water in the engine room and seawater in the cargo holds, but they have also confirmed that concerning deformations have been identified midship on the hull.\nWeather continued to present challenges with the teams on Friday, February 21, encountering winds that were still reaching over 60 mph in the cove where the ship was aground. Despite that, they were able to get aboard the ship on Thursday and again on Friday and also put an ROV into the water to survey the hull.\nThe survey showed that 75 percent of the hull is resting on the bottom which they viewed as good news. Also, the stern is aground with the bow remaining afloat. The heavier stern being aground is reducing some of the pressures on the hull. Bruce English of the Canadian Coast Guard told The Telegram newspaper on Friday that the ship is now firmly aground also reducing pressures. In the first days, he said they had observed the stern areas moving in the waves, but now he told the paper “Nothing is moving. The vessel is stable where it is right now.”\nEfforts are underway to sound the vessel’s tanks to determine the amount of fuel and lubricants aboard. The ship had been at sea since departing Montreal on February 5, before it went aground. The concern is for an oil leak or pollution, but so far none have been observed.\n\n\nDamage is visible midship below the letter \"S\" (Canadian Coast Guard)\n\n\n(Dan Lushman photo)\n\nThe Canadian Coast Guard vesselJean Goodwillremains in the area and is loaded with materials that could be used to control a spill. On Friday, the vessel was permitted to enter Corner Brook, but the Canadian Coast Guard reports it will remain in Newfoundland. The offshore service vesselAvalon Sea, which had initially been brought in possibly to assist in towing the containership, however, has been released. English told the newspaper that nothing would be happening quickly and with the fuel and damage to the hull, there is no immediate plan to pull the vessel off the shore.\n\n\nThe heavier stern section is aground reducing some stress on the hull (Canadian Coast Guard)\n\nEnglish said the first step will likely be removing the fuel and other polluting materials loaded aboard theMSC Baltic III. Previously, they had said they would consider removing containers. The ship has approximately 470 containers aboard, but according to the Coast Guard, over half of which are empty.\nThe Coast Guard said while it understands the interest it is encouraging people to stay clear of the area. They also imposed a safety zone and a no-fly zone for drones around the vessel. English said after getting the 20 crew off the vessel safely, the concern now is not to endanger anyone else as they continue to explore salvage options.\n",

The first installation will be on a new patrol boat for France.\nThe new vessel will be built by the Socarenam shipyards with designed by French naval architecture firm. Mauric. The contract for the design and shipbuilding was awarded in December 2024 by the Directorate General for Maritime Affairs, Fisheries and Aquaculture (DGAMPA) which is responsible for maritime surveillance on the French Atlantic coast. The tender was launched in January 2024.\nWith a length of 54 meters (177 feet), the offshore patrol vessel is designed for extended 12-day missions. Capabilities for extended missions and energy efficiency were key to the design. The vessel will employ a diesel-electric hybrid system with wind-assisted propulsion. It is designed to provide the vessel with a maximum speed of 17 knots and a range exceeding 3,600 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 12 knots.\nMichelin was selected to provide the wind propulsion deploying its WISAMO (Wing Sail Mobility) project. The wingsail will have a surface area of 170 square meters (1,829 square feet). Michelin reports a fuel consumption reduction of approximately 15 percent is expected through optimizations of the design and the vessel’s operational profile.\nThe WISAMO concept consists of a telescopic, inflatable wingsail. It includes an intuitive, automated control system and a simplified interface that greatly reduces the challenges of vessel integration. The system is based on three key components, including a self-supporting telescopic mast that is fully retractable and a durable lightweight fabric envelope that is inflated at low pressure to form a symmetrical wingsail profile. A fully automated control system manages all sail functions (hoisting, lowering, adjusting, maneuvering, reefing, and protective stowage according to environmental conditions), eliminating the need for additional crew workload.\nMauric reports the vessel's design with a steel hull and an aluminum superstructure places paramount importance on seakeeping and crew comfort. It will carry a crew of 20 and the design integrates an anti-roll stabilization combining active fins and passive free surface tank, to ensure optimal operability in all sea states.\nConstruction will be carried out at Socarenam's shipyard in Boulogne-Sur-Mer, with delivery scheduled for the second half of 2027. When completed, it will replace the approximately 40-year-old patrol vesselIris. The new ship will be based in La Rochelle and operated along the Atlantic coast, particularly in the Bay of Biscay. Its mission is maritime surveillance and regulatory enforcement of fisheries, as well as navigation monitoring, maritime pollution control, environmental law enforcement, and search-and-rescue operations.\nMichelinefirst unveiledits wingsail concept in 2021 highlighting the opportunities to support maritime decarbonization. The sail concept received design approval from DNV and in 2023 the first trials were conducted in 2023 aboard the MN Pelican demonstrating the endurance of the system.",

According to German outlets, someone appears to have tried to contaminate the drinking water system of the frigate Hessen.\nWDR, NDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung reported last week that an unknown perpetrator made an attempt to put a large quantity of waste oil into the Hessen's freshwater tanks. The frigate was moored at the German Navy's main base in Wilhelmshaven for repairs, and a contractor was hired to refill the vessel's tanks with clean water. The attempted contamination was prevented, and sources within the German Navy told media that they had ruled out the possibility of an accident.\nA police investigation is under way into the circumstances of the case, and Germany's Federal Office for Military Counterintelligence (BAMAD) has joined the effort.\nHessen is well-known from her time on patrol in the Red Sea last year, where she helped to defend merchant shipping from Houthi attacks. Beginning in February, Hessen took up station off Yemen as part of EU Operation Aspides, and was shooting down her first drones within days. During one of her earliest engagements, the crew misidentified an American drone as a Houthi munition and targeted it with two SM-2 missiles. Against the odds, both missed for \"technical reasons.\" The frigate returned to Germany in early May, having spent three months on deployment.\nThe apparent attempt to sabotage Hessen is the latest in a string of incidents affecting German warships in port. In 2024, a German Navy minehunter was damaged by unknown personnel while in shipyard in Rostock. Several cable harnesses were severed, according to Spiegel. In addition, an unknown saboteur dumped dozens of kilos of metal filings into the oil sumps of the main engines aboard the brand new corvette Emden, according to multiple German media outlets.

    "input": "\nThe Trump administration has ordered the diversion of eight percent of military spending and fired two senior service leaders, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. C.Q. Brown and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to hold the post and the first female member of the Joint Chiefs. Franchetti's unprecedented dismissal brings her term to an end almost three years early.\nThe Pentagon dismissed Adm. Franchetti before selecting a permanent replacement, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Friday that he is open to nominations for candidates for the post. Vice CNOAdm. James Kilbyhas taken on Franchetti's role in the interim.\nAdm. Lisa Franchetti is a surface warfare officer by background. She commanded USSRoss(DDG 71), and she served aboard USSShenandoah, USSMonongahela, USSMoosbruggerand USSStout. She also commanded Carrier Strike Group 9; Carrier Strike Group 15; and headed Strategy, Plans and Policy (J-5) on the Joint Staff. She became Vice Chief of Naval Operations in September 2022, receiving confirmation by voice vote from the U.S. Senate.\nFranchetti was promoted to Chief of Naval Operations in November 2023 and confirmed on a vote of 95-1. The sole objector, Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KY) blasted her appointment as an example of diversity hiring, suggesting that her four decades in the Navy and her career in command of surface warfare units, carrier strike groups and fleet-level commands were not sufficient to make her a competitive candidate.\n\"President Biden nominated Adm. Franchetti not because she is qualified or competent to do the job but because of this administration’s obsession with diversity and inclusion,\" Sen. Marshall said at the time. \"[Former President Joe Biden] even disregarded the recommendation of his own Secretary of Defense for this position.\"\nThe Trump administration's pick for the next Secretary of the Navy, financier and art collectorJohn Phelan, has no prior experience in any defense field, whether in uniform, in government or in a defense contracting role. He was a prominent donor and fundraiser for the president's successful 2024 election campaign.\nUnexpected spending changes\nLast week, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued plans to cut existing military programs by eight percent ($50 billion) and redirect the funding to other White House priorities. These new areas of focus include border security measures and a new \"Iron Dome for America\" missile defense system, inspired by Israel's achievements in reducing the threat of midrange ballistic missile and drone strikes.\nDeputy Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses said Wednesday that programs targeted would begin with initiatives related to diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change. The savings \"could be used to fund [the president's] priorities, as well as to refocus the Department on its core mission of deterring and winning wars,\" he told media.\nIn a memo, Hegseth that 17 programs would be exempt from the cuts. The list protects the Virginia-class attack submarine program, but not the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, the Navy's costliest and most challenging acquisition program. The memo does protect modernization of nuclear weapons, which the Columbia-class will carry.\nThe Navy's chronically-underfunded shipbuilding program is protected for \"executable\" warship contracts only; the futures of long-term initiatives, like the DDG(X) next-generation destroyer or the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV) are less certain.\n\"The Secretary of Defense is injecting a colossal amount of confusion and churn and uncertainty into the budgeting process,\" Bryan McGrath, a defense and national security consultant and retired Navy commander, told Business Insider in an interview on Thursday.\nThe administration is also moving to fire thousands of probationary employees in the defense department. The contours of the dismissals are not yet known; the military has more than 900,000 civilian employees in the U.S. and around the world.\n\"It is not in the public interest to retain individuals whose contributions are not mission-critical,\" John Ullyot, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement last week.",

    "input": "\nA unique project to design a large, high-speed next-generation ferry is coming to fruition with news that Sweden’s Gotlandsbolaget has ordered construction of the ferry developed working with Austal. The goal was to develop a vessel for climate-neutral trips and sustainable solutions that would be a pioneer in new technologies.\nAustal and Gotlandsbolagetannounced plansfor the development of the 130-meter (426-foot) multi-fuel high-speed vehicle passenger ferry design, with the flexibility to be able to operate on a variety of fuel types including hydrogen, in April 2023. Since then, Austal and Gotland Tech Development report they have engaged with technology providers from around the world to select preferred main equipment, and to define system arrangements. This has included the development of a unique propulsion system arrangement that repurposes engine exhaust to contribute to vessel propulsion and reduce emissions. In October 2024, the project gained approval in principle from DNV.\n\"Horizon X is an incredibly exciting project that is going to redefine commercial ferry capabilities, with a multi-fuel and hydrogen-capable combined cycle power plant and a class-leading, efficient hull design,” said Austal Chief Executive Officer Paddy Gregg.\n\n\n\nAccording to Austal, the design will feature a unique, highly efficient combined cycle propulsion system that includes both gas and steam turbines, a first for a high-speed craft. The gas turbines will be used in the drive train of Horizon X and they are designed to be powered by several types of alternative fuels, fossil-free. It will be a multi-fuel vessel and the design is prepared to convert to hydrogen when hydrogen production becomes commercially available.\nThe companies highlighted the multi-fuel capabilities will best prepare the vessel while there are still great uncertainties regarding which alternative fuels will be available to the maritime sector. To minimize energy requirements and achieve high efficiency, the companies highlight that a great deal of work has been done to develop energy-efficient hulls, minimize weight, optimize energy consumption on board, and streamline operations and flows throughout the ship.\n\"Shipping must change, and reducing the climate footprint of travel and transport to and from Gotland is of great importance for the island's development and attractiveness,” said Håkan Johansson, CEO of Gotlandsbolaget. “The construction of Horizon X is a crucial step in our journey towards climate-neutral crossings. At the same time, the ship will offer the same efficient crossing times as today, and a new and modern onboard experience.”\nThe ferry is designed to carry up to 1,500 passengers and 400 passenger cars at speeds up to 29 knots. It will be able to make the crossing between the Swedish mainland and Gotland in just over three hours. Plans call for it to operate during the peak summer travel season as well as in the spring and fall.\nAustal is valuing the construction contract at between A$265 and A$275 million (US$168 and US$175 million). The vessel will be built at the Austal Philippines shipyard with work commencing in 2026. The hull will be built in aluminum and where possible for the construction, green aluminum will be chosen, which means that approximately 60 percent of all aluminum on board is manufactured with renewable energy.\nAfter delivery in mid-2028, the ship will sail to Gotland. The company says the exact timing for its entry into service is yet to be determined, but that it will be on the route by the spring of 2029.",

    "input": "The offshore wind energy sector has remained in flux since the inauguration of Donald Trump and his new administration which has paused the efforts of the Biden administration and seems poised to abandon future projects. This week, BP Renewables became the latest to stall one of its projects in the U.S. pipeline while others continue to show signs of retrenching and shifting to a longer-term focus.\nBP in a filing with the New York Public Service Commission withdrew its application for the transmission system associated with its Beacon Wind project which would provide a total of 2.4 GW in a two-phase development. The company had previously asked the PSC to delay consideration of its application for up to one year.\nThe first phase of Beacon Wind already has its power offtake agreement in place with New York State. They were expected to participate in a future solicitation for the second phase.\nThe company in a statement said the move is to provide it more time based on changes in the market and “a challenging regulatory environment.”  BP is reportedly planning to evaluate the project’s design and configuration. In addition to the changes in the federal government's stance on the sector, it is being noted that New York State has been considering its future approach, specifically how the projects are connected to the power grid.\nBeacon Wind was to bring its cables ashore and connect to a repurposed power station in Astoria, New York in Queens County. But observers noted that New York State said for its sixth-round solicitation scheduled for the first quarter of 2026, it would consider “generation-only projects.”\nBP took full ownership of Beacon Wind as part of its agreement with Equinor in 2024 to end its joint venture with each company pursuing one of the projects. Equinor took ownership of Empire Wind. The plan for Beacon Wind has gained its final environmental assessment from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and was believed close to the approval of its Construction & Operation Plan (COP) but it was not completed by the Biden administration.\nAt the same time, French giant EDF reported financial results today, February 21, with over $120 billion in revenues and $18 billion in income. However, detailing its results the company revealed a nearly $1 billion impairment charge ($944.4 million) related to the Atlantic Shores wind project in New Jersey. Reuters is quoting CEO Luc Remont as saying it is “in order to reflect the new American political landscape.”\nAtlantic Shore Projects 1 and 2 represent 2.8 GW which would be provided to New Jersey. The project received BOEM approval of its COP in October 2024, but it has yet to conclude agreements with the state. It was bid into the fourth-round solicitation, but New Jersey ended it without selecting a project. In January 2025, joint venture partner Shell announced it was withdrawing from the project as part of its efforts to reduce its focus on renewable energy. EDF has said it is still committed to the project but decided to depreciate the developments carried out for the project.\nA third development company, Vineyard Offshore, which is a U.S.-based affiliate of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is also reported to be laying off and eliminating a total of 50 jobs. The company emphasized to local reporters it was not at the project level.\nIt is in partnership with Avangrid for Vineyard Wind 1 which is under construction but delayed due to the failure of blades and the need to test and replace the turbine blades. The company independently was also pursuing Vineyard Wind 2, but in December withdrew from negotiations for its power offtake agreement with Massachusetts. The plan calls for splitting the generation with Connecticut, but that state decided not to proceed with wind power at this time. The company said it could not financially justify the project without the second power agreement and it would have to reconsider the plan. Vineyard Offshore also has the lease for Excelsior Wind which is an early-stage project that would provide power to New York State and has an early-stage development with the lease for a project in Humboldt County off the northern coast of California.",

    "input": "\nLandlocked Hungary’s quest for access to the sea is nearing completion with the launch of construction of a new seaport in Trieste, Italy, 140 miles and two nations away from Hungary's border. Hungarian Deputy Foreign Minister Levente Magyar attended the groundbreaking ceremony last week in the company of the Italian Deputy Minister for Infrastructure, Edoardo Rixi.\nHungary announced the port project back in 2019 after the purchase of an 80-acre seafront site in Trieste. At the time, the transaction was valued at $32 million under a 60-year concession contract. The first phase of the port includes building a 250-meter quay wall, to be later expanded by about 400 meters, giving Hungary a total of 650 meters of coastline on the Adriatic Sea.\nAdria Port Zrt., a Hungarian state-owned company, is entrusted with developing the Trieste Port project. The $209 million facility is expected to be operational by 2028. It will have capacity for 78,000 TEU of cargo a year. A logistics center is also planned at the site to streamline the movement of goods. Trieste is a strategic location for a Hungarian seaport, given its proximity and reliable rail and road connection to Hungary.\n“Hungary exports cargo worth around $155 billion every year, with majority of them leaving Europe by sea. If the country does not have its own sea exit and seaport capacity, it will always be at the mercy of others. We would like to change this situation, because Hungary, as the 34th largest exporter in the world, must have channels to connect to global supply chains,” said Levente Magyar.\nHungary lost its sea access in 1920 after conceding defeat in the World War I. This led to the signing of the Trianon Treaty, which saw Hungary lose two-thirds of its former territory, including a vast coastline.\nIn the recent past, Hungary has intensified cooperation with its coastal neighbors for maritime access. Last month, Hungarian Minister for National Economy Márton Nagy met Bulgarian President Rumen Radev for economic talks. This saw the signing of cooperation agreements in the transport sector. The partnership will lead to the creation of a simplified logistics and transport corridor linking Hungarian businesses with Bulgarian ports and free zones in the Black Sea. The Hungarian government has said that Bulgaria is a critical partner for its energy security, providing a transit route for Russian, Turkish and Azerbaijani natural gas supplies by pipeline.",

    "input": "\nThe planned investment by AD Ports Group in Turkey’s Alsancak Port in Izmir has fallen apart after failed negotiations. The Turkish government this week confirmed that it has ended talks with the UAE company over the operation of the port.\nThe negotiations have been ongoing for almost two years. AD Ports was expected to buy a stake in the port in the western province of Izmir. The port has been operational since 1959, and according to the Invest in Izmir initiative, the port is today the country’s seventh largest in terms of container volume and thirteenth in terms of cargo tonnage.\n“We have pursued long negotiations with the investor from the Gulf, but no agreement has been achieved,” Turkish Transportation Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu told Bloomberg. “The aim was to get a partner to expand Alsancak port.” No further update was given on why the negotiations collapsed.\nThis becomes the second attempt to privatize Alsancak Port without success. In 2007, a group of investors including Hutchison Port Holdings submitted a $1.28 billion bid for the port. The deal was later blocked by a court leading the investors to withdraw.\nSince 2017, Alsancak has been owned by Turkey’s sovereign wealth fund TWF. It is currently operated by the national railway company TCDD.\nFaced with capacity challenges, the port has recorded a drop in cargo traffic. In container handling, the drop has come from a high of 390,300 TEUs in 2022 to 261,900 last year.\nThe negotiations were part of a wider effort by the government to attract additional foreign investment. Turkey opened its market to UAE investments, looking to raise capital for its critical sectors. In 2023, Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan inked deals worth $51 billion during a state visit to the UAE. The deals touched sectors such as energy, natural resources development, and defense. Trade relations between Turkey and UAE continue to develop, exceeding $50 billion in 2024, an increase of 11 percent year on year, according to data by the Turkish-Arab Economic Forum.\nAD Ports' entry would have added to the massive investment by the DP World in the Turkish port sector. One of the largest container ports, Yarimca Terminal (Port of Izmit), on the Sea of Marmara east of Istanbul, is controlled by DP World. The terminal has an annual capacity of 1.15 million TEUs. Last year, the operator expanded into the neighboring Evyapport terminal in Izmit, through a merger with Evyap Group.\nAlsancak offers a strategic advantage in its position. It does not require a transit of the Dardanelles. It is seen as a port with potential because of its location and easy access to the Mediterranean.\n",

This comes after NATO and neighboring countries have increased patrols in the Baltic after several incidents in which undersea cables were damaged and there has beenspeculation of attacksagainst tankers in the Russian oil trade.\nReports from the Russian media indicate that the Security Council recommended “step up monitoring of the activities of countries capable of creating threats to underwater and critical port infrastructure.” Grigory Molchanov cited the increased activity of NATO in the Baltic. He also referenced the ongoing use of unmanned attack boats by Ukraine in the Black Sea which he contends have been “repeatedly destroyed by units of the Russian Navy.”\nMolchanov is quoted as saying, “There was an increase in sources of military dangers and military threats to the Russian Federation in connection with NATO’s build-up.” He asserted that NATO could be targeting maritime transport and major oil terminals, as well as railway connections. Last month, NATO along with the Baltic nationsincreased patrolsafter incidents of damage to undersea cables.\nThe reports did not indicate any planned specific actions, but Reuters is reporting it saw a letter from the Russian Transport Ministry outlining actions. It informs shipowners, according to Reuters, that all vessels will need to be inspected when they arrive in Russian ports. This will include the use of divers to check the hulls for possible explosives.\nThe move comes after it was revealed that Italian and Greek authorities are investigating damage to two Greek-owned tankers that have transported Russian oil in the past. Thenamaris confirmed that its vessel was damaged while offloading in Italy last weekend and also revealed an incident with another tanker in January as it neared Turkey. The Italian authorities included the possibility of terrorism or sabotage which has led to speculation that tankers transporting Russian oil could be the targets.\nA Turkish-owned tanker was damaged while docked in Russia’s Ust-Luga early in February. Media reports called it an engine room explosion, but the mayor was quick to call it anattackon the vessel. Ust-Luga is the major Russian energy terminal on the Baltic.\n",

    "input": "\nA team of Spanish scientists have revealed alarming evidence of methane leaks in Antarctica. The researchers are exploring the vast quantities of methane stored in the Antarctic seabed. The study, carried on board the Spanish research vesselSarmiento de Gamboa, focused on the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula. These Antarctic edges are one of the most rapidly warming parts of the planet.\n“We have estimated that in this area there are some 24 gigatons of carbon accumulated in methane hydrates, an amount equivalent to what all humanity emits in two years,” said geologist Rogers Urgeles, who together with Ricardo León led the expedition.\nFor decades now, polar scientists have been studying methane hydrates - a mixture of water and methane gas trapped under high pressure - in the frozen continents. The methane hydrates are as a result of decomposition of organic matter buried for over 20,000 years beneath the polar seas; most of this research has focused on the Arctic.\nThe first active leak of methane from the Antarctic sea floor was confirmed by researchers in 2020. While additional data is needed to understand the methane seepage, there have been reports showing global warming could be a factor. However, the first leak was confirmed near the Ross Sea, a region which is yet to significantly warm. But tracking of these methane leaks is critical for climate models, which currently do not account for it. Methane in the atmosphere is considered roughly 20 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas.\nThe new study by the Spanish scientists further confirms the presence of huge methane hydrate reserves in the Antarctic Peninsula. Ongoing geological and climate-driven processes have made the reserves destabilize, causing seepage of methane. León and Urgeles reported observing columns of methane in the ocean up to 700 meters long and 70 meters wide. The gas could be bubbling up from the subsoil, often through mud volcanoes hundreds of meters above the seabed, the scientists told the Spanish Newspaper El Pais. The observed methane columns dissolve at about 150 meters from the ocean surface. The researchers recommend long-term monitoring to track methane release trends in the Antarctic, as well as the amount that escapes into the atmosphere.",

The EUNAVFOR operation Atalanta that monitors security in the region however is warning after two events in recent weeks that “similar organized piracy incidents might take place again in the area.”\nThis latest incident was reported to the authorities on February 17. It was believed that armed pirates boarded the Yemeni dhowSaytuun-2.  It was hijacked off Garmaal, on the northern coast of Puntland, a semi-autonomous region within Somalia. Atlanta classified it as an armed robbery because the vessel was staying within coastal waters.\nThe vessel was being monitored while the EUNAVFOR was also coordinating with its security partners, including the Yemeni Coast Guard and the Puntland Maritime Police Force as well as the international Combined Maritime Forces. They reported that there were five crewmembers aboard and the vessel was traveling to the south after it was hijacked. They believed there were six pirates aboard.\nThe pirates fled the vessel on February 22. Teams from one of the warships involved in the international security effort contacted the fishing vessel yesterday, February 23 in what Atlanta termed a “friendly approach.” They gathered information from the crew that confirmed that armed pirates with ladders had taken control of the vessel. The crew was uninjured but said the pirates had taken some of their belongings before leaving the dhow.\nEarlier in February there was a similar incident involving another Yemeni-flagged dhow,Al Najma. The vessel with a crew of 12 aboard was boarded on February 9 near Ely, Somalia also in the Puntland region. The EU naval forces began a search to locate the vessel and were tracking the vessel when the pirates also abandoned the hijacked dhow. It was released on February 13 and again forces participating with Atalanta visited the vessel to confirm the safety of the crew.\n“These recent events within Somali territorial waters demonstrate an active and evolving threat in the region,” Atlanta warned in its weekly report. “Despite routine patrols performed by CMF, EUNAVFOR Atalanta, and other warships in these waters, pirates continue to demonstrate sophisticated operational capabilities.” Atalanta also warns of a “well-established coastal support infrastructure.” Atalanta concluded that the prates maintain the capabilities and intent to target vessels in the region.\nThis comes 17 years after the security operation was first created. Atalanta began its patrols in 2009 and reports its efforts have led to the conviction of 145 pirates. They have documented 139 vessels that have been held in the region but noted that there are also an unknown number of unreported/unconfirmed dhows and smaller vessels that have been seized.\nLast year, Atlanta reported a spike in activity in the first quarter which continued till May 2024. After that, there were a few suspicious approaches before a Chinese fishing vessel was seized in December and held until the end of the year. The two incidents with the Yemeni-flagged dhows occurred this month raising the new concerns about continued dangers in the region.",

    "input": "Two of the leaders in the offshore sector for energy, Saipem and Subsea 7 entered into an understanding that is designed to lead to a merger of equally to create an offshore services giant. The deal valued at nearly $4.7 billion would combine the companies to create a global presence with a fleet of more than 60 construction vessels and 45,000 employees.\nThe companies highlighted that they have highly complementary geographical footprints, competencies and capabilities, vessel fleets, and technologies that will benefit the global client base. They believe a combination would also unlock annual synergies of approximately €300 million to be achieved in the third year after completion, with one-off costs to achieve such synergies of approximately €270 million. The combined company would have a current backlog of €43 billion and annual revenues of nearly €20 billion.\nExplaining the rationale for the combination, the companies told investors it would create a more comprehensive solution for customers, expand the expertise and experience base, and create a global and diversified operation. It would also lay the foundation for future innovation in the industry. The management of both Saipem and Subsea7 said they share the conviction that there is compelling logic in creating a global leader in energy services, particularly considering the growing size of clients’ projects.\nWhile recognizing the potential, analysts were quick to question the logistics of completing such a combination. They cited a difficult regulatory approval in part reflected by the companies’ projection that it would be mid-2026 before the deal could be completed.\nThe companies reported they have completed a memorandum of understanding for the combination which calls for a merger of equals. Each company would own 50 percent of the combined entity with the new company being known as Saipem 7. Current plans call for Alessandro Puliti, CEO of Saipem, to be appointed as CEO of the combined company while John Evans, CEO of Subsea 7, would be the CEO of the offshore business which will comprise all Subsea7 and Saipem’s Offshore Engineering & Construction activities.\nThe companies’ large shareholders are expressing their support for the combination. Siem Industries, the largest shareholder of Subsea7, would own approximately 12 percent of the new company, while Eni and CDP Equity, the largest shareholders of Saipem, would own approximately 10.6 percent and approximately 6.4 percent of the new company.\nThe companies independently developed as leaders in the offshore services industry tracing their origins to the 1950s and the start of modern offshore operations. Each has been involved in the consolidation and growth of the industry. The modern Subsea 7 emerged in the early 200s and reports it is the product of over 25 different legacy companies and businesses with Kristian Siem continuing to drive the company as its chairman. Saipem was also the product of mergers and served as the service supplier for Eni until 2015 when it reduced its holding setting the stage for the modern company.\nThe timeline for the deal calls for completing the merger agreement by mid-year. They will require extensive antitrust approvals and shareholder approval from each company.",

The carrier group was underway today and conducting routine flight operations.\nThe carrier arrived back at the Naval Support Base in Souda Bay, Greece on February 16 just four days after it collided with a bulker north of the Suez Canal. The report indicated that an assessment team would conduct a full survey of damaged areas and develop a repair plan to be executed immediately.\nThe Navy quickly assembled an emergency team that included engineers, naval architects, and other personnel from the Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center and Norfolk Naval Shipyard. In an “all-hands” effort, the sailors worked together with a local industry partner, Theodoropoulos Group, to assess the damage, develop the plan, and complete repairs to restore weathertight integrity to the carrier.\nThe initial damage assessment reported the exterior wall of two storage rooms and a maintenance space had sustained breaches as well as external damage including a line handling space, the fantail, and the platform above one of the storage spaces. The aircraft elevator however was not damaged and remained fully operational.\nThe work was completed in just five days with the carrier group underway on February 23. A Navy spokesperson told Stars & Stripes the repairs included removing damaged pieces of metal and installing weatherproofing bulkheads.\n“Our ship remains operationally ready to complete deployment with mission and purpose on full display by the entire crew,” said Capt. Chris Hill, commanding officer of Harry S. Truman. “We are out here launching and recovering aircraft.”\nHill took over command of the carrier as interim commanding officer the Navy reported on February 20. Hill transferred from the USSDwight D. Eisenhowerwhich is currently undergoing scheduled maintenance at Norfolk Naval Shipyard after completing its nine-month deployment in July 2024. The captain had led the first phase of the U.S. mission in the Red Sea region to combat the Houthis after they started attacking merchant ships. Hill replaced Capt. Dave Snowden, commanding officer of USSHarry S. Trumanwho was relieved due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command after the collision.\nThe Navy emphasized that there was no impact onHarry S. Truman’s mission or schedule due to emergency repairs. Since deploying, they report the carrier's eight embarked aviation squadrons have flown over 5,500 stories. This includes two strikes into Houthi-controlled Yemen and a strike on ISIS-Somalia. The Houthis had been aggressively targeting the Truman in January before suspending their strikes after the Gaza ceasefire.\nTheHarry S. Trumanis deployed with the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USSGettysburg. The strike group also consists of three Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers, USSStout, USSThe Sullivans, and USSJason Dunham.

Reports indicate that divers found a two-foot by four-foot hole with plates driven inward, indicating external forces were at work. Dead fish found near the blast site further suggested an explosion.\nOther recently-damaged tankers with Russian trading ties include theGrace Ferrum, Koala,andSeacharm.The Russian military cargo shipUrsa Majoralso went down in December near the Strait of Gibraltar after a series of engine room explosions, and the Russian operator claimed that it had been sabotaged.\nWithout specifying which particular incidents, three sources confirmed to Reuters that at least two blasts were likely caused by limpet mine attacks. One source said that the munitions used were Soviet BPM-type limpet mines, a time-delayed shaped charge with a magnetic casing that can be hand-placed by divers. The time-delay fuse can be set for durations as long as a month, according to open-source data, allowing the vessel to transit far from the point of placement before detonation.\nThe BPM has a small main charge of just seven pounds of tritonal, but placed directly on a ship's hull it is enough to be effective. When activated, it has an anti-removal plunger that detonates the mine if another diver tries to pull it off.\nLike all Soviet munitions, BPM mines were exported to third countries linked to Russian expansionism. The design has changed little over decades, they remain in production, and they continue to crop up in modern conflict zones - making attribution difficult.",

All we want is reciprocal, we want reciprocity. We want the same, so if somebody charges us, we charge them.\"\nEarly this month, Trump threatened to revise the tariff rates on Mexico and Canada upwards to 25 percent (except for Canadian energy, which would be subject to a 10 percent levy). After securing border-related concessions from both nations, Trump agreed to pause the tariff hike for a month for negotiations. If the tariffs do go into effect as he forecast, they will begin to affect cross-border trade on March 4.\nCanada is preparing to retaliate with its own tariffs on a list of $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. \"The threat of tariffs is a real one and may continue for a while. We need to be able to deal with the unpredictability of President Trump,\" said Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, speaking to reporters in London on Monday.\nIf fully implemented, an across-the-board tariff schedule of 25 percent for Canadian and Mexican goods would have significant economic effects. Economists predict that Mexico and Canada would likely enter a recession; U.S. GDP would be reduced by about 0.5 percent compared with business as usual; and inflation would increase in all three countries. Mexico, as the largest exporter of goods to the United States - larger than Canada or China - would be especially hard-hit.",

A Thai consortium entered into a similar port development MOU with Myanmar's previous government, but the deal fell apart in 2021.\nThe zone would be 50,000 acres in size, providing room for industrial development. Reshetnikov told Russian media that \"oil refining is still the most complex element,\" and that this might not be actualized. \"There is a desire of the Myanmar side to have a refinery. Our companies are still studying the economics of such a project, it is very complicated from the point of view of economic feasibility,\" he said.\nThe project's success will require the junta to retain control of Myanmar, with assistance from Russian and Chinese arms suppliers. Since seizing power and overthrowing the elected government in 2021, Myanmar's military forces have been steadily losing ground to a loose coalition of rebels.

    "input": "A decade after the European Union first adopted its ship recycling regulation to address concerns over environmental issues, it issued a new evaluation of the regulations highlighting shortcomings. Overall, it concludes the regulation is effective, but finds shipowners continue to “flag hop” incentivized by additional revenue from selling end-of-life ships.\nThe commission evaluated the framework ahead of the June 2025 entry into force of the Hong Kong Convention ratified by UN members in 2024 to provide a global framework for recycling and the treatment of environmental concerns. The EU was also reviewing the list of companies authorized under the regulation and released an update.\nWhile saying it believes the regulation has “largely achieved its objectives,” the report however warns that its “effectiveness has been significantly undermined through the practice of shipowners charging ship’s flag shortly before being recycled.” It also points to a continuing absence of hazardous materials inventories on ships in service which it says results in the quantities of inventories often being insufficient at the recycling stage.\nShipowners they concluded are still incentivized by additional revenue to send their vessels to South Asian yards despite none of the yards being recognized by the EU. Ships are transferred from the flags of EU member states to a non-EU flag shortly before being recycled. Middlemen often buy the vessels without disclosing intent and send them to Asia or sometimes briefly lay the ship up in an intermediary country before delivering it to the scrapyards.\nThere have been several high-profile cases but, in most instances, owners elude punishment while scrapping ships in Asia. In June 2024, Norwegian regulatorsimposedan approximately $750,000 fine for illegally exporting two ships to India for scrapping despite claims by then-owner Teekay that it sent the ship for further trading. As part of the evaluation, the EU reports it will focus on preventing circumvention efforts by clarifying standards and ensuring penalties for infringements.\nThe updated list for 2025 from the EU removes yards in Latvia, Lithuania, and Turkey from the recognized group. The list currently has 31 yards in Europe, 11 in Turkey, and one in the United States. Ships registered in an EU member state are required to use one of these yards for ship recycling. The EU emphasized the importance of the regulations saying European shipowners have 30 percent of the world’s tonnage.\nThe EU highlights the Hong Kong Convention sets out international ship recycling standards that are less stringent than the current EU Ship Recycling Regulation. It is assessing how the convention will be implemented and possibly improved towards stricter global standards. The EU reports its model has become a benchmark both within and outside the EU. It will look to further enhance the standards to ensure that environmental risks are reduced during the handling of end-of-life vessels.",

The vessel was first detained after cocaine was found hidden aboard the ship while it was in transit which later resulted in a dispute over port fees.\nIndia’s High Court in Orissa signed off on the release of the vessel (37,000 dwt and built in 2012) which is registered in Panama. The owners owed nearly $1 million in port fees to Orissa for the time the vessel was detained. For part of the time, it was in the anchorage and the remainder on berth. The crew had gone on strike last November when the ship moved to the dock to resupply a year after the ship was detained. The crew had refused to do any additional work until they were released.\nThe owners of the vessel and the Paradip International Cargo Terminal are reported to have reached an out-of-court settlement, the details of which were not released. The admiralty judge after reviewing the settlement agreed that there was no reason for the case to continue and said the ship was released. TheDebihowever as of today shows it remains at the port according to its AIS signal.\nThe vessel was traveling from Asia to Denmark to transport a cargo of steel plate when it made the port stop in Paradip, India. A dockworker noticed suspicious packages attached to the underside of one of the deck cranes and reported it to the authorities. The packages were found to contain 22 kg of cocaine which was seized on November 30, 2023. The street value of the cocaine was reported at over $25 million.\nIndian authorities searched the vessel and ordered the crew to bedetainedwhile they investigated the smuggling. The crew’s personal electronics were seized, but they remained in limbo. One crewmemberjumped overboardin a possible suicide attempt after a dispute on the ship which was blamed on the crew’s long detention. A junior engineer he was rescued and taken to a hospital while the remainder of the crew continued to wait. Finally, in December 2024, the court ordered the crew could begin to leave and 11 went home on December 23 while nine replacements took their positions. The others were expected to leave once their replacements arrived. The reports said of the 21 crewmembers, 17 were from Vietnam.\nThe port fees continued to accumulate while the vessel was detained in the port. The ship was officially arrested in February 2024 and in August the court had ordered it sold. The court last week ordered a refund of more than $27,000 in court fees to the terminal operator.\nInternational associations have increasingly highlighted cases such as theDebiwhere vessels and their crews are being routinely detained for smuggling charges or other infractions. Crewmembers have also been convicted on charges related to the discovery of narcotics aboard their ships without ever being directly linked to the smuggling operation. Unions are calling for fairer treatment and expedited processing of crews in these cases.\nIn the case of theDebi, the authorities repeatedly said they were investigating but no charges were ever filed against the crew. The cocaine was concealed out of sight and it was unclear if the crew was aware or if the ship was simply a courier in the case with the crew unaware that the drugs had been stashed aboard.",

The fire is believed to have been extinguished and contained to a small section of the RoRo sector of the vessel and the crew escaped uninjured.\nThe authorities granted permission for salvage tugs to bring the ship to port during daylight hours. Four tugs from Dutch company Multraship, numbers 32, 33, 35, and 36, moved the dead ship into Antwerp where it was tied up at the Euroterminal. Boskalis’ Smit unit was hired to oversee the salvage of the vessel.\nImages online showed scorching from the fire on the vessel’s superstructure near the funnel. Blistering is visible on two or more decks but contained within an area of the ship. Grimaldi initially reported one fire on February 17 which its crew attempted to extinguish with the CO2 system. Lifeboats from the UK’s RNLI attended the vessel but were released only to be recalled later the same day when a second fire was discovered aboard the vessel. The Grimaldi crew abandoned ship into its lifeboat and were rescued by one of the tugs and transferred to the Ramsgate Lifeboat to be taken to shore.\n\n\n\nGrimaldi told the European press there were indications of what had caused the fire but would not speculate until the investigation was completed. The vessel frequently transports used cars and containers and was bound for West Africa.\nTwo of the Multraship tugs reached the vessel on February 18 and working with Boskalis’ tugKamarawere conducting cooling operations. The French rescue vesselAbeille Normandiewas also standing by monitoring the operation.\nSalvage crews were expected to board the vessel now that it has returned to port to ensure the fire has been extinguished. Then inspectors will begin searching for the origins.\nToday, February 24, there are unconfirmed reports of yet another fire on a different Grimaldi vessel. Lloyd’s is reporting that fire occurred on theGrande Congo(47,600 dwt) as the vessel was transiting to Norfolk, Virginia. This Conro is now docked in Norfolk having arrived from Spain.\nThe company has experienced several vessel fires in the past few years. In 2019, it had fires on two vessels that led to changes in the rules for handling hazardous cargo. Then in 2023, another of the company’s vessels in New Jersey when a fire started as cars were being loaded. Two local firefighters were killed after boarding the vessel.

About 20 percent of all merchant ships have a third-party ISM manager - not the owner, nor the commercial manager, but purely a technical manager. Since a third-party manager has no say in the commercial operations of the ship, nor in its construction or bunker fuel selection, it should not be held legally responsible for the ship's emissions, according to InterManager.\n\"In comparison to the charterer and shipowner, the ship manager has no material influence over the GHG intensity of a ship. Ship managers have no say regarding the type of engine powering the managed ship, nor whether sails, solar, fuel cells or other installations are installed on board. Such choices are decided exclusively by the shipowner,\" the association said in a statement.\nInterManager's proposed text would state that the entity responsible for compliance would be \"the registered owner of the ship.\" This would put the financial burden on the shipowner, not the manager; the shipmanager would still be tasked with collecting emissions data and reporting it properly, in accordance with regulations.\n\"We ship managers are fully committed to playing our part in shipping’s journey to net zero. However, when it comes to the GHG intensity of a ship, ship managers have no say whatsoever in any of the decisions that result in material impact; they are not even consulted. In shore terms, we are the facility managers, not the factory owners,\" said InterManager President Sebastian von Hardenberg. \"In taking our points into consideration, the IMO can develop a more practical and equitable framework.\"\nThe association's objections mirror a long debate around who should be responsible for compliance with the EU's greenhouse gas rules for shipping. The newly-imposed FuelEU Maritime regulation placescompliance responsibilityupon the ship's technical manager; if the technical manager is a third party, it must work out contractual arrangements with the shipowner and charterer to protect its financial interests.\nBy contrast, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme putsresponsibilityon the registered shipowner by default. If the ship is chartered out or managed by a third party, the shipowner must work out contractual arrangements for compliance costs with the charterer or technical manager.",

    "input": "Marking the third anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the launch of the so-called “special military operation,” the UK and EU rolled out sweeping new sanctions. Both programs emphasized they continue to aim at undermining Russia’s sources of income and those support the war effort while the UK also said it was designed to strengthen Ukraine’s position.\n“Lasting peace will only be achieved through strength. That is why we are focused on putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position,” said UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. “Every military supply line disrupted, every rouble blocked, and every enabler of Putin’s aggression exposed is a step towards a just and lasting peace.”\nThe UK is calling today’s announcement the largest sanctions package against Russia since 2022. A total of 107 sanctions were announced targeting military supply chains, revenues, and the enables supporting Russia’s efforts. It noted for the first time the sanctions are targeting foreign financial institutions supporting the war effort including sanctions against the Kyrgyzstan-based IJSC Keremet Bank and the inclusion of the North Korean Defense Minister and other North Korean generals.\nToday’s sanctions include another 40 shadow fleet ships carrying Russian oil. According to the UK, these vessels have collectively carried more than $5 billion worth of Russian oil and oil products in the last six months. The specifications bring the total number of oil tankers sanctioned by the UK to 133, which the UK calls the highest of any nation in Europe.\nOther inclusions in the new sanction package included producers and suppliers of machine tools, electronics, and dual-use goods for the Russian military, including microprocessors and goods coming from countries including states in Asia, Turkey, Thailand, India, and China. It includes companies that procure arms, deliver military-industrial goods, and individuals inside and out of the Russian government.\nThe European Council also reported the adoption of its 16th Russia sanctions package. Like the UK they are targeting energy, trade, transport, infrastructure, and financial services and also went beyond Russia with sanctions for Belarus, the regimes in Crimea and Sevastopol, and those controlling the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n“This new round of sanctions not only targets the Russian shadow fleet but those who support the operation of unsafe oil tankers, videogame controllers used to pilot drones, banks used to circumvent our sanctions, and propaganda outlets used to spout lies,” said Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission.\nThe EU package targets 74 additional vessels, with the EU highlighting its total number of listed vessels at 153. As part of the effort, the EU is also adding a new listing criterion, targeting those who support the operations of unsafe oil tankers. This includes targeting terminals and operations in the ports of Ust-Luga, Primorsk, and Novorossiysk.\nThis sanction package also includes export restrictions on 53 companies and 34 companies in countries other than Russia. The EU added elements to prevent circumvention of the sanctions and to stop disinformation it is also suspending the broadcasting activities of eight media which it believes are supporting and justifying Russia’s war.\nIn addition to demonstrating Europe’s support for Ukraine, today’s actions were also believed to be a sign to Donald Trump who has not included Europe as he pushes for peace with Russia. Yesterday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron reported they spoke by phone to demonstrate their commitment to Ukraine. Macron met with Donald Trump today, February 24, in Washington D.C. Starmer is also scheduled to meet with Trump on Thursday, February 27. European leaders are warning against appearing “weak” and not unified when speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTrump has discussed the sanctions while Russia highlighted that it wants the sanctions ended as part of any peace talks. The Biden Administration was aggressive in its efforts to sanction Russia, including designating 183 tankers in January 2025. Included in the latest effort was a broad effort including crude oil and product tankers and gas carriers associated with Sovcomflot as well as the shadow fleet.",

On both sides of the border, Baluchi separatists have mounted attacks on central government security forces, but attacks have intensified on the Iranian side of the border. Over the past six months, under the pretext of carrying out training exercises, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has mounted large-scale sweep operations across Sistan Baluchistan, and has suffered a steady flow of casualties.\nThe fighting in Chabahar broke out on February 22, when Jaish Al Adl separatists forced the evacuation of a government building responsible for the administration of rural affairs, then blew it up. Jaish Al Adl also attacked the Chabahar office of the Islamic Revolution Housing Foundation. A protracted gun battle was taking place in central Chabahar on the morning of February 25, widely shared on social media, as IRGC security forces attempted to surround a Jaish Al Adl position.\nIranian military and security forces raided a house in Chabahar, Sistan and Baluchestan, using RPGs and heavy gunfire as clashes continue.Halvash that covers the event in the southeastern province reports the area is fully surrounded, but details on casualties or the reason for…pic.twitter.com/cWykemERkR\nFor external observers of Iran, it is difficult to gauge when local fighting will spread to other restive areas and spark a wider insurrection. The Iranian Crown Prince in exile, interviewed on February 25, believes Iran is already “in a revolutionary, or at the very least, a pre-revolutionary fervor,\" he said. “It’s escalating every day.”\nBut more pertinently, the IRGC – as an acute internal observer of the scene –- evidently also believes this to be the case, mounting large-scale internal security exercises, focused on border areas with large minority populations. These ‘exercises’ are a mix of mobilization rehearsals, intimidatory shows of force and an opportunity to launch pre-emptive strikes on what are thought to be forces opposed to the Islamic regime. Besides Sistan Baluchistan, these ‘exercises’ have also covered the Kermanshah area of western Iran, the traditionally restive Arabic-speaking Khuzestan across the border from Basra, and Tehran itself. The IRGC’s primary role is not defense of the country, but protection of the Islamic Revolution and its leaders, and the areas where the IRGC has exercised are the first places to look for any further uprisings sparked by the activity in Chabahar.\nA particular area of concern for the IRGC appears to be the southern coastline abutting the Gulf of Oman, which has seen increased levels of both Iranian regular and IRGC naval activity.  Rear Admiral Shahram Irani, the regular Iranian Navy commander, told Press TV recently two of his five deployed flotillas were covering this southern flank from the Indian Ocean.\nThe unprecedented levels of IRGC activity have been accompanied by a series of statements from the IRGC’s senior leadership.  These statements reflect concern that the country may face further attacks from Israel, but also from the United States, aimed at neutralizing Iran’s covert nuclear weapons development program.  Such statements have threatened a True Promise-3 operation, a larger scale ballistic missile and drone attack than Operation True Promise-2 launched against Israel on October 1, 2024. The Iranians have also brandished their ability to mount drone attacks from ships, and have been resupplying their Houthis allies. On the political front, the Iranian leadership has intensified its courting of allies and sympathizers, seeking to enmesh them in its defense and security arrangements.",

Japan’s NYK Group (Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha) working in partnership with Seatrium and its design company LMG Marine, is reporting a groundbreaking step in advancing the sector.\nThe group’s design for an ammonia-fueled ammonia bunkering vessel has passed the next key milestone in its development. ClassNK reviewed the design engineering developed by LMG and issued the next Approval-in-Principle for the project. The partners report the design will now be submitted to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore for evaluation. Singapore hosted thefirst ammonia bunkering operationsand certification program in early 2024 for the converted offshore support vessel developed by Fortescue.\nThe AiP certification validated the ammonia-fueled ammonia bunkering vessel design’s compliance with stringent safety, technical, and environmental standards. LMG Marin provided design capabilities, leading to a Hazard Identification Study (HAZID) for design validation. The comprehensive HAZID conducted was instrumental in ensuring optimal safety, performance, and operational reliability.\nThe partners report the vessel design incorporates the consortium's two key features to ensure safety and operational reliability. It uses ammonia fuel dual-fuel engines from IHI Power Systems and a bunkering boom by TB Global Technologies. The bunkering boom features a unique technology called the High Speed Ammonia Purging Emergency Release System (ERS), which enables a reliable and efficient disconnection between vessels in an emergency.\nNYK is already at the forefront of ammonia-fueled shipping. In 2024, it completed the conversion of its pioneering LNG-fueled tugboatSakigakeinto an ammonia-powered vessel. It completed one of the firstammonia bunkering operationwhich used truck-based delivery and the vessel is now demonstrating operations in Tokyo Bay.\nThe effort to develop an ammonia bunker vessel began several years ago. In September 2022, theproject receivedits first AiP certification based on a 3D model.\nNYK said the design for the bunker vessel is an essential contribution to developing the infrastructure needed for ammonia bunkering.

    "input": "The Verified Gross Mass (VGM) regulation that took effect in 2016 was supposed to cut down significantly on the risk of misdeclared weights in container shipping, which can cause stack collapses and dangerous stability issues. A recent incident involving a U.S.-flagged boxship shows the potential hazards that still exist if incorrect weights are entered in booking systems and if containers aren't reweighed before loading.\nIn early 2024, a booking agent for cargo departing California was preparing a reservation of 40 container slots for the February 3 sailing of the U.S.-flagged boxship President Eisenhower. One of the containers was flagged as overweight, so the agent split the booking into one heavy container and 39 other containers. The weight info for the new entry for 39 containers didn't automatically populate, so the agent typed in the cargo weight for all 39 boxes - as 2.5 tonnes. When including the weight of the empty container, this yielded a total loaded weight of about six tonnes for each container, and this number was recorded in the booking system. In actuality, the real total VGM reported by the shipper on the bill of lading was between 25-29 tonnes, nearly five times as heavy as what the agent put into the booking system.\nOn February 2, 2024, these containers were loaded aboard President Eisenhower at the Port of LA's Fenix Marine Services terminal. The majority of the boxes were stowed in the upper tiers of bay 42 on the port and starboard side, a few bays forward of the deckhouse. They were not reweighed at the terminal, nor did the STS cranes at the pier have the ability to weigh in motion during loading. The Eisenhower's chief mate performed stability calculations and draft measurements with the (incorrect) loading information supplied, and passed all routine presail checks. Early the next day, Eisenhower got under way for Oakland.\nOn the morning February 6, Eisenhower arrived off Oakland and shut down the main engine to drift while awaiting a berth. Wind and sea conditions gradually increased through the day, rising to 20-knot winds and 12-foot swells. The boxship was rolling up to 18 degrees in these conditions.\nAt about 2130 hours, the AB on duty saw \"smoke\" in the air on the port side. The third mate sent the AB forward to check on the cargo, and the AB found that a stack of containers was missing from the port side of bay 42. The smoke was suspended powder from collapsed containers: a total of 23 had gone over the side, and another 10 were damaged. The collapse caused an estimated $630,000 in cargo damage and $105,000 in damage to the vessel; luckily no one was hurt.\nLater analyses by the ship operator found that the improper loading configuration with the heavier-than-declared boxes would have produced excessive forces, large enough to break the lashings in bay 42. \"The vessel would not have sailed with that configuration, had it been known,\" the company told NTSB.\nThe booking agent has changed its computer system to automatically capture the VGM from the shipper's original booking, and it now requires individual verification of all VGMs under 10 tonnes.",

The maximum shock intensity occurs in the third shot, and is equal to two-thirds of the maximum shock design value of the ship. The test process is expensive, typically costing tens of millions for preparation, evaluation and post-shock repairs.\nIn the past, full-ship shock trials have revealed design flaws with components that previously passed rigorous testing standards. As an example, early testing of the Flight I Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USSJohn Paul Jonesled to significant shock-hardening revisions, which were tested seven years later aboard the Flight IIA USSWinston Churchill.

The Western Australian Museum (WAM) worked in conjunction with the Dutch Cultural Heritage Agency (RCE) to identify the boat using the group's 3D model of the site.K XIis said to be one of the most significant vessels to have been discarded in or near the graveyard, which is the final resting place for about 50 shipwrecks.\nK XIwas built in Fijenoord, Rotterdam between 1922 and 1924 for the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNN) and was deployed to patrol waters in the colonial Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia). Commissioned in 1925, the submarine was the first of three boats in the K XI class and one of 25 boats built for the submarine division of the RNN. At least 15 boats were deployed in the Netherlands East Indies.\nOn March 9, 1942,K XI'screw rescued 13 survivors from the 151 crew of the Royal Australian Navy’s minesweeping and convoy escort sloop HMAS Yarra (II) that had been sunk by Japanese warships. The 13 men had survived in rough waters for five days floating on life rafts and clinging to life through occasional spoonfuls of water and a few biscuits.\n\nFor more than three decades, WA Museum has been investigating the Rottnest graveyard, where it believedK XIwas resting. When divers discovered the wreck outside of the main dumping site, RCE agreed to finance the photogrammetry work, which was developed into a 3D model and submitted to the WA Museum for identification.\n“Over the decades, the use of archival sources, local knowledge, and remote sensing surveys has allowed the Museum to identify a number of significant sites in the graveyard. In this project, we compared archival records with the 3D model created by Wrecksploration to confirm that the wreck was theK XI,” said Corioli Souter, Head of Maritime Heritage at the WA Museum.\nDuring WWII, Fremantle Harbor was the largest submarine base in the Southern Hemisphere and was the second-most important Allied submarine base in the Pacific Theatre after Pearl Harbor, with U.S, British and Dutch submarines operating from Fremantle.

It comes as the first contract which was awarded to Hapag-Lloyd for low-emission shipper services is set to kick off in 2025 and run into 2026.\nThe concept behind the initiative known as ZEMBA (Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance) and facilitated by the Aspen Institute builds demand by aggregating the shipping needs of members ranging from Ikea and Nike to Levi Straus and Electrolux. Over forty major manufacturing and consumer brands are currently members of the alliance. The group launched its first tender in 2024 saying the goal was to accelerate commercial deployment of clean energy powered shipping. By aggregating demand, they are enabling economies of scale and building lead-edge demand to encourage the shipping and fuel industries to pursue their initiatives.\nUnder the first tender, well-known brands including Amazon, Patagonia, Bauhaus, New Balance, Nike, REI, and others agreed to purchase over one billion TEU miles on the route between Singapore and Rotterdam in 2025 and 2026. Hapag as the winner of the tender agreed to provide an independently certified and exclusive waste-based biomethane service.\nThe second tender launched today and accepting proposals through the spring of 2025 shifts to a focus on e-fuels. ZEMBA reported in October 2024 that a survey of the industry found sufficient predicted supply of both e-methanol and e-methanol-capable vessels in the container segment to support ZEMBA’s focus on e-fuel deployment. They noted however that many producers remained at the pre-FID stage, casting doubt on whether those projects would begin production on projected timelines and, related, if e-fuel-capable dual fuel vessels would actually run on e-fuels without spurring demand.\nWith the second tender, ZEMBA intends to aggregate approximately 86 billion tonne nautical miles of demand for the emissions abatement associated with e-fuel-powered shipping to be deployed starting in 2027. This equates to 1.5 million TEU transported across the Pacific by e-fuels, assuming a benchmark distance of Shanghai to Los Angeles and projects enabling companies to abate approximately 500,000 metric tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, subject to final commercial details.\n“Getting e-fuel-powered shipping on the water for the first time through this collaborative forward procurement will be a huge technical and commercial innovation milestone for the sector,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, President and CEO of ZEMBA.\nA qualifying bid for ZEMBA’s tender will be a proposal from a containership carrier or consortium for e-fuel-powered shipping for three to five years, starting around 2027. All bids must demonstrate at least a 90 percent lifecycle emission reduction for the primary propulsion of the vessels compared to a high-emission fuel baseline.\nZEMBA will select the best proposal(s), and after vetting and commercial negotiation, members will enter bilateral contracts with the winner(s). For this tender, ZEMBA is open to the potential of multiple winners. Results of the second tender are expected to be announced by the end of 2025.",

France's ambassador to Cyprus, Clélia Chevrier Kola?ko, was the guest of honor and keynote speaker.\nThe AUVs are paired with a docking system for recharging, and will provide 24/7 monitoring. Each drone can stay on station for up to a month at a time, thanks to the charging dock. The system incorporates swarming technology to allow the mini-AUVs to communicate and act together, and should be much less expensive than tethered solutions.\nThe testing phase is under way at the Ayia Napa marina, but the first real deployment for the drone subs will be at an artificial reef off Limassol, off Cyprus' south coast. The cement-based reef structure will contain the docking station, as well as a transmitter that will allow the AUVs to send information back to shore.\nThe AUV system also has potential applications in defense, an Arkeocean executive told AP, as it can loiter for long periods and operate without detection below the surface.",

For the first time in a generation, they are seeing the liner at sea and despite years without maintenance, she is still casting her famous profile.\nThe nearly 1,000-foot liner encountered some difficult weather conditions off the Virginia coast over the weekend which forced the tug, Vinik 6, to “hove to” to wait out the worst of the weather conditions. The captain of the vessel, Mike Vinik is posting comments and doing media interviews describing the tow as the experience of a lifetime.\nVinik told Fox 10 TV News in Mobile that they had encountered 45 mph winds and 14-foot seas on Saturday. He said the liner had gone into the wind forcing them to slow the tow. The ship is attached with an anchor chain and approximately 1,800 feet astern of the tug. At one-point, Vinik said they however were nearly alongside with the liner having turned sideways to the tug.\n\n\n\nOnce the weather abated, Vinik reports there were making speeds of between six and seven knots and sometimes up to eight knots. The tow plan projected speeds of five to six knots. Vinik maneuvered the tow to avoid the strongest elements of the Gulf Stream to aid the tow, but reports as they got south the weather has consistently improved.\nAt one point they encountered a unique phenomenon, “sea smoke.” The air temperatures were in the 30s or 40s Fahrenheit while sea temperatures were 80 to 85 degrees as they entered the Gulf Stream region. The liner also had “escorts” of a sort, including a whale and great white shark.\n\n\n\nThe tow is progressing ahead of schedule with the ship offpassing central Floridamidday on Tuesday, February 25. Vinik said in his interview they would reach the Florida Straits late tonight or early tomorrow morning.

It is the largest yet built for methanol and part of the company's diversified future offering including LNG and ammonia-fueled engines.\nThe Swiss company which has been in the engine business since 1893 highlights that the new methanol engine is ready for delivery after passing factory and type approval tests. It launched the line with a ten-cylinder, 92-bore X-DF-M engine while reporting it is offering engines with bore sizes ranging from 52 to 96, in similar cylinder configurations and engine rating fields as its diesel-fueled engines. The methanol rollout proceeds ammonia-fueled engines which are still in the testing phase but expected as early as mid-year.\n“Production of sustainable, renewable fuels of all types continues to advance, but long-term availability and cost remain uncertain,” commented Dominik Schneiter, CEO of WinGD. As interest in methanol and regulatory clarity increases, we anticipate the X-DF-M platform will become a key contributor to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from global shipping.”\nThe milestone was marked by a delivery ceremony held at engine builder CMD in Shanghai and included a ceremony for the signing of the approval certificate by eight classification societies. According to WinGD, this assures that the engine can be built to WinGD’s design by all engine builders.\nThe first engine will be shipped to COSCO Heavy Industry’s shipyard and is slated for installation on a 16,000 TEU containership being built for COSCO Shipping. COSCO is expanding its methanol operations after having also recently celebrated the naming of China’s first large methanol-fueled containership earlier this month. WindGD reports the new engine will be installed on the fourth ship of a new class with the other three ships’ engines being converted after the first methanol engine is commissioned.\nWinGD reports it has 56 orders for X-DF-M engines on order across bore sizes ranging from 52 to 92, X-Engines. The addition of methanol capability to WinGD’s engine line-up further extends the decarbonization options available to deep-sea ship operators, which include the long-established X-DF LNG-fueled engine platform and a new ammonia-fueled X-DF-A platform which is currently in the testing phase.\nThe company was acquired in 2016 by China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC).

The Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Secretariat of the Ministry of Economy cited it as a move to support free trade and to grow Argentina’s export industry and role in world trade.\nJavier Gerardo Milei who became president of Argentina in 2023 has been seeking to grow the country’s role in global trade. The country, which is already one of the leaders in the global export of frozen and refrigerated meat, said the move will allow for greater competition within the livestock and meat sector, greater market freedom, and provide a significant source of foreign currency.\nThe ministry called the ban outdated and not reflecting the current focus on free development. It declared that there were no reasons to maintain the restriction while asserting that developing the live export trade would encourage the improvement of livestock breeds and add prestige to national production. It said the repeal was in keeping with a government policy to promote “an economic system based on free decisions, adopted in an area of free competition, with respect for private property and the constitutional principles of free circulation of goods, services, and labor.”\nThe move is likely to face strong opposition from global animal rights groups which have increased pressure on the trade and governments around the world. They argue it is inhumane treatment of the animals and unnecessary cruelty. After years of pressure, New Zealand banned live export in 2023 followed by moves in Great Britain. Australia has limited its trade and is scheduled to end the export of sheep in 2028.\nAnimal rights groups have also been successful in demanding changes to the vessels used for live export after documenting conditions aboard. Combined with the bans, the shipping industry is in decline. In January 2025, Wellard, which had been involved in live export for 46 years and once was described as Australia’s largest live export business, announced the sale of its last vessel and an end to live exports.\nDespite the pressure, the trade however has persisted. Experts report continuing demand from countries including Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Argentina, Peru, and Colombia. Argentina’s neighboring country Brazil has been conducting live export since 2010 with reports saying around 2.6 million live cattle were shipped. Advocates however are also pressing Brazil to end its live exports.\nFor Argentina, live export is seen as a new opportunity to expand on its record levels of exports of frozen, refrigerated, and processed beef. The Ministry reported today, February 26, that Argentina increased beef exports by 10 percent in 2024 reaching a total of 935,261 tons. It was the highest level since a record reached in 1924 of 918 thousand tons. The main destinations for Argentina’s beef in 2024 were the United States, as well as China, Mexico, Canada, and Malaysia. In total, Argentina ships to 53 international markets, which was up by 11 in 2024.\nThe Ministry says Argentina's beef exports reflect the combination of quality, market diversification, and the ability to adapt to international demands. They report the meat sector is emerging as a pillar of the country’s economic growth.",

    "input": "\nIf implemented, the Trump administration's proposed million-dollar port fees for Chinese-built ships would increase costs for American shippers, according to analysts for Dutch banking group ING.\nThe White House's Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has proposed unprecedented access fees for Chinese-operated and Chinese-built ships, ranging up to $1.5 million per port call. The objective is to counter the support that China has provided to its yards and shipowners for decades; China now leads the world in shipbuilding and (by some measures) shipowning.\nIn a notice earlier this week, the USTR announced that it has determined that \"China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance is unreasonable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce.\" It laid out a series of possible million-dollar port call fees for Chinese vessel operators, other operators of Chinese-built ships, and operators with newbuilds on order at Chinese yards (China's orderbook accounts for more than half of all new tonnage). USTR is taking public comments on the proposal until late March, and the results will be forwarded to President Donald Trump for a decision.\nChinese-built tonnage accounts for 17 percent of all boxship port calls in the United States, and more on specific trade lanes. According to ING, the fees - if imposed as advertised - would exclude state-owned Chinese carrier COSCO from U.S. ports. All other large carriers are based in Europe or Asia, and would be subject to the proposal's \"Chinese-built\" port call fees. As China holds a particular dominance in the construction of container ships - accounting for 60 percent of the boxship orderbook - the fees will likely rise. As the fee structure is assessed based on the composition of each operator's entire global fleet, simply rerouting Chinese-built ships onto non-U.S. rotations would not be enough to evade the extra cost. \"These additional expenses would likely be passed on from the carrier to shippers and, ultimately, to importers and exporters,\" ING's analysts cautioned.\nThe USTR also proposed an ambitious quota requirement for up to 15 percent of U.S. exports to be shipped aboard U.S.-flagged ships by 2032 - including five percent aboard U.S.-built ships. ING expressed skepticism that U.S. yards have the capacity or the workforce resources to build large tonnage at that scale on a seven-year timeframe.\nShipping interests are famously adept at circumventing control measures, and one loophole appears to be available. Canada has ports that are not in the United States, and these would be exempt from any U.S. port fees. Many shippers already send large quantities of cargo from Asia to Prince Rupert and Vancouver, B.C., then have it moved into the U.S. heartland by intermodal rail. The fee would prompt U.S. shippers to shift more cargo to trans-Canadian routes, noted Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen in a social media message.",

Among the terms the union is highlighting is a 62 percent wage increase, accelerated wage raises for new ILA workers, container royalty funds for the ILA, and improved benefits including healthcare for members. Daggett in a message to members said the new contract was worth about $35 billion, nearly twice the previous agreement.\nThe terms are retroactive to October 1, 2024, when the prior contract expired. Wage increases had been deferred after terms were reached in October until the full contract was completed. The new contract covers approximately 35 ports from Maine to Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It runs till September 30, 2030.\nDaggett is publicly declaring a key win saying it is the greatest contract in ILA history. He reports it provides “full protections against automation,” without providing details on the contract terms. The ILA had firmly declared it would not accept automation or semi-automation for any port operations.\nIn December 2024, then President-elect Donald Trump met with the union leaders. He also issued a strong statement against port automation.\nThe Associated Press and Bloomberg, however, are reporting that a compromise was found allowing operators to implement technology as long as it does not impact jobs. Mathew Leech, CEO of Ports America, told Bloomberg that automation was separated from other efficiency-enhancing technology. AP reports there is “more leeway to introduce modernizing technology.”\nThe previous contract required technology proposals to be submitted to a committee that included union representatives for review. Ports such as the Port of New York New Jersey highlighted there was no automation in use at its terminals, a point that operators said was both a handicap and hindering growth and efficiency.\nBloomberg reports the operators also won concessions on issues related to a lack of labor reliability and absenteeism. Daggett in his message to members said that no-shows had to stop and said reliability was critical in their efforts to oppose automation.\nThe board of the ILA and the members of USMX which represents the terminal operators and shipping companies had previously approved the new contract.

On Sunday, ABF vessels located and intercepted the two Indonesian boats near Maningrida and Port Essington. They detained the fishermen, confiscated the catch of 1,200 kilos of sea cucumber, and seized the fishing equipment.

The emergence of the fuel is a critical step toward meeting the requirements of the FuelEU Maritime regulations and demonstrates a pathway for the industry with alternative fuels.\nThe bunkering was a partnership between STX Group and Molgas which collaborated to source, liquify, and deliver the certified bio-LNG. It was the first time that Molgas delivered mass balanced bio-LNG bunker to a maritime customer in Norway.\nThe fuel was delivered to Furetank, a Swedish tanker shipping company that operates 40 vessels in European waters. A total of 200 tonnes of bio-LNG was loaded to theFure Viken(17,942 dwt) while the vessel was anchored outside Mongstad, Norway. The tanker, which is 492 feet (150 meters) in length was delivered in 2024 as part of a program to modernize Furetank’s fleet. The first of the vessels was introduced in 2018 and the company highlights with the last delivery scheduled for 2027, it will have renewed its entire fleet. The vessels are dual-fuel to use LNG or gasoil, equipped for shore power, and are designed with a battery hybrid solution and several innovative features that reduce fuel and energy consumption.\n“We see a growing demand and interest in Bio-LNG, as it is one of the few renewable fuel solutions currently available in shipping. For this operation, we collaborated to prove a mass-balanced biomethane delivery and certify the entire supply chain. This new option strengthens the competitiveness of biomethane as part of the green transition,” said Gunnar Helmen, Director Marine at Molgas Nordics.\nBio-LNG is a mass-balanced product where biomethane of certified origins is purchased and injected into the gas grid. A corresponding amount of gas is withdrawn from the grid and liquefied into maritime fuel.\nEnvironmental commodity trader STX Group said it sees this transaction as one of the first signs of a new fuel market being born.\nBio-LNG has been emerging in the past few years as an option for shipping companies. Trade group SEA-LNG reported in a 2023 market analysis that annual production of biomethane, from which bio-LNG is produced, was around 30 million tonnes or around 10 percent of shipping’s total annual energy demand. It is growing in availability at ports including Rotterdam and in Asia and in 2024, Hapag-Lloyd working with Titan Clean Fuels, reported one of the largest bunkering operations to date. Hapag-Lloyd’sBrussels Expressloaded 2,200 tonnes of the alternative fuel at the Port of Rotterdam.\nThe companies called bio-LNG an “efficient answer” to FuelEU Maritime, noting the regulation rewards those who blend in biofuels and penalizes those who do not blend. They also noted that the new regulation makes no distinction between mass-balanced and off-grid produced biomethane. The companies assert that this opens up a new path for shipping in the transition to renewable energy, surpassing some of the hurdles of lack in biomethane supply and delivery infrastructure.\nOne of the challenges remains the lack of investment to achieve a critical supply level for the maritime industry. The companies note that their goal is for this demonstration to demonstrate the opportunities while they are also calling for public policy to further support the development of the production capabilities for renewable fuels.",

The launch of the Alliance aligns with the broader industry commitment that calls for increased investment in customs operations, digital transformation, and enhanced public-private partnerships to address the growing complexity of global trade.\n“Smart Cargo and Container Telematics are the foundation for the 21st Century Supply Chain with revolutionary new solutions for our society, authorities, governments, and businesses to structurally reduce illicit trade, cargo contamination, cargo waste, theft and supply chain carbon footprint while simultaneously enhance product authentication, on-time delivery commitments, asset productivity and cargo integrity and quality,” said Charles Vincent, CEO of ARVIEM, a technology company focusing on real-time end-to-end cargo monitoring services, and one of the founders of the Alliance.\nAccording to the group, over the past four years, smart container technologies have played a crucial role in enabling customs authorities and shipping companies to detect and intercept illicit goods, leading to multiple successful drug seizures. The Alliance will leverage this experience to push for greater adoption and regulatory support.\nThe launch of the Smart Container Alliance comes at a pivotal moment, coinciding with the most ambitious reform of the EU Customs Union since its inception in 1968. Smart containers are set to play a key role in the shift towards a data-driven approach to customs checks, reinforcing security measures across European ports and beyond.\nThe Alliance will advocate for the economic and technological benefits of smart container solutions, championing concrete use cases that demonstrate their transformative potential. With its headquarters in Brussels, it will engage with policymakers, industry leaders, and enforcement agencies to support a harmonized approach to trade security. A key focus will be aligning efforts with the European Port Alliance to counter criminal infiltration and reinforce supply chain integrity.\nArviem, Globe Tracker, ORBCOMM, Hoopo, Traxens, and Nexxiot are the founding members of the Smart Container Alliance.

The wind farm was selected in the tri-state solicitation in 2024 with Massachusetts and Rhode Island agreeing to split power from the 2.4 GW project. In one of its final acts, the Biden administration approved the construction plan for the wind farm on January 18, 2025.\nAs part of its year-end financial reports, EDPR said today, February 27, took an approximately $139 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2024 as it postponed the project. Final negotiations were underway with Massachusetts, while financing and the interconnects were in place, and the company said it had an “attractive” power purchase agreement.\nConstruction on the U.S. wind farm was expected to begin in 2025. The company had previously projected the wind farm which would be located 30 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and 20 miles south of Nantucket would be completed by 2030. The new timetable does not anticipate starting construction until 2029.\n“That’s a slightly worst case scenario,” Miguel Stilwell d’Andrade, chief executive of EDPR told analysts during the investment community conference call. He said the company was still working on the project getting it “ready to go,” but that it has “taken the more prudent approach,” anticipating a delay.\nThe company told the analysts that it does not intend to abandon the project but it is the “prudent approach given recent executive orders and permit reviews.” Further, it cited the slow pace of approvals in Europe noting that it would be reducing its pace of investments in renewable capacity in 2025 and 2026.\nThe joint venture company, Ocean Winds, also holds earlier stage leases in the United States for Bluepoint Wind in the New York Bight and Golden State Wind off California. The company is active in a total of eight countries and highlights that it continues to make progress on its projects in Europe and Asia. It was also granted a feasibility license by the Australian Government in 2024.\nEDP Renewables follows moves by several other developers adjusting their U.S. projects. France’s EDF reported last week that it was writing down its investment in the Atlantic Shores project planned for New Jersey. Shell had earlier said that it was exiting the project joint venture.\nBP also withdrew its application for the transmission system connections for its Beacon Wind project. Vineyard Offshore, which is a U.S.-based affiliate of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, also reported it would be reworking its plans for Vineyard Wind 2 after Connecticut failed to move forward with power agreements.\nOther U.S. projects currently under construction, including Vineyard Wind 1, Coastal Virginia, and Revolution Wind are proceeding. The uncertainties center around projects with permits and those currently under review by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Trump ordered that the projects be reviewed and imposed a moratorium on leases and reviews on his first day in office.",

Weather continues to hamper the efforts of the Coast Guard and a private salvage team with the latest update reporting they are focusing on the fuel and other possible contaminants aboard.\nThe vessel was abandoned on February 15 after it was driven onto the rocky shoreline of western Newfoundland. A helicopter rescued the crew.\nSince the 679-foot (203-meter) vessel went ashore, winter storms have continued to impact the area. The Coast Guard says teams are frequently unable to get aboard the ship and the weather is hampering some of the water operations. They are monitoring the ship from shore and the air.\nAt the beginning of the week, they reported that divers have confirmed that there were significant breaches or holes in the hull below the waterline. The vessel has settled firmly to the seabed and so far, they have not found significant breaks about the waterline. However, pictures have shown some deformations in the hull and the possibility of a crack.\n\n\nA crack appears to be forming to the right in the photo and deformations had previously been seen midship (Canadian Coast Guard February 24 photo)\n\n“Given the vessel’s current condition, it cannot be safely refloated,” the Coast Guard writes in its updated issued late on February 27. “The initial focus will be on the removal of the fuel and cargo.”\nBased on the urgency of the situation, the Coast Guard says it is looking at alternatives including repairing an old road and all-terrain vehicle trail that could be used to reach the remote location. They told The Telegram newspaper that the road would need upgrades to handle heavy equipment and tractor trailers. The Coast Guard is also looking at building an access point from shore to the bow of the vessel the newspaper reports.\nThe surveys have confirmed that there are approximately 1.7 million liters of heavy fuel oil and marine gas on board. While no pollution has been observed, there are concerns over a potential breach. One of the steps being explored is pumping the fuel to shore because it may not be possible to get a salvage vessel alongside.\nMSC initially advised the Coast Guard that the vessel had approximately 470 containers aboard, over half of which were empty. The others are carrying items such as food, lumber, and paper supplies. In the latest updates, the Coast Guard said however eight containers with polymer beads (nurdles) have been marked as a priority for removal.\nThe Coast Guard says that there are materials aboard considered dangerous goods in shipping terms, such as the nurdles as well as flour and whiskey. Nothing aboard however is hazardous under normal conditions.\nThe biggest issue is the race against time to reduce the risks as the winter storms are likely to persist in the region and further batter the vessel.",

Phelan testified on his views of the Navy's most urgent problems and fielded questions from committee members, providing detailed answers to questions about specific programs and describing the need to reform contracting processes.\nIf confirmed, Phelan would be the first Navy Secretary in recent memory without any professional experience in or with the military. It would also be the largest management role of his career: at the Navy, he would oversee a sprawling global enterprise with 340,000 active-duty servicemembers, 100,000 reservists, 220,000 civilian employees, over 50 base installations, and a supply chain of overstretched and over-budget contractors. (Forecast layoffs and cost-cutting at the Pentagon level may reduce the service's head count in the near term.)\nIn the hearing, Phelan pitched his outsider status as an asset. \"The Navy and the Marine Corps already possess extraordinary operational expertise within their ranks,\" he said. \"My role is to utilize that expertise and strengthen it, step outside the status quo and take decisive action with a results-oriented approach.\"\nPhelan acknowledged the serious challenges facing the Navy, including the hard fact that it risks losing dominance on the high seas. China's overwhelming advantage in shipbuilding and heavy investment in fleet modernization have made the PLA Navy the largest naval force by tonnage in the world. Its surface combatants are backed up by the world's largest merchant fleet and a growing inventory of antiship ballistic missiles.\n\"Every shipbuilding delay, every maintenance backlog and every inefficiency is an opening for our adversaries to challenge our dominance. We cannot allow that to happen,\" said Phelan. \"I would push for a more agile, accountable and flexible shipbuilding strategy by streamlining procurement, enhancing budget flexibility, strengthening partnerships with the defense industrial base, and holding contractors accountable for cost and schedule overruns.\"\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to approve Phelan's nomination in early March, followed by approval from the Republican-controlled Senate.",

    "input": "\nThe European Commission presented its new Clean Industry Deal as the next ambitious step in a decarbonization strategy. The plan follows on from the FuelEU initiative that aims to reduce carbon emissions saying it will accelerate decarbonization while providing support to secure the future of European industry.\nThe Commission said it is launching the ambitious new program to make the regulatory environment more efficient. Its goal is to reduce bureaucratic hurdles. The plan focuses mainly on two sectors which they said are closely linked and critical to success for the decarbonization efforts. One focus is on energy-intensive industries which the Commission recognizes face high energy costs, unfair global competition, and complex regulations that are harming competitiveness. The other focus is on advancing clean tech.\n“The demand for clean products has slowed down, and some investments have moved to other regions,” said Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. “We know that too many obstacles still stand in the way of our European companies from high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden. The Clean Industrial Deal is to cut the ties that still hold our companies back and make a clear business case for Europe.”\nOne of the key debates that shaped the FuelEI Maritime regulations and continue in Europe is the investment and availability of alternative, low-carbon fuels. Production lags and companies have remained slow to make costly investments. Experts have said the supply of the fuel and the competition among industries could be one of the key hurdles to reaching the goals to lower carbon emissions.\n“Affordable energy is the foundation of competitiveness,” the Commission said in rolling out its plan. It adopted an Action Plan on Affordable Energy to lower energy bills for industry, businesses, and households. According to the Commission, the new act will speed up the roll-out of clean energy as well as accelerate electrification. It will support the efforts to complete physical interconnects across the internal energy markets while encouraging more efficient use of energy and cutting the dependence on fossil fuels.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal the European Commission estimates will mobilize over €100 billion to support EU-made clean manufacturing and adopt a new framework for simpler and quicker state aid measures for the roll-out of renewable energy, industrial decarbonization, and manufacturing capacity of clean tech. It is aiming for €100 billion in funding for its Innovation Fund and a proposed Industrial Decarbonization Bank. Amended regulations they also estimate will attract up to €50 billion in private-public investment.\nThe maritime sector immediately came out in strong support of the plan. The European Sea Ports Organisation (ESPO) welcomed the plan saying it would provide critical support to ports that are vital to the efforts. The ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp-Bruges issued statements in strong support and calling for the immediate implementation of the proposals.\nThe European Shipowners (ECSA) also announced support saying timing was critical. It welcomed the inclusion of shipping in the focus sectors while emphasizing the need to de-risk investments in fuels for shipping. Danish Shipping also applauded the plans highlighting the focus on increasing and lowering the cost of renewable energy. It said the European Commission is “focusing on exactly the right areas.”\nThe presentation said the Clean Industrial Deal is a critical framework and provides the basis for tailoring action plans for specific sectors. The Commission reports it will present an Action Plan for the automotive industry in March and an Action Plan on steel and metals in spring. Other tailored actions are also planned.",

The move reverses a strategy launched just four years ago to take the long-time containership owner into the dry bulk segment.\nThe company has been in business for 51 years and focused recently on containerships. It currently has a fleet of 68 owned containerships with a total capacity of approximately 513,000 TEU. The ships sail for well-known carriers ranging from COSCO, Evergreen, and Yang Ming to Maersk, MSC, Hapag-Lloyd, and Zim. In its year-end 2024 financial report, the company highlighted contracts had been fixed for 96 percent of its containership capacity in 2025 and 69 percent in 2026.\nCostamare surprised the industry in June 2021 reporting it had decided to enter the dry bulk sector. At the time they called it a liquid sector with strong fundamentals that would provide enhanced return opportunities for shareholders. Management pointed to a low orderbook and demand that was being driven by increased infrastructure spending and commodity consumption.\nThe position in dry bulk was launched with the acquisition of 16 vessels in 2021. They ranged between 33,000 and 85,000 dwt, with an average age of 10 years.  Today, Costamare owns 38 dry bulk carriers with a total capacity of approximately three million dwt and has a total of 51 bulkers on its operating platform.\nThe company reported income of more than $290 million for 2024, but the markets for containerships and dry bulk have moved divergently. Last year, demand for containerships was very strong while analysts have questioned the prospects for segments of dry bulk. Bulkers operate on short-term charters with the company reporting in late 2024 and early 2025 that it executed over 50 charters.\nThe new strategy calls for a spin-off of the dry bulk business into a standalone company that will include the vessels and the operating platform. It will also trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The original company will retain the containerships and its Neptune Maritime Leasing operation.\n“The board believes the proposed separation will unlock the inherent value within the two companies, which have unique growth prospects and investment opportunities,” according to the announcement. In addition to creating two pure-play investment opportunities, the transaction they said would provide a simplified structure. Management they said would have an enhanced focus on the individual business and the companies would have improved financial flexibility.\nTerms of the spin-off have not yet been set and the transaction requires final approval from the board of directors. Costamare said the spin-off is expected to be completed as soon as practical within this calendar year.",

He is asking the Supreme Court to confirm the unconstitutionality of the contract as a step toward terminating the agreements.\nIt is the latest step by the government of Panama to address concerns raised by Donald Trump who has repeatedly asserted China is running the canal and that the United States would take it back. Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino has alternately taken steps to appease Trump while also telling the U.S. to stop spreading “lies and falsehoods.” Mulino had been scheduled to have a telephone call with Trump on February 7, but it was canceled by the U.S. due to “last-minute scheduling conflicts.”\nThe Panamanian news agency reported yesterday, February 26, that Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez had reviewed the concession contract between the Panamanian State and Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of Hutchison. The Chinese company has been active in Panama since 1997, two years before the final U.S. handover of the canal, and has a contract for the development, construction, administration, and management of port terminals. In 2021, Hutchison received a no-bid 25-year extension of its contract. The company operates terminals in Balboa and Cristobal, two of the country’s five ports.\nGómez concluded that the contract improperly agreed to transfer the rights of the Panamanian state. He said the contract affects public welfare and interest, thereby affecting free competition and demand.\nThe opinion was submitted to the court on February 19 in support of two suits filed challenging the 2021 contract which was awarded during the administration by a previous president of Panama. The suit says the company is also benefitting from tax breaks and other agreements.\nMulino took office in July 2024 promising to clean up the problems of the prior administrations. In January, Panamanian Comptroller General Anel Bolo Flores announced that they would be auditing the 2021 contract with Hutchison.\nThe government of Panama and the Panama Canal Commission which operates the canal met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early in February during his first trip since assuming the role. Rubio, accompanied by a delegation of representatives from the United States government, was received at the Miraflores locks by the Canal Administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, to observe operations. Vásquez said he expressed the ongoing commitment to ensure a safe, uninterrupted, and efficient operation.\nThe Panama Canal Authority said after the meeting it had conveyed to Secretary Rubio its intention to work with the U.S. Navy to optimize the transit priority of U.S. Navy vessels through the Panama Canal. The U.S. State Department issued an announcement saying Panama had agreed to free transit for the U.S. Navy but later was forced to walk back its statement.\nPanama took other steps after Trump’s repeated acquisitions. It filed a formal notice with China that it was withdrawing from the Belt and Road initiative. China responded saying the Trump administration is applying \"pressure and coercion\" on Panama.",

The job actions and strikes began earlier this month and now a second union, Unite, reports that its members have also voted to start a series of actions in early March.\nThe strikes are unusual because Unite and the other union, Prospect, are not disputing their contracts or striking for higher wages. Both unions, however, are demanding that Serco consult with them as part of ongoing negotiations with the Royal Navy for a new service contract for Serco. The company is currently in talks with the UK’s Ministry of Defence about the renewal of its 10-year contract.\nSerco took over as the service provider for the Royal Navy at its bases at Devonport, Portsmouth, Faslane, Great Harbour Greenock, and Kyle of Lochalsh after the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service was privatized in 2008. Serco provides towage activities, bunkering and watering, tank cleaning, passenger services, trial work, munitions, and nuclear safety activities for the Royal Navy.\nBoth unions report that in the past their members were consulted during the contract negotiations. Unite highlights that it represents approximately 300 tugboat and marine services crews, which is about half of Serco Marine’s workforce. Many of the individuals transferred to Serco during the privatization with Unite reporting these people have between 20 and 45 years of experience.\nUnite contends the new contract is valued at £1.2 billion, but it believes the Royal Navy is seeking to reduce the contract by £250 million, which Unite says is putting 100 jobs at risk. The unions believe their members can provide critical insights into the operations. Unite, however, alleges the cuts could include reducing the number of tugs handling nuclear submarines from six to four, which it says would be a violation of nuclear safety legislation.\nPromise, which mainly provides services at Faslane, Portsmouth, and Devonport, began the strikes with a 24-hour stoppage on February 3. Since then, it has been taking actions short of a strike, which include adherence to work rules and a ban on overtime.\nUnite plans to join the strike with tug masters, boatmasters, and bargemasters stopping work for 24 hours on March 6. The following day, March 7, technical managers, workshop managers, senior engineers, junior engineers, tank cleaners, and technicians will strike for 24 hours. Then on March 10, all shore grades, office, workshop and shore staff, mates, able seaman, fuel supervisors, barge operatives, and pilot boat crews will stop work for 24 hours. Unite is also banning overtime and will adhere to work rules starting on March 6. Unite also said further actions would be scheduled if the dispute is not resolved.\nSeco told UK media that it has regular engagement with both of the unions and that it was disappointed by the decision to strike. They emphasized that this is currently no change in the services provided under the Royal Navy contract.\nThe Royal Navy and the Ministry of Defence told the media that it is an internal dispute between an employer and its unions.

Later ReCAAP ISC reported there had been two other incidents earlier on Friday with the group warning of a possibility of more assaults on ships.\nThe Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and the Singapore Civil Defense Force reported that the Singapore-registered chemical tankerBasset(49,875 dwt) was boarded in the early morning hours of Friday, February 28. The incident happened at 0650 local time while the vessel was underway approximately 2 nautical miles outside Singapore’s territorial waters.\nThe vessel’s AIS signal showed it had departed Tanjung Pelepas, to the west of Singapore in Malaysia, and was transiting the Strait to Pengerang in Malaysia east of Singapore. Built in 2019 at Japan Marine United’s Maizuru Works, the vessel is owned by Grace Ocean and reported to have a service speed of 15 knots, although it is unclear what speed it was traveling at and if it was currently loaded.\nThe Civil Defense office reportsed it received a request for assistance approximately 20 minutes after the tanker was boarded.

In January, however, a bulker was boarded also while it was underway in the Singapore Strait. There were six perpetrators and they tied up at least one crewmember. The perpetrators are mostly stealing ship stores, scrap metal, and engine spares, but ReCAAP has highlighted this year an increase in the times when the boarders are carrying guns or gun-like objects and knives.\nReCAAP has repeated raised concerns about the increase in the number of incidents and is now warning that there is a possibility of yet further incidents. For all of 2024, there were a total of 107 incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in Asia. The data shows that 58 percent of the incidents were in or around the Singapore Strait.\nCountries in the region are increasing patrols and surveillance while ReCAAP is urging vigilance and responding promptly to incidents reported by ships. They have also called for strengthening the coordination and promoting information sharing on incidents and criminal groups involved to arrest the perpetrators.

The stern ramp on the ferry was still down, a violation of maritime protocols, and four crewmembers were standing there as Antonis Kargiotis came running up and jumped onto the ramp. He is in a scuffle with a crewmember as the ferry begins to move. In the video, the crewmember appeared topush Kargiotiswho fell into the harbor and was caught in the wake. He drowned while the crew and horrified passengers looked on.\nFamily members argued that Kargiotis could have purchased a ticket onboard, if he did not have one or that the crewmembers could have taken him into custody and turned him over to the Coast Guard or police. Prosecutors argued that in addition to deliberately pushing the passenger, the crew stood there and made no effort to aid the person in the water.\nCharges were brought against the captain of the Blue Horizon, the first officer who was on the ramp and pushed Kargiotis, as well as the second officer and a boatswain who were also at the stern as the vessel departed. The incident took place on September 5, 2023, as the ferry departed at 2100 from Piraeus for Heraklion, Crete. The vessel continued to sail and did not return to the port for approximately 40 minutes until the port authority and coast guard demanded its return to Piraeus.\nDefense attorneys for the captain argued there was no intent to cause death while also emphasizing gaps in port security as well as the role of the coast guard and port security. In the video, a person could be seen on the dock after the passenger falls into the water. Attorneys for the first officer argued it was a spontaneous response and there was no intent to cause harm, only to deny boarding to a late arriver. The defense had sought to have the charges changed from intent and manslaughter to negligence.\nThe jury convicted the first officer of manslaughter and the court handed down a sentence of 12.5 years in prison. The captain was convicted for allowing the ferry to depart after a fatal incident and covering up the crime. The captain was sentenced to 7 years and 5 months. The court noted that the sentences were reduced because of the individuals’ previous lawful conduct.\nLawyers argued for suspended sentences pending appeal. The court denied the request and ordered the captain and first officer sent to prison while their appeals are pending.\nThe second officer and boatswain were acquitted.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Vice President Geraldo Alkmin, and the Minister of Mines and Energy, Alexandre Silveira, attended to demonstrate the government’s commitment to the maritime, shipbuilding, and energy sectors.\nTwo initiatives were announced during the Brazilian Naval and Offshore Industry Business Fair with the federal government saying it will foster new opportunities in the sector. Petrobras CEO Magda Chambriard said the new initiative was in line with the gradual increase in natural gas production while predicting it would boost job creation and expand participation of Brazilian industry in the maritime and offshore sectors.\n“We will consolidate Transpetro as the largest Brazilian shipowner in gas transportation, strengthening the company in a segment that is of great importance to the Petrobras System and all of Brazil,” announced Transpetro CEO Sérgio Bacci. He said it was part of the broader plan to renew and expand Transpetro’s fleet and provide less exposure to vessel charters.\nThe effort calls for increasing the number of vessels in the gas tanker fleet from six to 14 and increasing the transport capacity from 36,000 to 108,000 cubic meters. The companies launched a tender for eight new gas carriers split into two tenders. The first is for five vessels, with three vessels with a capacity of 7,000 cubic meters and two with a capacity of 14,000 cubic meters. These gas carriers will be pressurized and intended for the transport of LPG and derivatives. The second tender is for three semi-refrigerated vessels with a capacity of 10,000 cubic meters which would be the first for the company capable of transporting ammonia.\nThe design of the vessels calls for them to be 20 percent more efficient in fuel consumption which they said would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent. They also need to be able to operate in electrified ports. Companies have 90 days to submit their bids but they can only win one of the two tenders.\nThe tender calls for the first of the vessels to be delivered within 30 months after the contract is finalized. The others should be delivered at six-month intervals.\nPetrobras highlights it is a continuation of its newbuilding program which began in July 2024. In January, the company contracted for four new handy class tankers. At the end of last year, the company also contracted for 12 new support vessels (PSV) to transport equipment to its offshore locations. Petrobras plans to also hire 20 new vessels, including 10 for emergency support and response (OSRVs), eight for inspections (RSVs), and two for platform anchoring (AHTS). Petrobras is requiring 40 percent local contact in the construction of the OSVs to ensure the participation of Brazilian companies.\nThe company also said that it plans to decommission 10 platforms by 2029. They are now exploring the reuse of these units as they said it could reduce logistics costs, strengthen the supplier base, and promote sustainable business practices.\nThe new vessels are part of a group of 25 ships that Petrobras plans to add between 2025 and 2029. They noted that 16 have already been contracted. Transpetro reports in addition to the six gas carriers, it currently has 16 crude oil tankers, five product tankers, and nine shuttle tankers, making it the largest multimodal oil, derivative and biofuel logistics company in Latin America.",

It coincides with a larger effort by the Indian government to make the country into a world-class shipbuilder.\nA delegation from the South Korean shipbuilder wasreportedby The Times of India to be touring the country’s facilities and talking with different domestic shipbuilders. The newspaper links the Koreans to L&T among other companies for a possible partnership. In addition, it reports that the South Koreans are spurring competition among the Indian states to attract the possible investments as it assesses potential sites for a shipbuilding facility.\nAccording to the newspaper, the visit by the delegation from Hyundai was in response to a visit by the Indians to South Korea in December. The paper reports India’s Ports and Shipping Ministry secretary T.K. Ramachandran led a delegation to meet with the three largest South Korean shipbuilders. They expressed the government’s interest in collaboration opportunities.\nIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared plans to establish India on the international stage for shipbuilding. The government has said it will be a critical industry for the future while also citing the benefits of reducing international expenses while boosting foreign trade and increasing earnings from the international economies. India, the government declared, will rank among the top 10 shipbuilders by 2030 and the top five by 2047.\nHD Hyundai which is the largest in South Korea continues to face strong competition from the Chinese shipbuilders. The South Koreans reported strong profitability in 2024 despite rising costs and capacity limits which see order slots full till at least 2026 or beyond. Hyundai attempted foreign partnerships in the past, including in the Philippines, without success.\nThe company is mapping its long-term strategy focusing on automation and green technology orders. For its shipyard, it looks to dramatically increase productivity. The company in 2021 launched its plan for the shipyard of the future and cites its use of the latest technologies including AI and digital twins as it seeks to increase productivity and safety.\nThis week its partner in the shipyard of the future, Palantir Technologiesreleased a videoin South Korea highlighting the efforts to create an automated shipyard. Hyundai is quoted as saying it will increase productivity by 30 percent in shipbuilding while also cutting production time for new ships by 30 percent. The goal is to complete the Future of Shipyard project by 2030.",

The cruise was traveling between Grand Cayman and Cozumel, Mexico on Wednesday, February 26, when the rescue took place.\nAccording to the reports, the ship was cruising when the bridge crew spotted a small boat on the horizon and decided to investigate. They had to alter course and according to the reports as they got closer the bridge crew thought it saw at least 10 people packed in a small boat that seemed to be adrift. They also thought they could see the people on the small boat bailing water.\nAs the cruise ship got closer to the boat, passengers reported seeing the people in the small boat waving a white flag. Many of the more than 2,000 passengers on the charter cruise operated by Vacaya, an LGBTQ+ travel group, lined the rails to watch the drama unfold.\nTheBrilliance of the Seascrew launched one of its launches to investigate and determined the people required immediate aid. The cruise ship’s tender rescued 11 people who were later determined to be Cubans who had been at sea for one to two days.\n\n\n\nThe cruise ship reports the individuals were dehydrated, malnourished, and exhausted. They were brought aboard and given medical attention and food while passengers offered to donate clothing and other supplies for the aid of the people who had been rescued.\nWorking with the U.S. Coast Guard and the Mexican authorities, it was determined the cruise ship would disembark the survivors on Thursday when it arrived in Mexico on its regularly scheduled port call. For many aboard, it was the first time they had witnessed a rescue. The cruise is on its way back to its homeport in New Orleans with the passengers sharing pictures and videos on social media of the rescue.",

The Military Sealift Command highlights the critical nature of the mission which has been conducted annually for the past 70 years since 1955 when the resupply mission was established.\nThe cargo ship which was built in 2010 and currently operates as part of Seabulk and its new joint venture with Crowley known as Fairwater is completing its portion of the annual effort. The ship is delivering 321 pieces of cargo, consisting of containers filled with mechanical parts, vehicles, construction materials including cement pilings for a pier project, food, electronics equipment, and comfort items; supplies needed to sustain the next year of operations at McMurdo Station, Antarctica.\nShe followed her running mateOcean Giantwhich conducted the first portion of the mission. Only one of the ships at a time can be at the station.Ocean Giantarrived at the base on January 26 andcompletedher portion of the mission on February 11. She made a stop at Lyttelton, New Zealand, and is currently on her return trip to Hueneme, California where she is due in mid-March.\nFollowing the offload,Ocean Gladiatorwill be loaded with 149 containers of retrograde cargo for transportation off the continent. This includes trash and recyclable materials for disposal and equipment no longer required on the station, as well as the 65-ton floating Modular Causeway System, which was used this year in place of the ice-pier for cargo operations.\nBefore departing McMurdo station,Ocean Gladiatorwill also be loaded with ice core samples that will be stored on the ship in a sub-zero freezer. The ice core samples will be delivered to the United States for scientific study.\nWhile she was at the base, members of Navy Cargo Handling Battalion ONE were assisting with the offload. The teams live in barracks at McMurdo Station, or on the ships for the duration of the mission.\nFebruary is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, but weather is a constant factor in Antarctica. The continent is known for its extreme environment, particularly subzero temperatures and high winds. The MSC team headed by Marie Morriw, ship liaison to the Joint Support Forces Antarctica highlights there is a small window of just a few weeks for ODF to take place. Temperatures on the ice they report hover around freezing during the day and below zero at night. Cargo operations can move forward, despite the temperatures, but high winds can put a pause on work for hours, with the ships’ cranes unable to move cargo in winds over 25 knots.\nFollowing operations in Antarctica,Ocean Gladiatorwill travel to Japan to deliver the floating modular causeway, before sailing for Port Hueneme, California, where they will offload cargo, completing their mission.",

    "input": "After saying the French Riviera did not want large cruise ships, the mayor of Nice who also represents the region agreed to reconsider and provide a compromise to the industry. Like other destinations around the world, the mayor is now proposing daily limits to reduce but not eliminate cruise ship port calls.\nMayor Christian Estrosi of Nice who is also president of the Nice Côte d'Azur Metropolis signed a decree in Januaryblocking cruise shipswith over 900 passengers or over 190 meters (690 feet) in length as of July 1. He cited the negative impacts of overtourism and challenges to the marine environment declared “I don’t want these floating hotels putting down their anchors in Nice.”\nWhile he received extensive press coverage it was quickly pointed out by many in the industry that Nice is not a major cruise ship port. It has a small dock only able to handle luxury cruise ships which the mayor was happy to have as they align with the exclusive image of the city. However, he sought to extend the ban into VIllefranche-sur-mer where large cruise ships regularly anchor. The mayor said cruise ships to go to the port of Cannes or Marseille which have the facilities to handle large ships but are more distant from the attractions.\n“We are urging a reconsideration,” a spokesperson for the cruise line trade group CLIA Europe said. The group called for a “holistic tourist management approach,” while emphasizing its estimate that the ban would stop as much as two-thirds of the 90 scheduled cruise ship calls for the summer of 2025. CLIA said it would cost $10 million in local revenues and as much as $600 million regionally.\nThe mayor of Villefranche spoke out against the bad while experts also questioned if Estrosi had the legal authority to impose his restrictions. Large cruise ships anchor 300 meters (nearly 1,000 feet) offshore in Villefranche which it was pointed out places them in federally controlled not local waters. However, it was also pointed out that the cruise ships send their tenders into the local waters to ferry passengers ashore.\nThe French news agency AFP reported today, February 28, that after consulting with local leaders Estrosi offered up a compromise. The report said he will submit a new plan on March 7 to the local council which he said would balance the interests of public health and the local economy.\nThe compromise calls for permitting cruise ships with up to 2,500 passengers to anchor in the bay and tender passengers ashore. The mega cruise ships would still be required to go to Cannes, while the smallest ships with under 450 passengers would also be permitted to call in Nice.  The compromise also limits calls to one cruise ship per day.\nThe port authority told AFP that this plan would permit about 65 of the planned 90 cruise ship calls scheduled for this summer. It noted originally that only about 20 of the ships would have had more than 2,500 passengers aboard.\nOther destinations including Key West in Florida also sought in the past few years to limit the size of cruise ships and it was successful in reducing the number of ships in port in a day. Others such as Bar Harbor in Maine stopped all large cruise ship calls while in Greece the government’s solution was a cap on the top number of people per day on the busiest Greek Islands and an increased port tax to fund port improvements.",

In a live address, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali said that a Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol ship was positioned within Exxon's Stabroek Block lease area, off the Atlantic coast of Guyana. The patrol ship is said to have approached oil production facilities, including ExxonMobil’s FPSOProsperity.\nThe Venezuelan government has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that its patrol ship was operating in what it described as “disputed international waters”. In response to the incident, Guyana has summoned the Venezuelan ambassador to register a formal protest. In addition, Guyana has deployed air patrol and coast guard assets to boost surveillance of territorial waters.\n“Guyana’s maritime boundaries are recognized under international law, and this incursion is a matter of grave concern. We will remain in close contact with our partners in protecting Guyana’s interests,” said President Ali.\nUS State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs was among foreign partners to stand in solidarity with Guyana. “Venezuelan naval vessels threatening ExxonMobil’s FPSO unit is unacceptable and a clear violation of Guyana’s maritime territory. Further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,” commented the Bureau.\nGuyana and Venezuela have a long-standing territorial dispute, with the matter currently before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Guyana brought the case before the ICJ in 2018, seeking a final judgement on its internationally recognized boundary.\nVenezuela claims the oil-rich Essequibo Region, which is under the control of Guyana. The area is located on the northwestern flank of Guyana, and constitutes nearly 70 percent of the country’s national territory. On several occasions, Venezuela has issued decrees to annex the region. In January, President Maduro went further to announce that Venezuela will conduct gubernatorial elections in Essequibo. This goes against an ICJ order issued back in December 2023. The order restricts Venezuela from interfering with the governance of Essequibo until the court renders a final judgment. The decision is expected by next year.\nVenezuela intensified its ownership claims of Essequibo in 2015 after ExxonMobil revealed commercially viable oil reservoirs located offshore from the region.\nExxon is an American company, and tensions between the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the White House are elevated at present. The Trump administration announced last week that it would be ending a partial license for Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. Gulf Coast, cutting off one of the regime's few remaining sources of foreign currency.",

The cuts were primarily among probationary employees - either new hires or people who had been recently promoted to a new role - and the exact number of layoffs was not disclosed. The announcement drew protests from the scientific community, along with warnings about what cuts at NOAA will mean for maritime interests.\n\"NOAA’s data and science are used routinely by weather forecasters, mariners, farmers, emergency responders, businesses and everyday people across the country,\" said Dr. Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Everyone in the United States relies on NOAA in their daily lives whether they realize it or not, something that will come into focus for many in the weeks and months ahead.\"\nMore cuts are expected. The General Services Administration is canceling office leases for some of the spaces that NOAA uses, and the agency has frozen the credit cards that its scientists and staffers use to pay for work expenses, according to the New York Times. The administration is also expected to cancel agreements with NOAA contractors totaling another 2,500 people. Coming soon, the Office of Management and Budget has issued planning guidance to federal agencies - including NOAA - for the next round of layoffs.\n\"Breaking up, defunding, or reducing NOAA's highly integrated workforce will severely impact our nation's economy,\" five former NOAA administrators said Friday in an open letter. \"It will also make it more difficult to receive weather forecasts, be assured of the safety of seafood, and ensure the timely delivery of purchases from overseas, which are delivered primarily through our nation's ports.\"\nFormer NOAA acting administrator Timothy Gallaudet told NPR that the cuts \"are really seemingly contradicting the administration's priorities,\" since downgrading weather services and weather research will have an impact on the economy - and on national security. Many of the personnel laid off last week were early-career scientists who were conducting research on improved forecasting methods. \"It's an absolute gutting of young talent,\" one staffer told NPR.\n“This loss of talent at NOAA is going to set the agency back years and compromise the integrity of missions that directly support human health and safety, economic prosperity and national security,” a policy analyst at NOAA's National Ocean Service told the New York Times.\n\"We’re the group that has the unique combination of early career motivation/drive but also enough expertise to be quickly effective as we are promoted into new roles,” said former NOAA hurricane researcher Dr. Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off last week. “This is not the group you’d get rid of if you wanted to make an organization more efficient — it’s what you’d do if you want to destroy an organization.”\nFormer NOAA administrator Richard Spinrad said Friday that the impact could be serious for U.S. fisheries, which have a global reputation for responsible management. \"That’s a $320 billion annual industry. And it’s hard to be the best in the world in an industry like that if you can’t support the industry with things as fundamental as stock assessments, how many fish are out there,” Spinrad told the Rhode Island Current.",

    "input": "American sanctions have reduced Russia's ability to ship oil on lightly-regulated \"shadow fleet\" tankers, but Moscow is maintaining its fossil fuel export revenues at about $700 million per day, in part thanks to the renewed participation of Greek tanker owners. Greek owners have emerged as crucial players in keeping Russian crude flowing to global markets, particularly to India and Turkey, according to Vortexa.\n\"Preliminary February data is showing Russian crude volumes carried by Greek operators at a 12-month high,\" said Mary Melton, a senior freight analyst at Vortexa, in a new research note. \"Russian crude exports to India and Turkey will need to be offered below the price cap so that Greek operators can facilitate these volumes.\"\nBloomberg confirms that Russian Urals crude is now trading below $60 per barrel, a deep discount to Brent - and enough of a discount to allow Western tankers to legally participate in Russian energy exports.\nThe need for a discount is clear. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 183 Russia-linked vessels in January, targeting approximately one-third of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" — a collection of aging vessels that were purchased, renamed and reflagged in order to circumvent Western shipping restrictions. Until recently, that strategy has largely worked, allowing Russia to get around the $60 per barrel \"price cap\" imposed on Russian energy shipping by the G7 nations. Russian energy revenue has been stable since 2023, despite sanctions.\nCourtesy CREA\nAccording to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), Russia's seaborne crude oil revenues surged by 13 percent in January compared to December, reaching $240 million daily. This suggests that Russia found ways to command higher prices despite the sanctions regime, according to the center's researchers. China is the country's largest buyer, and Russia has put particular emphasis on ensuring the continued flow of premium ESPO grade crude from the Russian Far East to China.\nShadow fleet tankers transported 84 percent of the total volume of Russian seaborne crude oil in January, according to CREA, but in February, above-board Greek operators had an increasing share. \"These Greek-operated vessels have migrated out of mostly Atlantic Basin trade, especially in the Mediterranean,\" Vortexa's Melton noted. \"This could lead to significant tightening in Atlantic Basin Aframax supply, and higher earnings for vessel operators in those regions.\"",

Last week, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed toured Mogadishu and held talks with Somalian President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Top on the agenda of the meeting was Horn of Africa security as well as the start of technical negotiations for Ethiopia’s port access, as agreed on in Ankara last December.\nWith Turkey acting as the mediator, Ethiopia and Somalia agreed to reach a “mutually beneficial commercial arrangement, which ensured Ethiopia gains access to the sea under Somalia’s sovereignty. In an interview with local media last week, Somali foreign affairs minister Ali Mohammed Omar said that talks are ongoing, and he suggested that the aim is to reach a framework agreement by June.\n“That framework will determine which type of port to offer, the exact area in the Indian Ocean and the overall cost of it,” said the minister.\nThis is remarkable progress in finding a long-term solution to Ethiopia’s ambitions for port access. Under the previous deal, Addis Ababa was planning to lease a 12-mile section of Berbera's coastline in the self-governing breakaway region of Somaliland, without Mogadishu's permission. Unfortunately, the decision stoked tension in the already-restive Horn of Africa region.\nEthiopia became landlocked in 1993 after Eritrea gained independence, marking the end of a three-decade war between the two countries. Currently, Ethiopia utilizes Djibouti's ports, through a network of roads and the 752-kilometer Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway.\nHowever, as one of the largest economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia is pushing to build its own port on the Indian Ocean. The port could also serve as a base for the Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Services Enterprise (ESLSE), one of the largest African ocean carriers.\nCurrently, ESLSE has a fleet of ten bulk carriers but has announced plans to add an extra six, as Ethiopia’s import and export needs grow. According to a 2023/2024 performance report, ESLSE handles around 45 percent of Ethiopia’s dry cargo imported through Djiboutian ports.",

The two countries have begun joint Antarctic drilling, crucial in collecting data to understand the changing Earth’s climate system. This week, a Sino-Russian scientific team carried out a successful geophysical survey on an existing borehole in the Larsemann Hills region of East Antarctica. The well had been drilled into a 545-meter thick glacier during the Chinese 40th Antarctic expedition, from November 2023 to April 2024.\nIn this 41st expedition, involving some Russian scientists, the study involved measuring key parameters of the well. These include the borehole temperature, inclination and changes in borehole diameter. The researchers also collected ice core and bedrock samples. The current expedition begun in last November and ends in May.\nSince last year, China and Russia have held talks over joint drilling in Antarctica. In September, Beijing and Changchun city hosted international conferences on Antarctic exploration, which were attended by Russian specialists from the Federal Agency for Mineral Resources (Rosnedra). With the successful geophysical survey this year, the cooperation is likely to extend to other sites in East Antarctica.\nDuring the conferences, a proposal was made for a Russian-Chinese project to drill the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains in East Antarctica. The scientific results to be obtained from the drilling could be one of the most advanced of our time, said Rosnedra. Through its Kunlun station, China has been carrying out studies near Gamburtsev. The mountain range occurs beneath Dome A, the highest plateau in Antarctica, with an elevation of 4100 meters. In 2012, China drilled the first pilot well in this region. However, further work is needed to get to the bedrock of the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains.\nDeep ice-core drilling in the Gamburtsev region remains one of the primary goals of modern polar research. Ice-core studies provide an excellent method for investigating past variations of global climate and forecasting the future.\nChinese and Russian cooperation in the Antarctic has taken various dimensions, with Antarctic drilling now presenting another important avenue. However, the two countries are seen as disruptors to the existing Antarctic governance system. Both seek to impose new views on resource exploitation in Antarctica. China and Russia have consistently opposed plans to expand marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Southern Ocean, which would mean reduced areas available for krill fishing.",

On Friday, the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology in Guangzhou kicked off a five-year program to start construction on the 600-ton deep sea submersible.\nThe manned subsea lab is designed for the study of cold seeps, areas of the seabed where oil and gas leak out naturally into the water column. Most oceanographic research programs are limited in duration by necessity, as existing research submersibles have short loiter times at the bottom. The subsea lab concept would allow scientists days or weeks to monitor the ecosystem with ROVs, \"manned mobile observation platforms,\" and other high-end devices for subsea exploration. Resident scientists will be able to stay submerged for 30 days at a time before resurfacing.\nAccording to Global Times, the technology developed during the subsea lab project could have secondary applications in deep-sea mining, O&G exploration, and \"rights protection\" of China's ambitious maritime sovereignty claims in the South China Sea. Specific areas of technological focus include fabrication of large, high-pressure titanium alloy components, as well as depth-rated hatches for docking submersibles at 2,000 meters. The latter could have applications for submarine rescues.\nIllustrations of the submersible suggest a design with five joined spherical pressure hulls - much like Russia's highly secretive Losharik, a deep-diving spy sub designed to tap subsea cables. All going to plan, the submersible should be ready to begin sea trials in 2030.",

The minister assured that government policy had not changed saying that Norway and the U.S. “maintain a close and strong defense cooperation.”\nNorwegian fuel supplier Haltbakk Bunkers, which describes itself as the largest operator of tankers along the Norwegian coast, posted a statement on social media calling for the boycott after Friday’s meeting between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The company said it had decided to immediately stop as a fuel supplier to U.S. forces in Norway and their ships calling in Norwegian ports. “No fuel for Americans!,” the company wrote online.\nThe CEO of the company, Gunnar Gran, admitted to the Norwegian newspaper VG it was a “symbolic measure,” as the company does not have a contract with the U.S. forces. He told VG last year they delivered approximately 3 million liters of fuel to the American warships. In 2023, the company had bunkered the aircraft carrier Gerald Ford during its first visit to Norway.\nThe company highlighted its support for Ukraine while condemning the confrontation in Washington D.C. It was similar to the statements of support for Ukraine coming from world leaders and other businesses in Europe.\n“We have seen reports raising concerns about support for US Navy vessels in Norway. This is not in line with the Norwegian government’s policy,” Defense Minister Tore Sandvik said in a written statement. “I can confirm that all requested support has been provided... American forces will continue to receive the supply and support they require from Norway.”\nThe company without comment later deleted the posting from its social media.\nNorway, the U.S., and European countries regularly cooperate and jointly deploy on military missions. U.S. warships make frequent Norwegian port calls, often as part of NATO exercises.

If accurate, the apparent discovery of powerful ship-mounted transmitters would help explain the shifting pattern of GPS disruption in the region. It would also align withpast reportsof high-power radio equipment fitted aboard vessels in the Russian \"shadow fleet.\"\nThe study monitored GPS disruption at ground level with a sensor installed at Gdynia Maritime University, 75 miles east of central Kaliningrad. It was mounted high enough for a line-of-sight radio horizon of about 20 nautical miles offshore (depending on transmitter antenna height). This is enough to reach out into the Gulf of Gdansk, but not far enough to cover the main east-west sea lanes of the central Baltic, where the vast majority of the region's traffic occurs.\nOver a period of six months beginning in June 2024, the sensor picked up 84 hours of GNSS interference, including 29 hours in October alone. Events lasted for up to seven hours at a time, and caused horizontal positioning errors of up to 100 feet - enough to affect navigation in confined waterways.\nMulti-constellation jamming (GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo) was observed through September 2024; the pattern changed to multi-tone interference from October onwards. This interference \"likely originated from a mobile maritime source, given its periodic occurrence and movement patterns,\" the researchers wrote.\nThe ground-level disruption affects maritime interests, and did not correlate with observations of ADS-B aircraft navigational system disruption at higher altitude. Since the ground-level GNSS events aren't detected by airborne ADS-B monitoring, the team called for setting up a terrestrial sensor network for GNSS disruption with geolocation capabilities, which would be used to spot the offending vessels and identify them for possible enforcement action.\n\"The interference . . . exhibited noticeable fluctuations in power levels, suggesting that the jamming source was in motion. Given the system's radio horizon, which primarily covers a portion of the Baltic Sea, and assuming that the interference source was not located within Poland’s borders, the most plausible explanation is that the jamming originated from a vessel in international waters,\" the researchers concluded.",

The plea was entered on November 5th at a federal court in Chicago.\nIn mid-2021, Pang began communicating with an unnamed person in Colombia about a plan to carry out a jihadist attack in the United States. The motive for the conspiracy was to avenge the death of Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian paramilitary leader who was assassinated by U.S. forces in 2020. Soleimani led Iran's IRGC Quds Force, the organization responsible for Iran's covert operations and proxy forces.\nU.S. investigators inserted themselves into this conspiracy and got Pang to meet with undercover agents who posed as Quds Force affiliates. In the fall of 2022, undercover agents met up with Pang in Chicago and in Lake Bluff, a suburb next to Naval Station Great Lakes. As the \"conspirators\" developed their plan to attack the naval station, Pang provided them with material assistance, according to the Justice Department: he admitted that he gave them photos and videos of key locations inside the base, as well as two military uniforms and a cell phone to be used to test a detonator.\nPang has been held without bail and will soon be sentenced. The maximum penalty for his offense is up to 20 years in prison.\nThe Naval Criminal Investigative Service worked with the FBI's Chicago counterterrorism task force to pursue the case, and called it \"a shining example of outstanding proactive investigative work\" with multiple agency partners.",

Other than the initial bad weather near Virginia, it was a calm trip and Vinik maneuvered the liner inside the Gulf Stream to reduce resistance.\nThe coast-hugging route made for memorable images as the vessel traveled along Florida last week. Spectators gathered at multiple places to view the ship as she passed. However, the most spectacular image came as the cruise shipUtopia of the Seas, one of the largest cruise ships in the world, altered course for a rendezvous with the liner.

Removing the remaining fuel and cleaning her tanks is a priority. Externally the loose paint needs to be removed and other loose materials. The funnels, radar mast, and cargo kingposts are to be removed along with the windows and portholes. On the interior, all the contaminants need to be removed before final preparation for the reefing to the east near Destin, Florida.\nEstimates have been that it will take up to about a year to make the preparations to reef the hull of the liner.\n\n\n",

The decision upends the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free-trade deal that Trump signed during his first term in office, and will have profound effects on North American manufacturing networks that have been built around cross-border trade.\n\"The tariffs . . . they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow,\" he said. \"What [foreign manufacturers] have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.\"\nAccording to America's automakers, Japanese and Korean car companies have the most to gain from the new tariffs, as they will not be exposed to a 25 percent import duty at each point in their parts supply chain - nor when their cars are sold in the United States. All American-made cars contain parts supplied by Canadian and Mexican contractors, and some of those parts cross the U.S. border multiple times during assembly.\nTariffs this high have not been seen since the early days of the Cold War, and are widely expected to impact the price of goods for American consumers. The S&P 500 index dropped nearly two percentage points on the announcement.\nEconomists expect the tariff plan to put Mexico and Canada into recession, and to reduce U.S. GDP growth. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly described the tariffs as an \"existential threat,\" and announced plans to retaliate with tariffs on $150 billion worth of U.S. goods, to be phased in over time.\nChina, the United States' third-biggest trading partner, faces an additional tariff of 10 percent - less than half the rate for America's neighbors.",

    "input": "\nThe Russian evacuation of its heavy equipment from Syria continues, whilst the Russian naval presence lingers in the Mediterranean, for the time being making do without Tartus as a base facility.\nThe Russian military cargo shipSparta IVwas alongside in Tartus for several days up to February 25, loading wheeled armored vehicles. The Krivak-classAdmiral Grigorovich(F745) appears to be lying just offshore, in Syrian territorial waters, providing protective cover and poised to escort theSparta IVon its homeward journey. At the other end of the Mediterranean, the Gorshkov-classAdmiral Golovko(F461) looks as if it may have been escorting theBaltic Leader,another Russian cargo ship last seen in Tartus in early February, as it made its way back eastwards across the Mediterranean. In between times, the Ropucha-class landing shipAlexandre Shabalin(L110) has also been loading in Tartus, a more obviously naval vessel. On March 2,Admiral Grigorovich, Alexandre Shabalin, Sparta IVand two other Russian cargo ships, theSyanie SeveraandAsacalon, were noted by naval open source specialist MT Anderson leaving Tartus as a convoy.\nThese ship movements indicate that the Russians have business-like dealings with the new Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) government in Syria, who have also provided effective protection to allow the evacuation to continue without interdiction or hindrance. But the fact that heavy equipment is being withdrawn clearly implies that if the Russians manage to retain a foothold in Syria, it will be a smaller presence and will have a restricted role when compared with the operational freedom that the Russians had enjoyed since Soviet days.\nRussian negotiations with the HTS government continue over a future presence. But as the talks continue, the political environment is changing. Given the recent global political upheavals, it should no longer be assumed that the United States is opposed to a continued Russian presence – as the Biden administration unambiguously was.\nIsrael has no wish to see an Iranian-dominated Syria, part of a Shi’a crescent of influence stretching from Iran, across Iraq and Syria, into Lebanon, replaced by Islamist influence supported from a dominant Turkey to the north. A continued Russian presence could act as a restraint on Turkey, as could a continued US presence in Syria. Israel’s interests are better served by a weak but stable Syria; hence its move into Syrian areas of the Golan Heights and its stated intention to support the Syrian Druze minority in areas south of Damascus, which have been threatened by HTS-aligned forces in recent weeks.\nIsrael also has an interest in preserving moderately-inclined Kurdish political autonomy in North East Syria and also in Iraq, as a counter-weight to both Sunni and Shi’a extremists and factional fighting, but also as a bulwark against increased Turkish influence.\nThe Russians have continued to maintain a naval presence in the Mediterranean, headed by its Kilo-class submarineKrasnodar(B265). Without its base facility in Tartus, it instead has used port calls in Algeria and Libya as a means of resting crews and replenishing ships, and its oiler auxiliaries have even still been permitted to top up in Tartus. It will be a while before such port calls overtax those hosting the Russians – by which time the Russians may have arrived at a new slimmed-down basing deal with the new Syrian government.",

A year after declaring offshore zones and selecting the first potential projects, the government granted two more feasibility licenses to proceed with the planning for wind farms in the Southern Ocean and the other for the Pacific Ocean.\nOnly in the past few years did Australia pass its first framework legislation to establish the process for developing offshore wind energy sites. The government selected areas and began accepting project applications in the multi-step planning process.\nProjects back industry majors were the latest to be moved from provisional licenses to full feasibility licenses. One project, Novocastrain Wind is owned by Equinor and Oceanex Energy. It calls for up to 2.1 GW of installed capacity off the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The other is Spinifex being co-developed by Parkwind, which is part of JERA, and Alinta Energy. It proposes 1.2 GW which would be equivalent to 10 percent of Victoria’s electricity needs.\nEach of the projects received licenses that grant the rights to explore the proposed projects, seek environmental approvals, and prepare a management plan. The management plan needs to be approved before they can begin feasibility activities and must address how the project will interact with shipping and fisheries.\nWith the approvals, the projects can undertake research and marine studies. This may include the use of lidar buoys to assess wind and other ocean conditions. They can also proceed with detailed environmental assessments and engage with the business community to develop the supply chain. The feasibility licenses provide for up to seven years. The companies then would submit construction plans for approval.\nThe companies hailed these steps are important milestones in the development of offshore wind energy for Australia. Each has been undertaking preliminary work. They highlighted the need for more work but said it would support moving forward with the investments to develop these projects.\nRWE was granted one of the first feasibility licenses from the Australian Government in July 2024 for the development of an offshore wind farm. To be located in the Bass Strait, off the Gippsland coast in Victoria, it is expected this could become Australia’s first project. The area was Australia’s first designated offshore wind zone. RWE said it would use the feasibility process to apply for a commercial license to build and operate the wind farm for up to 40 years anticipating it could be commissioned in the 2030s with up to 2 GW of capacity.",

They determined that the seizure could be canceled in part after the cable companies withdrew their request and the detention from the Port State inspection was lifted. They also said they were releasing the cargo but continue to hold three crewmembers in the ongoing investigation.\n“As the criminal investigation conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation, including the forensic investigation on boardEagle S, has progressed, there are no longer grounds for continuing the seizure of the tanker. Therefore, the seizure was canceled on Friday, February 28, 2025. As far as the criminal investigation is concerned, the tanker is not prevented from continuing its passage to leave Finland's territorial waters,” the Helsinki police said in a statement.\nThe Border Guard vesselTurvaescorted theEagle Sout of Finnish waters on March 2. The vessel’s AIS signal shows it underway on Monday at nearly 11 knots. It is declaring Port Said, Egypt as its next port call.\nFinnish authorities detained the vessel hours after Estonian electric transmission company Elering and Finnish electricity system operator Fingrid reported on December 25 an interruption in their EstLink 2 power connection. The vessel was ordered into Finnish waters and then on January 2 a Port State inspection found 32 deficiencies ranging from inoperative fire equipment and a radar as well structural conditions not as required in cargo areas. That detention order remained in place for 53 days.\n“Our inspectors have visited on board the ship and concluded that the deficiencies that led to the detention of the ship and the other deficiencies detected during port state control have been rectified,” said Sanna Sonninen, Maritime Director at Traficom. “Therefore, Traficom has releasedEagle S. Cooperation with the ship’s flag state (Cook Islands), crew, and classification society has been excellent.”\nThe Helsinki Police continue to work with the National Bureau of Investigation. They said there would be further interviews with the crew and examination of the material gathered on the grounds of criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communication. The vessel’s anchor was retrieved from the seafloor on January 6. The goal is to conclude the criminal investigation by the end of April.\nBased on the criminal investigation, eight crewmembers are reported to be suspects. However, the travel ban was also rescinded for five individuals with three required to remain in Finland.\nInvestigators are also reporting that they tested the unleaded gasoline and diesel cargo aboard the vessel. They have determined it can be transferred from the European Union. The detention of the cargo was permitted to lapse.\nElering and Fingrid said in a separate announcement that they withdrew their motion to detain the tanker for compensation for the damages. According to Kalle Kilk, chairman of the management board of Elering, the costs of the detention are unreasonable. He said it would have cost the company hundreds of thousands of Euros per month plus a one million Euro deposit. He said the costs could exceed the value of the ship and noted it would be difficult to sell the ship while the legal dispute was ongoing. The company said they plan to sue the ship’s owners for the repair costs while reporting a Finnish law firm assessed the trial could last up to five to six years.\nThe Finnish authorities have asserted their actions prevented additional damage to the cables while pointing to sabotage. Other cases however have shown possible unintentional damage. Sweden detained and released another ship after saying it was convinced that the incident was an accident. They however reported last week that they were investigating another incident of cable damage reported by a Finnish company for its cable off Sweden’s Gotland.\nThe December incident led to increased patrols by the Baltic countries. They also pressured NATO which has agreed to add resources for monitoring while the UK launched its own tracking tool using AI and other advanced technologies for vessels.\n",

The group placed an order for the first barge to be built by China’s Shandong Xinneng Shipbuilding.\nThe group called the order an important step to promote green inland river operations in the Asian market. The first barge was co-designed by CMA CGM’s New Build and R&D teams in partnership with China’s CATL for the battery technology. They are also working with China’s Jining Energy Group for the energy system which will include a solar-powered recharging facility to be located at the Gemalink terminal in Cai Mep, Vietnam.\nThe plan calls for an 80-meter (262-foot) barge. It will have a capacity of approximately 180 TEU. It is designed to sail entirely on battery power between Bihn Duong Province inland in Vietnam and the Gemalink terminal, a route of approximately 180 kilometers (112 miles). Annually they project the barge will transport more than 50,000 TEU annually. The operation is projected to start in 2026 and Nike has previously announced it would be using the barge to transport its products made in Vietnam.\nShandong Xinneng Shipbuilding was developed starting in May 2022 as China’s first domestic inland new energy shipbuilder. With this order, the yard has an orderbook of 165 ships. They highlight a capacity to annually build 400 inland ships in the size range of 1,000 to 5,000 tons. The company started construction in October 2022 and trial production in October 2023.\nVietnam is seen as a fast-growing market as the country develops its manufacturing capabilities. CMA CGM highlights that it has been in Vietnam since 1989 and currently operates 29 weekly mainline services from seven ports in Vietnam. The group says the new inland solution is part of its long-term commitment and decarbonization ambitions, along with Vietnam’s goal of being carbon net zero by 2050. The goal of the electric barge operation is to also create a model that can be replicated in other markets.",

    "input": "\nA damaged and failing bridge briefly shut down inland shipping on the Elbe at Dresden last weekend, the second time in five months that barge traffic has been halted by the risk of falling concrete and steel.\nOn September 11, 2024, at about 0300 hours in the morning, two spans of the Carola Bridge collapsed. A light-rail train had just gone by, but it was past and clear of the span, and no one was injured in the collapse. The bridge was one of four main crossings of the Elbe in downtown Dresden, and the loss of the span has been disruptive for businesses - and for shipping interests, which use the Elbe to access upriver regions as far as the Czech Republic (when water levels allow).\nThe bridge was built under Communist rule in 1967-71. It had been inspected properly and passed all routine exams, according to Simone Pruefer, the head of the city's engineering office. \"We were all very surprised,\" she told German media.\nA post-accident study by the Institute of Concrete Structures at TU Dresden determined that the collapse was caused by hydrogen-induced stress corrosion of the bridge's steel components. This form of corrosion is nearly impossible to detect with conventional methods, the study concluded, as it affects steel elements that are hidden from view.\nThe waterway was shut for four months for demolition and removal, a task made more challenging by the discovery of WWII-era bombs at the demolition site (common for Dresden, which was bombed heavily by Allied forces). Later testing revealed that the cause was hydrogen-induced stress corrosion.\nThe surviving bridge spans have similar corrosion problems, and the surviving bridge spans will have to be completely demolished and rebuilt. To ensure safety of navigation in the interim, the city has installed acoustic monitoring systems.\nLast week, another prestressed steel component broke in the still-standing section of the bridge, prompting another temporary navigation shutdown. Every time the temperature fluctuates, it exerts stress on the surviving steel cables and raises the risk of another critical failure, bridge engineer Steffen Marx of TU Dresden told local media. The city has hired a contractor to complete the demolition of the rest of the bridge on an expedited basis, in hopes of finishing the job by the end of 2025.\nFor now, ships are free to pass through during a limited two-hour slot from 0900 through 1100 hours each day. They must pre-register, and only necessary crew may be on board during the transit.",

    "input": "China continues to grow its influence over South America with China Merchants reporting an agreement to buy Brazil’s only privately operated VLCC terminal. The company reports the deal is part of its continued growth in the Latin America region and further consolidates its position globally.\nChina Merchants Port Holdings Co. reported on February 28 that it completed an agreement calling for it to acquire 70 percent of Vast Infraestrutura, operator of the onshore crude oil transshipment terminal in the Port of Açu. It is an industrial deep-water port that is within 24-hour sailing distance of Brazil’s major offshore production fields. It is the only terminal capable of handling Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) that is not operated by Petrobras.\nThe deal calls for an initial payment of approximately $448 million but not to exceed $714 million based on adjustments for cash and other considerations. There are also milestone payments of $56 million contingent on operating licenses being received by the end of 2026 and 2027 and potential earn-out payments of approximately $160 million based on the five-year performance to the end of 2029.\nChina Merchants reports it has been actively exploring new growth drivers for its existing ports business. This deal coupled with the 2017 acquisition of TCP Participaçoes, the Brazilian container terminal operator, will enhance China Merchant’s regional strategy.\nU.S.-based EIG Global Energy Partners is the primary investor in the parent company of Vast which started the terminal a decade ago in 2015. The terminal started with large agreements with Shell and other energy majors.\nThe newly acquired terminal handles approximately 30 percent of Brazil’s crude oil exports which are shipped through the facilities located north of Rio de Janeiro. The terminal averages 560,000 barrels per day. It currently has a licensed capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day. Vast highlights the strategic location of the terminal as well as its three berths allowing predictable operations with low downtime and a dedicated fleet of tugs to handle the tankers. In 2023, Vast reported a net profit before taxes of approximately $43 million.\nChina’s expansion in the Latin America region has drawn a lot of attention including from Donald Trump who targeted the involvement in Panama and the ports at the Panama Canal. Last month China celebrated the opening of the megaport project in Chancay, Peru. Analysts see it both as an effort to exert influence over South America well as to reshape global trade routes.\nUnder pressure from the United States, Panama reported that it would not renew its participation in China Belt & Road initiative. The country’s attorney general also filed with the courts to declare the port operations contract with China’s Hutchison unconstitutional.",

    "input": "China’s CK Hutchison announced that it has an agreement in principle to sell its international ports portfolio including the controversial terminals in Panama to a consortium being led by famed U.S. investment group BlackRock in partnership with Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), MSC Group’s terminal operator. The deal valued at $22.8 billion (enterprise value) is for 80 percent ownership of CK Hutchison’s portfolio of 43 global ports and in a parallel agreement for 90 percent ownership of Panama Ports Company, which operates the terminals in Balboa and Cristobal, Panama.\nThe companies emphasized that it is a preliminary agreement after a bidding process run by CK Hutchison, but they have entered into exclusive negotiations and a non-disclosure arrangement. The BlackRock-TiL Consortium is conducting confirmatory due diligence with the companies targeting signing the definitive agreements on or before April 2.\nThe sale could be seen as a victory for Donald Trump who repeatedly asserted that “China is running the Panama Canal.” Panama had responded by saying it was reviewing the contracts with Hutchison and the country’s Attorney General recently filed a brief in a court case calling the contract extension granted to Hutchison in 2021 “unconstitutional.”\nThis transaction is “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news report concerning the Panama Ports,” asserted CK Hutchison Co-Managing Director Frank Sixt commenting on the transaction.\nThe portion of the agreements for the Panama terminals will require confirmation by the Government of Panama of the proposed terms. The Wall Street Journal reports that BlackRock has briefed the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress on the planned acquisition.\n“This transaction is the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received,” highlighted Sixt. He called the valuation compelling and said the deal was in the best interest of the company’s shareholders. It includes 43 ports with a total of 199 berths in 23 countries.\nCK Hutchison expects to receive cash proceeds in excess of $19 billion from the transactions after minority interest and the repayment of loans. The company emphasized the agreements do not include any interest in the HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, South China, and other ports in China.\nThe Wall Street Journal is reporting the deal would be the largest-ever infrastructure acquisition for BlackRock. It is being structured between BlackRock and the recently acquired Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which became part of the company last year. GIP focuses on energy, transportation, and waste and water infrastructure including acquisitions in 2024 in the U.S. offshore wind energy sector.\nMSC has been moving aggressively to expand all parts of its business, including the terminal operations. It recently completed a deal with the City of Hamburg to acquire 49 percent of the terminal operations in Hamburg in addition to deals last year for terminals in key global markets.\nCommenting on today’s announcement, Diego Aponte who is Chairman of TiL and President of the MSC Group said, “We are very focused on this industry, and we know that the investment in Hutchison Ports will be a very viable investment commercially.”\nThe sale would likely reduce pressure on Panama. Hutchison’s involvement with Panama dates to 1997 and the time of the handover of the canal under the treaty with the United States. The company operates terminals at each end of the Panama Canal, in Balboa and Cristobal, and currently holds a concession that was extended until 2047.",

The UK regularly tracks the movement of Russian warships in the Channel with Commander Joel Roberts of the frigate commenting, “Somersetis well versed in the escort of Russian ships, having conducted these operations on a number of occasions.”\nThis time it triggered a multi-day operation that included Somerset as well as coordination with UK patrol aircraft and NATO forces.

    "input": "Despite significant resources and financial investments, the European Court of Auditors found in a new report that ships continue to pollute EU maritime waters with shortcomings in the tracking and enforcement. The auditors are calling for further steps and possible enhancements in the environmental action program to meet the EU’s zero pollution ambition.\nThe audit focused on ship-sourced pollution and the more than a decade of regulations from the EU. It examined EU actions between January 2014 and September 2024. They report that €216 million in funding was provided between 2014 and 2023 focusing on elements such as port waste reception facilities, collection of fishing nets, and research. While it concluded the EU’s efforts were well-designed and continue to improve, it said implementation had weakened and that the efforts of the 22 member states “is far from satisfactory.”\n“Pollution at sea caused by ships remains a major problem, and despite a number of improvements in recent years, EU action is not really able to steer us out of troubled waters,” said Nikolaos Milionis, the ECA Member responsible for the audit. “In fact, with over three-quarters of European seas estimated to have a pollution problem, the zero-pollution ambition to protect people’s health, biodiversity, and fish stocks is still not within sight.”\nThe auditors found that EU countries underuse the tools provided for them such as those from the European Maritime Safety Agency. As an example, they cited in 2022-2023 that the European Satellite Oil Monitoring Service identified a total of 7,731 possible spills in the EU. Yet, they found that member states failed to act and only confirmed seven percent of the cases.\nThey also said that member states do not carry out enough preventative inspections of ships. They reported that states failed to meet their mandatory target rates for inspections and that the penalties for polluters also remain low.\n“Actions to prevent, tackle, track, and penalize various types of ship-source pollution are not up to the task,” the auditors warned. They concluded that neither the European Commission nor the member states fully track the EU money used to combat seawater pollution. As a result of the lapses in the efforts, the auditor said “the actual amount of oil spills, contaminants, and marine litter from ships remains largely unknown, as does the identity of polluters.”\nAmong the specific shortcomings in the regulations, they pointed to the recycling obligations for end-of-life vessels. They highlight that one in every seven ships in the world was flying an EU flag in 2022, but the figure for end-of-life ships was 50 percent lower as owners continue to circumvent recycling regulations by adopting non-EU flags before disposing of these ships. The European Commission at the end of February alsocited this issuesaying it would be enhancing its efforts to enforce the rules and adapt as the Hong Kong Convention comes into force this year.\nThe audit is also critical of the handing of containers lost overboard. “EU rules on containers lost at sea are far from watertight,” the audit says. It highlights that there is no guarantee of reporting and that few containers are recovered.\nThe recommendations call for improving the monitoring and effectiveness of pollution alert tools as well as monitoring member states to confirm they are performing mandatory checks. They said that enhancing monitoring and reporting would be a key step along with better tracking of EU-funded projects.\nThese findings they suggest should be used to possibly enhance legislation and the previous eighth environmental action plan which was released in 2022. The ambition is for zero pollution of the EU’s waters by 2030.\nThecomplete reportis available for download online.\n",

Also after being certified in Singapore in the spring of 2024, the vessel will undergo inspections by the UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency.\n“The MCA will conduct thorough inspections and checks to ensure the vessel’s safety and operational readiness for its onward journey,” said Lars Lippuner,  MCA Director of UK Customer Services. “It has been a pleasure working in collaboration with Fortescue to bring this innovative vessel to Europe, and we are excited that the shift to a more sustainable marine fuel and a world’s first is being showcased here in the UK.”\nFortescue acquired an offshore supply vessel,MMA Leveque, early in 2022 from Australia-based MMA Offshore. Built in 2010 in Indonesia, the vessel was originally outfitted with four diesel-electric Cummins main engines. Two of the four engines were converted to be able to use ammonia or diesel for the demonstrations. The first-ever ammonia bunkering took place in March 2024 in Singapore and then a second in May as it completed testing.\nFortescue Executive Chairman and Founder, Dr. Andrew Forrest, said they brought the vessel to the UK to deliver the simple message and highlight the critical message to embrace real zero fuel standards. He called it an opportunity that cannot be missed urging the IMO to fast-track shipping’s move away from dirty bunker fuels.\nThe UK’s Maritime Minister Mike Kane called the vessel the type of innovation that will drive decarbonization forward. He highlighted the government’s support and efforts to achieve net-zero goals.\nTo supportFortescue Green Pioneer’s time in the UK, the vessel and team are reported to have been working closely with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to ensure full compliance with UK regulatory requirements. Port State Control inspections were scheduled for Southampton after the vessel’s arrival. It will then travel to West India Dock in London to showcase its technology and capabilities to key maritime stakeholders, partners, and the public.\nThe MCA notes that it is currently working with other member states at the IMO to further develop the interim guidelines on the use of ammonia as a fuel. The IMO still must review and finalize standards and then move for adoption. It is seen as a critical step as engine manufacturers move into their final stages of testing for ammonia engines and expect to be ready for commercial deliveries in the near future.",

    "input": "\nChina State Shipbuilding Corporation is reporting a giant new order for containerships valued at between $2.5 and $2.6 billion. While CSSC did not identify the customer, industry insiders widely believe it is from France’s CMA CGM Group following through on its earlier commitments and disregarding the U.S.’s threat to impose fees for Chinese-built ships.\nThe order is going to China’s Jiangnan Shipyard and calls for a dozen large 18,000 TEU containerships. The vessels will be fueled by LNG and incorporate the latest energy-saving technologies according to the filing from CSSC. The ships are due for delivery in 2028 and 2029.\nCSSC highlights that this large agreement comes from a company that “has been a long-term partner.” The Chinese shipbuilder said it would be deepening its relationship with the customer. CMA CGM and Chairman Rodolphe Saadé participated in a 2023 trade mission between France and the EU to China. The group signed acommitment for ordersvalued at $3.1 billion, which was called the largest order for the Chinese state shipbuilder.\nCMA CGM highlighted in the past that it has a long-standing relationship with the Chinese shipbuilding industry. The group said in 2023 that it had ordered more than 70 containerships to be built in China. The yards built the Jacques Saadé class which were the first large LNG-fueled containership ships and a new generation of 18,000 TEU vessels.\nCMA CGM highlights that it currently has a fleet of over 650 vessels and carried over 23 million TEU in 2024. Alphaliner calculates the group has an additional 94 containerships on order with a combined capacity of approximately 1.5 million TEU while the group has a current capacity of approximately 3.9 million TEU.\nConfirmation of this new order comes just days after the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office made follow-up recommendations on specific steps to take to stemChina’s unfair policiesdesigned to increase its domination in shipbuilding. In the last days of the Biden administration, the office found that China had policies that were subsidizing the industry against foreign competition.\nThe Trump administration hasproposed a series of feesthat would add to the operating costs of foreign companies that employ Chinese-built ships. Under the proposed actions, each U.S. port call for each vessel built in China, but operated by non-Chinese interests, could result in a fee of up to $1 million, depending on the proportion of Chinese-built ships in that operator's fleet. It also proposed an additional $1 million for each port call for operators who have newbuilds on order in China.\nThe Trade Office outlined several alternatives which are being reviewed by the White House on how to structure the fees on Chinese vessels. Most observers believe the Trump administration will proceed as it today, March 4, also moved forward with an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, doubling the base rate, while some categories already had tariffs ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent or even 100 percent on Chinese EVs.\nCSSC however highlighted the shipbuilding contract as a major export order. They noted the deal is denominated in U.S. dollars, while other recent deals were switched to the Chinese currency.",

    "input": "The issue of false flags continues to grow and promises to take center stage in an upcoming meeting of the IMO Legal Committee scheduled for the last week of April. Citing the dangers and the required steps, France and the Netherlands submitted proposals which are drawing attention as they highlighted two previously unheard-of registries.\nFrance’s note to the IMO Secretariat calls out the “Maritime Administration of Matthew Island” citing it as the latest example of fraudulent registries. It has sent everyone scurrying to the Internet and reference sources to answer the question: where is Matthew Island?\nTurns out it is an uninhabited island in the southern Pacific east of New Caledonia. France claims it as its territory, but Vanuatu has sought to challenge the rights saying it belongs to the indigenous people of its country. It does not much matter, because it is a volcanic outcropping and most sources note the size of the island changes due to volcanic and ocean activity.\nThe Netherlands at the same time is warning of another fraudulent registry posing as the registry of Sint Maarten calling itself the MSTA Registry operated by International Maritime Registries & Regulatory. Sint Maarten is the Dutch side of the Caribbean Island shared with the French who call it Saint Martin. While it is a popular cruise ship destination, the papers to the IMO assert that no one has been authorized to operate this registry.\nThe submission highlights the lack of transparency in both of these operations a point that they contend is common among these false flag operations. They note these two websites have very similar interfaces.\nShaddy operators emerging to operate so-called international registries is nothing new. Guyana at the end of 2024 highlighted that five tankers sanctioned by the U.S. were falsely displaying Guyana as their registry. The authorities noted that the country has a closed registry only available to residents and none of the ships qualified.\nThe IMO had previously said over 100 ships were showing in databases with false flags. As the shadow fleet of tankers grew to serve the Russian oil trade, as well as Iran, the number is thought to have increased dramatically. The UK in a submission to the IMO’s Legal Committee cited over 230 examples while some reports say it is now over 270 ships.\nAs part of the lead-up to the Legal Committee meeting, France and the Netherlands outlined a series of steps to continue the crackdown on false flags. In their submission they acknowledge “every state whether coastal or landlocked has the right to sail ships flying its flag on the high seas,” but they note there must be better records and transparency. They note there are various obligations of flag states and that communications are required among flag authorities or their managers, especially in the event of an accident or inspection.\nThey are calling for the IMO to require states to set conditions for registry in their national law. The IMO they said should use digital tools to confirm the authenticity of the registration certificate and enhance the procedures for the allocation of IMO numbers.\nLiberia which uses an international manager for its flag also submitted a paper for the upcoming meeting. It supports the proposals previously submitted to the IMO while offering some suggested improvements for the effective use of resources and the enforcement of available tools.\nThe IMO started its latest efforts to step up thecrackdown in 2019. At the time it outlined steps including the creation of the first database to track vessels under UN Security Council sanctions.\n\nTop photo of Mathew Island in 2012 byJd.Girard(CC BY-SA 3.0)",

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump took time to call for a reinvigorated American shipbuilding industry, and pledged new support for both commercial and naval yards.\n\"To boost our defense industrial base we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House that offers special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America where it belongs,\" Trump said. \"We used it to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.\"\nThe announcement is the first mention of the new shipbuilding office. That function has historically been housed in the Maritime Administration and in Naval Sea Systems Command, and Trump did not provide further details. However, the news met with strong approval from America's shipbuilders: the industry's main trade association called for enhanced cooperation between industry and government to create a consistent demand signal for shipyards.\n\"We applaud the creation of the White House Office of Shipbuilding, and the entire shipyard industrial base not only stands at the ready to work with the new Office of U.S. Shipbuilding, but we are also ready to answer the call to design and build America’s commercial and military fleets,\" said Matthew Paxton, President of the Shipbuilders Council of America. \"By fully utilizing the existing domestic shipyard capacity, the shipyard industrial base can meet the growing demands of national defense, restore American competitiveness, and create thousands of skilled jobs.\"\nThe U.S. Navy's growing problems with the shipbuilding industrial base - particularly supply chain delays and workforce shortages - have raised the industry's profile in Washington. The previous Secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, put a spotlight on shipyard delays and sought foreign investment from South Korea's Big Three yards in the hope that their high-tech methods could help right the ship. In the Senate, Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) - a longtime advocate for growing the fleet - recently warned that \"just about every major U.S. shipbuilding program is behind schedule, over budget or irreparably off track.\"\nIn his speech Tuesday, Trump also emphasized his administration's efforts to restore more American influence over the Panama Canal, and noted a newly-concluded deal that handed control of the container terminals on either side of the waterway to an American hedge fund.\n\"My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it. Just today a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple other canals,\" Trump said.",

The ship has no provisions at all for human occupancy during operation.\nThe 180-foot, 240-tonne autonomous gray hull is in the water and will now undergo sea trials, beginning in the spring. Its crewless design has specific advantages, according to DARPA: without making room and allowances for people, there is little in way of a deckhouse, and the vessel has a narrower beam. This means less construction cost, less weight, better hydrodynamic efficiency, better stealth performance, and a better operating window in rough sea states, according to DARPA.\nThe prototype is the product of the agency's No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) program. DARPA has been running multiple tests to support the operating concept in parallel with construction, including at-sea refueling for a Defiant-sized vessel. The U.S. Navy's USV Squadron 1 conducted the test in partnership with DARPA using two experimental unmanned vessels, the crewboat-based Ranger and Mariner.\n\n\nCourtesy DARPA\nThe design objective is to produce an unmanned ship that has 90 percent reliability at sea for a year at a time, with minimal human intervention. Ryan Maatta, Marine Engineer Manager at SERCO and Deputy Program Manager for DARPA's NOMARS program, told Naval News that the design could drive \"greatly reduced cost per mission hour.\"\n\"It's going to put more payload out on the ocean, more mission systems Out on the ocean for much cheaper than the Navy does traditionally,\" he said.",

The vessel had an estimated 7,500 liters of fuel on board, according to the Heiltsuk Nation.\nThe CCG, the Heiltsuk government and BC's Environmental Emergency Branch set up a unified command for the response, and a commercial salvor was selected to perform pollution abatement and wreck removal.\nHeiltsuk Marine Emergency Response Team responded and deployed containment boom around the vessel. They also deployed deflection boom along the shorelines and to protect the McLoughlin Bay hatchery.\nA Unified Command has been established to oversee the incident and ensure an appropriate response.\nOn site operations to begin the salvage started on February 26, and crews were able to quickly rig the vessel and parbuckle it upright. Severe weather moved in during the operation, so the vessel was secured to the side of the barge and repositioned to a nearby safe harbor to continue dewatering. No sheening or pollution were observed during these evolutions.\nAfter the wreck was safely aboard the barge, the team returned to the site of the grounding to begin dive operations for removing any remaining debris. That work wrapped up on February 27, and the barge  got under way for mainland BC to deliver the wreckage.\n",

In the latest development, HII is highlighting that its Newport News Shipbuilding yard printed and installed the first-ever manifold using the technology for the soon-to-be-delivered aircraft carrier USSEnterprise.\n“What started as a proof of concept quickly turned into a tangible result that is making a meaningful difference to improve efficiencies in shipbuilding,” said Dave Bolcar, NNS vice president of engineering and design. “The benefits of this innovation will extend well beyondEnterprise(CVN 80), as we incorporate our expertise in additive manufacturing into the fundamentals of shipbuilding.”\nThe valve manifold assembly, a specialized assembly that allows the distribution of a single source of fluid to multiple points on the ship, is installed in a pump room on Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrierEnterprise. The assembly is approximately 5 feet long and 1,000 pounds. Newport News collaborated with DM3D Technology to manufacture the manifold body.\nAccording to the shipyard, it is another demonstration of its pursuit of opportunities to support construction using additive manufacturing. Similar manifolds planned for the next carrier in the class,Doris Miller(CVN 81), will also employ additive manufacturing rather than traditional casting methods.\nThis latest advancement in the development and deployment of additive manufacturing HII reports builds on Newport News’ prior certification and approval as a supplier for additive manufacturing components on Naval Sea Systems (NAVSEA) platforms. To date, the shipyard has created more than 55 additively manufactured parts installed on both new construction vessels and those currently in the fleet, with plans to install more than 200 additional parts this year.\n\n\nNewport News highlights its growing use of 3D printing technology (HII)\n\nNewport News says the use of certified 3D-printed parts has the potential to accelerate the construction and delivery of vessels to the U.S. Navy. The technology provides the opportunity to reduce lead times and improve manufacturing quality for critical components.\nFour years ago, the U.S. Navy moved to accelerate the use of 3D printing after having installed its first-ever 3D part in 2018. First used as a source for critical and obsolete parts, the Navy moved in 2022 to install printers and test them on vessels on deployment. The USSEssex, a Wasp-class Landing Helicopter Dock, was the first to install a printer in July 2022, and as the technology has been proven the Navy is now ready to accept parts using the technology on its most advanced vessels including the newest carriers.",

The State Department and Treasury Department have been asked to draft a list of measures for potentially easing stringent U.S. sanctions, which have been the most effective tools of economic persuasion that the West has deployed against Moscow.\nThe news aligns with a personal falling-out between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which burst into public view with a contentious news conference at the White House on Friday. After a heated exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky was asked to leave the building. Trump subsequently announced a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine, a profound blow for Ukraine's front-line forces.\nSources close to the White House told Reuters that the sanctions relief measures under consideration would be for individual Russian citizens and companies. Ukraine's government responded with a call for the White House to wait for more progress in peace talks, in order to maintain leverage to bring an end to the invasion. However, Russia has indicated that negotiations over Ukraine are only part of the discussion with the Trump administration: the bilateral talks also cover something else - \"normalizing\" relations between Moscow and Washington.\n\"Of course, if we are talking about normalizing bilateral relations, then [Russian interests] need to be freed from this negative burden of so-called sanctions,\" said Dmitri Petrov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"It is probably too early to talk about anything [being lifted] . . . we have not heard any official statements.\"\nCurrent U.S. sanctions include significant restrictions on Russia's energy sector and its tankers. The previous administration's effort to target Russia-linked \"shadow fleet\" of aging tankers has forced Russian Urals exporters to drop their prices below $60 per barrel for the first time in more than a year, and tanker rates from Russian loading ports have soared.",

The shipping major best known for its bulker operations announced plans in 2023 to diversify its business with an expansion of its cruise line which was operating a single ship.\nTheSeabourn Sojourn(32,477 gross tons) was delivered to MOL on February 28 and immediately chartered back to Seabourn to complete its published itineraries. After a scheduled world cruise ending on May 15, 2026, the ship will be handed over to Mitsui Ocean Cruises which says it will be refurbished and positioned into the short to medium length cruises in the domestic Japanese market. Details on the name and refurbishment will be announced at a later date.\n“The purchase of this vessel brings forward the company's plans to expand its cruise business, ahead of the launch of two new ships,” MOL said announcing the second cruise ship acquisition. The company in 2023 mapped a strategy calling for building new cruise ships and now says the second acquisition “will begin operations prior to the new vessels in order to provide Mitsui Ocean Cruises' services to customers as soon as possible.”\nThe new cruise line was launched in December 2024 with the formerSeabourn Odysseywhich was acquired in March 2023 and chartered to Seabourn to complete its itineraries. The ship renamedMitsui OceanFijientered service at the end of last year with MOL saying it would also serve the international market. The company just announced the opening of a North American sales organization for the ship.\n“We launchedMitsui Ocean Fujiin December 2024 and are very pleased with the guest reaction to the ship and onboard product,” said Tsunemichi Mukai, President of Mitsui Ocean Cruises. “While all new cruise ships take a little time to settle in, the experience onMitsui Ocean Fujiis continuously improving, and we are now extremely confident these two ships are the most suitable vessels to expand our cruise business.”\nThe sister ships were built by Italy’s T. Marriott entering service in 2009 and 2010. They were considered an advancement in the luxury market with accommodations for just 458 passengers. They measure 649 feet (198 meters) with 229 passenger suites.\nThe sale of the second ship by Carnival Corporation comes as it is focusing on its larger brands and building new mega-ships. Seabourn introduced two luxury ships for expeditions built in 2022 and 2023 but will be overall downsized after delivering its second cruise ship to MOL. The line has a third sister to the two sold to MOL plus two slightly larger 600-passenger versions as well as the expedition ships.\nMOL reports Japanese will be the official language aboard the second ship while saying its size will permit it to reach a variety of ports including in the Seto Inland Sea and remote islands in Okinawa and Hokkaido. It also looks to leverage its experience operating the sister ship to immediately offer enhanced services aboard the ship when it enters service in late 2026.\nMitsui Ocean Cruises says the announced cruises of theMitsui OceanFijiand its older cruise ship Nippon Maru will not be affected by the purchase. TheMitsui OceanFijiwill continue to focus on medium to longer term cruises which will include international fly-cruises. All its cruises will call at a minimum of one international port. Nippon Maru mostly operates in the domestic market but has also offered longer international cruises.\nMOL’s expansion in the cruise sector comes as NYK is also preparing for the launch of its second cruise ship.Asuka IIIwas recently floated out at Meyer Werft in Germany and departed the yard on Sunday, March 2 arriving in Eemshaven, Netherlands yesterday to prepare for sea trials and delivery. She is due to enter service in July from Japan as an addition to the olderAsuka II.\nJapan’s Ryobi Holdings, a diversified company that includes operations in transportation and tourism, also announced plans at the end of 2023 to enter the cruise market. It ordered a luxury, yacht cruise ship to be built in Portugal for delivery in 2027.",

    "input": "The French shipping group CMA CGM recently took delivery of its first dual-fuel methanol containership. While the group continues significant investments in LNG-fueled newbuilds it also recognized the need for diversified sources during this period of transition in the maritime industry.\nThe new vesselCMA CGM Irondeparted Singapore on March 4 bound for the Khalifa port in the UAE on its first voyage. The vessel is joining the route between Ais and the Middle East Gulf region.\nCMA CGM ordered 12 methanol-capable vessels from HD Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries in South Korea in 2023. The order was valued at $2 billion with the series due for delivery in 2025 and 2026. Registered in Malta, CMA CGM is saying the container ship is “a new milestone on its group’s path toward net zero carbon by 2050.”\nThe naming ceremony for the new ship took place on February 17 in South Korea shortly before her delivery. CMA CGM Iron is 146,000 dwt with a capacity of approximately 13,000 TEU. The vessel measures 1,099 feet (335 meters). The sister ships, which will includeCMA CGM Cobalt, Argon, Platinum, Mercury, Helium, Krypton, Thorium, Osmium, Silver, Copper,andGoldwill be progressively deployed in 2025 and 2026.\n\n\nCMA CGM Iron is the first of a new class of a dozen methanol-fueled containerships (CMA CGM)\n\nThis new class is the latest step in CMA CGM’s effort with the company reporting it has invested nearly $20 billion to order LNG and methanol-powered ships. In 2024, the Group took delivery of 12 new LNG-fueled vessels and was linked yesterday to a new $2 billion order placed in China for another dozen LNG-fueled vessels. The group says that by 2029 it will have 153 ships capable of using low-carbon energies (biogas, biomethanol, and synthetic fuels) in its fleet. CMA CGM reports a total fleet currently of over 650 vessels with orders of nearly 100 new ships.\n“In the future, the diversity of technologies and the availability of greener fuels, such as biomethane or biomethanol, will remain a major challenge for the CMA CGM Group and the industry,” the company said last week in its annual financial results report.\nMethanol continues to emerge as a fuel while concerns continue about the supply and the cost of the fuel. One key challenge is that it has a lower energy density than other alternatives. In part, this might account for a slower pace for additional orders for methanol-fueled ships. There are also reports within the industry that shipowners have revised building contracts with Alphaliner saying this week that Wan-Hai has approached shipbuilders in South Korea about possibly switching its order for eight 16,000 TEU ships to LNG engines.\nWhile there were 166 new orders in 2024 according to DNV, no methanol-fueled orders have so far been placed in 2025. This compares with 44 orders in the first two months of this year for LNG-fueled vessels.\nOverall, the methanol orderbook grew quickly in the past two years with containerships leading the sector. DNV calculates that there are 25 containerships currently in service able to use methanol which has caught up to the product tanker segment. However, the orderbook shows over 300 methanol ships scheduled by 2030, two-thirds are containerships.",

    "input": "The U.S. Treasury has imposed new counterterrorism sanctions on seven Houthi leaders who worked to secure weaponry from the Russian government and supply Yemeni fighters for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. No Russian officials were sanctioned in the announcement.\nThe Houthis repeatedly attacked merchant shipping in the Red Sea from late 2023 through the end of 2024, then paused their operations in January after the announcement of the group's stated objective - the phased ceasefire agreement between Israel and Palestinian terror group Hamas. The Houthis' primary military sponsor is the government of Iran, which has provided the group with weapons and funding for years, but the U.S. Treasury also has reason to believe that the terrorist organization has received support from Iran's Russian allies as well.\n\"By seeking weapons from a growing array of international suppliers, Houthi leaders have shown their intent to continue their reckless and destabilizing actions in the Red Sea region,\" said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent in a statement. \"The United States will use all available tools to disrupt the Houthis’ terrorist activities and degrade their ability to threaten U.S. personnel, our regional partners, and global maritime trade.\"\nAccording to the Treasury, Houthi spokesman Mohammad Abdulsalam has helped arrange the group's efforts to get weapons and support from the Russian government, working from offices in Oman. Abdulsalam has traveled to Moscow and met with the Russian foreign ministry, as well as members of the Russian military, according to the Treasury's staff. An aide to Abdulsalam, Eshaq Abdulmalek Abdullah Almarwani was also designated for his role in the talks.\nAli Muhammad Muhsin Salih Al-Hadi, head of the Sanaa Chamber of Commerce (SCC), plays a key role in financing Houthi weapons purchasing. He has traveled to Russia to make arrangements \"to secure defense equipment for Houthi militants and investment in Houthi-controlled industries,\" according to the Treasury.\nTop Houthi leader Mahdi Mohammed Hussein Al-Mashat, chairman of the terror group's Supreme Political Council (SPC), has also worked to increase cooperation between the Russian government, Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Houthi movement, according to the Treasury. SPC member Mohamed Ali Al-Houthi helped coordinate the group's truce with Russia and China, which pledged a moratorium on Houthi strikes on maritime traffic linked to the Houthis' leading international supporters.\nAlso named were two senior Houthi operatives - Abdulmalek Abdullah Mohammed E Alagri and Khaled Hussein Saleh Gaber - who also traveled to Russia to participate in the meetings. Alagri has also joined talks with the Chinese government, according to the Treasury.\nThe Houthi military trade with Russia involves both imports and exports, according to the Treasury. The department asserts that Houthi operative and \"major general\" Abdulwali Abdoh Hasan Al-Jabri operated a \"lucrative human smuggling operation, recruiting Yemeni civilians to fight for Russia in Ukraine.\" The recruits were not always well-informed of their new role, Treasury said, but their efforts have earned the terrorist group a new source of much-needed revenue.\nThe weapons talks between Moscow and the Houthis may have had direct relevance to the safety of shipping in the Red Sea. In September, government sources told Reuters that Iran was helping the Houthis negotiate with Russia to acquire the P-800 Oniks (Onyx, Yakhont) supersonic antiship missile - a potent upgrade to the terrorist group's Iranian-supplied munitions, which sank two ships out of more than a hundred attacked. Houthi officials likely met with Russian representatives in Tehran twice last year, security sources told Reuters, and the talks about procuring the Oniks were expected to continue.",

The gas field is one of the older ones in operation having been started by Shell in 1975.\nAfter the rubber raft with an outboard motor was discovered, the migrants were able to make contact with Alert Phone an emergency service in the region which then issued a notice to the authorities. According to the information from the group which appeared to be from Ethiopia and Eritrea the boat had capsized in the Mediterranean but they were able to make it to the platform. They said they had been at sea for five days and now had no food or water and were cold as there was no indoor shelter available on the platform.\n\n\nMigrants on the lower platform signalling to one of the aircraft that were dispatch to confirm the situation (Sea-Watch)\n\nThe operator Miskar reported the situation and the European Coast Guard Fonex reportedly confirmed the presence of the migrants on the platform. They issued an alert to Malta, Italy, and Tunisia as the platform sits at the edge between the SAR areas maintained by Tunisia and Malta.\nSea-Watch says the Tunisian navy was going to go to the platform and reported it would remove the people on Sunday. However, no help arrived. The NGO says Italy and Malta did not respond to the situation.\nThe NGO’s vesselAurorawas dispatched and finally reached the platform on March 4. It found the people cold and hungry huddled on the walkways of the platform. They were taken aboard the Aurora and given initial attention.\nItaly ordered theAurorato the port of Lampedusa where it arrived today, March 5. The people were offloaded while the NGOs highlighted it as another example of neglect by the authorities which failed to rescue the people.\nThe Miskar platform was also the center of a 2022controversywhen several NGOs accused Shell and Malta of not responding to another group of migrants that also took shelter on the platform. In that case, the NGOs were unable to rescue the people who were removed by the Tunisian navy and returned to Africa.",

    "input": "Work officially began with the next milestone on the fifth and final vessel in the Maritime Administration’s program to provide state-of-the-art training ships to the state-run maritime academies. The grand block for the fifth vessel, which has been assigned to the California State University Maritime Academy, was placed into the dry dock to begin assembly of the ship.\nThe orders for the vessels began in 2020 using the Vessel Construction Manager acquisition model where MARAD retained TOTE Services to manage the construction of the vessels and Philly Shipyard (now Hanwha Philly Shipyard) received the orders. The fifth vessel was added to the contract in April 2022. Philly Shipyard at the time said the fifth vessel was valued at approximately $300 million, bringing the total order intake under the contract for the five-ship program would be approximately $1.5 billion.\n\"California State University Maritime Academy is honored to be part of a distinguished fleet of purpose-built training ships, each designed to meet the evolving needs of America's maritime education while also providing the U.S. with ships that can support disaster response and other critical national needs,\" said Vice Admiral (Ret.) Michael J. Dumont, Interim President of Cal Maritime. \"This vessel stands as a testament to innovation, resilience, and the nation's unwavering commitment to preparing the next generation of mariners. It will be proudly operated by the crew, cadets, and faculty of the only state maritime academy on the West Coast.\"\nThe program is known as the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV). The ships were designed to provide a modern training facility replacing outdated vessels used for the training programs. The training facilities include classrooms and a fully equipped bridge as well as a modern diesel power plant versus the steam plants that many of the previous training ships employed. The vessels are also able to handle a container, have RoRo capabilities, and can also be used for disaster relief.\nHanwha, which acquired the shipyard at the end of 2024 and looks to expand its U.S. government work highlights the speed of the construction program. They note that all five vessels’ keels were laid over the past 39 months. TOTE highlights that it is a demonstration of the efficiency of the contracting model.\nEach of the vessels is 525 feet (160 meters) in length and is designed with a range of over 10,000 miles at 18 knots. They accommodate 600 students and teachers and can accommodate up to 1,000 people on their humanitarian missions. The vessels also have a full hospital and helipad to support the humanitarian deployments.\nThe first and second NSMVs,Empire StateandPatriot State, were delivered in September 2023 and 2024. Both have now undertaken their first training voyages as they settle in at SUNY Maritime College in New York and Massachusetts Maritime Academy.\nThe three remaining vessels are currently in various stages of construction at Hanwha Philly Shipyard. TheState of Maineis in the final stages of outfitting and will be delivered later this year for the Maine Maritime Academy. The fourth vessel,Lone Star State, completed block assembly in October 2024 will be at Texas A&M Maritime Academy and the California vessel,Golden State, is tentatively scheduled for delivery in late 2026.",

TheSM Portland(51,314 dwt) has resumed its voyage bound for Vancouver where it will be inspected by Canadian authorities.\n“Due to heavy rolling by the inclement weather, unfortunately, it caused cargo damage, including container loss, collapse, and damage of 115 containers,” SM advised. Customers are being instructed to check their documents to determine if they might have had boxes onboard the vessel which had called in China and South Korea before departing for Vancouver where it was due to arrive on March 10.\nThe ship, theSM Portland, has a capacity of 4,228 TEU and is 856 feet (261 meters) in length. It was built in 2009 and acquired by SM Line in 2021. The company reports it encountered severe winter weather with strong winds near the Bering Sea. AIS signals show the vessel changing course early on March 4 and resuming its crossing on March 5. SM Line reports the vessel had slowed and adjusted course for safety.\nWhen the vessel arrives off Vancouver, the line reports there will be an investigation by Transport Canada and the Canadian Coast Guard before it is permitted to berth. SM Line warns customers that it expects schedule delays.\nSM Line was started in 2017 as a niche carrier and the following year, 2017, it launched service to North America. The company continues its Pacific routes in cooperation with the larger Korean carrier HMM.\nThis incident comes more than four years after one of the worst container loss events happened in the North Pacific in November 2020 on theONE Apsus. The vessel also encountered heavy weather resulting in the loss of over 1,800 containers and damage to many more boxes that remained on deck. Maersk experienced a similar issue with its containershipsMaersk EssenandMaersk Eindhoven, both of which also suffered container losses at sea on the Pacific that same winter season.\nThe heavy losses in 2020-2021 prompted new initiatives in the industry to address dangerous rolling. The shipping companies were advised to enhance training for their crews and new technologies were developed to help monitor and alert crew to potentially dangerous conditions.\nThe World Shipping Council in its 2024 annual report highlighted the industry’s success in reducing losses with its data showing just 221 containers were lost at sea in 2023 out of 250 million transported. The IMO also moved in 2024 to tighten the rules requiring reporting of container losses.",

After several rounds of dive operations, a commercial contractor has recovered an estimated 340,000 liters of petroleum, the service confirmed to New Zealand outlet Stuff - but officials declined to say how much fuel remains on the ship.\nThe task was supposed to finish in January, but has taken longer than expected. The salvor continues to work on recovering remaining amounts of fuel from the vessel's tanks and compartments; conditions on scene are challenging, including periods of rough weather and a difficult location at the edge of the reef.\nThe ship will likely remain in place and become a part of the reef structure, New Zealand defense minister Judith Collins told local media. Despite local complaints about the smell of diesel fuel, the government of Samoa \"has decided it wants it to stay where it is,\" she said. Collins suggested that it will likely be a diving attraction when cleanup operations are completed, much like an artificial reef.\nHMNZSManawanuiwent aground near a reef on the southern coast of Upolu, Samoa on October 5. The commanding officer ordered the 75 crewmembers aboard the vessel to abandon ship, and all made it safely to shore, despite rough surface conditions. Several of the survivors were injured while crossing a reef to reach safety, but all survived; the vessel caught fire and sank the next morning.\nManawanuiwill not be replaced, Collins confirmed in January, and her missions will be picked up by the patrol boat HMNZSOtago- a much smaller vessel lacking Manawanui's working deck and 100-tonne crane.",

    "input": "\nWhen a Louisiana refinery's mooring dock collapsed upon contact with a barge in 2023, allision damage might have been suspected - but the National Transportation Safety Board has determined that it was the dock to blame, not the vessel. A structural inspection had discovered serious deterioration of the dock six years before the accident, and no progress was made in making repairs in the year and a half before the casualty.\nIn the early hours of April 25, 2023, the towing vesselOvide Jwas arriving at the Chalmette Refinery crude oil dock with two laden barges and a cargo of 50,000 barrels of crude. The refinery is on the Lower Mississippi near mile 89, just downriver from New Orleans. The dock was built in 1967 out of wood and steel pilings, dolphins, and access bridges. The transfer platform was located on dolphin number three, along with a boom crane and the pipe manifold.\nThe relief captain was at the helm as the towboat approached the dock from downriver, using the current to guide the tow slowly towards the pier. The relief captain made his final approach at 0001-0004, maneuvering slowly to make contact with the dock at about 0.3 knots.\nWhen the tow made contact with dolphin number 3, part of the dock fell off into the river. The relief captain put the starboard side engine in neutral in order to avoid fouling the propeller with any debris from the collapse. The other two dolphins remained intact, so the crew moored to the surviving portions of the dock and notified the company of the casualty. Luckily, no one was injured.\nTheOvide Jand her barges sustained no damage from the incident, and the timber fendering around the dock was undamaged. Video from the pilothouse showed no signs of a hard contact (like jarring, vibration or movement of objects). The relief captain later told investigators that the maneuver - which he had performed at the same dock 20 times in the past year - had gone perfectly to plan.\n\"When you come in, you touch up stern first. . . . So, when I came in, I lightly touch on the stern. . . . As soon as I touched up, the dock collapsed,\" he said. \"If I had to do it again, I would do it the same way over again. I would not change a thing.\"\nThe dock sustained about $7 million worth of damage: 150 feet of the structure collapsed, and the support piles for dolphin number three were sheared off below the waterline. But the damage may have started long before the casualty event, based on past inspection reports. In 2017, a third-party engineering inspection found major deterioration of the braces between the dolphin's pilings. Six years before the collapse, three horizontal braces on the dolphin were broken, one more was damaged and two pilings were \"severely deteriorated.\" The dock owner informed NTSB that the recommendations from this inspection had \"not been progressed\" before the dock collapsed.\n\"Because a portion of the dock collapsed from what appeared to be a low-impact contact during docking, it is likely that the dock’s dolphin no. 3 transfer platform structure was compromised to the extent that it could not sustain the forces from a typical docking. The dock owner was aware that the dock had structural integrity issues before the collapse but had not yet taken steps to address them,\" NTSB concluded.",

The company describes itself as one of the world’s leading dry bulk shipping companies currently with a fleet of 91 vessels.\nThe Saverys’ company CMB.TECH continues its efforts at consolidating the shipping industry after acquiring Euronav and converting it to the tanker operating company under its umbrella. The company currently has more than 150 seagoing vessels with operations in crude oil, dry bulk, containers, chemicals, offshore wind, and workboats.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, CMB.TECH is acquiring a 40 percent stake in Golden Ocean (more than 81 million shares) at a price of $14.49 per share. They represent renown investor John Fredriksen’s entire stake in the company, but CMB.TECH reports it will not trigger a mandatory takeover bid or similar offer.\nAccording to CMB.TECH, the acquisition is in line with its strategic objective of diversification. It says it intends on becoming a long-term shareholder and investing in a modern dry bulk fleet. Last year, CEO Alexander Saverys told the investment community that they planned to use the traditional sectors of the shipping world to help fund and drive their push for decarbonization. CMB.TECH is at the forefront of developing ammonia and hydrogen systems for shipping.\n\"The acquisition of the Golden Ocean shares from Hemen represents a significant milestone in CMB.TECH’s diversification strategy,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH while announcing the agreement. “We look forward to engaging with the board, management, and employees of Golden Ocean and to build on Golden Ocean’s and Mr. Fredriksen’s strong legacy to drive long-term growth and innovation.”\nFor Fredriksen, it ends his long association with the dry bulk sector and Golden Ocean. He made his investment in 2000 and a decade ago merged the company with Knightsbridge Shipping. Golden Ocean continues to grow its position reporting in late 2024 that it had completed the delivery of 10 new 85,000 dwt vessels. They were built in South Korea.\nWhile the dry bulk sector has been under pressure, analysts viewed the acquisition as a sign of confidence in the opportunities. They noted that the Saverys are paying a strong premium to the valuation of Golden Ocean. The stock, which reached a recent high of $15 a share in May 2024 on NASDAQ, has been trading under $10 a share for all of 2025.\nCMB.TECH has been active in the dry bulk sector through Bocimar. The company owns 30 bulkers that transport coal, iron ore, grain, and minor bulks.",

If operationalized, the \"Thunderforge\" software initiative could have a profound effect on how the Navy and Marine Corps fight.\nAccording to Breaking Defense, the biggest operational advantage may be surprisingly mundane: collating and analyzing all the data needed to plan the logistical details of a military operation, which can take hundreds of hours of work using dated Pentagon computing systems. This would free up staff officers for more strategically-important tasks.\nThe Thunderforge system draws on AI agents developed by Scale AI, along with Anduril's Lattice platform and Microsoft's large language model (LLM) products. The developers emphasized that the agents will always operate under human oversight.\n\"Today’s military planning processes rely on decades-old technology and methodologies, creating a fundamental mismatch between the speed of modern warfare and our ability to respond,\" said Bryce Goodman, DIU Thunderforge Program Lead and contractor. \"Thunderforge brings AI-powered analysis and automation to operational and strategic planning, allowing decision-makers to operate at the pace required for emerging conflicts.\"\nThe system will be deployed first with Indo-Pacific Command and European Command, the two regions with the most at stake in a high-end fight.

    "input": "The UK Government awarded a £55 million ($71 million) grant to Scotland’s Port of Cromarty Firth to drive the next phase of expansion which will be used to support planned float offshore wind farms. The grant is the first of two announced under a program launched by the government in 2023 to support the development of port infrastructure needed for the floating wind sector.\nLocated on the northeastern shore of Scotland near Inverness, the Port of Cromarty Firth has a long history of supporting the offshore industries first in oil and gas and more recently offshore wind. Port officials highlight that its position with deep, sheltered waters is perfectly suited to accommodate large ships. The plan calls for bringing the wind farm components to the port where they will expand the lay area as well as provide space for the construction, installation, and operational support.\nThe components will be manufactured around the UK. The new facility will be the Quay West and the Phase 5 laydown area. The floating turbines can be assembled and pre-commissioned, before being towed to the wind farm site.\nThe port presented a plan that would make it the UK’s first custom-built integration hub for floating offshore wind construction. It said the expansion was critical to meeting the plans for the sector.\nThe UK remains the largest installed base of offshore wind in Europe although China surpassed it for total size in the global market. The government has mapped a strong strategy to make wind energy a key component in the long-term strategy and committed to investments in floating wind farms which will be the next phase of the industry.\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero launched the Floating Offshore Wind Manufacturing Investment Scheme (FLOWMIS) to meet the port needs of the floating wind sector. The Department confirmed the grant to the Invergordon-based Trust that operates the port as part of an effort to fund the proposed expansion project. They said today’s grant would pave the way for the port to secure matching funds from banks and investors.\nThe port also plans to use the grant to start the process of awarding pre-construction contracts for the expansion project. They report the work must be completed by 2027 to be ready for the first commercial-scale floating wind projects.\nPort Talbot is the second port selected under the FLOWMIS program. The Department reports the plans for the shortlisted port are currently under development. Talbot is located on Swansea Bay in Wales.",

If the anonymous comments on Chinese social media were transformed into policy, Palawan would be the first major piece of inhabited sovereign territory that China has claimed in the Philippines. Though new, such a claim would be consistent with China's foreign policy objectives: Beijing has laid similar historical claim to Tibet, Taiwan and parts of northern India.\nIf the new Palawan claims were promoted on open-access Western platforms like X or Facebook, Manila would likely have little cause for concern. But since the Chinese internet is tightly governed and subject to rigid censorship, and China has allowed the Palawan claims to stay posted online, the Philippine government has reacted with alarm.\n\"We categorically reject the baseless and revisionist claims circulating on Chinese social media that Palawan was historically part of China and should be returned to it,\" said Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Año in a statement. \"Palawan has always been and will always remain an integral part of the Republic of the Philippines. No historical record, legal precedent or credible evidence support the claim that Palawan was ever under Chinese sovereignty.\"\nThe claim on Chinese social media suggests that Palawan is \"Zheng He Island,\" named for the 14th-century Chinese explorer Zheng He. Año noted that there is no historical evidence that Zheng He visited Palawan, nor any sign of Chinese settlement in the province. \"These false narratives, proliferated through digital disinformation and information warfare tactics, appear to be part of a broader effort to undermine Philippine sovereignty,\" Año warned.\nThe \"Zheng He\" theory would extend China's ambitions beyond the boundaries of the well-known \"nine-dash line\" policy, Beijing's historically-derived claim to almost all of the South China Sea. The nine-dash line covers most of the Philippines' western exclusive economic zone, along with large sections of the Vietnamese, Malaysian, Indonesian and Bruneian economic zones. An international court invalidated the basis of that claim in 2016, but China has ignored the ruling.\n",

During a jamming event, the crew went off course at hit a rock, causing hull and propeller damage. According to the BMMOA, the crew appealed to Russian port authorities for aid, but received no response for an extended period - so long that the crew began to run short on food and had to rely on melted snow for drinking water.\nWith pressure from ITF, salvage assistance was finally secured. ThePrincesswas afloat and under way again at a slow bell near Ust-Luga on March 6, with a Russian salvage tug nearby, according to AIS data.\nThe BMMOA reported that another Meghna Group bulker got into trouble in Venezuela at about the same time. In late January, a diver was struck and killed by the propeller while he was performing a mandatory underwater counternarcotics inspection on theMeghna Prestige.The officer on duty had started the engine because the vessel \"began drifting with the wind,\" the master said, thereby killing the diver.

Francesco Schettino, former captain of the lost cruise ship Costa Concordia, may soon be eligible for partial parole, and would have a day job waiting for him outside of prison.\nOn January 13, 2012, the giant cruise ship Costa Concordia hit a rock and capsized just off the island of Giglio, Tuscany. 32 people were killed in the casualty, and the wreck removal cost about $2 billion, making it the largest project of its kind in history - and Italy's worst maritime disaster since the Second World War.\nOn that day, Schettino navigated Costa Concordia closer to shore in a \"salute\" for a retired cruise line commodore, resulting in the grounding and partial sinking. He was accused of manslaughter, and in 2015 he was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison.\nSchettino’s legal representatives say that the collision itself did not cause the fatalities, and blamed a failed backup generator and flooded compartments for failed evacuations; they also denied allegations that he abandoned ship early, or that he had navigated close to shore in order to impress a female dancer who was on the bridge. The captain never admitted fault for the sinking, but blamed issues with the vessel, miscommunication on the bridge and other issues.\nNine years after his conviction, Schettino is up for parole, and a board will announce its decision on his case on April 8. If granted \"semi-freedom,\" he would be allowed to work during the day at the Fabbrica di San Pietro, a Vatican institution charged with preserving St. Peter's Basilica. Sponsored by the prisoner support group Second Chance, his role would be in digitalizing historical documents. He would join other inmates from Rome's prisons who work at the Vatican under the organization's auspices.\nSome of the families of the victims of the Costa Concordia disaster have opposed his petition for semi-release. Giovanni Girolamo, father of a crewmember who died in the sinking, told La Nazione that Schettino \"must not be released, but given 32 life sentences,\" equal to the number of the victims.\n",

The move comes just weeks after the company alsonamedformer Wärtsilä CEO Jaakko Eskola as its new chairman of the board.\nThe yard which has a long heritage in the cruise ship sector was acquired in 2014 by Germany’s Meyer family which was best known for Meyer Werft in Papenburg, Germany. The family reports it has invested over €300 million in the development of the shipyard after acquiring it from STX. They highlight that it delivered at least one large cruise ship a year during the decade working with customers TUI’s Mein Schiff. Carnival Cruise Line, Costa, and Royal Caribbean International.\nTim Meyer took over as CEO in 2020 after being a managing director at the Papenburg yard since 2016. He replaced his brother Jan Meyer who had been CEO of Meyer Turku for two years since 2014. The company highlighted recently that Tim Meyer had been successful in returning the shipyard to profitability. He cited efforts to develop the organization, streamline processes, implement a new enterprise resource planning system, and a development program. Revenues are reported to have grown from €500 million to €2 billion.\nThe pandemic placed a strain on the operations but both the yards in Turku and Papenburg were able to retain their orders. Papenburg however required a financial bailout from the German government last year and as part of the deal the Meyer family ceded ownership of the yard but it still retains 100 percent ownership of Turku.\nTim Meyer said in the press release he would be focusing on the development and strategies of the shipyard and the family’s other businesses. Jan Meyer had shifted to a business development role at Papenburg, while their father Bernard Meyer has stepped down from the management of both shipyards.\n“In Casimir, we have found an exceptional leader with years of experience from various industries such as construction,” said board chairman Eskola. “I already have experience from successfully working together with him in a company majority owned by a family.”\nLindholm will assume his new role in May after departing Cargotec, which today focuses on heavy road equipment after a series oftransactions. Kalmar the manufacturer of cranes and heavy cargo handling equipment was spun-off and in late 2024 it agreed to sell MacGregor, a leader in maritime cargo and load handling, to a private investment firm. Previously Lindholm was president and CEO of Eltel Group, an infrastructure company, and before that, he was at Lemminkäinen Group, a Finnish construction company.\nHe takes the leadership of Meyer Turku as the yard is focused on building the world’s largest cruise ships for Royal Caribbean International. At the end of February, it started the propulsion plant onStar of the Seasahead of planned sea trials and delivery ahead of its entry into service during the summer. The first blocks were set in the dry dock last October for the next 250,000 gross ton cruise ship which will beLegend of the Seasand due for delivery in 2026. Royal Caribbean has ordered a fourth Icon class cruise ship from the yard due in 2027 and has options for two additional sister ships.\nMeyer Turku completed the last of the cruise ships for TUI’s Mein Schiff in June 2024 ending a decade’s long relationship. Currently, the yard is also working on a new patrol ship for the Finnish Border Guard.",

The announcement came as Chairman and CEO of CMA CGM Group Rodolphe Saadé met with President Donald Trump and alluded to U.S. shipbuilding plans.\nThe French group currently owns seven terminals in the U.S. including in the Port of New York New Jersey and Los Angeles. It also owns APL, the former American President Lines, acquired in the 2016 acquisition of Neptune Orient Lines.\n“Over the next four years, we will significantly grow our U.S.-flagged fleet, expand the capacity of key container ports on both coasts, develop state-of-the-art warehousing across the country, and establish a significant air cargo hub in Chicago,” said Saadé. “I am proud to build on our long-standing relationship with the United States through this commitment of $20 billion to the country’s maritime future and logistics capabilities.”\nCMA CGM Group said its investments over the next four years would contribute to the development of American maritime capabilities and advance the U.S. administration’s recently announced priority to strengthen American shipbuilding capabilities. CMA CGM highlights it has been servicing U.S. markets for 35 years and reports it handles about 5 million TEU annually in the U.S. out of the 23 million TEU carried globally in 2024.\nOne element they highlighted would include “bolstering APL’s U.S. flag capacity.” Saadé told Trump the company would like to triple the size of its U.S.-flagged fleet to 30 ships. It was unclear however if these vessels would be used for APL or within the CMA CGM fleet. In 2020, CMA CGM transitioned APL’s express services into the CMA CGM branded operations refocusing APL to a niche operation servicing the United States Government, providing its U.S. flag service, and continuing its service to the Guam-Pacific trade.\n\n???????????????? French shipping magnate Rodolphe Saadé pledges $20bn US expansionBoss of CMA CGM says expansion will add further 10,000 jobs in UShttps://t.co/a50W0hQt0WPS. At such a price, we could have also negotiated with Trump to rename the Gulf of America the Gulf of Phoenicia????????????pic.twitter.com/Ut9c4QTOfx\n\nThe company did not detail the proportions of the other investments but reported it would include its terminal and logistics operations and its expanding air cargo business.\nThe group said it will develop port infrastructure in key locations across the U.S., including New York, Los Angeles, Dutch Harbor, Houston, and Miami to contribute to efficient operations and supply chains. It said the new investments would accelerate digitization, improve connectivity, and increase safety for port workers and cargo.\nCMA CGM in 2023 reported plans toinvest $600 millionafter it completed the acquisition of terminals in Bayonne, New Jersey, and Staten Island, New York from Global Container Terminals. At the beginning of 2022, CMA CGM also completed the acquisition of Fenix Marine Services (FMS), which operates a terminal at the Port of Los Angeles. It is reported to be the third largest terminal in the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex.\nThe other planned investments will include improving U.S. logistics and supply chain infrastructure with new warehousing and automotive logistics platforms. As part of this investment, CMA CGM Group will also expand its American air cargo capacity including a new hub in Chicago and deploying five new Boeing 777 freighters. CMA CGM will open a new logistics R&D hub in Boston, focusing on advanced robotics and automation solutions.\nThe planned U.S. investments are part of a larger overall growth plan for CMA CGM Group. The carrier currently owns over 300 vessels and operates in total more than 650 with reports that it has an additional 94 on order in China and South Korea. The U.S. shipbuilding plan might help to earn some relief from the Trump administration which is reported to be planning fees on carriers calling in the U.S. that build or operate Chinese-built ships. Earlier this week, the carrier waslinked to a $2.6 billion orderplaced with China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) for a dozen new containerships. The group said in 2023 that it had ordered more than 70 containerships to be built in China.",

    "input": "\nThe new head of U.S. Transportation Command wants to buy as many more foreign-built ships as necessary to replenish the sealift fleet, purchasing secondhand hulls abroad and repairing them in the United States to meet Military Sealift Command's standards. This acquisition strategy has been used to bolster the Ready Reserve since the Cold War, and is viewed by defense logistics planners as a rapid and cost-effective way to get new tonnage into a deteriorating sealift fleet.\n\"The median age of the 46 Roll-on/Roll-off ships we use to surge from the continental United States is 47 years; 14 of the 46 ships are 50 years old or older,\" said Gen. Randall Reed (USAF) in written testimony for the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"USTRANSCOM supports the Navy’s strategy to recapitalize the government-owned fleet by acquiring foreign-built sealift ships from the commercial used market while also removing limitations on the number of used sealift vessels that the DoD can procure.\"\nThe Navy and the Maritime Administration have been buying foreign ships for the Ready Reserve for some time, and have authorization to purchase a maximum of 10 used ro/ros. That cap is approaching: seven used hulls have been bought already, and two more are expected this year.\nGen. Reed testified that the optimal course of action would be to waive the cap and buy four more a year going forward, two a year at minimum. These purchases would offset the built-in decline in capability as the fleet ages out: 30 sealift ships are on track to decommission by 2034, and the aging fleet's ability to get underway on short notice is already in doubt. Reed noted that many of the oldest ships have steam plants, and it is difficult to recruit mariners to work on these vessels.\nGen. Reed told the committee that in the short term, Transportation Command needs all the flexibility that it can get to buy used tonnage on the commercial market, and would like a waiver of the 10-ship cap on purchasing foreign-built hulls. However, he emphasized the importance of the Jones Act and the need to continue building vessels in America.\n\"Together we are working to get ships in any way we can. The address last night by the commander-in-chief emphasized that sealift is definitely something we need to do. He intends to make sure we can return to the seas,\" he said. \"We need to build new and buy used.\"",

    "input": "The two unions representing the masters and crews of the tugs that support the UK’s Royal Navy announced they were postponing planned strikes. The actions would have impacted the support for vessels that the Navy’s bases as well as other critical services such as the delivery of supplies and munitions.\nAt issue were the complaints by the two unions, Unite and Prospect, that their members were not being consulted as part of the new services contract being negotiated by operator Serco Marine and the UK’s Ministry of Defense. The contract covers services at Navy bases in Devonport, Portsmouth, Faslane, Great Harbour Greenock, and Kyle of Lochalsh.\nThe company has a 10-year contract valued at £1.2 billion ($1.5 million) which is up for renewal. Serco provides navigational support for everything from the pride of the fleet aircraft carriers and nuclear subs to all other naval vessels and is also responsible for delivering fuel, water, and munitions at all Royal Navy ports, tank cleaning, and passenger transportation. Serco took over these critical roles in 2008 as part of the government’s move to privatize the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service.\nPromise, which mainly provides services at Faslane, Portsmouth, and Devonport, began the strikes with a 24-hour stoppage on February 3 and continued with actions short of a strike, which include adherence to work rules and a ban on overtime. Unite was scheduled to start a series of walkouts as well refusing overtime as of today, March 6.\nFollowing talks with the MoD, Serco, and the Royal Navy, Unite reported that it had agreed to suspend its strike action at Devonport, Portsmouth, Faslane, Great Harbour Greenock, and Kyle of Lochalsh. Serco has agreed to delay signing its new contract with the MoD to allow for 30 days of union consultations.\n“There will now be a consultation period to ensure the service is fit for purpose under the new contract. During this period, strike action will be suspended but action short of strikes will continue,” said Unite national officer John McGookin.\nThe unions contended that the government was looking to reduce the contract by £250 million ($310 million) which Unite says is putting nearly 100 jobs at risk. Unite has 300 members which represent about half of the workforce. It said among the steps being discussed was a proposal to reduce the number of tugs used to move nuclear submarines to four from the current six.\nSerco had confirmed to the BBC that negotiations regarding the in-port contract were ongoing while emphasizing that no changes had been agreed. The MoD said it was an issue between the employer and the unions and a strike would not impact the Royal Navy’s operations. Serco had promised to keep the unions apprised of the negotiations.",

    "input": "\nSince returning to the White House, Donald Trump has vowed to restore “maximum pressure” on Iran with targeting of the oil trade being a top priority. In an exclusive report, Reuters revealed today, March 6, that the Trump administration is considering ways to delay the shipping of Iranian oil by inspecting tankers.\nCiting six unnamed sources,Reuters saysthe Trump administration is considering leveraging a 2003 agreement designed to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to slow the delivery of Iranian oil and increase pressure on the supply chain and counterparties. According to the report, tankers would be stopped for inspections in major sea lanes and critical points such as the Malacca Strait.\nReuters reports its sources told them the goal would be to slow down Iran’s oil exports and make it more difficult to meet delivery contracts. The concept is that it would further disrupt the supply chains and the critical revenues Iran gains from oil exports. One source speculated to Reuters that exports could be reduced by some 750,000 barrels per day.\nIran is reported to have made more than $50 billion in each of the last two years from oil exports despite Western efforts to increase sanctions. Further, TankerTrakers.com reported earlier this week that it calculated “Iran's crude oil exports were up by exactly 50 percent during February vs January.”\nThe fleet of tankers servicing the Iranian oil trade also continues to grow. The watchdog group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) maintains adatabaseand says when it started in 2020 it listed 70 tankers. Today it lists over 510 tankers, many of which are known to be using false flags. TankerTrackers.com calculates the U.S. “has only blacklisted 234 (or 45 percent) of the 522 tankers involved in the Iran sanctions oil trade.”\nIran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate including citing its ability to close the critical Straits of Hormuz. The regime has in recent years taken a “tit-for-tat” response seizing tankers in the Persian Gulf after the U.S. attempted to seize oil cargos.Two Greek tankersand their crews were held for an extended period after the U.S. went after a cargo on a tanker disabled in Greek waters. Greek courts forced the U.S. to release the oil cargo but when the U.S. was successful in seizing another cargo Irantook more tankersincluding one undercharter to Chevron.\nReuters cites a speech by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian where he last week acknowledged the new U.S. efforts. The new Trump administration launched two waves of sanctions in its first weeks including a dozen tankers it said were involved in illegal ship-to-ship transfers. Pezeshkian reportedly said the new actions were creating uncertainties about how to unload their oil and gas cargos.\nIran has shown strong resilience by adapting to the sanctions and adopting new measures. Bloomberg this week reported the use of more Aframax and Suezman tankers versus VLCCs. They cited eight smaller tankers involved in transfer in February saying these vessels provide additional flexibility. They said these ships were able to deliver the oil to smaller Chinese ports.\nIran media was quick to carry today’s report from Reuters on the new efforts. Government officials have yet to respond.",

    "input": "\nFailure by the U.S. Coast Guard to invest in maintaining and renewing its crumpling shore infrastructure and a lack of funding from the U.S. Congress has resulted in a significant increase in the amount required to carry out the work. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is again shining the spotlight on the agency’s mounting challenges, estimating that the USCG now requires $7 billion to rebuild its deteriorating shore infrastructures, more than double the amount required in 2019.\nGOA carried out a detailed assessment in 2019 of the Coast Guard’s shore infrastructures and made recommendations to manage the growing challenges. Based on USCG assessments, GAO determined that about 50 percent of the facilities were past their expected service life. The agency needed $2.6 billion to revamp the facilities comprising assets like piers, runways, and buildings. USCG it reports has about 40,000 shore infrastructure assets with a value of $24.5 billion.\nSix years later GAO finds little has been achieved and the agency is now grappling with an infrastructure maintenance backlog amounting to $7 billion. The Coast Guard admitted in a 2023 report that the condition of most of the facilities ranged from “mediocre to fair” and were contributing to the worsening operational challenges.\nThe Coast Guard cites budgetary constraints for the backlog, reporting the government’s budgets since 2019 failed to include requested funding levels that the agency identified were required to meet its targets in terms of shore infrastructure investments. A case in point is the 2025 financial year in which the agency requested $709 million but was only allocated $167 million by Congress.\nApart from budgetary constraints that have forced the deferment of maintenance, the agency is also attributing the surge in backlog to new facilities that are needed to accommodate new assets including the offshore patrol cutters (OPC). The agency is building 25 OPCs that will replace the aging medium endurance cutters.\n“We found that the Coast Guard-estimated $7 billion cost to address its shore infrastructure is understated because there are hundreds of additional projects that lack cost estimates, and the Coast Guard has not updated all of its existing cost estimates for inflation,” said GAO.\nIn its report, GAO highlights that the current shore infrastructure backlog cuts across recapitalization projects that include replacing assets that have reached the end of their useful life, new construction projects that include building a boat maintenance facility, and deferred depot-level maintenance projects, such as repaving an airfield. Also affected are critical infrastructures like housing units for service members and their families, training centers, and command centers.\nGAO reports it made six recommendations to the USCG in 2019, of which the Coast Guard has only fully addressed two while also taking steps toward three of the recommendations. It says the Coast Guard is in the process of systematically assessing the condition of its shore infrastructure but has not developed supporting details on project alternatives and trade-offs in congressional budget requests.\nThereport concludesthe USCG should be taking the recommended steps to more efficiently manage existing resources, including reducing costs. It would also provide the Coast Guard and Congress with better information to address the mounting shore infrastructure challenges.",

The pause is the latest in a long series of changes: his first administration negotiated a zero-percent tariff deal in 2019 - the U.S. Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - but after winning the election in November 2024, Trump announced the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on most goods from USMCA members. The White House paused this tariff hike on February 3 before it entered into effect, then put it into action on March 4, then paused it again on Thursday.\nThe Thursday pause occurred in two phases. In the morning, Trump announced via social media that he would temporarily suspend the tariff increase on Mexico, but did not mention Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that tariffs on Canadian goods remained in effect. Later in the day, Trump signed two executive orders exempting both Mexican and Canadian goods for another month.\nThe pause is temporary, and the tariffs will resume on April 2 unless another solution is announced. Mexican and Canadian goods traded outside of the USMCA framework - a limited category that includes some Mexican-built vehicles - are still subject to 25 percent tariffs in the interim. An additional tariff of 10 percent on all Chinese goods remains in effect.\n\"[The pause] basically makes it more fair for our car manufacturers during this short interim period before April 2,\" Trump said. \"Long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening here.\"\nThe latest pause follows a sell-off in the stock market, the announcement of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods by the Mexican and Canadian governments, and a series of complaints from major American manufacturers - particularly automakers. The tightly integrated North American parts supply chain left American carmakers exposed to the added costs from paying tariffs at each border crossing, which they would have to pass on to consumers. By contrast, carmakers in Europe, Japan and Korea were not exposed to the tariffs, and this gave their products a new price advantage over American autos.\nAt the signing ceremony, Trump said that the pause had nothing to do with the markets. Following news of the new tariff pause, the Dow closed down by one percent and the Nasdaq by 2.6 percent, reflecting continued uncertainty in the market.",

The Coast Guard highlights that the unique icebreaker celebrated its 49th year of operations after life extensions designed to keep the vessel operational until at least 2029 when the new icebreakerPolar Sentinelis scheduled to finally be completed.\nPolar Star’s crew performed icebreaking duties in McMurdo Sound, clearing routes to ensure safe passage for cargo vessels for McMurdo Station and New Zealand’s Scott Base.Polar Staralso conducted a crew exchange with the New Zealand Defense Force shipAotearoawhile it was operating in the region.\n\n\nThe annual mission was completed this week with the Polar Star departing McMurdo Station (USCG)\n\n“The surface ice conditions in McMurdo Sound were abnormally light this year, a welcome change of pace from the extreme conditions experienced last year,” said Captain Jeff Rasnake,Polar Star’s commanding officer. “Operation Deep Freeze presented a number of challenges, beyond those inherent in maintaining and operating a 49-year-old ship to complete this arduous mission. We benefitted tremendously from a great deployment plan which allowed us to take advantage of favorable conditions and use the elements to stay ahead of events without pressing the cutter or crew excessively.”\nPolar Staralso worked with the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to support a secure and sustainable Southern Ocean. It was the first United States surface asset to support CCAMLR. The crew’s efforts to observe and monitor fishing and other activity on the high seas safeguarded resources and U.S. national interests in the Antarctic region.\nThe vessel and her crew have transited nearly 16,000 miles since departing its Seattle homeport in November with stops in Honolulu, Sydney, and McMurdo Station. To celebrate its 49th year of service, the vessel also visited Cape Polar Star in the northern part of the Ross Sea. Cape Polar Star was named after the icebreaker for the scientific support provided by the cutter in the area during Operation Deep Freeze 86.\nPolar Staris the United States’ only asset capable of providing access to both polar regions. The Seattle-based cutter is a 399-foot heavy polar icebreaker commissioned in 1976. It is 13,500 tons and is 84 feet wide with a 34-foot draft. The cutter's six diesel and three gas turbine engines produce up to 75,000 horsepower.\n\n\n\nAfter years of delays, design challenges, and cost overruns, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Navy Integrated Program Office received approval on December 19 to begin building thePolar Sentinel, the first of three planned heavy icebreakers. The order for the vessel was placed with VT Halter which was later acquired by Bollinger Shipyards. The new vessel is slated to be larger at 460 feet (140 meters) in length and 23,300 displacement tons.\nDuring a speech in January days after taking office, Donald Trump said the U.S. would launch a massive building program for new icebreakers. In total, he said there could be 40 vessels built although due to the complexity of the heavy icebreaker, it is unlikely that all the vessels would be of that class. The U.S. currently only has thePolar Staras the heaviest vessel, along with the medium icebreakerHealywhich has been in operation since 2000, and the recent acquisition of commercial polar icebreakerAiviq, renamedStoris, which is expected to be commissioned in 2026 to provide bridging capacity until the new fleet is in service.",

Now politicians in the small Pacific Island nation are questioning their role in the shadow fleet and how the reporting is impacting the image of the nation.\nAfter repeated news reports highlighting vessels registered in the country, the Cook Island News reports it became the issue of questions during last week’s parliamentary meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport responding. They asserted that nothing illegal was happening, but they would investigate the allegations.\nAccording to the newspaper, Opposition Leader Tina Browne asked the Ministry of Transport to respond to the reports that vessels registered in the Cook Islands have been “arrested overseas” on allegations of transporting arms to Russia or involvement in the shadow fleet. She cited media reports of 18 vessels having been detained, questioning if it was “giving us a very bad name out there?”\nDeputy Prime Minister Albert Nichols responded saying that they had not been able to find anything on the alleged 18 vessels while noting that the names of the ships had not been supplied. The Cook Islands News reports he assured parliament that if there were any merit to the allegations “rightful steps” would be taken.\nThe tankerEagle Swhich was detained for over 50 days in Finland after the Christmas Day incident with the undersea cables is registered in the Cook Islands. The vessel was transferred to the Cook Islands’ vessel registry in July 2023 and its registered owners are listed as a company in Dubai. In addition, the U.S. sanctioned four tankers registered in the Cook Islands in its sweeping January 2025 package.\nThe Ministry of the Foreign Affairs of the Cook Islands said it is well aware of the situation and is taking the global media coverage “very seriously.” The government has repeatedly denied the allegations that Maritime Cook Islands has become a haven for Russian-linked tankers. It says that they comply with international sanctions. Maritime Cook Islands is an outside manager employed to administer the registry.\nThe Cook Islands however maintains an open registry with the media reports stating it added over seven million DWT of tankers and became a top 30 registry in 2024. The Ministry said it had not expected the number of vessels in the registry to increase so dramatically noting it is currently over 780 foreign vessels.\nThey asserted that there are no illegal operators as vessels have either been deregistered or have voluntarily removed themselves from the registry. A dozen tankers were removed from the registry in July 2024 for violations. Nicholas responded to Browne asking for some time to conduct a review and said if the allegations were proven to be accurate then there would be an investigation and appropriate actions taken.",

    "input": "Russia’s energy shipping company Sovcomflot reported financial results on Friday, March 7, citing the continuing impact of Western sanctions on its operations and warning that the pressures on its operations were likely to increase this year. This came as Donald Trump posted on social media that he was “strongly considering” additional sanctions on Russia to push it to the negotiating table with Ukraine.\nSovcomflot told investors that Western sanctions have continued to erode its profits. The press release said, “The company's operations were subject to the influence of geopolitical factors and illegally imposed sanctions by unfriendly countries. The company continues to work systematically to minimize the negative impact of sanctions restrictions on its activities, consistently adhering to high standards of maritime safety and the quality of maritime operations.”\nAmong the factors cited was that some vessels had to be idled which the company said created “operational difficulties.” Operating costs for the year were up approximately 13 percent. This comes even after Sovcomflot downsized operations previously selling tankers and transferred vessels to companies outside the sanctions.\nThe result was that 2024 net profits were down by over half (55 percent) to $424 million. Revenues were down by 20 percent ($1.87 billion) as the company has also had to deal with the price cap imposed on Russian oil by the G7.\n“New large-scale sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department, introduced after the reporting date, became an additional limiting factor in the company's operations,” wrote Sovcomflot. It was referencing the January 10 announcement by the Biden administration. Before leaving office, Joe Biden imposed the largest sanction effort to date which included a new listing of Sovcomflot. The Treasury identified as blocked property 69 vessels, including 54 oil and product tankers and four liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, owned by Sovcomflot.\nDonald Trump is now threatening to further increase the pressure on Russia writing on social media today that Russia is “’pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield” causing him to “seriously consider” large-scale banking sanctions, other sanctions, and tariffs. He said if enacted the sanctions would be in place until a cease fire had been achieved and a final agreement on peace is reached.\nRussia is reportedly anxious to loosen the sanctions which have placed an increasing hold on its economy. Energy products are one of the primary sources of revenue for Russia.",

    "input": "The Trump administration is reported to be building out its plans to penalize China for its subsidy of the shipbuilding industry by seeking international support while also linking it to the rebuilding ofU.S. shipbuildingand breaking China’s monopoly on cargo cranes. Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have seen drafts of executive orders proposed to Trump that follow up on the recommendations of the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office and the announced White House office on shipbuilding.\nSpeaking to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said, “We used to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore, very much. But we’re going to make them very fast, very soon.”\nThe Trade Representative in the last days of the Biden administration concluded an investigation into China’s shipbuilding policies. The report called for steps to reign in China’s unfair advantages in shipbuilding which it concluded were built through government subsidies and policies. Unconfirmed reports recently said the Trump administration had taken the Biden report and was looking at fees on shipping lines using Chinese-built ships and calling at U.S. ports.\nIn anexclusive reportfrom Reuters, it said it has seen a draft of the executive order proposing fees on all ships entering U.S. ports from carriers that have Chinese-built ships in their fleets. The fees would be regardless of where the individual ship was built or registered.\n\"The national security and economic prosperity of the United States is further endangered by the People's Republic of China's unfair trade practices in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors,\" the draft order says according to Reuters.\nIt highlights that the draft changes from theprevious reportsin that it widens the potential number of ships subject to the fees. It does not say how the fees would be calculated but drops previsions that limited the fees to fleets with 25 percent or more of the ships on order or for delivery from China.\nThe draft order according to Reuters also calls on the U.S. to “engage allies and partners” to enact similar fees. According to Reuters if they did not support the U.S. they could “risk retaliation,” which is emerging as one of the Trump administration's bargaining tactics. Retaliation has become a key piece of the emerging trade war and tariffs and Trump’s report that on April 2 the U.S. will enact reciprocal tariffs on any nation that imposes tariffs on U.S. goods.\nThe report highlights that the sweeping fees would reach beyond the major Chinese carriers including COSCO and its subsidiary Orient Overseas Container Lines (OOCL). By including all fleets with Chinese-built ships, it would impact all the major carriers including MSC Mediterranean Shipping, Maersk, CMA CGM, and others.\nThe draft also links to the separate issue that emerged over Chinese cargo-handling equipment according to Reuters. During the Biden administration, the dominance of China’s ZPMC (Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Company) was highlighted and accusations emerged that China controlled the cranes or was using them to spy on the United States. Biden moves to place tariffs on the large cranes used by ports to load and unload containers and to reshore a U.S. capability to build large cargo cranes.\nAdditional tariffs would be imposed on Chinese-made cargo equipment according to Reuters’ review of the draft executive order.\nThe draft on the response to Chinese shipbuilding subsidies comes after The Wall Street Journal reported the White House was also working on a sweeping executive order for the shipbuilding industry. It reportedly will order Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to review procurement as it relates to shipbuilding and proposes raising wages for shipyard workers involved with nuclear shipbuilding.\nTrump during his meeting at the White House on Thursday with Chairman and CEO of CMA CGM Group Rodolphe Saadé alluded to major steps coming soon in the shipbuilding and shipping industries.",

While there is daily activity, the Coast Guard reports weather and ice conditions are impacting the operations about 50 percent of the time and many days teams are not able to get aboard the vessel.\nThe 37,636 dwt containership blacked out on February 15 while approximately 12 nautical miles outside the entrance to Bay of Islands, Newfoundland. The crew was removed uninjured in a challenging operation involving a Canadian rescue helicopter while the vessel was driven ashore in a remote cove on the western side of the island.\nBased on the current conditions, Bruce English, Senior Response Officer, Marine Environmental and Hazards Response, for the Canadian Coast Guard, said their focus is not on speed but on minimizing the impact of the incident. He was unable to provide a timeline while speculating the operation would involve a combination of overland and a barge alongside first to remove the fuel oil and then the cargo.\n\n\nLose ice has clogged the remote cove where the vessel is located with temperatures and winds challenging the operation (Canadian Coast Guard)\n\nMSC Mediterranean Shipping Company as the operator of the vessel has appointed T&T Salvage and the Eastern Canada Response Corporation to develop the salvage plan and manage the environmental dangers. English reports those companies have brought in resources from around the world and are staging equipment on Newfoundland for the response. An ice class tug and barge arrived in Corner Brook carrying tanks some of which will be put onshore for eventual use as they remove the approximately 1.7 million liters of heavy fuel and marine gas oil onboard. The Coast Guard believes the majority of the required equipment is now onsite for the operation.\nAccessing the vessel from the shoreside with heavy equipment requires upgrades to a road into the area. The operation is in the final approval stages from Canada for the roadwork and English reports a draft plan showed that it would take approximately two weeks of work to make the road usable for the trucks and other equipment. Previously they had said the salvage operation might also build a walkway to the bow of the vessel to increase access.\nThe salvage teams have been aboard and they confirmed to the Canadian Coast Guard that the vessel has significant hull and structural damage although it is now resting solidly on the seabed. English said that they have been advised there is flooding in the three of the holds, the tanks, and the engine room. The vessel can not be safely refloated at this stage.\nWhen the operation can commence, the fuel oil in the tanks will need to be heated before it can be pumped off the ship. However, the salvage teams have determined the cranes aboard the ship are operational which will be helpful for the cargo operations.\nMSC in a statement reported that “we have secured the hazardous containers still aboard to avoid any risk of marine pollution and have a plan for their removal.” The Canadian Coast Guard said that MSC had informed it that two empty containers were damaged but posed no risks. The vessel has approximately 470 containers, over half of which are empty, aboard.\nUnder Canadian law, the vessel owner is responsible for the costs. The Canadian Coast Guard declined to speculate on the cost of the operation.",

Turkish authorities have not commented on the allision where the tanker was hit by a Turkish-owned containership, but it was captured on video which was broadcast on Turkish TV.\nThe tanker namedMia(149,686 dwt) was anchored approximately 5 miles offshore near Istanbul. The vessel’s ownership is considered to be murky with a company registered in the Seychelles listed as the owner, no known manager, and no inspections on file since 2014. The U.S. sanctioned the vessel in 2024 and cited it as being registered in Guyana. The authorities in Guyana however reported that it was a false flag as the ship has no ownership ties to the country which operates a closed registry. The U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control also places a strong likelihood the tanker also operated under the aliasesMagusandFreedom.\nThe videos show theOrita(8,000 dwt) striking the container ship as the vessel appears to be turning. It is a small container ship with a capacity of 672 TEU. It was built in 2005, registered in Panama, and managed by a Turkish company.

    "input": "The Canadian government today, March 7, marked the contract signing for a new polar icebreaker to be built at Seaspan Shipyard making official an order first announced in 2021. Under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the government is renewing the fleets of the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard including two heavy polar icebreakers providing the Canadian Coast Guard the ability to operate self-sufficiently year-round in the high Arctic down to temperatures at -50° C.\nThe contract ceremony was led by the Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, on behalf of the Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Quebec Lieutenant. The government of Canada reported the value of the contract at C$ 3.15 billion (before tax) (US$2.2 billion) with the vessel to be built at Seaspan’s Vancouver Shipyards in British Columbia.\n“The contract awarded to Seaspan's Vancouver Shipyards for the build of a new polar icebreaker underscores our dedication to ensuring safe and efficient navigation in Arctic regions,” said Wilkinson. “This state-of-the-art vessel will not only strengthen our icebreaking fleet, but will also support critical scientific research and environmental protection efforts, and ensure national security in the Arctic.\"\n\n\nJohn McCarthy, CEO of Seaspan, along with Minster Wilkinson at the contract ceremony (Seaspan)\n\nWith the contract now in place, Seaspan reports it is ready to cut steel on this ship and begin full-rate construction. It has scheduled the official start of construction for April 2025. The other polar icebreaker is being built by Chantier Davie Canada located in Quebec. That shipyard was awarded a contract valued at C$16.47 million (including taxes) (US$11.5 million) in September 2024 to advance work on a Polar-class icebreaker.\nSeaspan highlights it will mark the first time a  polar icebreaker has been built in Canada in more than 60 years.  Building the complex and densely-outfitted multi-mission ship they report represents a significant challenge for the shipbuilders and when completed the vessels will have more advanced capabilities than the Canadian Coast Guard’s current heavy icebreakers.\nThe polar icebreakers will be 158 meters (518 feet) with a design displacement of 26,00 tons. They will have more than 40 MW of power with an ice-class azimuthing propulsion system. Functional design of the polar icebreaker was completed in 2024 by Seaspan working alongside established Finnish companies who have extensive experience in designing Arctic-going vessels.\nCanada in November 2024 signed the ICE Pact Memorandum of Understanding with the United States and Finland to deepen existing cooperation, strengthen their shipbuilding industries, and allow new equipment and capabilities to be produced more quickly. The three countries committed to working more closely together to engage to help meet future global demand for Arctic and polar vessels.\nThe United States approved the contract for the construction of its first heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Sentinal, in December. It is the first of three heavy Polar icebreakers the U.S. ordered from VT Halter, which was later acquired by Bollinger. After long delays in the design phase, the U.S. expects to complete its first polar icebreaker in 2029.",

    "input": "South Africa Begins Safety Audits on its Commercial Fishing Fleet\nSouth Africa has launched nationwide safety inspections on all its commercial fishing vessels. Last week, the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) said that the audits are in response to a series of recent fatal fishing incidents. This saw eighteen fishermen lose their lives last year, leading to calls for higher safety standards in the fishing sector.\nThe safety inspections began last week at Port Elizabeth (Gqeberha) and will be conducted in the next four months, covering all other major fishing ports across South Africa. Specifically, the audit will focus on fishing vessels that have been involved in major maritime incidents. Other targeted fishing vessels include those built or registered before 1998.\n“The audits play a vital role in shaping a robust fishing vessel safety improvement plan, aimed at preventing future maritime incidents,” said SAMSA Acting CEO Mbalenhle Golding.\nSAMSA earlier reported that its rescue team had to deal with significantly higher numbers of maritime accidents in 2024 compared with previous years. Top on the list of incidents involved commercial fishing vessels. The most tragic was the sinking of the 63-year-old FVLepantoback in May, resulting in the deaths of 11 crewmembers. The vessel capsized around 34 nautical miles off the coast of Kommetjie town, near Cape Town.\nIncidentally, five months later, the sister vessel of FVLepanto, the 62-year old FVArmana, caught fire and sank off Cape Town. All the 20 crew members evacuated successfully. While the age of the South African commercial fishing fleet has been brought to question, there are apparent violations to safety and operational procedures, according to a preliminary report on the sinking of FVLepanto. The report released in December by SAMSA revealed the troubling state of maritime safety in South Africa.\nIn the case ofLepanto, investigators found glaring gaps in crew training on basic life-saving equipment. Survivors also confirmed that the accommodation doors on the port and starboard side were left open at the time of incident. These watertight doors are required to be closed at all times while the vessel is at sea.\nOther issues include modifications to the vessel without complying with stability calculations. For instance, wood decking had been replaced with concrete decking, which may not have been approved.",

The modernization and expansion program has been ongoing for the last three years, under a 30-year Build-Operate-Transfer concession signed in 2019 with the Saudi Ports Authority (Mawani).\nThe $800 million upgrade has seen the terminal’s capacity double from 1.8 million TEU to 4 million TEU. The capacity will further rise to 5 million TEU in a subsequent expansion phase.\nThe new terminal spans a total quay length of 2,150 meters, including a deep-water quay with an 18-meter depth, capable of accommodating up to five ultra-large container vessels simultaneously.\nIn response to the growing demand for perishable cargo, the terminal’s capacity for reefer containers has also been expanded from 1,200 to 2,340. In addition, DP World has developed a facility for inspecting up to 75 reefers at one time - the biggest such port-centric facility in Saudi Arabia.\nIn line with DP World’s carbon neutrality strategy, the new terminal features automated and electrified yard cranes. The operator said that the target is to reduce CO2 emissions at the terminal by 50 percent in the next five years. Other measures in the pipeline include floating solar platforms, electrified trucks and water recycling systems.\nDP World has been operating in Jeddah port since 1999. In fact, it was the first concession for the operator outside its UAE home base.\nWith Jeddah a crucial link for Saudi Arabia’s global trade, DP World is further investing in a large logistics park, adjacent to its South Container Terminal. The 415,000 square meter Jeddah Logistics Park is the largest integrated facility of its kind in Saudi Arabia. It will offer warehousing, distribution and freight forwarding services, further cementing Jeddah’s position as a key regional trade hub connecting Africa, Asia and Europe. The construction of the facility began last year in May and is expected to be completed by Q2 2026.\nThe launch of the Gemini Cooperation between Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd has come with liner connectivity advantages for Jeddah Port. Under Gemini, five new shipping services were added to three Saudi ports, including Jeddah, Dammam and Jubail. On top, Jeddah was selected as one of the regional hubs for the Gemini cooperation. The new shipping services connected the three Saudi ports to other international terminals, including Port Said in Egypt, Tangier in Morocco, Algeciras in Spain, Mundra and Pipavav in India.",

A disagreement between the port authority and the foundation that managesTexasled to uncertainty about the giant WWII warship's future, but it has been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties, and the battleship will soon move to its new home at Galveston's Pier 15.\nUSSTexasis the only surviving battleship that served during both world wars. Commissioned in 1914, she served on escort duty through WWI. During WWII, she saw action in both the Pacific and the Atlantic theaters, providing shore bombardment with her 14-inch guns during the landings in Morocco, Normandy, Iwo Jima and Okinawa - the most ambitious and costly amphibious operations of the war.\nUSSTexasretired after WWII, and she has been in the care of the State of Texas' Battleship Texas Commission since 1947. Like all older museum ships, she began to develop issues with leakage, and in 2022 she transited to the nearby Gulf Copper yard to begin a two-year comprehensive refit. Gulf Copper bought a larger (used) drydock to accommodateTexas, completed all below-the-waterline work, and successfully refloated the aging vessel.\nHowever,Texasdid not immediately have a place to go. Talks between the Battleship Texas Foundation and the board for Galveston Wharves (Port of Galveston) broke down in October, and the port authority called off negotiations. USSTexaswas originally slated to berth in the area of piers 19-21, but this would have put her on the busy and narrow shipping channel, raising a variety of concerns about safety of navigation and hurricane preparedness (related to storm surge concerns). Port director and CEO Rodger Rees told the Houston Chronicle that the conversation was \"not getting anywhere,\" so the board pulled the plug in late October.\nThe two sides resumed discussions in November, and eventually settled on nearby Pier 15. The site is an industrial wharf that has low utilization and does not figure prominently in port expansion plans, according to Galveston Wharves. It is still within walking distance of the port's busy cruise terminals, and the slip is located off the main channel.\n\"After years of hard work and dedication, we’re thrilled to have the support of the Wharves Board to bringTexasto Pier 15 in Galveston- just a short walk from Pier 21 and the historic Galveston Strand.Texas, the last ship of its kind, will promote tourism, educate future generations, and create a visitor experience worthy of her crew and legacy,\" said the Battleship Texas Foundation in a statement.",

The vessels were reported to be near Hull, England. Four lifeboats from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution were dispatched along with helicopters and assistance from commercial vessels in the area. One of the Windcat crew vessels supporting the offshore wind industry reportedly provided transportation to shore for some of the causalities.\nTheStena Immaculate(49,792 dwt) was reported to have been at anchor in the Immingham Anchorage having arrived from Greece. The vessel is operated by Crowley under the U.S. flag and owned by Stena Bulk. It is on a long-term charter as part of the U.S. Department of Defense Tanker Security Program. Stena told CNN that the 20 crewmembers from the vessel have been accounted for and are safe.\nCrowley issued a statement confirming that all of its crewmembers are safe and reported the Stena Immaculate was loaded with Jet A-1 fuel. The vessel suffered a ruptured cargo tank causing the fuel to be released. They said there were multiple explosions and that the vessel was abandoned.\nThe tanker was struck by the Portuguese-flagged containershipSolong, which is managed from Germany. The vessel is 9,300 dwt and 461 feet in length (141 meters) with a capacity of approximately 800 TEU. The vessel was sailing from Scotland to Rotterdam.

Vandroff has been at the helm at Fincantieri Marinette Marine since July 2021, and has overseen the yard throughout the maturation process for the Constellation-class frigate program, which began under Allman's leadership.\n\"I want to thank Mark for his exceptional leadership at FMM, and I look forward to working with him as we navigate our company's many opportunities with government stakeholders in Washington,\" said Marco Galbiati, CEO of Fincantieri Marine Group, in a statement. \"And I want to welcome Jan back to Marinette, where she spent many years overseeing the successful production of Freedom-class LCSs and the start of the frigate program.\"\nThe leadership change comes at a pivotal moment for the shipbuilder. Fincantieri Marinette Marine is currently completing the long-awaited detailed design of the lead ship for the Constellation-class frigate, with construction expected to begin later this spring. The first ship is scheduled for delivery in 2029, and the company has secured contracts for five additional frigates, ensuring continued shipbuilding operations in Marinette for at least the next decade.\nFincantieri Marine Group has three shipyards in the Great Lakes region and employs nearly 3,000 people, making it one of Northeast Wisconsin's largest employers. The company is a subsidiary of Italian shipbuilding conglomerate Fincantieri, which specializes in complex naval, cruise and offshore shipbuilding.",

    "input": "\nAt the beginning of the year, the IRGC Navy (Nedsa) announced that it would hold a series of major exercises in January, to be concluded by the Nedsa's \"largest ever fleet review\" on January 27.\nNothing quite fitting this description appears to have occurred, but Iran’s other naval force, the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy (Nedaja) assembled a substantial sail-past of ships at the conclusion of the naval element of Exercise Zulfiqar 1403 on February 26.The presence of ships on this fleet review is of some interest, at a time when the new US administration has warned that it could commence stop and searches of tankers in international waters believed to be carrying sanctioned Iranian oil. At a time when the Nedaja is limiting its press releases revealing the make–up and location of its operationally-deployed assets which could be tasked to protect such tankers, it is of interest to note which ships remain in home waters.\nThe Nedaja has not released the names of vessels seen on February 26 off Bandar Abbas, but it is possible to identify more than ten that were involved. Often, Iranian media sources splice in video from previous exercises to bulk up the assets on display, but in this instance the choppy sea state and meteorological conditions common to all the imagery released provide some veracity.\nThe Alvand and Moudge Class frigates IRINSAlvand(F71) and IRINSJamaran(F76) led the fleet, followed by IRINSBayandor(F81). Two submarines were spotted:  IRINSFateh(S920) and an unidentified Ghadir Class midget submarine struggling in the heavy swell. Kaman and Sina Class fast attack craft IRINSNeyzeh(P231) and IRINSZereh(P235) were also suffering in the swell, and in separate footage the Kaivan Class patrol boat IRINSTiran(P202), first launched in USCG’s Curtis Bay (MD) yard in 1957, was seen launching a 35km-range Nasr anti-ship missile, developed from the Chinese C-704.\nNumbers were made up by IRINSSirjan(K472) and a second unidentified Delvar Class logistics vessel, and by the Hendijan Class auxiliary IRINSBahregan(A1406).  The largest vessel in the Nedaja, the converted tanker IRINSMakran(K441) was not featured in the sail-past but could be seen in the background.\nKnown to be out on deployment at the moment are the Nedaja’s 100th Flotilla, made up of IRINSBushehr(K422) and IRINSLavan(L514), on the annual winter training cruise with 220 naval cadets aboard. The flotilla was due to leave Mumbai on February 28.\nThe Nedaja had announced last November that the 100th Flotilla was heading to the Red Sea to rotate into the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden security mission. With the 100th Flotilla clearly elsewhere, it is not clear when the 99th Flotilla led by IRINSDena(F75) left the Red Sea, as there was no normal homecoming announcement, but IRINSDenawas spotted in Port Klang, Malaysia on February 24.\nRear Admiral Shahram Irani, the Nedaja commander, had indicated to Press TV in February that there were a further two unaccounted-for flotillas currently deployed in the Indian Ocean.  It appears therefore that the Nedaja is maintaining a high level of operational deployments at present, which - given the obsolescent status of most of its fleet - is an impressive maintenance and manning achievement. Given the security situation in the region at present, it will need to be sustained.\nThe Iranians usually conduct Exercise Maritime Security Belt with the Chinese and Russian navies in mid-March, and the suspected Russian contingent appears to still be on track to make the date. The Steregushchiy Class Project 20380 missile corvettesHero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov(F339) andRezkiy(F343) and the oilerPechenga(IMO 7710977) were on March 3 conducting a live firing exercise in the Eastern Indian Ocean.",

The Canal Authority is reporting it was a carefully planned, complex operation to bring the heavily damaged vessel through the canal on its way to Greece.\nOffloading of the 150,000 tons of crude aboard the tanker was completed in December 2024 after nearly a month-long operation managed by Ambrey and Mega Tugs. The tanker run by Greece’s Delta Tankers was northbound in the Red Sea when it was struck in August and disabled. After the crew abandoned the tanker, the Houthis went aboard and set off multiple explosions starting oil fires and destroying the bridge in addition to the previous flooding and damage to the engine room.\nThe Suez Canal Authority reports it oversaw the offloading operation after the vessel was towed into the port south of the canal. The Authority’s pollution control vesselKasht2 was positioned nearby during the offloading while the operation was monitored by teams in case of pollution.\n\n\nBridge and control systems were destroyed by the Houthis (SCA)\n\nPlanning for the transit took weeks according to Lieutenant General Osama Rabie, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority. He highlights that the 274-meter (899-foot) tanker has no steering control and was a challenge as a large dead ship tow.\nThe tanker was being towed by theAigaion Pelagos, a large anchor handler operated by Megatugs of Greece. The Suez Canal Authority assigned its largest tug,Baraka, along with theMohamed Bashir,Suez 1, andSuez 2to the transit. Tug Suez 2 was attached at the stern to act as a rudder to help guide the tanker.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transit began Saturday, March 8, and took approximately 24 hours. They initially positioned the dead ship to enter the Suez Canal and then conducted the transit in stages. They paused in Great Bitter Lake while the southbound convoy passed. It continued in stages pausing for crew changes. In total 13 pilots were used to guide theSounion.\nThe tow operation reached the northern terminus of the canal on March 10.

    "input": "\nThe Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) has unveiled its latest wreck find: the remains of the steamerWestern Reserve,which went down 132 years ago in Lake Superior.\nWestern Reservewas a historically significant ship. She entered service in 1890 and was among the earliest lakers ever built out of steel plate. Her novel design allowed her to carry heavier loads at higher speeds than competing wooden-hulled vessels.\nOn August 30, 1892,Western Reservewas under way on a ballast voyage to the port of Two Harbors to take on a load of iron ore. She had 32 crewmembers and passengers on board, including shipowner Capt. Peter Minch, his wife, his two children, his sister-in-law and her daughter.\nWhen they reached Whitefish Bay, rough weather picked up and the captain ordered the anchor dropped to wait for calmer conditions. When the winds died down, they heaved anchor and headed out into Lake Superior. At 2100 hours that night, they were hit by a squall and the ship - which was just one and a half years old - began to break up.\nThe crew launched two lifeboats, and all got away. However, one of the lifeboats capsized as soon as the crew boarded, leaving just one boat afloat as the ship slipped below. Two crewmen from the lost lifeboat were pulled from the water by the survivors.\nThe second boat nearly made it to safety twice. A steamer passed in the night, but did not see the survivors. At about 0730 hours the next morning, the boat approached the Upper Peninsula's shores near the Deer Park Life-Saving station. The boat flipped in the surf, sending the shipowner, his family and the surviving crewmembers into the water.\nThe sole survivor, wheelman Harry Stewart, managed to make it to shore on an uninhabited beach. After making it to safety, he told investigators that theWestern Reservehad begun to break apart in heavy seas; further inquiries revealed that the shipbuilder had used contaminated, brittle steel for the vessel's construction, leaving it vulnerable to cracking from metal fatigue. The sinking led to stronger standards for steel plate in U.S. vessel construction.\nIn late summer 2024, the GLSHS' research vesselDavid Boyddiscovered the wreck site on sidescan sonar, right at the edge of detection range. A follow-up deployment with an ROV confirmed the identity of the wreck.\nThe survey revealed that the wreck had broken in half, and the stern section landed first in 600 feet of water. The bow section came down on top of the stern.\n\"Knowing how the 300-footWestern Reservewas caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" said GLSHS director of marine operations Darryl Ertel.",

After launching an independent terminal company in 2023, Hapag-Lloyd reports it has acquired a controlling interest in one of the independent terminals in Le Havre, France.\nHanseatic Global Terminals, a wholly owned subsidiary based in Rotterdam, was announced in July 2024. Hapag said at the time the aim was to increase operational efficiency and promote sustainable growth that will benefit customers and partners worldwide. It says that terminal and infrastructure investments represent a crucial component of the strategic agenda for Hanseatic Global Terminals.\nThe company acquired 60 percent of the shares of CNMP LH from Seafrigo Group, a company specializing in temperature-controlled food logistics. Seafrigo will continue to hold a 40 percent stake in the terminal operator.\n“By acquiring a majority stake in the CNMP LH terminal in Le Havre, we are strengthening our position in one of our core European markets,” said Dheeraj Bhatia, CEO of Hanseatic Global Terminals (HGT). “At the same time, we are continuing to expand our global terminal portfolio while paving the way for targeted investments to enhance efficiency.”\n“This will significantly raise the profile of our joint terminal as an important gateway for container transports in the Port of Le Havre,” said Eric Barbé, President of Seafrigo Group. The companies projected that the container throughput of the CNMP LH terminal is expected to grow in the coming years – including in the attractive reefer container business.\nCNMP (Compagnie Nouvelle de Manutentions Portuaires) highlights that it is a historical stevedoringcompany operating in Le Havre since 1920. It has a multimodal terminal with river barge access and 1 km (.6 miles) of rail connection. It is an independent service provider to multiple carriers calling at the port.\nLe Havre, the companies emphasized numbers among the 10 largest ports in Europe. They called it the most important port for sea transport to and from France reporting it has an annual container throughput of 3 million TEU and offers hinterland connections to Paris.\nHapag called it a strategic acquisition for Hanseatic Global Terminals in keeping with its strategy of expansion. HGT manages a portfolio of stakes in 21 port terminals and complementary logistics services across 12 countries and four continents, with plans to expand its stakes to over 30 terminals by 2030.",

    "input": "Energy service company and tanker operator AET provided details on its planned conversion of one of its support vessels to create a hybrid electric vessel with the world’s longest range. Based in Galveston, Texas, and a division of Malaysia’s MISC, the company reports one of its existing purpose-built Lightering Support Vessels has been selected for the hybrid conversion project.\nThe company operates a fleet of these vessels reporting it performed more than 15,500 STS transfers making it a market leader in the U.S. Gulf region. It also provides lightering operations in offshore Uruguay and the Brazilian Basin.\nAET has signed an agreement with marine battery company Fleetzero for the hybrid power project. Under the agreement, one of AET's Lightering Support Vessels (LSV) will be retrofitted with a plug-in hybrid-electric system. The Lightering Support vessels are used to transport equipment and crew to conduct ship-to-ship cargo transfer operations.\n“By integrating plug-in hybrid electric solutions into our fleet, we are transforming ambition into action to deliver more energy with less emissions,” commented Zahid Osman, President & Group CEO of MISC Group. “This pilot project also allows us to evaluate the feasibility and operational performance of this technology, paving the way for potential deployment across AET’s and potentially MISC’s fleet.”\nAfter the conversion project, the vessel will operate primarily on battery power, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 82 percent according to the companies when compared to conventional LSVs on a tank-to-wake basis. They estimated it will help the vessel to avoid 1,220 tonnes of greenhouse gases per year and significantly reduce fuel consumption and maintenance costs.\nFleetzero, a start-up focusing on marine battery applications reports its products are designed by mariners and engineers from the world’s best automotive EV companies, the company’s Leviathan solution incorporates the best automotive EV technology but is fundamentally built for the unique challenges and requirements at sea. Its battery storage solutions are modular to provide a scalable power range between 200 kWh to hundreds of Megawatt-hours of energy storage. They are designed and tested in accordance with ABS, DNV, RINA, Lloyds, and ClassNK rules.\nThe base agreement for the project was signed in December 2024 with the companies reporting more details will be released in the near future.\nFleetzero in March 2024 reported it had received a strategic investment from MOL Plus, the venture capital operation of Mitsui O.S. K. Lines. The companies reported they would be exploring the application of the battery system on MOL’s vessels.",

    "input": "\nThe government of Canada confirmed the order for the second of its planned large polar icebreakers with Quebec’s Chantier Davie. The contract for the other large polar icebreaker was confirmed with Seaspan in Vancouver with both vessels being part of the country’s National Shipbuilding Strategy.\nDavie has been contributing to the program for the two icebreakers which were first announced in May 2021, including a contract last fall for design work. Chantier Davie has already played a critical role in supporting Canada’s fleets, receiving over C$2.8 billion (US$1.9 billion) in contracts from 2012 to 2023 for various types of work on ships for the Canadian Coast Guard, the Royal Canadian Navy, and Transport Canada. The orders for the icebreakers come as the National Shipbuilding Strategy is marking its 15th anniversary and government officials highlighting it has contributed to Canadian shipyards delivering eight large vessels and 34 small vessels to the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard while supporting federal fleets with critical repair, refit, and maintenance work.\nDavie reports work will begin in 2025 on its icebreaker project which it values at C$3.25 billion (before tax) (US$2.25 billion). Delivery on the design they are calling Polar Max to Canada by 2030. On Friday, March 7, the government of Canada reported the value of the contract at C$3.15 billion (before tax) (US$2.2 billion) for asimilar vesselto be built at Seaspan’s Vancouver Shipyards in British Columbia.\n\n\n\n“The contract awarded to Chantier Davie Canada for the build of a new polar icebreaker underscores our dedication to ensuring safe and efficient navigation in Arctic regions,” said Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Quebec Lieutenant. “This state-of-the-art vessel will not only strengthen our icebreaking fleet, but will also support critical scientific research and environmental protection efforts, and ensure national security in the Arctic.”\nDavie reports it will be the first vessel built under the trilateral partnership announced in November 2024 between Canada, Finland, and the United States. Davie acquired Helsinki Shipyard in 2023 and it will provide support to the project. They note that Helsinki Shipyard has built more than half of the world’s icebreakers. Davie reports it plans to implement a workforce exchange, enabling Québec employees to learn world-class icebreaker construction expertise first-hand from their Finnish colleagues.\nWhile the early phase of the polar icebreaker construction is underway, Davie reports modernization of its Lévis Shipyard will continue, giving it time to accelerate the hiring of skilled workers across all trades. According to the company, this will enable it to leverage its Canadian supply chain sooner than anticipated, while ensuring the completed polar icebreaker is delivered from Lévis.\nThe Canadian Coast Guard currently has 18 icebreakers of varying sizes and capabilities, making it the second-largest icebreaking fleet in the world. Canadian officials said these larger, more powerful polar icebreakers will ensure the Coast Guard’s operations continue at higher latitudes for longer periods while allowing it to strengthen Arctic security, advance high Arctic science, and better respond to maritime emergencies.",

It would also benefit the port by providing lower-cost electricity, according to ABP.\nThe panels will be mounted at a fixed angle on floating pontoons, which will be anchored to the bottom of the dock. The array of 47,000 panels would cover about a third of the entire surface area, leaving the remainder open for leisure usage - notably shoreside and pierside fishing. ABP notes that using the water area for power generation also leaves land free and unencumbered for future port development. All going well, the project could be completed in as little as 9-12 months after planning approval is received.\nABP carried out wildlife surveys and assessments to ensure that the array would have no significant impacts, and it held two public planning meetings to solicit input from residents.\nThe port company has bigger plans for Barrow's long-term expansion, to include new infrastructure to support offshore wind operations and a new jetty.",

    "input": "\nThe governments of South Korea and Japan plan to use maritime trade as a bargaining chip to avoid the unfortunate fates of Canada and Mexico, the first two U.S. allies hit by the White House's tariff proposals. Both Japan and South Korea have shown interest in a big-ticket LNG export project from the state of Alaska, and Korea is also pitching its shipbuilding capabilities as a way to build up American maritime power.\nSouth Korea's trade and industry minister, Ahn Duk-Geun, met last week with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to talk about cooperation on shipbuilding and tech industry development. As an outcome of the discussion, Ahn's office said that Korea will be setting up a shipbuilding cooperation task force drawing on multiple government agencies, including foreign affairs and defense. The U.S. Department of Commerce will set up a similar working group.\nAhn told Korean media that the Trump administration is interested in accessing South Korea's sophisticated naval shipbuilding capabilities. The U.S. Navy is struggling to overcome cost and schedule issues with almost all of its major shipbuilding programs, in part because of supply chain and labor recruitment issues; South Korea has the world's second-biggest shipbuilding industrial base, and though it has labor issues of its own, it does have a much larger pool of skilled tradesmen to draw upon. One of its yards, Hyundai Heavy Industries, has built Aegis-equipped destroyers.\nAccording to Business Korea, Ahn offered priority access to newbuild slots at Korean shipyards for package orders of warships, tankers and icebreakers - in return for guaranteed safety from U.S. tariffs. Those slots are hard to come by, as the orderbooks at Korea's Big Three yards are booked through 2027-8 in a hot commercial newbuild market.\n\"At this point we don’t know how the Trump administration will play out its trade policies in the long term. So what’s most urgent now is to secure a communication channel and keep negotiating in favor of our firms,\" Ahn said.\nThe other big offer on the table is the prospect of Asian investment in the long-stalled Alaska LNG project, a proposed pipeline and export terminal that would commercialize vast quantities of natural gas from the remote North Slope. The terminal near Anchorage would liquefy up to 20 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG for export, but at an eye-watering construction cost of $44 billion.\n\"Currently, our country's energy supply is heavily skewed towards the Middle East, and imports of U.S. energy are important for energy security, so we are actively reviewing this,\" Ahn said. \"We are also considering ways for private businesses to diversify energy import channels.\"\nJapan is also in the running for a role in Alaska LNG, which had been all but defunct until the new flurry of diplomatic activity. In February, President Donald Trump described an agreement with Japan to offtake \"historic\" amounts of gas from the as-yet-unbuilt terminal.\n\"The administration is working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investment of trillions of dollars each,\" President Donald Trump said in his recent joint session address.",

Officials are warning even after the three-day strike there are expected to be lasting repercussions and delays.\nA vital waterway for short sea and feeder shipping in the Baltic region, the Kiel Canal was due to close Monday evening, March 10, and will remain closed through the day shift on Thursday, March 13. Ships have been ordered to clear the canal with no new shipping being permitted to enter the canal for most of the day on Monday to provide time for ships to clear the waterway. The gates at both ends of the canal were due to be closed by 2200 Monday evening.\n“Nothing will be moving,” warned a spokesperson for Ver.di. “No ships will be able to go in or out.” In addition, the spokesperson said, “Ver.di has called on the employees of the Waterways and Shipping Office to go on a warning strike so that the federal government can also feel the effects.”\nThe so-called warning strike is a short-term, limited action by the union under German law. It is done to call attention to their cause which in this case is contract negotiations for public service employees. Announcing the strike, the union lamented that offers had not been put forth ahead of the negotiations. The next round of contract talks is scheduled for March 14-16.\nThe union says wants the terms of the new contract to help to increase the attractiveness of jobs in the public sector, combat staff shortages and reduce the burden on employees. Ver.di is demanding a pay increase of eight percent in total, but at least 350 euros per month. They are also demanding higher bonuses for stressful shift work, three additional days off, and a new type of \"my time account\" to give employees more time independence.\nThe new round of strikes began over the weekend with reports that all 13 of the country’s major airports would be going on strike. The Hamburg Airport is reported to have already closed as of Sunday during an unannounced strike.\nVer.di is calling for theatres, daycare centers, and public swimming pools to close, garbage collection to be suspended, and most municipal services to be halted. The scope of the strike is set to increase daily.\nThe Kiel Canal calls itself “the world’s most frequented artificial waterway.” It provides a direct route between the North Sea and the Baltic, reducing the trip by 260 nautical miles which equates to saving 14 to 18 hours of transit time. The canal is approximately 50 nautical miles and takes six to eight hours to transit. Ships will either have to wait for it to reopen or make the trip around Denmark in the congested sea lanes.\n“After reopening, major delays should be expected for all west- and eastbound traffic heading towards the Kiel Canal. The period of congestion cannot be predicted, as it will depend on the volume of ships waiting to transit,” ship agency and logistics company GAC Group warned customers in an alert.\nThe local branch of Ver.di is calling on employees at the Port of Hamburg to join this week’s action. The port is already warning of anticipated delays noting that one in three containers handled in Hamburg passes through the canal.",

Tug boats are in the vicinity to ensure theSolongremains away from the coast and to respond as the situation develops.\"\nAt 2320 last night local time the Coastguard reports theSolongseparated from theStena Immaculateand began to drift southwards. The Stena vessel was anchored approximately 10 miles off the coast near Hull, England, and remains there while the Coast Guard continues to track theSolong. Daylight images today show multiple fireboats near the containership spraying the fire.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the owners of the vessel Ernst Russ is now denying the reports of dangerous chemicals in some of the containers. “We are able to confirm that there are no containers on board ladened with sodium cyanide...,” they stated. “There are four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical and these containers will continue to be monitored.”\nImages of theStena Immaculateshow the large fire is extinguished. Experts said they are remaining cautious however that there might still be fire below deck and they would be monitoring the vessel. Boskalis confirmed Dutch media reports that it has been retained to oversee the salvage operation for the tanker. The company said the timeline was unclear but that resources were already traveling to the ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coastguard also clarified previous reports saying that the 36 crewmembers were ashore and none were in hospitals. They said one was treated after coming ashore and declined further medical assistance. One crewmember from theSolongremains missing after the search was called off on Monday.\n“We also recognize the dangers that others are faced with as they work to stabilize and secure the vessels and cargos involved,” Ernst Russ said in its statement. “Our team is actively engaged with all local authorities, and we will work with clean-up teams to ensure every effort is made to mitigate further impacts on the marine environment.”\nThe Coastguard reports teams are working with ship owners, salvors, and insurance companies.

Reports said there are internal discussions as to which country will lead the investigation although the MAIB is reported to already be in the area gathering information and possible evidence.Further updates on the situation were expected later in the day from HM Coastguard.",

A South Korean weapons expert, Moon Keun-Sik, told AP that it appears to be twice as large as previous North Korean subs and may have capacity for up to 10 missiles.

Pyongyang has a smaller 2,000-tonne converted attack sub that it uses for testing sub-launched ballistic missiles, one at a time. It also has unveiled a conventionally-powered ballistic missile submarine, the Pukguksong-5, which has been panned by Western and South Korean analysts.\nThe North has nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, but it was not publicly known to possess a functioning naval reactor until last weekend's announcement. To some, the rapid development suggests that Russia may have had a hand. In 2023, Kim Jong-un made a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to supply Russia with artillery ammunition and soldiers; only the North Korean side of the deal has been visible to the public so far, in the form of its footprint on the battlefield in Ukraine. Exactly what Kim received in return is as-yet unknown to the public. Whatever that reward may be, the sub's construction started sometime before the deal with Russia was reached and could have incorporated some amount of Russian input, defense expert Yang Uk of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies told Korea Times.\n“The released photos suggest that the submarine has been under construction for more than two years. North Korea may have received technology from Russia in the latter half of 2023, while supplying artillery shells and missiles in return to aid Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Yang said.",

It was a part of the regular NATO efforts in the region where activity by Russians has been watched more intently this year as more ships were entering the Mediterranean as the political situation in Syria unfolded.\nThe Spanish frigateÁlvaro de Bazán(5,800 tons displacement) part of the F-100 class was assigned the monitoring operation. It operates as part of Standing NATO Task Force No. 2 (SNMG2). NATO maintains two escort groups (SNMG) and two minesweeping groups (SNMCMG) responsible for the waters ranging from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Northern Flank, and the Southern Corridor (from the Strait of Hormuz to the Suez Canal), including the coasts of Somalia.\nFew details were released on the monitoring, but the Spanish Navy identified the submarine asKrasnodar, of the KILO II class. The subs are diesel-electric attack submarines built in 1980 and operated by the Soviet Union. The Spanish only said that it was “in the waters of the Eastern Mediterranean.”\nThe submarine was traveling with the Russian tugboatEvgeniy Churov. According to the report, it accompanied the submarine on its way to the port of Alexandria, Egypt. The monitoring of the merchant vessel ended when the Russian vessels separated and each took a different course.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Bazán tracked the Russian vessels (Spanish Navy)\n\nEuropean Security & Defense reported in February that the sub and the tug had been observed off Portugal after having made their way from Northern Europe and the Baltic. The Royal Danish Navy tracked the vessels at the beginning of February as they transited west.\nAccording to the report, the Krasnodar and another Russian submarineNovorossiyskwere both based in the Black Sea until 2022. TheNovorossiyskwas seen at the end of the year leaving the Mediterranean so if theKrasnodarremains in the Mediterranean, the news outlet said Russia would be restoring its presence in the region.\nNATO and the West have been closely watching the Russian retreat from Syria and the steady stream of vessels moving into and out of the Tartus naval base. European Security & Defensespeculateson possible new bases of operation for the submarine.\nSpain highlights the tracking was part of its ongoing solidarity with the other NATO member countries, thereby supporting deterrence and collective defense at and from the sea.",

The cutoff of aid affects Gazans at a population level, as the destruction of the territory has left hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs dependent on humanitarianassistancefor survival.\nLast weekend, Israel cut off electricity supplies to Gaza's sole desalination plant at Deir el-Balah, which supplies water to about 600,000 displaced people. The plant has recourse to generators and to solar power, but the loss of a utility grid connection makes its future (and the local water supply) more tenuous. A spokesman for the terror group Hamas accused Israel of committing \"collective punishment and a full-fledged war crime\" by withholding food, water and electricity.\nYemen's Houthi rebel faction - backed by Iran - agreed to cease its attacks on shipping in the Red Sea in January when Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement. Given the recent breakdown in the ceasefire arrangement, the Houthis warned Friday that attacks in the Red Sea could resume imminently if Israel does not restore access for food trucks in Gaza.\nHouthi militants have been attempting to rearm after more than a year of constant engagement with U.S. forces in the Red Sea, and have sought to supplement Iranian-supplied weaponry with a new Russian government supply relationship. Russia, which has been working to renew its diplomatic ties with the United States, has reportedly been in talks to provide the Houthis with the P-800 Oniks supersonic antiship missile - a munition that Soviet ngineers designed to attack U.S. Navy destroyers, like the ones that engage with Houthi forces in the Red Sea.",

    "input": "\nAn innovative project to develop a shipboard ammonia-cracking technology took a key step forward toward the vision of building a zero-emission dry bulk carrier for the copper industry. Class societies ABS and DNV working with Norway-based Pherousa Shipping and technology company Metacon have issued design Approval in Principle reporting they found “no show stopper conditions” to employing the innovative technology.\nAmmonia continues to draw interest with systems in development but so far it has required carbon fuel primers to start ignition and presents the challenges of lower energy density versus traditional fuels. Hydrogen similarly shows potential as a power source but so far has been limited to small near-shore support vessels and inland shipping.\n“The Approval in Principle from two of the leading classification societies and certification bodies, ABS and DNV, marks another important milestone for us in the development of zero-emission solutions for the maritime industry,” said Hans Bredrup, Chairman of Pherousa. “By granting Pherousa these AiPs, both ABS and DNV clearly state that there are no showstoppers of the Pherousa technology for marine application.”\nPherousa’s concept working with an exclusive license agreement from Metacon for the application of the technology onboard ships focuses on developing ammonia cracking, the release of hydrogen energy from ammonia as a carrier, at scale to power larger vessels. The ammonia cracking technology would be used with PEM Fuel Cells and a Fuel Gas Supply System generating a fully electrical propulsion plant.\n“Ammonia cracking combined with a PEM Fuel Cell has no need for pilot fuel or other fossil sources,” explains Morten Løvstad, VP and Global Business Director for Bulk Carriers at DNV. He called it, “an innovative solution for maritime application towards full decarbonization.”\nPherousa reports that Ammonia Cracking can be applied to a variety of developed technologies, such as supplying Hydrogen to PEM Fuel Cells, replacing conventional fuels with Hydrogen as pilot fuel on Ammonia fueled Internal Combustion Engines, or supplying Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engines. It could also be used for supplying Hydrogen to Auxiliary Engines to reduce emissions. According to the company, any of the four alternatives can be fitted onboard any type of vessel and with an engine power of up to 15-20 MW.\n“The efficiency of ammonia cracking will play a decisive factor in its ability to contribute to decarbonization of the industry,” predicts Stergios Stamopoulos, Director, Global Sustainability forAmerican Bureau of Shipping (ABS).\nPherousa and Metacon report that have conducted thorough research and tests to develop the Ammonia Cracking technology concept. The companies have delivered a working prototype that demonstrated the practical potential of this approach.\nThe Pherousa subsidiary, Pherousa Shipping, reports it has worked closely with two major copper miners during the design process of an Ultramax 64.000 dwt vessel, to find the optimal layout for emission-free transportation of copper concentrates between its origin and the smelters. The vessels are intended to be on water in parallel with the new IMO regulative that comes into force in 2030.\nThey are focusing on the copper industry because the commodity is essential for emerging markets linked to decarbonization. They believe end-users of copper utilized for solar panels or electric cars will seek to build a carbon-free supply chain including shipping.\nHaving achieved the design reviews from ABS and DNV, Pherousa reports it is now transitioning from concept to scale-up and market entry. It looks to deploy its innovative solution on a global scale.",

While it remains most petty crime, robberies, the caution continues because the perpetrators appear to have become more brazen, and far more of the reports indicate the perpetrators are carrying guns or knives versus past years.\nAfter incidents in which a seafarer was injured and required a medical evacuation and others were tied up, the most recent did not include any direct interaction between the crew and the boarders. Security consultant Ambrey is advising crews not to confront the perpetrators.\nThe most recent incident overnight between yesterday, March 10 and today took place aboard a tanker flagged in Panama. The crew reported it saw seven boarders while the vessel was underway near the Phillip Channel. Near the western connection of the Malacca and Singapore Strait, it has become a frequent spot for activity this year.  The report says the boarders appeared to be carrying guns.\nThe monitoring operation ReCAAP had issued its weekly update yesterday, March 10 reporting one further incident that took place near the eastern side of the Singapore Strait. A tug pulling a barge, accompanied by a second tug, reported seeing three people on the barge. Again, it appeared to be a case of armed robbery with scrap metal being stolen while the vessels were underway.\nSince the first of the year, ReCAAP shows that it has received a total of 26 reports across the entire Southeast Asia region. However, on Monday, it said 23 of the 26 incidents reported since January were in the Strait of Malacca or Singapore Strait region. This compares with just six reported incidents in the first two months of 2024.\nReCAAP has been calling for the regional states to be more responsive and increase their patrols along the straits. They have also called for faster response times and increased efforts to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators.\nAmbrey is advising crews transiting the region to lock down their vessels. They emphasize closing off access to the accommodation block and stores. Most of the incidents have involved the boarders stealing stores or lose tools from the engine room areas.\nMost of the cases do not include a confrontation between the crew and the robbers. Ambrey advises crews should carry out partnered deck patrols to increase safety. When they are discovered, most time, the boarders grab what they can and quickly leave the ships. The incidents have also come in clusters suggesting that when the groups enter the channels they prey on multiple ships over a short period of time.",

It holds contracts for an array of smaller auxiliary vessels, along with a large-scale subcontract award for module construction to support General Dynamics Electric Boat's submarine projects.\nOn Tuesday, Austal announced that it plans to place about 53 million new shares with institutional investors at a price of US$2.40 per share, a discount of about 15 percent compared to the company's last closing price. The funds will go towards construction of the US$300 million Final Assembly 2 complex, which began construction last July and is due for completion in 2026. The infrastructure project is located just south of Austal's current complex, and will include a new assembly hall, a wharf and a new shiplift, which will make it easier for the company to launch newbuilds. The bay will be used for building large modules for the Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter program and for the Navy's T-AGOS-25 research/surveillance vessels.\nWith the addition of a shiplift, Austal will also have the capability to bring vessels back onshore for maintenance in addition to its newbuild work.\nAustal requested a brief trading halt Tuesday morning pending the announcement. \"This announced raise will ensure that Austal is appropriately funded for FA2, which one complete, will facilitate the delivery of large steel vessels in the current pipeline for the US Navy and ensure Mobile continues to be well placed to execute on future opportunities,\" said Austal CEO Patrick Gregg in a statement.\nAustal is widely expected to be a top contender to build additional Constellation-class frigates (alongside Fincantieri Marinette Marine), once the design has stabilized and production of the first hull has gotten under way. It is also well-situated to compete for mid- and large-sized unmanned vessel orders.\n“The long-term investment made in developing deep defence relationships in the United States and Australia, founded on product innovation, technology and demonstrated shipbuilding and support capabilities, is starting to deliver increased returns,\" Gregg said in an earnings statement in February.",

Russian shipping experts have questioned the fleet's suitability for open-water service in Black Sea winter weather, given that most of these sister ships are over 50 years old, and their design was never intended for rough surface conditions.On December 15,Volgoneft-212broke in half and sank in a severe storm about five nautical miles outside of the Kerch Strait. Waves in excess of 25 feet were forecast by Russia's meteorological agency in advance of the sinking, and the effects were enough to snap the aging tanker in half. The tanker was carrying about 4,300 tonnes of mazut, a Russian residual fuel oil produced from low-quality feedstocks. The tanker Volgoneft-239 broke up and grounded near Taman shortly after, spilling a similar load of mazut.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Morspas\nThe cleanup effort for the wreck site of Volgoneft-239 took until the end of January, and it incurred significant costs. A response team led by Russian salvage agency Morspasluzhba (Morspas) built an earthen dike around the perimeter of the wreck, protecting it from wave action and creating a sheltered space for pollution abatement work to proceed. The oil was heated, pumped out and driven off by the truckload.\nMorspas has sued Volgatransneft - the owner of theVolgoneft-239- to recover the full cost of the cleanup, and the case is proceeding at an arbitration court in Krasnodar. Volgatransneft petitioned to have the lawsuit transferred to a court in Moscow, but Morspas objected, and the court refused the request. The hearings will begin in early April; the amount of the claim has yet to be fully calculated.\nThe same court has already fined Volgatransneft a minor penalty of $3,500 for alleged technical violations in connection withVolgoneft-239'ssinking.\nCourtesy City of Anapa\nSeparately, the city of Anapa has filed a claim of $2.4 million against Volgatransneft and Kama Shipping - the owner of theVolgoneft-212- to recover the costs for the beach cleanup that followed the spills. The city administration plans to increase the claim when extra cleanup costs occur, as more washed-up waste is expected for years to come.\nExperts consulted by Forbes put the estimated environmental damage from the spills at about $300 million. The tankers are insured for a maximum of about $30 million for pollution compensation, according to Alexei Kurinny, a Communist Party MP.\nThe lost vessels were part of aflotillathat provides bunkers for Russia's \"dark fleet\" near Novorossiysk, and helped transfer fuel oil to at least three U.S.-sanctioned tankers, according to Russian investigative news outlet IStories.\nRussia’s Ministry of Transport has confirmed that the fuel oil aboard the tankers belonged to Rosneft, Russia's giant state oil company, which posted a profit of $14 billion in 2023.",

    "input": "The situation surrounding yesterday’s North Sea incident continues to rapidly evolve with reports from the police in the UK that one seafarer has now been detained and arrested. The police said the unidentified individual was in custody while they continued the investigation.\n“Following enquiries undertaken by my team, we have arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision, this follows the conclusion of search operations by HM Coastguard for the missing crew member of theSolong,” said Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson. They did not announce the position of the individual or which vessel he was from but the BBC is reporting that it is the master of theSolong.\nThe charges were set as manslaughter after HM Coastguard reported late on Monday that a search for one missing seafarer from theSolonghad ended. Earlier today, the UK’s Minister of Transport Mike Kane told Parliament, “Our working assumption is that, very sadly, that the sailor is deceased.”\nBoth shipping companies as well as the authorities said their focus was on the 36 survivors of the incident. They were all given medical attention are reportedly moved to local hotels.\nThe UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has launched a preliminary assessment to establish the causes of the collision. It is reported to be collected information while also working with the authorities in the United States and Portugal as the flag states of the vessels.\nHumberside Police reported today that have commenced a criminal investigation into the cause of the collision and are working in collaboration with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The police however are leading the investigation of any potential criminal offenses.\n“Extensive work has already been carried out, and we are working closely with our partners to understand what happened, and to provide support to all of those affected,” said Nicholson. “The man arrested remains in custody at this time whilst enquiries are underway, and we continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident.”\nThe police’s response comes as there has been growing speculation that theSolongmight have been on autopilot when it plowed into the port side of the tanker. One of the American seafarers aboard theStena Immaculatetold CBS Newsoff the record that he had not seen anyone on the bridge of the containership as it struck the tanker. He said the vessel “came out of the blue.”\nThe issue of lax watchkeeping has been involved in several incidents in the North Sea and Baltic region in recent years. The MAIB and others have warned of distracted bridge watches and a lack of lookouts despite the requirements.",

    "input": "The U.S. Navy is interested in developing a remotely-operated robotic bottom crawler that can detect and disable sea mines and other threats on the seabed.\nThe service is seeking an unusual combination of exquisite attributes. The crawler must be lightweight (under 150 pounds) and must be able to swim on the surface autonomously for two nautical miles to reach offshore locations. It must be able to operate in water depths of up to 2,000 feet, and must be able to carry modular payloads of up to 100 pounds. In addition, it must be able to power itself - and any power-consuming attachments, like disruptors, short-range diagnostic sensors, and manipulators - for at least six hours at a time. One requirement is entirely unique to a mine clearance application: the device must meet specifications for low magnetic signature so that it can get to within three feet of influence-activated mines.\nWhen submerged, the device would release a tethered float that would rise to the surface and enable a radio-frequency command link to operators on shore or in a nearby boat. Supervisory autonomy is desired but not a requirement.\n\"There is no commercial capability available\" for an off-the-shelf solution, the Navy noted in a solicitation issued late last year.\nSubsea crawlers have existed for years for research and cable-lay applications, but none have mine clearance capability. Commercially available base models include the Bayonet series by GreenSea IQ and the Geomar Viator, but these devices greatly exceed the weight limit specified by the solicitation, and lack the swimming self-deployment capability.\nIf successful, the crawler program may later become classified, the Navy said in its solicitation. Only U.S. firms can participate.",

    "input": "\nAfter days of back-and-forth threats, the White House and the premier of Ontario, Canada backed down from steep tariff hikes that would have hit consumers on both sides of the border.\nLast week, in response to Trump's ongoing tariffs on Canadian goods, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on all exports of electricity to U.S. customers - and pledged to raise the levy or shut off power exports completely if the White House added any more tariffs. \"Believe me when I say I do not want to do this, I feel terrible for the American people, because it’s not the American people who started this trade war. It’s one person who’s responsible. That’s President Trump,\" Ford said.\nThe Canadian and American grids are deeply intertwined, and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and New York all import power from Ontario. The province estimated that about 1.5 million homes would be affected, and that the tariff would generate about $300-400,000 daily for Ontario's government. (Utilities in Minnesota and Michigan downplayed the impact and suggested that it would be negligible for the average household.)\nTrump responded Tuesday by threatening to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to a total of 50 percent - a crippling impact on Canada's metal producers and on the U.S. manufacturers that rely upon a Canadian supply chain. He blasted Ford for using electricity as a bargaining chip and again called for the annexation of Canada.\n“The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,” Trump said Tuesday morning. “The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear.\"\nBy the afternoon, tensions appeared to have cooled, at least temporarily. Ford announced that he had arranged a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick to discuss renegotiation of the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade deal that Trump negotiated in 2019. In response, Ford said that Ontario would suspend its 25 percent tariff on electricity exports, and the White House confirmed that it would suspend the threat to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.\nA 25 percent U.S. tariff on steel and aluminum imports from all countries remains in effect, along with a 10 percent tariff on Canadian oil and a 25 percent tariff on all Canadian and Mexican goods that fall outside of the USMCA framework. An across-the-board 25 percent tariff on both USMCA members takes effect April 2, though implementation has been delayed twice.\nFarmers begin to feel tariff pinch\nIn response to newly-imposed 20 percent U.S. tariffs on most Chinese goods, Beijing has imposed an array of retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural products, calibrated to target goods that China can replace with other sources. The tariffs include a 15 percent hike on U.S. exports of chicken, wheat and corn, and a 10 percent hike on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit. Goods that are already en route will not be affected, so long as they arrive by April 12.\n\"Farmers are frustrated. Tariffs are not something to take lightly and 'have fun' with. Not only do they hit our family businesses squarely in the wallet, but they rock a core tenet on which our trading relationships are built, and that is reliability,\" said Caleb Ragland, a soy farmer and the president of the American Soybean Association.",

It is being widely reported that four sailors aboard a Greek-managed bulker were killed during a Russian missile attack, a fifth crewmember injured, and an employee of the port company was also injured. The attack on Odesa comes as both sides have escalated their efforts on the front lines while the Trump administration continues to push for peace talks.\nHours after it was reported that Ukraine had launched a massive drone attack on Russia, sirens were warning of a missile attack against the city of Odesa this evening. According to the reports, the alarm was sounded around 2000 local time, and minutes later a large explosion was reported.\nSerhiy Bratchuk of the Public Council at the Odessa OVA posted the reports online. It was later posted (but now deleted) by the Odesa Port Authority. Included with the posting is a picture of a fire-damaged bulkerMJ Pinar.\nThe vessel which is registered in Barbados is not currently broadcasting an AIS signal. Many ships have gone dark entering the Black Sea and the ports of Ukraine. Its last signal placed the 30,465 dwt vessel at Sulina, Romania. A message to the vessel’s manager in Greece has not received a reply.\nThe reports indicate the vessel was on dock in Odesa loading 30,000 tons of wheat. At least one missile is reported to have struck the seawall causing extensive damage to the pier, terminal’s grain gallery, and other infrastructure. The report indicates there was a fire aboard the vessel that killed three Syrian and one Ukrainian crewmember and injured one other crewmember. The ship is reported to have a crew of 12 aboard. A port employee also aboard the vessel is reported to have been injured.\nToday’s attack if confirmed could be the deadliest for seafarers in the port.\nA delegation from the World Food Program was also visiting the port today. They toured the port facilities and met with officials to discuss the operations of the port and shipping corridor. The UN continues to place a high priority on food exports from Ukraine primarily to countries in Africa.\nToday’s attack came the same day as it was reported that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had sent a letter to Donald Trump and that the U.S. agreed to resume sharing military intelligence and shipping materials to Ukraine. Reports from the talks underway in Saudia Arabia are indicating a potential ceasefire in the three-year war. Ukraine had reportedly accepted a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States.\nVessels have occasionally become collateral damage during the long war with repeated reports of damage during attacks on the port. The feeder ship MSC Levante F was reported to have suffered damage at the beginning of March while it was docked in Odesa. The company later denied significant damage, but the Governor Oleh Kiper also wrote that two port employees sustained injuries in the same attack.",

    "input": "\nAs the Canadian government marks the 15th anniversary of its National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) it is moving ahead with critical orders including the first official construction contract for the new River-class destroyers. The ships which will make up the backbone of Canada’s naval combat capabilities are reported to be the largest and most complex shipbuilding effort undertaken in Canada since the Second World War.\nCanada’s Minister of Defense joined with his colleagues in the government to announce the implementation contract to start construction on the first three of the new vessels. The work was awarded to Irving Shipbuilding which is based in Halifax and which has been closely involved in the project. Irving began construction of the production test module of the River-class in June 2024 and now expects full-rate production to start next month, April 2025.\nThe River-class Destroyer is based on BAE Systems’ Type 26 warship design being built by the United Kingdom and a variant of which is being built for Australia as the Hunter Class Frigate. Canada’s Minister of Defense reports its new vessels will have enhanced underwater sensors, state-of-the-art radar, and modern weapons. The vessels are designed to provide combat power at sea support joint-force operations ashore and undertake a broad range of missions ranging from counter-piracy and counter-terrorism to intelligence and surveillance, interdiction and embargo, humanitarian assistance, research and rescue, and enforcement of law or sovereignty.\nThe new vessels are designed to replace the 12 Halifax-class frigates that are currently operating in the Royal Canadian Navy. Those vessels have been in service for approximately 30 years with the first of the class commissioned in 1992. They will also take over the role of the Iroquois-class destroyers which were in service between 1972 and 2017. Canada built four of the destroyers with two decommissioned in 2015 and the last one of the class in 2017.\n“Today’s announcement is a major step forward in delivering the first three River-class Destroyers – these impressive ships will offer an incredible capacity to the Royal Canadian Navy and Canada, ensuring that we can defend our waters against any adversary and deliver frontline combat power anywhere in the world,” said Vice-Admiral Angus Topshee, Commander, Royal Canadian Navy.\nThe first contract has a value of C$8 billion (US$5.6 billion) and is intended to fund the first six years of construction. It supports the construction of the first three ships of the class as well as the training, spares, and maintenance products required for the ship once they are commissioned. The first three ships are slatted to be named Fraser, Saint-Laurent, and Mackenzie, after Canada's vital waterways.\nThe Government of Canada reports following extensive analysis it has determined that the cost to build and deliver the first three ships at C$22.2 billion (US$15.4 billion). This estimate includes the costs that will be paid to Irving Shipbuilding through the implementation contract, as well as costs associated with the delivery of equipment, systems, and ammunition that Canada will be acquiring to bring the first three ships into service.\nAt the end of last week and over the weekend, the government also confirmed the orders under the NSS for two heavy polar icebreakers. They represent an equally challenging project to the new destroyers. The orders for the icebreakers were split between Davie and Seaspan with the vessels projected for delivery in 2029 and 2030.",

    "input": "\nA spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry responded to a question from Reuters calling the proposed fees on Chinese-built ships “wrongdoings.” It comes as the war of words continues, and the trade war heats up after Donald Trump began imposing new tariffs.\nThe White House is yet to officially comment on its response to the U.S. Trade Representative’s finding that China unfairly subsidized and supported its shipbuilding industry. The report issued in January recommended actions after finding China was dominating shipbuilding through the state-owned industry and a broad system of support.\nReuters asked for comments from the Foreign Office after the news agency last week reported the Trump administration was seeking allied support for a series of fees against Chinese-built ships. It is believed the U.S. will charge a fee on any Chinese-built ship calling in U.S. ports regardless of the nationality of the shipowner. Further, the fee would be commensurate to the percentage of Chinese ships in the owner’s fleet.\n“Such measures as imposing port fees and levying tariffs on cargo handling facilities hurt the U.S. itself as well as others,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said during Monday’s press briefing. “The move not only hikes global maritime shipping costs and disrupts the stability of global industrial and supply chains, but also increases inflationary pressures in the U.S. and hurts the interests of American consumers and businesses.”\nIndustry analysts Alphaliner analyzed the global containership fleet. In its report, it says “37.8 percent of the current active containership fleet was built in Chinese shipyards.” It has been highlighted in other reports that this includes all the major carriers. MSC Mediterranean Shipping has drawn extensively on relationships with China and the Chinese leasing industry as it is building its fleet of ultra large container vessels. CMA CGM developed its large LNG-fueled ships in China and just this week Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding is highlighting sea trials for a new generation of 24,000 TEU LNG-fueled containerships for CMA CGM.\nThe global containership order book is reported at nearly 800 vessels. Alphaliner reports that 70 percent of the orders are placed with Chinese shipyards. It notes that “out of the Top 10 shipyards in terms of vessels on order, seven are located in China.”\nChinese officials have been speaking out against the U.S. trade investigation since it was first launched in 2024. They have repeatedly said the problems with U.S. shipbuilding were long and deep-seated issues while China is using technology to advance its industry.\n“The practice will ultimately fail to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry,” said Mao Ning. “We urge the U.S. to respect facts and multilateral rules, and immediately stop its wrongdoings. China will take necessary measures to defend its lawful rights and interests.”\nThe U.S. Trade Representative’s office is currently receiving comments on its proposals. A public hearing is scheduled for March 24, which is the same day the comment period is due to close.",

The said that any Israeli vessels attempting to violate the ban would be subject to “military targeting.”\nThe group is citing the “failure to fully implement” the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. They assert that Israel is procrastinating including delays in opening the crossings into Gaza for the delivery of humanitarian aid.\n“This ban will remain in effect until the crossings to the Gaza Strip are reopened and humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, is allowed to enter,” the Houthis declared.\n\n????? ?????...pic.twitter.com/w6CKmh2ann\nPropaganda video posted by the Houthis as they reiterated their threat against Israeli shipping\n\nThe renewed threats come as the United States is pushing for more progress on the peace efforts in the region. Donald Trump on social media last week threatened Hamas if it did not immediately release all the hostages and bodies of Israelis that it is still holding.\nMost of the major shipping companies however had previously said it was too soon to return to the region while the security efforts also continue. The EU renewed Operation Aspides and the command continues to cite its close protection missions for merchant vessels transiting the area. Lloyd’s List Intelligence reports in an analysis that transits through the Bal el-Mandeb remain down by more than half versus 2023.\n\n\nEUNAVFOR Aspides has continues its security efforts during the lull in Houthi attacks (Aspides)\n\nOperators have also kept vessels out of the region due to the unpredictable nature of the attacks. In the past, the Houthis targeted vessels saying that the operators were supporting Israel or vessels with indirect associations with Israel. In some cases, it was believed the Houthis were using outdated information gained from the Internet.\nThe renewed threat comes almost three months after the group claimed its last attack on commercial shipping, the Maersk-operated containershipSanta Ursulawhile it was transiting to Oman. The attacks had become less frequent during late 2024 although the group continued to target U.S. Navy vessels including claims of three launches against the carrier USSHarry S. Trumanin the days leading up to the implementation of the ceasefire. They also continued to launch missiles toward Israel which had led to several retaliatory strikes by the Israel Defense Forces on ports and other facilities in Yemen.",

    "input": "\nThe House Republican caucus plans to pass a continuing resolution (CR) rather than a budget to cover the remainder of the fiscal year, a procedural option that keeps federal spending at constant levels and avoids a difficult fight over spending priorities. Overall, theproposed CRwould raise defense spending by $6 billion year-on-year, roughly $16 billion below the amount needed to keep up with current levels of inflation.\nThe U.S. Navy has historically disliked CRs because they disrupt long-term shipbuilding and maintenance plans, which rely on a steady increase in funding levels. This one is different: it also adjusts several important line items, including an apparent cut in funding for the delayed Constellation-class frigate program.\nThe proposed CR sets a budget of $233 million for the Constellation-class for FY2025, a fraction of the $1.2 billion that the Navyrequestedthis year. (The CR also includes five cost-to-complete adjustments for the frigate totaling $400 million, which will cover prior-year shipbuilding cost increases from FY2020-24.)\nAlso on the list of cuts is the Landing Ship Medium, a key priority for the Marine Corps and a frequent point of friction for the Navy. The line item for this intratheater transport ship has been reduced to just $30 million, down from a requested amount of $268 million.\nThe CR also boosts funding for destroyer construction by an unrequested $1.5 billion. The Navy typically buys two destroyers a year from GD Bath Iron Works in Maine and HII Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi, and its long-term shipbuilding plan calls for orders of just under two per year through 2050.\nIn the past, defense officials have expressed skepticism about whether the two yards could follow through if given an order for a third destroyer a year. \"We don’t see the yards being able to produce three a year. We don’t see them being able to produce two a year. And that’s just data,\" Pentagon comptroller Mike McCord told USNI in 2024. \"Everybody’s struggling with skilled labor. Everybody’s struggling with supply chains.\"\nMaine and Mississippi have politically powerful representation on the House and Senate Armed Services committees; Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) told Roll Call that the funding for an extra destroyer was justified, given the strong recent performance of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in the Red Sea.",

    "input": "\nThe first full-scale seaglider prototype using the wing-in-ground effect recently completed the first on-water tests of a prototype with humans onboard. According to Regent Craft, which is developing the new vessels, it was the kickoff of a testing campaign that will culminate with the first human seaglider flight at mid-year.\nThe company was launched in 2020 to develop the technology which it believes will present a new paradigm in travel. Its design is for an all-electric high-speed vessel that operates exclusively over water connecting coastal destinations. The vessel operates in three modes — floating on the hull, foiling above the waves on hydrofoils, and flying in ground effect within one wingspan of the surface of the water. The company’s first design, the Viceroy, is a 12-passenger vessel that can travel at up to 180 mph and up to 180 miles on a single charge.\nThe company successfully flew its quarter-scale seaglider prototype in 2022, validating its technological approach to redefining wing-in-ground craft (WIGs), vessels that operate in ground effect low over the surface of the water. Last year, it reported it had received permission to advance to prototype testing while raising more than $90 million from investors to develop the vessel. Regent has also advanced its maritime certification process with the U.S. Coast Guard and with maritime regulators in key markets around the world, in partnership with the maritime classification society Lloyd’s Register.\n\n\nPaladin was lowered into the water in Rhode Island to start the first trials\n\nRegent christened its new vesselPaladinbefore lowering her into Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. The 12-passenger Viceroy seaglider prototype is 55 feet (16.7 meters) long with a 65-foot (approximately 20-meter) wingspan, making it the largest-ever all-electric flying machine.\nOfficially commencing sea trials, Regent’s test captains completed the first in a series of on-water tests. Sea trials follow months of sub-system testing of the critical onboard systems, including motors, batteries, electronics, mechanical systems, and vehicle control software, and will progress to the first human seaglider flight in the coming months.\n\n\n\nThe company has attracted strong attention from both regional air carriers as well as the shipping industry. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines made a strategic investment in 2024 and Brittany Ferries is among the companies reporting it was exploring using the vessels. Regent reports its total order book is valued at more than $9 billion.\nConstruction has started on a 255,000-square-foot manufacturing facility located in Rhode Island. The company expects the facility will come online in 2026 as it moves forward with the commercialization of its seagliders.\n\n\n\n",

The Coast Guard is reporting that it detected a research vessel in restricted waters and then again today four Chinese Coast Guard vessels entered the same area in Kinmen near Dongding Island in the Taiwan Strait.\nNumerous previous incidents have been reported leading to Taiwan announcing that it wasincreasingits monitoring and efforts to interdict vessels loitering in its waters. It said a specific target would be Chinese-owned merchant ships operating under foreign flags such as Cameroon and Tanzania. In January, a Chinese-owned cargo ship was accused of damaging offshore cables and at the end of February, the Coast Guarddetaineda Chinese-owned vessel registered in Togo. The Coast Guard believed it caught the vessel in the act of dragging its anchor near sensitive undersea cables. Taiwan’s telecom provider reported at the same time that one of its cables had been interrupted.\nThe Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu branch of the Taiwan Coast Guard Administration reports it detected a Chinese research vessel,Yanping 2entering the restricted waters at midday on March 12. After making radar contact, the Coast Guard sent two patrol boats at approximately 1300 local time to intercept the vessel. When the patrol boats reached the area, they immediately began broadcasting messages for theYanping 2to depart the area.\nThe Coast Guard Administration reports as the Chinese vessel was being directed out of the area its crews observed the vessel dropping some type of detection equipment into the water. One of the patrol boats began searching the waters while they also broadcast a message to the Chinese to retrieve the equipment that had been released into the water.\n\n\nTaiwan condemned China for \"harassing our waters\" with scientific research vessels and survey ships (CGA)\n\nTheYanping 2has been registered as operating over the past decade for the Fujian Seismological Bureau and Fujian Marine Research Institute. Taiwanese officials said they believe the Chinese are conducting seabed geology, topography, and hydrology research, but it might not be purely for scientific research purposes. They believe the Chinese could be using the guise of scientific research to hide its true intentions.\n“The Coast Guard Administration strongly condemns China for harassing our waters with scientific research vessels and survey ships,” the officials said reporting yesterday’s incident.\nAfter being confronted, the Chinese vesselYanping 2replied it would cooperate and stop the activities. It retrieved the equipment that had been placed in the waters. At 1552 the Coast Guard patrol boats reported the Chinese vessel had left the restricted area which was about three miles southeast of Dongding Island.\nTaiwan asserts that the Chinese are using the gray zone to harass the island. At 1450 local time today, March 13, four Chinese Coast Guard ships also sailed into the southern waters of Kinmen. The Taiwan Coast Guard intercepted the vessels and instructed them to turn around and leave. While they were being monitored, they departed the gray zone at 1700.\nThe Taiwan Coast Guard reports it will continue its efforts to monitor and drive away vessels from its restricted waters.",

    "input": "Shippers are adjusting to an unpredictable mix of geopolitical disruption, economic uncertainty and sweeping tariff changes, and some of the most prominent container freight experts are advising their clients to avoid locking in long-term contracts until the dust settles.\nIn a webinar held by the container leasing platform Container XChange, a panel of executives and analysts discussed the changing dynamics of ocean freight. The market is now driven in part by an array of political circumstances - particularly the on-and-off shutdown of the Red Sea, and the White House's changing tariff announcements.\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's proposed multimillion-dollar port fees for Chinese-built ships could have particularly significant effects on U.S. trade patterns, and the industry is watching closely. Xeneta's top analyst, Peter Sand, noted that all top six carriers have fleets that are more than 20 percent Chinese-built and orderbooks that are more than 40 percent Chinese. He called the fee proposal \"a challenge to globalization and free competition,\" and recommended an analytical rather than reactive business response.\n\"Uncertainty is toxic for trade, and businesses today are overwhelmed by shifting regulations, unpredictabletariffs, and constantly changing trade dynamics. The best advice? Stay calm, keep your options open, and avoid locking into long-term commitments without a clear upside,\" recommended Xeneta's Peter Sand. \"Businesses should focus on data-driven decision-making, risk management, and adaptable logistics strategies to navigate anincreasingly volatile market.\"\nThe White House has already imposed tariffs of 20 percent on Chinese goods. Circuitous routing is one common response, and one container equipment trader suggested that business is already picking up for moving cargo through Southeast Asia, the Mideast or the Subcontinent.\nThe Red Sea is another wild card. If it reopens and stays stable, global slot capacity will increase and rates will come down - but only if carriers have certainty that Houthi attacks will not restart.

    "input": "The German Shipowners’ Association (VDR) released its annual report on the strength and vital role of shipping in the country’s economy and security. Citing “turbulent times” the group which represents the largest part of the German merchant fleet is calling for new long-term measures to support its smaller shipowners and efforts to reduce bureaucracy to increase global competitiveness.\nThe group highlighted in its presentation that despite global turbulence and uncertain times in international trade policy, that German shipping remains a key contributor to the country’s economic strength and supply security. They reported that approximately 26 percent of exports and 60 percent of imports are handled by sea.\n“Without a strong and independent merchant fleet, there is neither economic stability nor national security – especially in times when geopolitical and trade policy risks are steadily increasing,” said VDR President Gaby Bornheim.\nAlthough Germany remains a strong maritime hub and continues to rank seventh globally, VDR reported that the industry is slipping in key areas. German shipping’s tonnage has declined from a peak of approximately 90 million gross tons in 2010 and 2011 to a current 47.4 million gross tons. While container shipping remains the largest segment, Germany has slipped to third behind Switzerland (home of MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company) and China.\nGerman shipping companies purchased 70 vessels in 2024 (1.9 million gross tons) and newbuilds numbered 74 vessels (2.6 million gross tons). However, sales numbered 180 ships (4.1 million gross tons).\n“The VDR therefore calls for targeted, long-term measures to strengthen the competitiveness of German shipping companies and Germany as a maritime location to avoid falling behind internationally,” the group writes in its report.\nWhile the total German merchant shipping industry consists of approximately 290 companies and a fleet of 1,764 ships, the VDR’s data highlights just under half are flying EU flags and only 15 percent are registered in Germany. Further, it highlights that 80 percent of German shipping companies are small to medium-sized companies with fewer than 10 ships, with 44 percent specifically operating a single ship.\nIt cites a broad range of challenges for the industry including Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs which it says are causing uncertainty in the German and global merchant fleet. It also cites the geopolitical disruption to shipping routes and maritime trade. The VDR warns that national interests must not come at the expense of free global trade flows.\nIn addition to geopolitical and trade policy uncertainties, VDR reports that German shipping companies face an increasingly dense administrative burden within Europe. It says that double reporting requirements and regional special regulations on climate protection unnecessarily complicate ship operations and weaken competitiveness.\n“It is high time for Europe and Germany to abandon their dubious leadership in excessive bureaucracy and regional special regulations. Streamlined processes and globally consistent climate protection requirements are essential to safeguard Germany’s economic strength at sea,” warns VDR CEO Martin Kröger.\nWhile highlighting the challenges for shipping, VDR also reports a positive trend in 2024 as more young talent was attracted to the industry. It reports a 14 percent increase in trainees, with 499 training contracts at sea and 214 onshore. It highlights that shipping is attracting more young professionals while saying it is vital to continue to attract young talent into the industry.",

    "input": "Officials from HM Coastguard and the shipping companies involved in Monday’s incident in the North Sea are reporting that the situation has stabilized aboard both ships as attention turns to planning the salvage operation. UK investigators are continuing to gather information while they wait for access to the data recorders aboard the two ships.\n“The MCA is working with the salvage companies who are responding on behalf of the vessels’ owners and are working in full cooperation with all commercial and government partners. The overarching objective is to protect the public and the environment to the best of our ability, during this ongoing incident response,” HM Coastguard said in its update midday on Wednesday. “There have been no further reports of pollution to the sea from either vessel beyond what was observed during the initial incident.”\n\n\nThermal imaging from a neighboring vessel showing the allision as it happens -- note the weather conditions from the bridge view in the first images (Orca AI supplied)\n\n\"This video footage clearly shows the context of the accident, that is the fog conditions at the time, while the moment of impact is also shown clearly,\" commented Yarden Gross, CEO and Co-founder of Orca AI, a maritime operations platform utilizing artificial intelligence and computer vision to aid mariners. The company describes the video saying the footage comprises two videos, one captured by the SeaPod's day cameras showing the dense fog that would likely have prevented the crew of the feeder containershipSolongfrom seeing theStena Immaculatewith the human eye. The second video captured by the SeaPod's thermal cameras shows the approach of theSolongand the explosion as it hit the tanker.\nThe fires aboard the containershipSolongare being described as “greatly reduced in their extent and intensity” while the vessel’s owner Ernst Russ said in a statement that the operational response to fully extinguish the fire and stabilize its containership continues. It said that fire activity onboard had diminished since yesterday, but that the vessel continues to emit smoke with occasional reports of flames. Pictures show the vessel charred end to end. The containership continues to be held in a safe position offshore by a tug with additional support vessels remaining in the area.\nThere are no visible flames on theStena Immaculate, which remains at anchor with safety tugs in position nearby. The salvage team from Boskalis was hoping to carry out an onboard assessment on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\nStena Immaculate on March 11  (Photo: Maritime and Coastguard Agency)\n\nErik Hanel, chief executive of Stena Bulk which owns the tanker said the company was working closely with Crowley which operated the tanker under charter for the U.S. government, and that once the fire has been fully extinguished, salvagers would conduct a comprehensive assessment of the damage.\nSpeaking with the BBC, Hanel said that they would not know the full extent of the structural damage until the teams got aboard. He said they “hoped a decision on what to do with it could be made over the next 24-48 hours.” Hanell said that they now believe only two of the vessel's 18 fuel tanks had leaked, with an estimated 10 percent of the cargo.\nThe investigators have not made any public comments although the Internet remains ripe with speculation. A spokesperson for Ernst Russ commented that the master of the vessel who was detained by the police and its entire team are “actively assisting with the investigations.” They confirmed that the master is a Russian national and the rest of the crew are a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.\nMedia in the UK is also highlighting that theSolongwas cited for a range of issues during Port State inspections in 2024.

Illegal fishing is a major issue in the Arafura Sea, and the ABF has allocated significant new resources to interdict and discourage Indonesian fishermen in Australia's northernmost waters.\nAboard the vessel, the authorities found 339 shark fins, fishing equipment, and 200 kilos of salt for preserving illegal catch. Not present were the remaining portions of the sharks, indicative of a finning operation.\nAll seven fishermen aboard the vessel were arrested, and their vessel was seized and destroyed. The suspects were brought ashore in Darwin to face charges under the Fisheries Management Act, and all pleaded guilty on March 4.\nThe fishermen were released on an AU$1,000 undertaking to be on good behavior for at least five years. One suspect had an outstanding warrant for a prior offense, and he was sentenced to a month in prison.\n\"This illegal activity will not be tolerated in our waters. We will intercept you, you will lose your catch, your equipment and possibly even your vessel,\" said ABF Operation Lunar Commander Tracie Griffin.\nThe case brings the number of Indonesian fishermen prosecuted at Darwin to a total of 132 suspects in eight months. The ABF has also destroyed several other vessels, including two that were burned at sea last month.",

The growth was a result of increase in volumes across all segments including oil, auto, bulk and container shipping.\nDuring the year, Vancouver and other Canadian ports had to contend with challenges including labor disputes, local and global geopolitical tensions, climate change and extreme weather such as wildfires. Despite this, Vancouver cemented its status as Canada’s biggest facilitator of international trade.\nThe Trans Mountain pipeline expansion has unlocked new markets across Asia for Canadian petroleum products, and liquid bulk exports surged by an unprecedented 203 percent to 17.1 million tonnes. Dry bulk however posted a four percent decline to 96 million MT driven by fall in coal and potash exports.\nContainer trade recovered throughout 2024, returning to pre-pandemic growth trends. Vancouver’s four container terminals handled 3.5 million TEU, up 11 percent compared to 2023 and two percent compared to 2019.\nGrowth was also recorded in the ro/ro segment, with a record of almost 470,000 vehicles handled by auto terminals.\nDuring the year, the top trading partners that moved goods through the port were China with 46 million tonnes, Japan with 19 million tonnes and South Korea with 18 million tonnes. Trade to the U.S. through the port increased to seven percent of total cargo moved, amounting to 10 million tonnes, driven by increased petroleum exports.\nWhile the performance shows that Canada’s biggest port is on a growth trajectory, trade uncertainties ignited by tariff wars could affect the port’s activities this year. Confusion continues around the 25 percent tariff imposed on certain Canadian goods by President Trump, and the steps that Canada is taking to retaliate.\n“The Port of Vancouver stands ready to support efforts to diversify Canada’s international trade and build a strong, resilient national economy. We will continue partnering with governments and industry to plan and deliver the long-term capacity needed to support trade through the gateway,” said Peter Xotta, VFPA President and CEO.\nApart from cargo, Vancouver also cemented its position as a key cruise facility with passenger visits hitting a record 1.3 million, a seven percent increase from 1.2 million in 2023.\nTo sustain growth going forward, Vancouver has been undertaking significant investments to improve operations and efficiency. These include densification and modernization at Global Container Terminal’s Vanterm terminal, which is increasing container handling capacity, enabling larger container ships to berth and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",

The company’s first sail installation was completed in Antwerp, and the chemical tankerBow Olympuswill now be carefully monitored to observe the impact on operations.\n“The five-year-old vessel will soon embark on what could be called her second maiden voyage—this time, crossing the Atlantic towards Texas with four eSails,\" said Erik Hjortland, VP Technology for Odfjell. “Each nautical mile will be thoroughly analyzed in real-time to document the energy-saving effects. That data will be fundamental in informing future decisions as we continue to improve the environmental performance of our existing fleet.”\nOdfjell selected bound4blue’s eSails, a wind foil that it said is best suited to the challenges of chemical tankers. They noted that the deck of the vessel is covered in pipes for multiple cargo tanks. The integration of the sail foundations required careful planning to ensure a seamless fit with tanker operations and the vessel’s requirement for air draft limitations.\nBound4blue says that it was able to minimize the size and eliminate the need for tilting systems because its eSails generate six to seven times the propulsive lift of equivalently proportioned rigid sails. The fully automated eSails generate propulsive force by dragging air across an optimized aerodynamic profile. TheBow Olympuswhich is approximately 600 feet (183 meters) and 49,000 dwt, was fitted with four 72-foot (22-meter) eSails.\nTo accommodate the vessel’s operating schedule, the installation was undertaken in two stages. The foundations were fitted during a scheduled drydocking. The sails were installed during two days, March 10 and 11, at the EDR Antwerp Shipyard.\n“We’ve made some major steps in minimizing our emissions, reducing our fleet’s carbon intensity by 53% against the 2008 baseline,” says Hjortland. “We’ve done this through many operational measures and by installing a range of different energy-saving devices. Wind power was the next step.”\nThis project is funded by the European Union under a grant agreement from the Innovation Fund program. The tanker company says once results are validated from the operation of this first vessel, the plan is to install sails on more of its vessels.\nOdfjell joins owners such as Amasus, Eastern Pacific Shipping, and Louis Dreyfus Armateurs with operational eSAILs. David Ferrer, Co-Founder and CTO of bound4blue notes that other major shipping companies such as Maersk Tankers, Marflet Marine, and Klaveness Combination Carriers are filling the company’s growing orderbook.",

Executives at Pertamina allegedly set up a complex scheme to import gasoline from foreign refineries, inflate the price and skim money off the top at multiple points in the supply chain. The scheme touched chartering, procurement, blending and distribution, according to local authorities, and one U.S.-based shipping company is suspending the director of its Indonesian JV in response.\nIndonesia's oil industry is highly concentrated, and a small \"oil mafia\" of well-placed officials and private individuals exert considerable control over the trade. Recently-elected President Prabowo Subianto campaigned on a promise to rein in this \"mafia,\" and the Pertamina case is the first big test of that effort. (It is not the first time for Pertamina, which has undergone five previous corruption investigations in the past 10 years.)\nAccording to local prosecutors, from 2018-23, a group of nine executives carried out fraudulent trades in order to increase their own earnings. The overall cost to the Indonesian state and local consumers came to about $12 billion.\nAccording to officials, the starting point of the scheme was to declare that certain locally-produced crude was too poor in quality to be used in Indonesian refineries. This opened a legal avenue to import more expensive foreign-sourced gasoline to make up the artificial gap. At that point, the suspects allegedly purchased lower-quality 90 octane gasoline on the foreign market, then blended it and fraudulently resold it as higher-quality 92 octane gasoline in Indonesia. Motorists who used a low-quality fuel in an engine designed for high-octane gas could experience knocking and poor performance, and lawsuits are expected.\n\"An engine that continuously experiences knocking will lose combustion efficiency. Over time, carbon deposits will accumulate on the piston head and combustion chamber, drastically reducing performance,\" said Dr. Nur Aklis, a mechanical engineer at Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta (UMS).\nSome of the suspects also allegedly inflated the cost of chartering to import this fuel by 13-15 percent, then pocketed the difference.\nOne individual arrested in connection with the scheme, Muhamad Kerry Adrianto, is also a director at the Indonesian joint venture operation of Navigator Gas (the firm is not accused of any involvement). The U.S.-listed LPG carrier operator has taken steps to remove Adrianto from his role, and expects that the change will have no material impact on its business.",

    "input": "Retailers are continuing to front-load their imports into U.S. ports due to the uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and the potential that the Trump administration will move to impose fees on Chinese-built ships reports the National Retail Federation. While the trade group expects volumes to remain elevated through the spring, its Global Port Tracker is reducing the forecast for second quarter imports versus last month’s outlook.\nThe group highlights the concerns among members and the elevated import levels so far in 2025 as seen for example on the reports of strong monthly volumes at the port of Los Angeles and Long Beach. However, after separately reporting declines in monthly consumer sales in both January and February, the NRF is now saying import volumes could see year-over-year drops this summer.\nThe National Retail Federation’s Port Tracker rallies container volumes at the major U.S. ports. The group raised its forecast by 3.5 percent for the first quarter while lowering its second quarter projection by 2.5 percent. It now expects possible year-over-year declines in import volumes to start in June and July, noting it would be the first decline since September 2023.\n“Retailers are continuing to bring as much merchandise into the country ahead of rising tariffs as possible,” said Jonathan Gold, Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy at the NRF. “The on-again, off-again tariffs against Canada and Mexico won’t have a direct impact on port volumes because most of those goods move by truck or rail. But new tariffs on goods from China that have already doubled from 10 to 20 percent are a concern, as well as uncertainty over ‘reciprocal’ tariffs that could start in April.”\nThe trade group notes that retailers have been working on supply chain diversification, but that doesn’t happen overnight. In the meantime, it says tariffs are taxes on imports ultimately paid by consumers, not foreign countries, and American families will pay more as long as they are in place. Economists have echoed this concern while Donald Trump this week dismissed talk of an impending recession due to his trade policies.\nThe NRF is projecting more than 6.4 million TEU for imports in the first quarter of 2025 noting that levels were up 4.4 percent in January over December and 13.4 percent year-over-year. It projects the momentum continued into February with a 6.1 percent increase, making it the busiest February in three years, a month that is traditionally slower as factories close in Asia during the Lunar New Year celebrations. It is forecasting a 10.8 percent increase year-over-year for March and a 5.7 percent increase year-over-year for April.\nThe retailers however are projecting the momentum will end with just a 2.8 increase in May followed by monthly year-over-year declines. June they project could be down 3.2 percent year-over-year and increasing to a 13.9 percent year-over-year decline in July. The forecast also shows container import volumes below 2 million TEU in July 2025 which would be the first time it has fallen below that level since March 2024.\nThe NRF is now forecasting a total of 12.78 million TEU for the first half of 2025. That would be up 5.7 percent versus last year.\nThe group notes if the Trump administration moves ahead with port fees on Chinese-built ships, that carriers might move to larger vessels. They expect the major lines would seek to consolidate calls at major ports rather than making multiple stops at smaller ports. Others have speculated that shippers might route move volumes through the Canadian and Mexican ports to reduce exposure to the proposed port fees.\nThe NRF believes the growing uncertainties and continuing “tariff turmoil” are increasing concerns and are likely to be reflected in import volumes as the year progresses.",

    "input": "\nThe U.S. House of Representatives haspasseda continuing resolution (CR) rather than a budget to fund the federal government for the rest of the year, leaving funding levels effectively flat. Without a normal appropriations bill, the Pentagon lacks funding to offset inflation and the authorities needed to start new programs. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee today, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby said that the CR would have several significant effects: at a time when the Navy is working hard to maximize readiness, the flat funding of a full-year CR puts maintenance availabilities for 11 ships at risk. These yard periods would have to be pushed to next year or skipped altogether, which would create growth work and unexpected issues during the next maintenance availability.\nThe timing is poor for the Navy. Unable to compete with China's PLA Navy on tonnage, the service has embarked on a plan to do more with what it has. Under now-departed CNO Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the Navy set a \"stretch goal\" to achieve 80 percent surge availability across the entire fleet, matching its targets for aircraft availability. That target remains in place under VCNO Adm. Kilby, who is performing the duties of CNO following Franchetti'sdismissallast month.\n\"Our goal is to achieve and sustain an 80% combat-surge ready (CSR) posture. We began these efforts with naval aviation in 2018, improving the operational availability of tactical aircraft. We are now scaling our efforts across all aviation platforms, as well as in the surface and submarine communities,\" Adm. Kilby said in prepared testimony.\nIn addition to the effects of a CR on maintenance and readiness targets, Adm. Kilby warned that the lack of a proper budget could interfere with the service's progress on recruiting. The Navy had a serious recruiting shortfall in 2023, but made an all-out effort to turn it around and succeeded last year in hitting its numbers. Navy recruiters are outperforming targets this year, and the service is on track to reach 100 percent enlisted rating fill by the end of 2026 - so long as the CR doesn't derail the effort.\n\"I'm very concerned about the impact of the CR on that machine and slowing it down. We want to bring in all the people we need and bring down our gaps at sea, and a CR makes that a little more challenging,\" said Kilby.\nThe committee sought input from service leaders on what could be done to allow the armed forces to make the most of the funds they have, including more flexibility to use appropriations for new purposes. Kilby emphasized the value of budgetary flexibility to adapt to new technology and new threats - for example, to pivot funding to meet new drone and missile risks in the Red Sea. These changes are hard to do under a continuing resolution, Adm. Kilby said, so having more flexibility in the budget from the start would allow the Navy to make do more easily when a CR occurs.\nCivilian DOD layoffs and an ongoing military-wide hiring freeze are a concern for the service leaders, but Kilby noted that two critical groups - public shipyard employees and the Military Sealift Command mariner pool - are exempt from these workforce reduction initiatives.\nThe Navy also came in for criticism for the persistent maintenance issues in the amphibious fleet, which have caused friction between the Navy and the Marine Corps for years. Just 13 out of 32 amphibs are currently available for deployment, and General Christopher J. Mahoney (USMC) testified that the current levels of amphib capacity are \"not going to do it\" to generate USMC warfighting capability. \"We have got to get ahead of the maintenance curve, and that means years ahead,\" said Mahoney.",

    "input": "\nWhile businesses have been closely following the Trump administration's tariff policies, the seven-figure port fee proposal from the US Trade Representative (USTR) could have even deeper effects on American shipping interests. If adopted, Chinese-built ships - and global operators who use Chinese-built ships elsewhere - would have to pay millions of dollars for every port call in the U.S. Exporters would be required to ship an increasing percentage of their goods on U.S.-flagged tonnage, and eventually on scarce U.S.-built tonnage. This plan's steep costs could be enough to put some smaller companies out of business, drive others away from American shores, or end some categories of American exports altogether, maritime businesses and shippers warned in comments to the USTR.\nACL, the conro specialist that operates in Transatlantic trade, handles more than half of the American heavy machinery and equipment exports from New York, Baltimore and Norfolk to Europe. It is the only U.S.-headquartered carrier serving these American manufacturers on the East Coast. In a submission to the USTR, ACL explained that it went to China to buy all five of its specialized new conros because no one else would build them. In 2012, the few qualified U.S. yards said that they were booked seven years out with Navy work, ACL claimed; Japanese yards didn't want to bid on such a small series, and Korean yards said that it wasn't worth the cost of doing a custom design for just five vessels. When ACL sought bids in China, it received a competitive offer, and the vessels were built under class supervision in Shanghai.\nIf the multi-million-dollar fees went into effect, ACL said, it would make the company \"totally uncompetitive versus the other carriers in the US trades,\" and ACL would be forced to shut down its U.S. operations. It would cease services, close its U.S. headquarters, lay off its staff and leave American shippers using foreign shipping services. Those foreign operators would be dramatically more expensive, ACL warned.\n\"US export container rates to Europe for a carrier with a Chinese-built fleet - now averaging $500 per 40-foot container today - would climb to around $2,500 per 40-foot overnight – a 500% increase – simply to cover the new service fee,\" ACL said. \"American manufacturers would have less choice of carriers and face significantly higher transportation costs.\"\nSeaPort Manatee, the largest port in Southwest Florida, said that the port fees would also likely end the U.S. operations of the regional line World Direct Shipping (WDS). WDS is a Florida-headquartered container line connecting the U.S. with Mexico, and supports about $1 billion a year in U.S. economic activity. \"Cargo would be diverted from WDS vessels to trucks, resulting in 1,000 more trucks crossing the border each week, and increase congestion at Texas border crossings and increase wear/tear on U.S. highways,\" noted the port authority. \"The proposed action is very likely to negatively impact United States supply chains . . . and negatively impact American businesses and families (e.g., lost jobs; increased cost of goods and services).\"\nU.S. agricultural interests are also concerned. The Agriculture Transportation Coalition, a trade body for farmers who export goods by container, warned that the fees would \"render US ag unaffordable and uncompetitive.\" The group believes that this would have an extreme impact on U.S. agricultural commodity exports. \"Because there is ample substitute supply from other countries, it would end US ag sales to foreign markets,\" the association told Lloyd's List.\nEnergy Products Partners, a leading U.S. midstream firm, warned that the fees would also have a devastating impact on oil and gas exports. If the fees take effect, \"there will be no ‘drill baby drill’ [and] the ‘liquid gold’ under our feet would stay in the ground,\" EPP told Lloyd's List.\nThe costs outlined by the USTR could also be just a starting point. Beijing could take its own actions in response, further raising costs, one established freight broker noted. \"The reality is that, similar to the retaliation of U.S. trading partners to recent major tariff increases, similar fees would be imposed on U.S. ships calling Chinese ports,\" the broker warned.\nThe International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU)'s Washington branch also pointed out that the extra charges could incentivize carriers to simply offload cargo outside of the United States - in Mexico or Canada - and then truck it across the border without paying the port fees. Without parallel restrictions to equalize costs at the land border, U.S. port traffic and longshore jobs could decline.",

    "input": "A new tug construction project underway at Turkey’s Uzmar shipyard will integrate a marine battery power system with a methanol-fueled engine to minimize emissions from the operations. The vessel is being built for Svitzer and will be launched later this year for operations in Gothenburg, Sweden.\nThe tug is based on Svitzer’s TRAnsverse tug design and will be used for escort duty. With a gross tonnage of approximately 806 tonnes, the tug will be capable of achieving speeds of up to 14 knots. Delivery is planned in the second half of 2025.\nThe order for the 6MWh battery went to AYK Energy and is its first contract with Uzmar. The battery will be built at the company’s new facility in Zhuhai, China, and delivered to Uzmar for installation in the tug. AYK attests to having the highest energy density and volumetric density in the industry today. Combined with its Battery Management System) and packaging solution, it reports it has tailored unique solutions for the maritime sector. It claims to offer the safest, lightest, most affordable, easiest to operate, and commission battery with the ability to operate in smaller spaces.\n\"Battery solutions are constantly expanding, and we are proud to be at the forefront when it comes to providing those solutions to the maritime sector,” said AYK Energy founder Chris Kruger, He said the contract “shows our continuing progress in winning the bigger battery projects.”\nThe battery power system will be supported for the first time by dual-fuel methanol engines. The engines will be used for backup power and to extend the range of the tug. However, according to the companies, they expect the tug to perform more than 90 percent of its escort duty operations using its battery-electric powertrain. They said the vessel’s design will also allow the battery-powered tug to operate more efficiently than internal combustion engine-powered tugs of a traditional design.\nUzmar says that the combination of battery power and methanol engines will provide a safe, efficient, and reliable solution.\n“The launch of a first-of-its-kind newbuild project with our partners at Uzmar Shipyard is a significant milestone for our decarbonization ambitions,” said Gareth Prowse, Head of Decarbonization at Svitzer.  The battery electric tug will mean we can deliver our services to customers in the Port of Gothenburg with significantly lower carbon emissions, and still to the highest operational and safety standards.”\nCompanies such as Svitzer see battery power as becoming an important option in the sustainability transition. Marine batteries are demonstrating that they can play a fundamental role in decarbonizing the industry, as an increasing number of tugs are being built and deployed with battery-electric powertrains.\n",

At the same time, a Magistrate’s Court extended the detention and questioning of the master of theSolong.\nHM Coastguard reports little change in the situation aboard both vessels. The fires appear to be out on the tanker Stena Immaculate and it remains where it was anchored when it was struck by the containership.\n“Small pockets of fire are still reported to be on the top deck ofSolong,” HM Coastguard reported noting that crews continue to respond to the vessel. The containership continues to be held off the English coast in what they are calling “a safe location connected to a tug.”\nChief Coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan said: “Both vessels are presently stable and salvors have been on board to carry out initial damage assessments to secure future safe access to both ships,” in his end-of-day update on Thursday.\nThe Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) reported earlier on Thursday that it was gathering preliminary information and interviews but was waiting while the prior has been to allow the emergency services to undertake their efforts and to secure the vessels. MAIB said it has been gathering witness accounts and obtaining digital data.\nIt also reported that the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Coast Guard had joined the efforts. In addition, the Marine Safety Investigation Authority of Portugal has also joined but MAIB reports it was agreed that the UK will lead the safety investigation with Portugal and the U.S. “acting as substantially interested states.”\n\n\nGermany provided HM Coastguard with assistance including planes and drones for close-up inspections of both vessels (Havariekommando)\n\nHumberside Police Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson however reported that the Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday had granted a 36-hour extension for the man they have in custody.\n“Detectives are continuing to question him following his arrest on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision,” said Nicholson. “Extensive lines of inquiry by police into any potential criminal offenses which arise from the collision between the two vessels are ongoing, whilst partner agencies continue their own assessments of the incident.”\nMAIB said when it is safe its teams would conduct a detailed inspection of both vessels and manage the retrieval of the Voyage Data Recorders (VDR) from both ships. In addition to gathering witness accounts, MAIB said its further investigation work will look to establish the navigational practices on board both vessels; the manning and fatigue management; the condition and maintenance of the vessels involved; and the environmental conditions at the time.\n\n\nInspection of the Stena Immaculate (Havariekommando)\n\nThis comes as speculation continues to grow on the repercussions of this incident. Marcos Alvarez, Managing Director, Global Financial Institution Ratings for the credit rating service Morningstar DBRS said they do not expect this to “materially affect the credit profile of marine insurers in 2025.” However, he notes that multiple insurance policies, including those for hull and machinery, liability, and marine cargo, will be activated. “We estimate that liability and salvage losses will exceed the cost of hull and cargo claims said Alvarez. Morningstar believes total insured losses in the range of $100 to $300 million will “remain manageable,” while noting the findings of the U.S. investigation into sabotage and the MAIB investigation could have “significant implications,” for handling any insurance claims for the incident.\nThe U.S. shipping company Crowley confirmed late on Thursday that the team from SMIT had been aboard theStena Immaculate, but they cautioned it would take time to complete the assessment. They said a salvage and tow plan would be finalized with the appropriate authorities.",

Officials are hailing it as a key step in deepening the relationship as the South Korean industry looks to realize more opportunities under Donald Trump’s plan to enhance the U.S. Navy.\nThe 40,000 displace ton vessel, which is part of the Military Sealift Command’s Lewis and Clark dry cargo class, spent approximately six months at Hanwha Ocean’s Geoje shipyard plant for overhaul maintenance work on the hull and machinery. The project as specified included major equipment inspections and replacement and systems upgrades.\nThe shipyard also reports during its inspection it identified additional steps to improve the vessel’s operations and it was successful in obtaining a revised contract from the U.S. Navy. MSC reports that during the dry docking, more than 300 work items were addressed including hull corrosion and a full rudder replacement. The vessel departed South Korea on March 12.\n“Hanwha addressed extensive deterioration and damage to the hull, propeller, rudder, and rudder post/steering gear,” said Cmdr. Patrick J. Moore, commanding officer, MSC Office-Korea. “Notably, Hanwha engineers reverse-engineered the damaged rudder, completely replacing the unit when blueprints were not available. This saved significant time and resources in gettingWally Schirraback to sea, a testament to their resilient supply chains, advanced automations, and skilled workforce.”\nThe project was conducted under the U.S. Navy’s ship maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) program. Hanwha signed a contract with the U.S. Navy in July 2024 after completing the certification process to become the second South Korean shipyard authorized to bid for contracts. HD Hyundai was also authorized last year and reports it plans to start bidding for contracts in 2025. South Korea’s HJ Shipbuilding & Construction, the renamed former Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction, has also according to media reports formed a team to complete the qualification process to enter the MRO program.\nUS MSC officials note that normal voyage repairs are routinely conducted in Korea but this is the first time the much larger work has been performed. The South Koreans report the market is valued at approximately $8 billion and is growing steadily.\nHanwha Ocean currently has a second project underway, the overhaul of the refueling vessel USNSYukonwhich arrived at the yard in November. Hanwha Ocean said that it is also involving small and medium-sized shipbuilding companies in the Geoje area as subcontractors to share the economic benefits with the broader industry. The shipyard says it is targeting five to six MRO contracts for 2025 and looks to further expand its overseas MRO business.",

Martin Hans Sinke, age 48, was the chief officer and in charge of the navigation which was moving the vessel from the Western Anchorage to the SDT Engineering Marine Tuas shipyard. Eric Peijpers, age 56, was the second engineer, and Merijn Heidema, age 26, was third engineer. Each admitted to one charge under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.\nThe dredgerVox Maxima(43,400 dwt) was underway on June 14 in Singapore harbor when the vessel lost propulsion and steering causing it to strike the docked bunker tankerMarine Honour(9,000 dwt) while it was alongside another vessel at the Pasir Panjang Terminal. One of the bunker vessel’s tanks was ripped open and an estimated 400 tons of fuel oil leaked into the harbor and fouled the shoreline in sensitive environmental areas.\nProsecutors told the court the clean-up took more than two months. They said the full extent is being analyzed. TheMarine Honouris still undergoing repairs with an estimated cost of US$5 million. According to the reports, at least six of the vessel’s ballast tanks, 10 cargo tanks, and a slop tank all suffered damage.\nPrevious reports said the dredge had lost steering and propulsion during the incident with the details coming out during the court hearings. On the morning of June 14, the engineers on watch were conducting maintenance work while the vessel was at anchor, and they opened a circuit breaker on the high-voltage switchboard stopping power to the step-down transformer on the starboard side of the vessel.\nAt noon the watch changed in the engine room and Peijpers and Heidema came on duty and they were told the vessel needed to be ready to move at 1:30 p.m. local time to the shipyard. They switched the vessel from its auxiliary generator to the main generators to prepare for the navigation, but prosecutors said they failed to perform their duties and did not realize the circuit breaker was still open. The only electrical power was coming from the port side generator because the circuit breaker had remained open.\nUnderway, the vessel’s two hydraulic pumps started to draw power and then the second came online it overloaded the port side circuit breaker shutting down all power to the low-voltage equipment. The vessel lost control as its controllable pitch propellers and rudders lost power.\nThe prosecutors alleged that the master Ouwehand and chief officer Sinke failed to properly engage emergency steering.\nThe Vox Maxima just missed hitting one vessel, the 15,000-dwt product tanker Super Hero. The report said the crew of the tanker was able to alter speed and course to avoid a collision. However, the out-of-controlVox Maximathen plowed into theMarine Honour.\nProsecutors told the court that the master and chief officer should each be fined between US$15,000 and US$22,500. The recommendation for the two engineers was that each should be fined between US$30,000 and US$37,500. They were facing a maximum penalty of up to two years in jail and fines of up to approximately US$37,5000 each.\nThe court has scheduled the sentencing for April 2.",

    "input": "\nThe Canadian Port of Vancouver reported a very strong performance last year as its cargo throughput hit record highs. The port is also looking to capitalize on its position as a possible port of entry for increased Chinese and Asia trade due to the uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and Donald Trump’s plan to impose port fees on Chinese-built ships.\nVancouver Fraser Port Authority (VFPA) reported a strong performance in 2024 that saw overall cargo volumes hit a record 158 million metric tonnes, a five percent increase compared to the previous record of 150 million MT set in 2023. The growth, which was achieved despite a challenging environment, was a result of an increase in volumes across all segments including auto, bulk, and container.\nDuring the year, Vancouver and other Canadian ports had to contend with numerous challenges including labor disputes, local and global geopolitical tensions, climate change, and extreme weather such as wildfires. Despite the challenges, Vancouver cemented its status as Canada’s biggest facilitator of international trade with the bulk sector leading in terms of volume growth with an eight percent increase to 117.9 million MT.\nVancouver is highlighting that the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline and Westridge terminal unlocked new markets across Asia for Canadian petroleum products, something that saw liquid bulk exports surge by an unprecedented 203 percent to 17.1 million MT. Dry bulk however posted a four percent decline to 96 million MT driven by a fall in coal and potash exports.\n\n\nCMA CGM's containership completed the first LNG bunkering in Vancouver on March 9 (Seaspan)\n\nContainer trade recovered throughout 2024, returning to pre-pandemic growth trends following several tumultuous years that included a pandemic-era surge in consumer demand and numerous supply chain disruptions. This resulted in Vancouver’s four container terminals handling 3.5 million TEU, up 11 percent compared to 2023 and a two percent increase compared to 2019.\nGrowth was also recorded in the RoRo segment, with a record of almost 470,000 vehicles handled by auto terminals.\nDuring the year, the top trading partners that moved goods through the port were China with 46 million MT, Japan with 19 million MT, and South Korea with 18 million MT. Trade to the U.S. through the port increased to seven percent of total cargo moved amounting to 10 million MT driven by increased petroleum exports.\nWhile the performance shows that Canada’s biggest port which handles trade of approximately C$300 billion (US$208 billion) with up to 170 countries every year is on a growth trajectory, trade uncertainties ignited by tariff wars could impact the port’s activities going forward. Confusion continues to engulf a 25 percent tariff imposed on certain Canadian goods by President Trump, something that has forced Canada to retaliate.\n“The Port of Vancouver stands ready to support efforts to diversify Canada’s international trade and build a strong, resilient national economy. We will continue partnering with governments and industry to plan and deliver the long-term capacity needed to support trade through the gateway,” said Peter Xotta, VFPA President and CEO.\nApart from cargo, Vancouver also cemented its position as a critical cruise facility with passenger visits hitting a record 1.3 million, a seven percent increase from 1.2 million in 2023.\nLast week, Seaspan Energy reports it successfully completed Canada’s first ship-to-ship LNG bunkering for a containership in the Port of Vancouver. It took place on March 9 in English Bay. The LNG was provided to theCMA CGM Pointe Du Piton, a 7,900 TEU containership that was built in 2024 by HD Hyundai Samho by theSeaspan Garibaldi, one of three LNG bunkering vessels recently introduced by Seaspan. The company started its Pacific Coast LNG bunkering operation in December 2024 and brining it to Vancouver is seen as another factor supporting the growth of the port.\nTo sustain growth going into the future, Vancouver has been undertaking significant investments to improve operations and efficiency. These include expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline and Westridge terminal, densification, and modernization at Global Container Terminal’s Vanterm terminal increasing container handling capacity. The efforts are also enabling larger container ships to berth at the port.",

    "input": "\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Academy’s now well-publicized sexual assault scandal and the cover-up known as Operation Fouled Anchor is back in the spotlight with news that seven additional complaints have been filed. The law firm representing all the complainants, Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight reports it has filed a total of 29 complaints as the victims rush to file before a pending deadline.\nIn the seven new complaints, the individuals who were either cadets or prospective cadets of the Coast Guard Academy allege they were sexually assaulted either while in the dorm rooms, other USCG locations, or in one case an instructor’s home. As with the earlier complaints, some allege they were assaulted by classmates who entered their dorm rooms without permission while they were sleeping. In some cases, there are allegations that cadets had been drinking despite the Academy's strict policy against underage consumption of alcohol. Some of the cases were older, higher-ranking members of the service who are alleged to have taken advantage of cadets.\nThe scandal went public in June 2023 with anexposé by CNN. It recounted the years of sexual incidents at the Academy and how senior officers had ignored or purposefully hidden complaints. It also exposed that the Coast Guard had starting in 2014 conducted an internal investigation known as Operation Fowled Anchor but purposefully hid it and failed to reveal it to Congress.\n“Additional Coast Guard Academy sexual assault survivors continue to reach out to me,” said Christine Dunn, Partner and Co-Chair of the Sexual Violence at the law firm. Dunn along with Associate Jillian Seymour and Ryan Melogy of the New York law firm Maritime Legal Solutions, are handling the cases. “I’ve heard story after story of the sexual violence they endured at the Academy and how the Academy turned a blind eye,” said Dunn. “The Coast Guard can no longer be allowed to sweep sexual assault under the rug.”\nThe law firm says it believes the case to be the first known collective action by sexual violence survivors against a U.S. service academy. Each of the divisions of the military as well as the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy have faced charges of sexual assault. In one of the most famous cases, known as the Tailhook Scandal, U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviation officers were alleged to have sexually assaulted up to 83 women and seven men during a 1991 event in Las Vegas, Nevada. Protections against sexual assault have become a cornerstone issue for Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and others.\nOne of the challenges the complaints face is a complex legal process in which they must first file administrative claims under the Federal Torts Claims Act. Today, the seven new cases were filed against the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security which now oversees the Coast Guard, and the Department of Transportation which formerly had oversight of the Coast Guard.\nUnder the process, the government has six months to review the filings. Only then can the claimants move to file suit. However, there is a two-year statute of limitations for FTCA claims. The lawyers seek to get around this by claiming the extent of the sexual assaults and the cover-up only became public with the CNN investigation in 2023 and subsequent hearings in the U.S. Congress.\nThe Congress has been highly critical of the Coast Guard and its leadership for the handling of the scandal and failure to bring it to a close. In addition to faulting the USCG for failing to properly investigate and pursue allegations, Congress has proposed new regulations related to cadet safety. The Coast Guard Reauthorization Act calls for new mandates including requiring the Academy to install electronic locking mechanisms to secure cadet rooms and common spaces. The lawyers have accused the Academy of enabling the behavior by having a rule barring cadets from locking their dorm rooms.“Decades of documented moral failures by leaders of the U.S. Coast Guard have made it clear to Congress, the public, and survivors that the agency is unwilling to take steps needed to protect Coast Guard Academy cadets from systemic sexual abuse,” said attorney Ryan Melogy. “It has become obvious that only outside pressure can lead to change.”\nDunn and the Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight law firm reported it was filing the first complaints, from 12 women and one man who had attended the Academy in September 2023. In September and October 2024, Sanford Heisler filed similar FTCA complaints on behalf of additional sexual assault survivors, and with today’s filings, bring the total number of former Academy cadets represented by the firm to 29.\nIn January 2025, the new Trump administration ousted Admiral Linda Fagan, Commandant of the Coast Guard, in part due to her focus on DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). Admiral Kevin E. Lunday assumed the duties of Acting Commandant and will face the challenge of addressing what many see as a long-running, systemic problem that is yet to be fully addressed.",

    "input": "After initially saying it would not comment on a “commercial deal,” the Chinese government used the media to lash out at the deal and criticize CK Hutchison. The proposed sale involves operations in 43 global ports outside China and the terminals at each side of the Panama Canal but is becoming embroiled in the larger political debate and the trade war between Trump and China as well as the government’s criticism of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing who controls CK Hutchison.\nThe government-owned newspaper Ta Kung Pao based in Hong Kong and seen as a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party released a strongly worded editorial on Thursday, March 13, attacking the deal on patriotic terms. It cites the Trump administration's moves on tariffs and pending proposal for port fees on Chinese-built ships rolling it all into an American plot for domination. They warn the deal is part of a plot to deprive China of access to key shipping routes and global trade.\nThe New York Times highlights that the article says if the deal is completed, “the United States will definitely use it for political purposes and promote its own political agenda. China’s shipping and trade there will inevitably be subject to the United States.”\nThe reports cite that there has been a growing strain between Li Ka-shing and the Communist government which views him as supporting rival positions. The article calls CK Hutchison which said it would make $19 billion on the deal “profit-seeking,” and says it is “spineless groveling,” as well as a betrayal of the Chinese people.\nSaying that the deal goes against national interests, the editorial warns that the company “should think twice,” and “carefully,” about its position and where it stands. Official government sources quickly reposted the article which was seen as a further government endorsement of the positions.\nAnalysts said it was not surprising that China would speak out against the deal but it might just be bluster as it does not want to lose its position in major ports such as Felixstowe in the UK, Rotterdam, Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia. CK Hutchison however would retain its Chinese ports meaning China does not have to approve the deal.\nThe sale of the two terminals in Panama at Balboa and Cristobal was positioned as a parallel but separate transaction. The government of Panama has already said it would be reviewing the sale and now Bloomberg speculates that Panama might use China’s criticism to reject the sale. Trump hailed the BlackRock deal as a key component to regaining control of the Panama Canal but NBC News reported yesterday Trump has also asked for plans to place a U.S. military presence in Panama possibly to seize the canal.\nThe terms of the sale are for a partnership with BlackRock and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company’s Terminal Investment Limited (TiL). MSC has taken a low profile in the media creating the impression that the deal is BlackRock’s.\nHutchison has not responded to the criticism of the deal but the value of its stock plunged as investors feared the sale might not proceed. The company had set the beginning of April as a target for a final agreement.",

    "input": "Hours after reports surfaced that Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was rejecting Donald Trump’s overtures for new talks, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced a new round of sanctions targeting the oil industry and tankers. The move by the Office of Foreign Assets Control comes as the Trump administration has vowed a campaign of “maximum pressure” against Iran.\nIt was widely reported last week that Donald Trump had sent a letter via the United Arab Emirates to Khamenei seeking to start a new dialogue regarding Iran’s nuclear program. When asked by reporters, Trump last Friday only said “good things” are going to happen very soon. Today, however, Iranian media reports Khamenei dismissed the idea of negotiations referencing Trump’s decision during his first term to withdraw from the prior agreement.\n“The Iranian regime continues to use the proceeds from the nation’s vast oil resources to advance its narrow, alarming self-interests at the expense of the Iranian people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent announcing today’s designations. “Treasury will fight and disrupt any attempts by the regime to fund its destabilizing activities and further its dangerous agenda.”\nThe U.S. asserts that Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum is allotting 20,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the military. Further, they said the allotment would be increased to over 500,000 barrels per day. The U.S. asserts that half of Iran’s oil revenues will be going to its armed forces by the end of 2025.\nToday’s action designated Iran’s recently appointed Minister of Petroleum, Mohsen Paknejad, who assumed the role in August 2024. The U.S. said he is responsible for masterminding the oil operations and allotting the oil to the Iranian military to supplement its funding.\nThe U.S. also designated 13 additional tankers, including one registered in Iran and others registered internationally. The U.S. alleges the vessels are being used to transport oil from Iran or lift Iranian oil from storage in Dalian, China. Some of the oil is being transported to China or distributed to others in Asia. The tankers are said to be manipulating their AIS signals to disguise efforts to ship Iranian crude oil.\nThe vessels named include the Iran-flaggedPolaris 1, as well as Peace Hill (Hong Kong), Seasky (San Marino), Corona Fun (Panama), Neso (Panama), Lexi (Cameroon), Itaugua (Cameroon), Lydya N (Palau), Blue Gulf (Palau),Shannon II (Barbados),Malili(Indonesia),Celebes(Indonesia), andMarina Vision(Indonesia).\nThe effort also targeted a range of companies including ones in China and India. It lists companies in Hong Kong, Singapore, Seychelles, Suriname, and Bangladesh that it says are facilitating the oil trades or operating the tankers.\nJust weeks after returning to office, Trump announced thefirst round of sanctionson Iran targeting an additional 13 tankers. Since then, it has been reported in the media that the administration was looking at other ways of interrupting Iran’s oil trade, including possiblylaunching inspectionson tankers at sea under regulations designed to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nLast month, TankerTrackers.com highlighted that the U.S. so far has only sanctioned less than half of the tankers known to be involved in Iran’s oil trade. They calculated that over 500 tankers are working with Iran.",

    "input": "Norwegian Cruise Line took delivery on its next cruise ship today, March 13, from Fincantieri in Italy. It is the third ship of the class of six being built by Fincantieri with the fourth ship scheduled to float out from the building dock tomorrow.\nNorwegian Aquawhich was delivered today is part of what the company is calling its Prima Plus class as the vessel is 10 percent larger than the first two ships,Norwegian PrimaandNorwegian Viva, which were introduced in 2022 and 2023. The ships are all based on a design developed by Fincantieri that opens the ship up to the sea with larger windows and places the promenade deck lower. It uses other design features such as a strait prow to improve sea handling and places machinery midship for improved handling and efficiency.\nThe new ship is 1,056 feet (322 meters) in length and 156,300 gross tons compared to the first two ships which are 143,535 gross tons and 965 feet (294 meters).  The enlarging of the design involves adding a midbody section to the vessel to increase the length and adding nearly 500 passenger berths for a capacity of 3,571 passengers onNorwegian Aqua. The enlarged design permitted an increase in the size of the suite enclave on the ship known as The Haven.\nThe ship also incorporates new design elements. Among these are a hybrid rollercoaster and waterslide and a new high-tech digital sports complex. It also has an entertainment space filled with immersive and virtual reality games. The ship features a wrap-around promenade with dining and lounge spaces known as Ocean Boulevard as well as the now standard variety of specialty restaurants.\n\"Norwegian Aquais more than just a ship—it’s a commitment to our guests that we will continue to push boundaries and deliver MORE at sea,\" said David J. Herrera, president of Norwegian Cruise Line. \"From thrilling attractions like the Aqua Slidecoaster to the debut of Sukhothai, our first Thai specialty restaurant, Norwegian Aqua is designed to create unforgettable moments for the whole family.”\n\n\nThe fourth ship of the class, Norwegian Luna will be floated from the building dock on March 14 (Fincantieri)\n\nThe new cruise ship is starting with sailings in Europe and will embark on a transatlantic journey from Southampton, England, on March 28, 2025. She will arrive in the U.S. on April 4, for two inaugural events in Boston and New York City before being christened in Miami on April 13. During her first year of service,Norwegian Aquawill sail from Miami and Port Canaveral, Florida, as well as New York City.\nTomorrow, March 14, her sister shipNorwegian Lunawill be floated out from her building dock also at Fincantieri’s yard in Marghera near Venice. The fourth ship of the class is due to enter service in the spring of 2026. Two additional ships, which will again be 10 percent larger and are being built methanol-ready are due for delivery in 2027. Norwegian also recently confirmed its next generation of 200,000-ton plus cruise ships to be built at Fincantieri.\nWith a gross tonnage of approximately 226,000 tons, the next class will be the largest ever built for Norwegian. The ships will be built at the Fincantieri Monfalcone shipyard, with the first ship to be delivered in 2030 and the others to follow in 2032, 2034, and 2036. With over 5,100 berths, the ships will be able to accommodate over 8,300 people, including crew.",

Additional milestones were achieved for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind as the project prepares for its next phase of installation.\nWhile the offshore wind energy industry is beleaguered in the United States, Dominion Energy has emphasized that its project remains on schedule. It will begin the second phase of its installation in May.\nThis week, Dominion highlighted that DEME Group completed the lifting and installation of the first of three offshore substations for the project. DEME’s large install vessel Orion shifted from the other portion of the project for the massive lift. The station, which had arrived in Virginia at the end of January, weighed 4,300 tons. It was the first topside installation on to one of the jackets marketing the next milestone for the project which commenced offshore work nearly a year ago.\n\n\nThe 4,300-ton substation arrived in Virginia in January and this week was moved into position (Dominion Energy)\n\nOrionis now resuming the installation of transition pieces. As of February, Dominion highlighted that 16 transition pieces were in place after Orion completed the installation of the first 78 monopile foundations between May and November 2024. The second phase of monopile foundations begins this spring and when completed the wind farm will consist of 176 wind turbines. It will have a capacity for 2.6 GW of electrical energy.\nThe Port of Virginia working with New York-based construction company Skanska also highlighted this week that work is now complete at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal for the staging and berths for the wind operations. Skanska completed a $233 million redevelopment of 72 acres and 1,500 feet of wharf.\nThe project included constructing three heavy lift berths, a berth for wind turbine delivery and load-out, and a berth for the monopiles and other equipment. Large areas were also prepared for storing and staging the elements of the project.\n\n\n\nDominion reported in February that work was underway on wind turbine tower and blade fabrication with nacelle fabrication also scheduled to begin. Fabricated monopiles, transition pieces, undersea cables, and other major components also continue to be delivered to Portsmouth and staged as the project proceeds.\nThe project has reached the 50 percent mark toward completion. Dominion Energy has said it remains on track for on-time completion at the end of 2026.",

    "input": "A steamship that was reputed to be one of the fastest and safest vessels afloat but which broke into pieces after encountering a gale has been discovered in Lake Superior, some 132 years after her sinking. The wreck of the vessel known asWestern Reservewas discovered some 60 miles northwest of Whitefish Point in Lake Superior.\nTheWestern Reservewas a 300-foot all-steel cargo ship that had a short career but which left a lasting mark on the industry even following her sinking in August 1892 causing the death of 27 with only one survivor. Built just two years earlier for millionaire Captain Peter G. Minch, a highly respected shipping magnate, the steamer was one of the first all-steel vessels on the Great Lakes.\nHistorical accounts indicated that the steamer was built at a time when Minch and other shipping magnates were pioneering the industrialization of bulk carrier freight service on the Great Lakes. Her steel construction made it possible forWestern Reserveto carry heavier loads of freight than her wooden rival steamships.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, theWestern Reservewas admired as a pioneer. Apart from being deemed one of the safest ships afloat, she was also designed to break cargo shipping records. She earned the description of being “the inland greyhound” for her outright speed on the lakes.\nIronically, the fate that was to befallWestern Reservewould occur when the ship was not transporting cargo but on a leisure voyage. In August 1892 Minch decided to take his family aboard the ship for a late-summer cruise up through Lake Huron en route to Two Harbors in Minnesota.\nWhile the weather was pleasant and Captain Albert Myer had assured Minch and his family of a smooth voyage, things started to unfold when the vessel reached Whitefish Bay. Rough weather prompted the crew to drop anchor to await better conditions. Soon after they weighed anchor and steamed into Lake Superior, where a gale overtook the ship, battered her, and caused her to break and sink. Desperate efforts to attempt survival using lifeboats proved futile, with wheelsman Harry W. Stewart being the only survivor after swimming a mile to shore after his lifeboat capsized.\n\n\n\nFor about two years, explorers at the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) have been trying to locate the wreck ofWestern Reserve. In July last year, the society’s marine operations director Darryl Ertel and his brother Dan Ertel made the initial discovery aboard research vesselDavid Boydusing sonar technology. Subsequent ROV deployments confirmed the identity of the shipwreck, revealing a ship broken in two, with the bow section resting on top of the stern in approximately 600 feet of water.\n“Every shipwreck has its own story, but some are just that much more tragic,” said Bruce Lynn, GLSHS Executive Director. “It is hard to imagine that Captain Peter G. Minch would have foreseen any trouble when he invited his wife, two young children, and sister-in-law with her daughter aboard theWestern Reservefor a summer cruise up the lakes. It just reinforces how dangerous the Great Lakes can be…any time of year.”\nTheWestern Reserveis the latest shipwreck to be discovered in Lake Superior where more than 550 undiscovered wrecks are believed to be lying on the seabed.\n\n\n\n",

    "input": "\nThe annual Iranian-hosted Exercise Maritime Security Belt with the participation of Russian and Chinese ships got underway on March 11 concluded on March 15. The exercise took place in the waters off Chahbahar on Iran’s eastern border with Pakistan. This was the seventh iteration of the exercise.\nThe exercise featured three phases of activity: an assembly and preparation phase, a maritime drill phase and a harbor summary lessons-learned phase, concluding with the customary fleet review. The overnight maritime phase - which will have been a boon to Iranian sailors fasting for Ramadan - included practicing offensive actions against maritime targets, visit/board/search and seizure operations, damage control procedures, and joint search and rescue drills.\nGiven the sea time needed to assemble the participating fleet, with the Chinese deploying from Djibouti and the Russians from Vladivostok, the active part of the exercise was extremely short, almost symbolic in character, emphasizing that the exercise had greater political significance this year than in previous years.\nSensing pressure from the new Trump administration, Iran has been seeking to strengthen its defense alliances, in the hope that they will provide some restraint to direct action against Iran’s nuclear weapons development programmer and ballistic missile capability. Both these capabilities were damaged by recent Israeli direct action, but remain largely intact and extant as a threat, with senior Iranian officers promising that Exercise True Promise-3, the next attack on Israel, will go ahead and has been scheduled.\nThere will also be fears in Iran that both Russia and China may have much more to gain by doing deals with the Trump administration, rather than persisting with support for Iran - which in overall terms could be seen as a cost rather than a benefit. Russia benefits - particularly while the Ukraine war continues - from Iranian shipments of missiles and drones, and China enjoys cheap Iranian oil. But the cost of being Iran’s best friends is to be associated with Iranian expansionism across the Middle East, adventurism which damages both American interests but also other regional countries which both Russia and China have far more profitable and productive relationships with. Chinese support for Iran has in any case always had some limitations. The Trump administration has been forthright in its determination to close down the threat from Iran, but less demonstrative about the threat posed by Russia. This all makes the Iranians nervous.\nHolding the exercise in the waters off Iran’s Sistan-Baluchistan also speaks to the threat posed by continuing separatist unrest in the province which is claiming a steady stream of Iranian security force casualties. While the insurgency is largely supported from across the land border from Pakistan, which has its own problems with Baluch separatists, Iran claims the insurgency is supported by unidentified foreign backers. Hence signaling an improved coastal defenses and surveillance capability to deter arms smuggling in this area will be a priority. China also has an interest in security in Baluchistan, as Chinese economic and commercial assets working on Belt and Road Initiatives have been subject to terrorist attacks in the area in the recent past.\nChinese participation came from the 47 th Naval Escort Group which commenced its deployment to Djibouti in December. The ships deployed were the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Baotou (F113) and the Type 903A replenishment ship Gaoyouhu (K904). The Chinese normally deploy three ships for this exercise, so representation this year was smaller than previously.\nThe Russian contingent for the exercise as expected consisted of the Steregushchiy Class Project 20380 missile corvettes Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov (F339) and Rezkiy (F343), plus the oiler Pechenga (IMO 7710977). On March 4 this flotilla from the Vladivostok-based Pacific Fleet concluded a live firing exercise in the Eastern Indian Ocean, en route to Chahbahar for the exercise.\nIranian vessels deployed consisted mainly of the ships which participated in a naval fleet review off Bandar Abbas on February 26, led by the Alvand and Moudge Class frigates IRINS Alvand (F71) and IRINS Jamaran (F76) and the obsolescent IRINS Bayandor (F81), with a number of fast attack missile boats. The IRGC Navy was represented by the catamaran missile corvette Shahid Soleimani (PC313-01). The converted oil tanker Shahid Bagheri (C110-4) did not put in an appearance as was expected, tending to confirm reports that is not yet operationally viable as a platform for launching drones.\nNaval staff from Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates attended the exercise as observers.",

The Netherlands released an image of the missile as it was launched from the frigateDe Ruyter.\nBuilt by Damen and commissioned in 2004, the frigate is one of four deployed by the Dutch. It is 6,000 tons displacement with an operating speed of 30 knots. The Dutch have announced plans to extend the life of the class at least for another decade with the modernization of systems.\nThe Dutch announced in 2023 plans to acquire the U.S. missile system for the frigates as well as its submarines. The U.K. has already deployed the system and in December 2024 Australia test fired its first Tomahawk from HMASBrisbanewhile off the U.S. West Coast. Australia and Japan have also placed orders for the system for future deployment.\n\n\nAustralia conducted its first test firing of the Tomahawk in December off San Diego (Australian Defence Force)\n\n“With this launch, the navy is gathering necessary information,” said the Netherlands’ Defense Ministry, “This will eventually allow it to fire Tomahawks from the air defense and command frigates.” Media reports have said the Netherlands expects to deploy the system in 2027.\nThe Ministry highlighted that the weapons would give the Royal Navy extra combat power and greater distance. The missiles have a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n“Think of command centers, anti-aircraft installations, and enemy units,” said the Ministry.

The police said they were leading the investigation of any potential criminal offenses after it was reported that a Filipino crewmember, Mark Angelo Pernia, age 38, was missing and presumed deceased.

They called it a complex investigation and returned to the court on Wednesday to get a 36-hour extension and again on Thursday for a further 24-hour extension.\n“Additional time has been imperative to the investigation due to the complexities of the incident with the vessels in the sea, the number of witnesses involved, and establishing any scenes to collate and gather information and evidence,” the police said on Thursday.\nThe Prosecution Service cautioned against speculation to protect Motin’s rights to a fair trial. A spokesperson for the containership's owner said in a statement that it would be \"inappropriate for us to comment on ongoing police investigations. We are fully supporting the crew and assisting the investigation into the incident.\"\nHM Coastguard reported on Friday that the situation aboard both vessels remained stable as salvage teams were planning for the next steps.

They are focusing on the market potential as a transitional fuel for power plans and the maritime sector as well as a hydrogen carrier.\nMitsubishi Shipbuilding, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, and Namura Shipbuilding have been working to develop a basic design for a large ammonia carrier. They report that the vessel is intended to have an engine that utilizes ammonia as the main fuel source, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the vessel. In addition, the rendering incorporates the rigid sail system, Wind Challenger, which was developed by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Oshima Shipbuilding Co. and first deployed in 2022.\nThe ship is designed to be even larger than the conventional segment for Very Large Gas Carrier/Very Large Ammonia Carrier (VLGC/VLAC) vessels. According to the project, this will enhance the efficiency of marine transport.\nThe revolutionary ship design they report satisfies the port entry restrictions at major power plants in Japan. It ensures compatibility between ammonia loading/unloading terminals, and cargo handling connections at a level almost equivalent to existing VLGCs.\nIt is anticipated that the first vessels could be built in the second half of this decade.",

It was the final leg of her annual deployment to Antarctica as part of the resupply mission known as Operation Deep Freeze.\nThe vessel left California in late December carrying 327 containers of dry cargo as well as a temporary floating Marine Causeway System for the U.S. base McMurdo Station in Antarctica. Operation command highlights the vessel along with a second ship,Ocean Gladiator, transport about 80 percent of the items needed for survival over the severe Antarctic winter when the station is cut off from the rest of the world. The supply mission was started in 1955 and conducted each year time for access to the base.\nOcean Giantfirst traveled to the U.S. support base in Lyttelton, New Zealand where it resupplied and took on additional cargo bound for McMurdo Station. When it reached its destination teams first had to deploy the causeway system which was used to replace the traditional ice pier which had been deemed unusable this year.\nIn total, 380 pieces of cargo, which included containers filled with mechanical parts, vehicles, construction materials, office supplies, and electronics equipment were offloaded fromOcean Giantin the Antarctic. The ship then loads station waste and recyclables and other materials for transport back to California. It made a resupply stop in New Zealand, departing on February 19 for California. It will now offload the materials brought back from Antarctica to complete the annual mission.\nThe second vessel,Ocean Gladiator, followed the same route arriving in Antarctica at the station on February 20 delivering a further 321 pieces of cargo. She was carrying containers filled with mechanical parts, vehicles, construction materials including cement pilings for a pier project, food, electronics equipment, and comfort items for the teams at McMurdo Station.\nOcean Gladiatordeparted Lyttelton, New Zealand yesterday, March 13. Her AIS signal shows she is bound for Yokohama, Japan.\nThe mission concluded for this year at the beginning of March. The icebreakerPolar Stardeparted McMurdo after having assisted the two cargo ships and conducting other assignments. It marked her 49th year of service.\nThe Military Sealift Command reports planning will begin for the next Operation Deep Freeze.

    "input": "The International Combined Task Force 150 is continuing with efforts to tackle illicit activities in the waters of the Middle East. The task force, which is currently under the command of New Zealand reported the seizure of a total of 318 kilograms of heroin and 83 kilograms conducted by the Royal Navy’s frigate HMSLancaster.\nThe Royal Navy highlights that the illicit activity was first detected by its new Peregrine remote-controlled mini-helicopters while the frigate was on its patrol. The operators of one of the drones detected suspicious activity during a night flight when they saw two boats side-by-side in the Arabian Sea.\nThis prompted the launch of the frigate’s Wildcat helicopter for further investigation. The crews observed packages being transferred between a small craft and a dhow. The frigate made its way to the location at full speed while the team waited for daybreak. Teams were sent on the frigate’s fast boats for the interdiction.\n\n\nLancaster's crew retrieving the packages the smugglers tossed overboard\n\nThe smugglers however attempted to evade capture by getting rid of their illegal haul reports the Royal Navy. The small boats began dumping packages overboard. The crew ofLancasterhowever was able to recover the packages, which were subsequently tested and confirmed to be illegal narcotics. The interdiction by the Duke-class frigate was the first for the Royal Navy in 2025.\nThe Royal Navy highlights thatLancaster’s capabilities in fighting smugglers and drug runners were enhanced through the uncrewed Peregrine air system which was only introduced into operations at the end of 2024. Peregrine is the first remotely piloted helicopter operated by the Royal Navy. At just three meters long, the drone is capable of sorties lasting up to five hours and is suited for long and demanding surveillance missions.\n\n\nRoyal Marines from HMS Lancaster boarding the dhow\n\n“I am really pleased that Lancaster has been able to demonstrate the utility of a tailored air group consisting of the Wildcat helicopter and recently procured uncrewed Peregrine air systems in a combined 24-hour deck cycle to achieve persistent surveillance and beat illicit drug runners in the region,” said Sam Stephens, commanding officer of HMSLancaster.\nThe interdiction was the second for CTF 150 since New Zealand assumed command in mid-January. Last month, the U.S. Coast Guard cutterEmlen Tunnellseized nearly 2,357 kilograms of hashish aboard a dhow off the coast of Oman. CTF150 says its mission has been vital in tackling drug trafficking on the so-called “Hash Highway” covering the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Indian Ocean, and Gulf of Oman.\nThe Royal New Zealand Navy frigate HMNZSTE Kahais scheduled to join CTF 150 later this month. The last time New Zealand contributed a ship to CTF150 was a decade ago whenTe Kahaoperated under a French-led operation. At that time, the frigate intercepted, confiscated, and destroyed 257 kilograms of heroin.",

The Humberside Police reported on Friday that they had officially charged him with gross negligence manslaughter and remanded him to police custody after announcing the arrest of the 59-year-old on Tuesday, March 11.\nVladimir Motin of Primorsky, St Petersburg, in Russia, appeared Saturday morning, March 15, in a court in Hull, England for the formal reading of the charges. Reports said he appeared with an interpreter and did not enter a plea. The court ordered him held and set a hearing for April 14 at the Central Criminal Court known in the UK as the “Old Bailey.”\nDuring the hearing which lasted less than an hour, prosecutor Amelia Katz provided the first details surrounding the incident. She told the court Motin had taken the watch about three hours before the allision and was in command when the containership hit the tanker. She told the court records show the vessel was traveling at a speed above 15 knots.\nReuters quotes the prosecutor as telling the court, \"For a period of over 40 minutes before the collision, theSolongwas on a direct route for impact with theStena Immaculate, which was anchored and stationary. There were no communication attempts from theSolongto warn of the impending collision and theSolongdid not adjust its course or speed at any point.\"\nFrank Ferguson, Head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, said yesterday in a statement that they had authorized the charging of Motin. He noted that Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia, age 38 and a crewmember on theSolong, was missing and presumed to have died during the collision and subsequent fires. His death promoted the manslaughter charge.\n“The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against this defendant are now active and that he has the right to a fair trial,” Ferguson said in his statement. “It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary, or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”\nFriday evening, a spokesperson for the owners of the containership, Ernst Russ, told The Maritime Executive, \"It would?be inappropriate for us to comment on ongoing police investigations. We are fully supporting the crew and assisting?the investigation into the incident.\"\nThere have been no additional updates regarding the status of the two vessels after Friday’s report from HM Coastguard that said they remained stable while salvage teams were planning the next steps. Small fires were still periodically appearing on theSolongbut HM Coastguard said they were “not causing undue concern.”\nTheSolongis being held in position by a tow line. There has been some speculation online that an effort would be made to tow the ship out of the North Sea although it has not yet been confirmed by any of the authorities. The Stena Immaculate remains where it anchored on Sunday, March 9, more than 15 hours before it was struck by the Solong.",

    "input": "\nMVJairan, the second of two Iranian cargo vessels which is believed to have loaded sodium perchlorate in China, was on Saturday morning passing through the Straits of Malacca en route to Bandar Abbas. Sodium perchlorate is the primary feedstock for making ammonium perchlorate, used by Iranian solid-fueled ballistic missiles.\nThe vessel, which is owned by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) and is subject to secondary US Treasury sanctions, is expected to dock in Bandar Abbas well before its scheduled arrival time on March 26, and is currently traveling with its Automatic Identification System switched on.\nThe 16,694 ton MVJairanis believed to have taken on a cargo of 24 containers loaded with sodium perchlorate, enough to refine sufficient ammonium perchlorate to fuel about 250 medium range missiles of the types used by Iran to attack Israel in Operations True Promise-1 and 2.\nIn the form it is being shipped, sodium perchlorate is classified in the United States as a hazardous product, with explosive risks and the health risks of breathing difficulties and kidney failure from fume exposure. Besides being the feedstock for ammonium perchlorate, it can also be used as an oxidizing agent in engraving processes and in the manufacture of livestock fattening agents. But as a dual use product, and specifically because it is being conveyed by IRISL, the shipment should fall under the provisions of UN Security Resolution 1929, which cautions states to be aware of IRISL’s sanctions-breaking activities and its role in supporting Iran’s missile development, manufacture and maintenance activities.\nSodium perchlorate is processed and fashioned into ammonium perchlorate rocket fuel at the Iranian facilities at Parchin south of Tehran and Khojir. Ammonium perchlorate makes up 70% of the standard fuel load of most of Iran’s solid-fueled ballistic missiles.\nIranian ballistic missiles which use ammonium perchlorate include medium range Khybar-Shikan and Fattah missiles, and the shorter range Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles. In original and variant form, these have been widely exported to Russia and Axis of Resistance allies, and have been used to attack shipping at sea and targets in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Israel and Ukraine, as well as in the attacks causing injuries to American service personnel at Al Asad in Iraq.\nIllustrative of the uses to which ammonium perchlorate is put to in its solid fuel missiles, and the threat which it poses, in February last year the Iranian news agency Tasnim showed video of two containerized solid-fuel Zolfaghar missiles being fired from the deck of the IRGC’sShahid Mahdavi(Pennant 110-3) in the Gulf of Oman.\nThis missile has also been used by the Houthis to attack Aramco oil facilities at Ras Tanura. From theShahid Mahdaviand its sister ships, the Zolfaghar also has a mobile and wide-ranging anti-shipping capability.\nIran is likely to be seriously short of ammonium perchlorate at present, enough to take the risk of interdiction while shipping the material and the risk of causing political embarrassment to China - which currently is keen to protect its negotiating position with the United States over tariffs. Iran’s own ballistic missile domestic fuel production facilities have been damaged in Israeli attacks, and output demands are high because of the need to replace stocks expended in attacks on Israel and to meet increased exports to Russia.\nThe MVJairanis believed to be travelling without escorts at present, and by traveling with its Automatic Identification System switched on, it clearly believes that nobody has the political will to intercept the ship - notwithstanding efforts by eight US senators to press the US Department of State into taking action. As it closes on Iran, the MVJairanhas passed through the Straits of Malacca where it was particularly vulnerable, and as it travels towards the northern Indian Ocean it will soon acquire cover from the regular Iranian navy, which has in recent months has increased its naval presence in this sea space.",

As the Gaza ceasefire teeters on the verge of collapse, the group has threatened to renew attacks on merchant shipping in the Red Sea - initially focused on Israeli-linked vessels.\nIn a statement Sunday, Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree claimed that the group had targeted the American aircraft carrier USSHarry S. Trumanand her escorts with 18 missiles in retaliation for Saturday's airstrikes. \"The [Houthis] will not hesitate to target all American warships in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea in retaliation to the aggression against our country,\" Saree asserted.",

Three of the barges were lined up perpendicular to the shoreline, jacked up, and then connected using their bridging ramps to create an expeditionary \"pier\" extending far out into the water.\nVideopic.twitter.com/aSxP4gJOXo\nBeachfront photos and videos of these \"invasion barges\" have been circulating on Chinese social media since last week. Open-source analyst Damien Symon identified the new exercise location in Zhanjiang using background imagery and synthetic aperture radar.\nIt is not the first time that the unusual special-purpose jackups have been spotted by Western analysts. In January, H.I. Sutton (and others)noticedat least three of the unique vessels at Guangzhou Shipyard, and quickly identified them as amphibious logistics enablers - uniquely designed to bridge the surf zone and transfer high volumes of military cargo to a secured beachhead. The bridge section is hinged and affixed to the bow, and when lowered, it spans about 400 feet. Three of the barges installed back to back would reach a substantial distance offshore, well back from the surf zone into deeper water.\nLike the \"Mulberry Harbors\" installed in Normandy after D-Day, the vessels would likely be deployed after a successful amphibious assault secured a beachhead on hostile territory and established a defensive perimeter. In a cross-strait assault to retake Taiwan, they could open up a larger menu of possible invasion landing zones: if they function as designed, they would allow Chinese forces to deliver heavy military equipment ashore early in the conflict, without the need to seize a major seaport first - so long as the beachhead could be defended from a counterattack.\nThe U.S. Army/Navy equivalent to this system, Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), centers on a floating \"trident pier\" tethered to shore. A floating deck barge located offshore helps offload cargo from deep draft ro/ro ships; that cargo is rolled onto Army ro/ro landing craft; and the landing craft deliver the cargo the final mile to the end of the floating pier. This carefully orchestrated system was designed for calm waters, and it is fragile above Sea State 3, as demonstrated during therelief mission to Gazalast year. That operation wascalled offafter repeated setbacks in open-ocean weather conditions.\nThe Chinese \"invasion barges\" are elevated on jackup legs, and appear less vulnerable to wave action than the U.S. Navy/Army JLOTS system.",

After posting its most profitable year ever in 2024, with earnings of $850 million, it plans to invest $580 million in capital expenditures for 2025.\n“Our balance sheet remains strong, giving us the financial strength and flexibility to pursue new opportunities and invest in existing projects,” said ICTSI in a statement.\nSome of the planned projects in this round of financing include the new ICTSI terminal in Bauan, Batangas in Philippines. The construction of the Luzon International Container Terminal (LICT) was announced in October. With the funding now available, construction could begin in the second quarter. The $800 million terminal is scheduled to be completed in 2028 and will become the Philippines’ largest privately funded maritime terminal investment.\nAnother project planned for expansion is ICTSI’s Matadi Gateway Terminal (MGT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Last week, ICTSI said that it will be undertaking several key projects at the terminal this year, aimed at improving operational efficiency and customer service. One of the major initiatives is the construction of a 2.65-kilometer road linking the Port of Matadi to the national highway network. The first phase covering 1.75 kilometers was completed in June last year. The second phase began last month. Upon completion, the improved road access is expected to reduce container dwell times and streamline cargo deliveries to the port. Matadi is DRC’s main port serving the sprawling city of Kinshasa and the surrounding hinterland.\nOther terminals ICTSI is targeting for upgrades include completing the Phase 3 expansion of Mexico’s Contecon Manzanillo terminal in Colima. In addition, ICTSI is also pursuing equipment upgrades in its Rio Brasil Terminal, Brazil.\nMeanwhile, ICTSI is still battling with Maersk in a court case in South Africa over the operation of the Durban Container Terminal Pier 2 (DCT2). The hearing of the case proceeded in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court last week. Maersk, through its subsidiary APM Terminals, had moved to the court seeking review of Transnet’s decision to award ICTSI the concession for DCT2. APM Terminals cited irregularities in the awarding of the tender. While the case is nearing its conclusion, the terminal has been left without an operator for over one year. The concession is part of Transnet’s privatization initiative, aimed at resolving persistent port inefficiencies in Durban and other major ports across South Africa.",

The Coastguard is saying the pollution likely entered the water at the point of collision on March 10 and that a retrieval operation has begun in the developing situation.\nThe RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) identified the pollution reporting on Sunday that a sheen had been spotted on the water. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said an aerial survey confirmed the pollution which has now been identified as plastic nurdles (small plastic pellets). Today, the Coastguard is reporting observers have found the first clumps of burnt pellets washing ashore.\nNurdles are small pellets of plastic resin used in plastic production. They are sized between 1 and 5 mm and weigh less than a gram. The concern is that they pose a risk to wildlife and are especially challenging to clean up. Sri Lanka dealt with a large-scale clean-up effort in 2021 when the containershipX-Press Pearlburnt and sank off Colombo and a large quantity of nurdles washed ashore. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) moved in 2023 for new regulations on the transport of nurdles because of the pollution risks.\n\n\n\nHM Coastguard released pictures of the burnt clumps on the beach. The said retrieval has started today.\nNews of the first pollution came after U.S. shipping company Crowley, which operatedStena Immaculateunder charter for the U.S. government, reported salvage teams had found the damage was contained on the vessel. SMIT Salvage is handling the job and its teams reported that only one cargo tank and one ballast tank were breached when the vessel was hit.\nCrowley reports there was a total of 220,000 barrels of Jet-A1 fuel aboard. They now believe that 17,515 barrels were lost in the fire or leaked after the vessel was hit. The remaining cargo and the vessel’s bunkers are reported to be secure.\nThe company is crediting the crew of theStena Immaculatewith heroic actions as the fires were beginning. It said the crew had the presence of mind to activate fire monitors to provide boundary cooling water to the adjacent tanks.\nThe companies have warned that the salvage operation will be complex and that it will require time.

    "input": "\nA fire incident this week onboard a Chinese fishing vessel,Dae Jin,while berthed at Suva Harbor, Fiji has rekindled concerns on marine safety in the country. The 24-year-old Fiji flagged longliner is said to had just completed offloading its catch when the fire started in the engine room. Twelve crewmembers, including Chinese and Indonesian nationals were able to escape, although some reported minor injuries. Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) confirmed the incident and said an investigation has been launched to establish the cause of the fire. Fiji Ports Authority also dispatched a tug to tow the burnt vessel out of the port.\nHowever, this incident comes hot on the heels of a growing push to clean up dozens of fishing shipwrecks abandoned near Suva Harbor. As operational costs for the fishing industry rise in the Pacific region, some companies are increasingly abandoning vessels in remote islands. In the case of Fiji, 25 vessels, mostly Chinese-owned, are now abandoned near Suva Harbor. This poses a significant environmental threat as well as a navigation risk to other passing vessels.\n“The vessels started stacking up in the harbor during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the owners came forward and helped in the clean-up process. That is why the number has dropped from 44 to 25. For the remaining wrecks, owners have refused to comply with removal notices,” MSAF CEO Joeli Cawaki told BenarNews.\nIn addition, some of the abandoned vessels could have been illegally operating without licenses and salvage coverage, leaving the entire disposal and clean-up costs to local authorities. MSAF estimates that it requires $170,000 to dispose of all shipwrecks abandoned off Fiji.\nWith an expansive EEZ and an influx of foreign-owned fishing vessels (some operating without licenses), Fiji is likely to deal with more cases of abandoned vessels in future. Unfortunately, the country is yet to ratify the Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks. The convention, which was adopted in 2007 and came into force in 2015, provides a legal basis for states to remove shipwrecks that have potential threats to safety of lives, goods and the marine environment. The convention makes ship-owners financially liable for costs of wreck removal. If ratified by Pacific Island countries such as Fiji, it could give an impetus to their marine debris removal programs. So far, Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, Palau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Nauru are signatories to the convention.",

    "input": "\nWith the ongoing push for Ethiopia’s seaport access, the country is also advancing in the reorganization of its navy. On Friday, a Russian Navy delegation led by the Deputy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Vladimir Vorobyev, visited Ethiopian Navy facilities and training center in Bishoftu town, around 30 miles south of Addis Ababa.\nDuring the visit, the two sides signed a cooperation agreement on training and capacity building. Russia has pledged to work with Ethiopia in its efforts to modernize its navy, following an initial visit back in 2022. With a cooperation agreement now in place, “both sides will continue to work together to strengthen the naval rebuilding that Ethiopian navy has begun and to further strengthen its readiness to protect Ethiopia’s interests in the international waters,” said Deputy Commander in charge of operations in the Ethiopian Navy, Commodore Jamal Tufisa.\nWhile Ethiopia’s navy was originally founded in the 1950s, it had to be dissolved following Eritrea’s independence in 1993, which left Ethiopia landlocked. However, after taking office in 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced he would revive the Ethiopian naval forces. At the time, Abiy said that France would assist Ethiopia in rebuilding its maritime capabilities. The following year, French President Emmanuel Macron visited Ethiopia, culminating in the signing of a defense cooperation agreement that provides a framework for France to support the reconstruction of the Ethiopian Navy.\nIn 2023, the Ethiopian Navy held a graduation ceremony for part of its personnel who had received training in navigation, engineering, communication and armament. The training had been delivered by foreign and domestic instructors. The agreement with Russia shows that Ethiopia is keen to expand the pool of foreigner partners available to train its navy.\nThe cooperation coincides with Russia’s new search for a permanent base in the India Ocean. Last month, Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) foreign minister Ali Youssef Ahmed said that there were no obstacles for a Russian base in Port Sudan. Partly, this has been seen as a reprieve for the Russian Mediterranean flotilla, which was forced to leave Port of Tartus, Syria. But the ongoing civil war in Sudan could delay any constructive arrangements for a foreign naval base in the country.\nTop image: An aging monument to the Ethiopian Navy, Addis Ababa (Dvermierre / CC BY SA 4.0)\n",

    "input": "Federal officials were successful in withdrawing for what is believed to be the first time an environmental permit granted by the Biden administration for an offshore wind farm. New Jersey’s proposed Atlantic Shores offshore wind farm project had been singled out by Donald Trump in his opposition to the industry and this latest development adds another hurdle to an already troubled project and potentially the industry.\nAtlantic Shores which was proposed as a joint venture between Shell and EDF Renewables received its federal permitting including approval of its Construction and Operations Plan by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in October 2024. The plan calls for a two-phase project with a total capacity of 2.8 GW. The first phase, which would be in the southern part of the state near Atlantic City has consistently been reported to be in position to become New Jersey’s first offshore wind farm.\nDonald Trump singled out the project during the 2024 presidential campaign and in February 2025 said he hoped the New Jersey project would be “dead and gone.” Among the presidential executive orders were steps to review the industry and its impact on the environment.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency filed a motion in February to remand the 2024 approval granted to Atlantic Shores for review. Friday, March 14, Environmental Appeals Court Judge Mary Kay Lynch granted the motion saying it was appropriate based on Trump’s Executive Orders.\nLocal opponents have been contending that the review of the project’s EPA air quality filing did not meet a number of procedural requirements. They allege that the air quality modeling for the EPA permit was not done properly. The permit only pertains to the pile driving operation to set the monopoles for the project and not its operations.\n“Atlantic Shores is disappointed by the EPA’s decision to pull back its fully executed permit,” Atlantic Shores said in a brief statement. It emphasizes that “regulatory certainty is critical to deploying major energy projects.”\nThe project has already faced significant hurdles. Early in 2025, Shell said it was stepping back from its involvement in offshore wind energy and wrote off the value of its investment in Atlantic Shores. The project was also bid into New Jersey’s fourth wind solicitation but the state ended that round without selecting projects leaving Atlantic Shores without its necessary power agreements.\nLocal opponents celebrated Friday’s decision. They reported they have also written to the Interior Department and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asking them to reconsider the approvals granted during the Biden administration.\nThe American Clean Power Association warned that Friday’s decision “could chill investment in the U.S. for all types of infrastructure if a project permit is canceled for political reasons and not because of real impacts.”\nIn the last weeks of the Biden administration, BOEM approved other offshore wind projects including SouthCoast Wind which would serve Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and the Maryland Offshore Wind project. It approved a total of 11 projects and set in motion reviews for others. Since taking office Trump has stalled the future reviews and with Friday’s decision concerns are being raised about the projects approved but not yet in construction. The concern is that the Trump administration will use other loopholes such as the EPA permit for Atlantic Shores to delay the approved projects.",

    "input": "\nAs shipping's global regulatory structure faces increasing pressure from regional interests, the International Chamber of Shipping and the Comite Maritime International (CMI) have announced a joint campaign to encourage national governments to ratify more IMO treaties.\nICS and CMI have been concerned for a long time that many governments are not ratifying important conventions. This year, they have updated their joint campaign to address the issue, and are encouraging shipowners to educate their governments about the importance of ratification. The effort focuses on a handful of conventions that the two organizations believe are the most important:\n- The IMO Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks (Nairobi WRC)- The IMO 2010 Protocol to the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea Convention (HNS Convention)- The IMO Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (Hong Kong Convention)- The United Nations Convention on the International Effects of Judicial Sales of Ships (Beijing Convention)\nOf these, the HNS Convention is the only one that has not yet received enough signatories to enter into force, and it has been awaiting full ratification since 2010.\nICS has long advocated for a single global rulebook for shipping, which is by definition a global industry. Merchant ships cross national boundaries every day, and the alternative to a robust international framework \"would be a plethora of conflicting national or regional rules that would seriously compromise the efficiency of world trade,\" according to ICS.\nRatifying conventions adds weight to their validity, brings national enforcement mechanisms to bear, and can add protection for signatory nations. The Nairobi Wreck Removal Convention requires shipowners to carry insurance for the increasingly high costs of wreck removal, and allows coastal states to pursue insurers directly to recover expenses. Non-signatory coastal states could miss out on that protection within their territorial seas, and could be left on the hook for the cost of cleanup of a foreign ship. Only 70 nations have ratified the Nairobi WRC to date.\nICS and CMI noted that IMO is available to provide legal and technical assistance to national governments if they wish to ratify and implement a new convention. Implementation typically requires new domestic legislation and new administrative functions in each ratifying country, and IMO has a program to help set up these mechanisms - but only if asked.\n\"The purpose of the campaign is for ICS and CMI members, which represent national shipowner associations and national maritime law associations respectively, to engage with their governments to urge them to ratify these conventions where they are not currently in force,\" said Kiran Khosla, Principal Director (Legal) at the International Chamber of Shipping. \"It is fundamental that the same regulations are equally applied to all ships engaged in international trade, and that the same rules apply during the entire voyage. A global industry needs global regulations.\"",

The unions reported that government officials had been receptive in a recent meeting, and they hoped to make progress on a simmering dispute over reforms to France’s retirement policies.\nDockworkers and other port employees have been conducting a rolling series of strikes since January in a dispute that dates back to 2023 and the federal government’s plans for reforms in the national retirement project. The government of French President Emmanuel Macron pushed through controversial reforms in 2023 including raising the national retirement age from 62 to 64.\nThe unions are demanding that their industry be exempt from the changes to retirement. They insist it is a physically demanding profession that entitles them to special consideration.\nThe Federation National des Ports et Docks scheduled a strike for March 18 that was reportedly going to stop all activity in the ports of Le Havre and Rouen.  There were fears that it would include a suspension of the cross-channel ferry operations to England.\nThe job actions had varied since January ranging from four-hour stoppages to strikes ranging between one and three days. A prior action on February 27 stopped nearly all cross-channel ferry services for the day. The unions had vowed to intensify their actions in March with tomorrow’s strike to last for 72 hours.\nAfter a meeting with representatives from the Prime Minster and key government agencies, the unions said the government was more receptive to talks and honoring its earlier promises. The unions had been arguing that the government was not responding to earlier commitments and not proposing additional talks till 2027.\nThe unions have scheduled a general meeting for March 25 to review the status of their efforts. Leaders while they were seeking to ease tensions it would be possible that they would initiate new industrial actions in April if the government does not respect its commitments to the dockworkers.",

The passenger reported to be a Brazilian national was charged with a failed plan to smuggle 10 kg of cocaine into Australia.\nThe arrest took place in Sydney on Saturday, March 15, with the Australian Border Force reporting they found a concealed package hidden in a ceiling cavity of the man’s cabin. The package was found to contain 28 individually wrapped packages of cocaine. Searching the cabin, the police reported they also uncovered body packing material which drug couriers use to conceal drugs when crossing borders and security checkpoints hidden in the ceiling cavity and in the wardrobe.\nThe report did not identify the cruise ship only saying that it was arriving from Argentina. Three cruise ships were due in Sydney on Saturday, Royal Caribbean International’sOvation of the Seasand Princess Cruises’Royal Princess, which are sailing cruises around Australia, and MSC Cruises’MSC Magnificawhich is on a world cruise. It called in Brazil and Argentina in late January and made stops in Chile and French Polynesia before arriving in Australia.\n\n\nCocaine was found concealed in a ceiling cavity aboard the cruise ship along with material to smuggle it ashore (AFP and ABF)\n\n“The cruising season brings with it additional opportunity for criminal syndicates to attempt to smuggle illicit drugs into the country, however Border Force officers are very attuned to their pivoting tactics,\" said ABF Superintendent Matt O'Connor.\nThe Australian Federal Police were alerted to the discovery and took the passenger into custody. They reported a search of his cell phone found evidence related to the drug trafficking.\n“This amount of cocaine could have been sold in the community as 10,000 individual street deals of 1 gram for about A$3 million (US$1.9 million),” said AFP Detective Superintendent Kristie Cressy.\nThis is the first report from Australia of drug smugglers attempting to use a cruise ship. In 2022, Spanish police reportedarrests of smugglersattempting to pose as passengers on two cruise ships crossing the Atlantic from South America. French police in 2023 also reported a large bust as Brazilian drug couriers booked aspassengers attemptedto carry cocaine off a cruise arriving from South America.\nThe individual appeared today in an Australian local court.

    "input": "\nFully autonomous navigation is still in the testing stage for merchant ships, but AI mariner-assistance systems are already in commercial use - and their developers say that the technology is already bringing demonstrable safety improvements. In this interview, Dor Raviv, Co-Founder and CTO of Orca AI, told TME about how autonomous technology is improving safety and efficiency for commercial vessels worldwide.\nLet's start with a general overview of what's new in assisted navigation and autonomy in the maritime space. What are you seeing in the marketplace?\nMaritime shipping and commerce have gone through turmoil for the last few years, but it's been a very good era for AI and digitalization. At Orca AI, we've grown dramatically. We're now installed on more than 750 commercial ships with an order book exceeding 1,500 vessels. We've proven that AI perception for collision avoidance works and that it's something the market wants and needs. We've also made significant advancements in Japan with our autonomous ship collaboration. We've concluded the proof-of-concept phase and are now working on a full commercial suite for fully autonomous ships.\nThis growth is driven by multiple factors: increased safety requirements, new EU and IMO regulations on emissions and fuel reduction, and the challenge of recruiting crews to work aboard large ships.\nMore broadly, seafarers themselves have undergone massive transitions. Technologies like LLMs, ChatGPT, cloud computing, and generative AI applications are being utilized in so many day-to-day use cases. This has generated interest, trust, and a better understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations.\nTwo years ago, if you asked a room full of captains who had used AI in the past week, no one would know what you were talking about. Two weeks ago, I asked the same question to a room of captains in Athens, and everyone had used AI in the past week for something. This broader adoption has set the scene for what to expect from an AI system onboard a ship.\nWe also see an increased focus on maritime defense — shoreline monitoring, port monitoring, passive perception systems, mission autonomy, and USVs. Just last month, the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln collided with a commercial ship, which is exactly the type of situation Orca AI helps prevent.\nWe've been working with several navies on using cameras, which are much cheaper than radars, to provide computer vision-based perception adequate for autonomous navigation. The race for data to power AI for autonomous capabilities is in full swing.\nCan you tell us about the challenges in crewing and how automation on the bridge can help?\nIn an autonomous voyage scenario, crew will always be onboard, but perhaps in reduced numbers. If we can prove the system understands its limitations, we can approach our clients and say, \"Consider reducing watchkeepers under these conditions.\" That delivers immediate value — maybe reducing manning by one or two people per ship, which is massive savings.\nA ship might start with a decision support system for collision avoidance while docked. As it leaves port and enters coastal navigation in high traffic, it might use a Level 2 autonomy system for collision avoidance recommendations. When entering the high seas, it could switch to Level 4 autonomy focused on fuel and emissions optimization while maintaining navigational safety — this covers about 90-95% of the voyage.Upon encountering severe weather, low visibility, high traffic, or search and rescue situations, the system would automatically notify the crew to return to the bridge and handle these delicate situations.\n\nAn officer monitors an ARPA (right) and an Orca AI display (center) during a transit (Orca AI)\nAt Orca, we introduce these capabilities incrementally. Using our existing hardware, we're working with ABS toward Level 2 autonomy for 2025. This means understanding the limitations of sensor fusion, computer vision, collision avoidance, and translating those into a system that knows its boundaries and when to call the crew. After we gain trust with this bottom-up approach across our fleet of 1,500 ships, the transition from Level 2 to Level 3 autonomy becomes easier because we already understand the system's limitations. The phased approach, closely connected to crew requirements, makes much more sense for adoption.\nIn terms of timeline, how far out do you think we are before we start seeing ships that self-navigate in specific conditions?\nI believe maritime will transition faster than automotive or aviation. There are so many incentives, and while the industry is perceived as slow-moving because ships move slowly, the regulation here actually moves quite fast.\nAs the IMO MASS code for voluntary implementation comes to fruition by 2027, while EU ETS regulations have already started, I think that in about two years, we'll see ships navigating autonomously in the open sea under supervision and restrictions.\nThe infrastructure to support this is already here. Advanced perception systems like Orca AI's are already in production at scale. This scale allows ships to share rich data between themselves — not just AIS data, but context-based information like specific events, congestion, port traffic, etc.\nWe already have the connectivity and bandwidth to calculate optimizations in the cloud and share them back to ships in real-time. Remote teams already have access to live data streams including video from all cameras, sensor data, and location information.\nAll the class societies I've spoken with are moving quickly to approve these capabilities. They've brought in experts from universities to help push autonomy and AI to the mass market. In the past two years, I've conducted about six computer vision workshops with different class societies, discussing benefits, limitations, data gaps, benchmarking, evaluation scenarios, and the human aspects of AI integration.\nWhen the system is able to stand watch, do you anticipate there will still need to be at least one person on the bridge?\nIt's a good question. Realistically, such systems need to gain the trust of the crew — that's more important than gaining management's trust. It will vary depending on different crews and situations.\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, we'll always need someone on the bridge, at least in the foreseeable future — maybe just one person who isn't looking out the window but is monitoring other systems. But perhaps after 5-10 years, these systems will be so good that, yes, why not? Solo circumnavigators go to sleep from time to time; they're not awake 24/7.\nIt will take time to gain the confidence and trust of crews, but fortunately, they have plenty of time to evaluate these systems because they spend so much time on the bridge. I think this transition will happen faster than in other industries.\nInsurers have a clear economic incentive to improve safety. Can you tell us about your work with insurance partners like NorthStandard?\nThis is a very good question. Historically, insurance companies look at track records to set premiums. Now they have unprecedented amounts of context and data flowing from platforms like ours. They need our help understanding and assessing what constitutes risk.\nThis is brilliant because you have all the evidence to objectively prove whether these systems increase or decrease safety events, which could eventually lead to premium reductions. That's the holy grail.\nWe've been able to prove this to NorthStandard, and they now subsidize half the cost of our system to their clients in the first year. We have so much anonymized data backed up by chart data, video data, context events — all easy to explore, learn from, and use to understand improvements.\nThe goal for insurers is to become the most attractive insurance company by offering lower premiums to clients who adopt AI, automation, and data collection. It's a win-win-win scenario, and we're gaining interest from more insurers because we can empirically prove that ships using Orca are safer. We can track KPIs over time and show the data.\nAre we going to get to a point where AI can identify sailboats and fishing boats for COLREGS purposes? Or make passing arrangements on VHF?\nToday, all autonomous navigation systems use a camera as the primary sensor and everything else is fused to it. If I identify something as a fishing boat rather than a sailing boat, there's currently no logic in other systems to handle that distinction. You need a system with richer context to understand that if an object looks a certain way and is stopped, it's probably a fishing boat.\nIt's natural for humans to identify lights and patterns, but hard for AI systems to derive meaning from those cues alone. Practically speaking, when a system replaces people, it needs to operate properly without some legacy human requirements. For example, in foggy conditions where you traditionally listen for sound signals, I wouldn't trust a microphone to locate other vessels. I'd simply ask a crew member to come to the bridge and listen.\nSimilarly, it's extremely difficult to parse radio communications from speakers of different languages and translate that into machine code. Even with the latest ChatGPT technology, I wouldn't trust it as the sole solution for managing ship encounters. I'd want someone on the bridge in those situations.\nThe same applies to delicate operations like port docking. Instead of expensive technologies like lasers, LiDAR, and QR codes to position a ship precisely, maybe just use two tugboats. Don't over-solve problems or find solutions to problems that might not exist.\nDor Raviv is the Co-Founder and CTO of Orca AI, a company that provides AI-powered navigation systems for maritime vessels. Orca AI's collision avoidance system is currently installed on more than 750 commercial ships worldwide.",

The indication is that the crew was uninjured and that the vessel is back underway after the boarders left the vessel.\nThe Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG) first issued the alert saying that it had received a report that an unnamed tanker had been boarded approximately 40 nautical miles southeast of Santo Antonio do Príncipe, on the island of Príncipe in the island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe off the west coast of Central Africa. MDAT-Gog’s last report was that the “unauthorized persons” had cleared the vessel and it was proceeding to Libreville in Gabon for refuge.\nThe vessel is being identified as theBITU River, a Panama-flagged bitumen tanker operated by Rubis Asphalt, a company that sourced bitumen at the refinery and distributes it across West and Central Africa. The 15,500 dwt vessel was built in China in 2022 and is the fifth bitumen tanker in the company’s fleet. The ship is 475 feet (145 meters) in length and the company reported when the vessel was delivered that it would operate with a crew of 14.\nAIS signals show the vessel had departed the anchorage at Lome, Togo and was proceeding to Douala in Cameroon. The security reports said three persons boarded the vessel. It is unclear when the shots were fired, but the company security officer late told MDAT-GoG the pirates had departed. There was no indication if the vessel was robbed or if any crewmembers were kidnapped.\nMDAT-GoG reported an incident in a similar location off São Tomé and Príncipe taking place on December 21 and December 22. In that incident the crew was able to secure itself in the citadel. Other recent incidents included an approach off Equatorial Guinea and a fishing boat being attacked off Gabon at the end of January.\nMartin Kelly, Head of Advisory at EOS Risk Group, wrote that this region is “the new stomping ground for pirates in West Africa.” He indicates that six vessels have been boarded since January 2024 off Equatorial Guinea and Gabon with 14 crewmembers kidnapped in three pirate attacks.",

On land, satellite imaging shows that China has recently invested in infrastructure and housing development in the long-contested border zones along its western boundaries with India and Bhutan, raising concerns that Beijing could unilaterally declare ownership of lands that were previously subject to negotiation. For maritime security, the main concern is the Chinese island-building and maritime presence campaign in the Spratly Islands. China claims ownership of the entire archipelago under its \"nine-dash line\" policy, which was invalidated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2016. China has disregarded the ruling, and it has invested heavily in fortifying and manning a string of island bases within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone, hundreds of miles away from mainland China.\nIn related language, the G7 also emphasized \"the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to international security and prosperity.\" China claims Taiwan as its own, and has vowed to bring the island under Beijing's control, by force if necessary. China opposes foreign support for Taiwan, and it asserts that cross-strait relations are purely an internal Chinese matter.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Ottawa received the G7's statements as an affront, and it responded within hours. \"The [G7] statements are filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions to suppress and attack China. China strongly deplores and opposes this and has lodged solemn representations with the Canadian side,\" an embassy spokesperson said. \"[They] repeat the same old rhetoric, ignore facts and China's solemn position, grossly interfere in China's internal affairs, and blatantly smear China.\"\nTop image: China's island base at Mischief Reef (Tony Peters / CC BY 2.0)",

    "input": "\nScottish government-owned ferry agency CMAL has awarded a contract for seven small electric ferries to Polish yard Remontowa, snubbing a bid from the Scottish government's own shipyard, Ferguson Marine. The decision leaves Ferguson without orders for new tonnage, except for a module construction contract for BAE Systems.\nFerguson said that its bid led the tender on measurements of quality, but Remontowa won the contract on price. The two yards have been competitors in the same segment for years, and the loss could have an effect on Ferguson as it seeks to rebuild its orderbook.\nIn a statement, CMAL said that it had to follow Scottish public procurement law, and Remontowa's bid came out on top under the tender formula. \"We are confident in Remontowa’s ability, and have worked with them before, most recently with the delivery of the MV Finlaggan in 2011. We will now enter a 10-day standstill period before finalizing the contract,\" said CMAL CEO Kevin Hobbs in a statement.\nScottish opposition politicians slammed the award and said that it should have been handed to Ferguson directly, without a tender process. \"It should be a given that a nationalized shipyard wins a Scottish government contract,\" said Scottish Conservative spokesperson Sue Webber. \"It could yet prove the death knell for the yard.\"\nFerguson's reputation for quality took a turn for the worse during the construction of CMAL's long-delayed LNG ro/pax ferries, Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa. The project underwent multiple design changes and rounds of rework, and the costs forced Ferguson into administration in 2019. The Scottish government bought the yard out of bankruptcy and managed it through the completion of the two ferries; the project ended up four times over budget and six years behind schedule.\nAfter years of work, Glen Sannox finally entered service in January 2025. The ferry was briefly taken out of service on Friday due to a newly-discovered hull crack at a weld seam. It was repaired, and the vessel returned to commercial operations on Sunday.\nLeadership turnover has been comparatively high at Ferguson. The yard's interim CEO, John Petticrew, resigned Thursday after less than 12 months in the role. He had been expected to depart in November, but the board could not recruit a permanent CEO to replace him, and he agreed to stay on until April while the board sought a successor. He chose to depart last week instead, citing family reasons.\nPetticrew's predecessor, David Tydeman, was fired by the yard's government-appointed board after a series of unexpected delays and technical problems.\n\"We remain focused on securing a sustainable and prosperous future for the yard and are very close to announcing a permanent CEO to replace John Petticrew. We look forward to providing more detail on this very soon,\" Ferguson's chief financial officer David Dishon told BBC.",

Upwards of 50 people were killed on the ground, Houthi media claimed, and many more injured. The group did not differentiate between civilian and military casualties, but U.S. defense officials said that Houthi leaders were targeted and some were killed.\nIn retaliation, Houthi forces claimed to have launched 18 ballistic missiles and one drone at the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, which is operating in the Red Sea. A U.S. military spokesman put the numbers differently, counting one ballistic missile and 10 drones; the drones were reportedly shot down by U.S. Air Force and Navy fighters, and the missile fell short of target.\nIn a statement Monday, Trump said that Iran exercised full operational control over Houthi forces, \"dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated military equipment.\" Iran has supported the Houthi movement since the start of the Yemeni civil war, and  U.S. forces have repeatedly intercepted Iranian missile component and drone shipments aboard dhows bound for Yemen. The intercepted components correspond to systems known to be used by the Houthis.\n\"Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of Iran, and Iran will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences,\" Trump said in a statement.\nOver the weekend, the president promised a continuing campaign of \"overwhelming lethal force\" until the Houthis fully abandon their campaign of attacks on merchant shipping.\nIn response, Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, told state media that \"we warn our enemies that Iran will respond decisively and destructively if they carry out their threats.\"\nHouthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said Sunday that the group will\" confront escalation with escalation,\" and that the terrorist group still has \"escalation options\" if the U.S. continues airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.",

He had been hanging on to life for months by eating whatever he could catch, and was in critical condition when found.\nMaximo Napa Castro, 61, set off from the city of Marcona, Peru on December 7. He was planning to spend two weeks at sea to fish, and had supplies for the journey. 10 days into the trip, he encountered a storm and his skiff's engine failed, leaving him adrift. Without an EPIRB, he had no way to send a distress signal for help. He ran out of food and water, and ate insects, birds and a turtle in order to keep going; he relied solely on rainwater for his drinking water supply, when it was available at all.\nWhile he was adrift, his family held out hope that he might still be rescued, even as the days turned into weeks and months. \"Every day is anguish for the whole family and I understand my grandmother’s pain, because as a mother, I understand her,\" said Napa's daughter, Ines Napa Torres, in a Facebook post. \"We never thought we would go through this situation, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.We will not lose hope, Dad, of finding you.\"\nAn Ecuadorian fishing patrol boat found Napa at last on March 11, adrift at a position about 600 nautical miles off the coast of Ecuador. He was severely dehydrated, and he was taken ashore in critical condition and delivered to a hospital in Paita, Peru; he was given IV treatment to nurse him back to health, and was discharged from the hospital on the 15th. He was flown to Lima for a joyous reunion with his mother and the rest of his family.\n\nNapa's family has complained that Peruvian authorities did too little to find the fisherman when he went missing. \"It took three months of constant struggle for the entire family to search on our own, and even to the point of pleading with the authorities to continue the search,\" his sister Flor Napa told Diario Correo. \"We didn't see the proper commitment to this, and I feel disappointed in the local and national authorities for not providing support in these cases.\"\nThe local authorities noted that Napa did not have an EPIRB. \"I think it was a fortuitous event. Not having a radio beacon made the work a bit difficult,\" Paita naval base commander Jorge Calizaya told Ecuavisa.",

The fine comes after the Australian Maritime Authority (AMSA) last year banned the vessel from sailing to Australia also related to safety issues in 2023.\nKMAX Leader, a Liberia-flagged bulk carrier, arrived at the Port of Gladstone in October 2023 reporting propulsion issues. Through the port agency, Universal Shipping Alliance, AMSA was advised the vessel would require eight to 10 days to complete repairs. Instead, the port and AMSA found themselves dealing with the ship for four months while two cyclones also impacted the area. The vessel finally left Australia in February 2024under towafter engineers had repeatedly failed to resolve the mechanical problems.\nAMSA now says, “The captain of theKMAX Leaderand its Australian agent, Universal Shipping Alliance, failed to respond to and act on the issued direction, despite repeated requests.” After the vessel left the port under tow, AMSA slapped a 12-month ban on it from entering Australian waters.\n“In this case, with a cyclone bearing down on the port, the consequences of not engaging a towage vessel to move the vessel out of the port, could have been catastrophic,” said AMSA Executive Director Operations Michael Drake. He warned that ignoring lawful directions from AMSA is not an acceptable option.\nAMSA emphasizes that a failure to act on a direction is a serious violation of the Navigation Act 2012 and carries severe consequences. As such it went to court and now the Gladstone Magistrates Court agreed. A fine of A$63,000 (US$40,000) was imposed on the owner along with court costs for failing to comply with AMSA’s written direction.\nOwned and managed from the Philippines,KMAX Leaderwas built in 2010 and became one of four ships AMSA barred from Australia during 2024. Three of the vessels, includingKMAX Leader, were banned for maintenance issues while the fourth was banned due to improper storage of explosives and repeated violations by the shipping company. AMSA highlights during its 2023-24 financial year, it issued 57 directions to vessels and operators in relation to safety breaches, mechanical deficiencies, and maritime labor issues.\n“We will not compromise on the safety of vessels and crew, or any potential threat to the community or environment,” said Drake.",

    "input": "\nAmerica's seaports have weighed in against the Trump administration's steep proposed fees on Chinese-built shipping, which could amount to an additional $3.5 million per port call if fully implemented. In comments to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) warned that the unprecedented fees would make U.S. exports less competitive, and it provided the industry's first hard numbers for what the proposal might cost in lost revenue.\nIn a statement, AAPA president and CEO Cary Davis warned that the fee structure would do little to counter China's dominance in shipbuilding, and said that it would have few near-term effects on domestic shipyard production. \"A fee on foreign vessels will simply not bring back American shipbuilding. Our existing shipyards are working at or near capacity, and higher demand for American vessels will not enable them to produce more ships with the same resources,\" Davis said, noting AAPA's support for alternative support policies like the SHIPS Act.\nAfter the USTR announced the fee proposal last month, AAPA joined a multi-industry study to assess the impact of the fees, conducted by Trade Partnership Worldwide. The early results suggest a double-digit decline for American exports because of the increased cost of shipping. The study's initial conclusions suggest that if the fees fully enter into effect, agricultural exports will drop by about 16 percent, petroleum and coal exports will fall by eight percent, and U.S. goods exports overall will drop by about 12 percent.\nU.S. goods exports amount to roughly $2.1 trillion per year, so a 12 percent drop would be a revenue decline of about $250 billion annually for U.S. exporters - equal to about one percent of U.S. GDP.\nThe plan as written would likely reduce traffic to smaller secondary ports, AAPA said, and would risk squandering federal investments in channel deepening and port infrastructure in midsize seaports on the Gulf and East Coasts.\n\"AAPA respectfully urges the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to reconsider its approach to countering Chinese dominance in the global shipbuilding industry by narrowing the scope of the proposed fees or reversing course,\" the association said.\nThe Louisiana Maritime Association (LaMA), which represents Lower Mississippi River maritime service companies, warned that American maritime workers could lose out in the near term, even if the fees eventually succeed in boosting future U.S. shipyard activity.\n\"The fallout will affect railroads, pilots, towage (tug) companies, barge companies and many small, independent businesses such as line handling companies, dock, terminal and facility workers,\" warned LaMA. \"The myriad of United States companies dependent on the shipping industry could (and reportedly already are) lose business based on the anticipation of the implementation of this USTR action.\"\nBIMCO reviews effects of port fees\nShipping association BIMCO also weighed in this week, and it provided a detailed overview of the likely effects.\n\"The proposed actions will impose much increased transport costs on US imports and exports and have negative effects on the wider US economy; their impact on Chinese dominance is much less certain,\" said BIMCO deputy secretary general Lars Robert Pedersen in a statement. \"The ships already built of Chinese origin will not disappear from the world fleet if the proposed port fees are introduced.\"\nPedersen predicted a splitting of the global shipping market into two halves: some shipowners would put together fully non-Chinese fleets in order to call in the U.S. without the penalties. Meanwhile, other shipowners would use Chinese tonnage to serve the rest of the global market, without making port calls in the U.S., and at lower price.\n\"The totality of the world fleet would not change, but the overall cost of maritime trade would increase due to less competition in the now segregated US market,\" he cautioned.\nThe boxship sector, which has consolidated into less than 10 large operators, is less likely to divide up the market in the same way, he said. Instead, ocean carriers will concentrate port calls into the largest hubs, avoiding the extra fees that would come with each call at secondary ports. Those smaller ports would go underutilized while congestion would grow at the major trade gateways, he warned.\nPedersen noted that a U.S.-built requirement for U.S. export shipping would raise costs \"significantly,\" and would affect the competitiveness of American exporters - particularly farmers. Inexpensive commodities like grain and soy would be most affected as a percentage of cargo value, he warned.",

    "input": "\nThe Chinese government continues to apply pressure after the news of CK Hutchison’s planned sale of its international port operations, including in Panama to a partnership between U.S. investment group BlackRock and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company’s TiL ports group. The deal has become mired in the politics between Donald Trump and China.\nWhile Beijing has officially remained silent on the deal, it has used proxies to increase the pressure against Hutchison and Li Ka-shing, the tycoon behind the company. He has long been seen at odds with the Communist Party but when CK Hutchison announced plans to sell its foreign port operations early in March it called the deal “purely commercial,” and said it was “unrelated to recent political news reports,” in a veiled reference to Trump’s assertions regarding the Panama Canal.\nThe company, headquartered in Hong Kong, has largely gone silent in the face of the campaign being waged in the media. Yesterday, the company said it would not hold its normal briefings with investors and the media when it releases its financial results.\nIn a regularly scheduled press conference, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive John Lee spoke out against the proposed sale echoing last week’s pressure from a newspaper closely linked to the Community Party. Analysts highlight that historically Hong Kong has not asserted legal rights to review transactions selling assets to foreign companies, unlike the mainland government that closely controls foreign asset sales.\nLee speaking to reporters cited the “extensive discussions” related to Hutchison’s proposed sale saying it reflects “society’s concern” over the sale which last week the newspaper called unpatriotic and against national interests. Today, Lee said, “These concerns deserve serious attention.”\nHe said that any transaction “must comply with the legal and regulatory requirements. Hong Kong will handle it in accordance with the law and regulation.”\nHutchison highlighted when announcing its plan that the deal, which involves a total of 43 ports in 23 countries, does not involve its Chinese port operations. Further, the sale of the two terminals in Panama is in a parallel transaction subject to the review of the Panama government and separate from the other international ports.\nChina has said it views the deal as coercion by the United States and efforts to extend the U.S.’s dominance over China and others.\n“The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong,” Lee told reporters today. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic, and trade relations.”\nAt the same time, it was reported that China sent a delegation to Panama over the weekend. Under pressure from Trump, Panama has sought to back away from its close relationship with China including serving notice that it would not renew its participation in the Belt and Road initiative. The Panama Government continues to assert that the canal belongs to Panama but said it would review the proposed transaction between Panama Ports controlled by Hutchison and the BlackRock-MSC partnership. Earlier, Panama said it was reviewing the contract awarded to Hutchison to run the two terminals.\nHutchison and BlackRock agreed in March to enter into exclusive negotiations to finalize the terms of the transaction. The companies set a target of on or before April 2 to sign definitive documentation for the Panama Ports Corporation portion of the deal. It said that the acquisition of the HPH Ports Sale Perimeter would proceed on “an expedited basis” subject to the BlackRock-TiL Consortium conducting normal and usual confirmatory due diligence, settlement of definitive documentation, and receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, amongst others.",

Under Assad, Russia held a 49-year lease on the port of Tartus, home of the only Russian naval base in the Mediterranean. Under HTS, the terms of Russia's ability to stay at the base have been up for negotiation, and Russia's military has been extracting shiploads of vehicles and containerized cargo from the port since January.\nRussia has been in talks with Syria's new Islamist leadership about a revised status of forces agreement, and has received positive signs from HTS about maintaining Russian base infrastructure - in exchange for continued Russian support for the battered Syrian economy. No final deals have been announced, but a sanctioned Russian tanker recently got underway from Murmansk with a load of one million barrels of crude oil for Syria's Baniyas refinery, replacing the Iranian supplies upon which al-Assad relied.\n\"Russia is using fuel as rent money for its maintained armed presence in port Tartus, Syria,\" observed TankerTrackers.com, which first reported the shipment.",

DP World operates one of Brazil’s largest private terminals at the Port of Santos and plans to increase capacity by 50 percent to support Maersk’s growth in Latin America.\nUnder the terms of the eight-year agreement, Maersk will introduce additional long-term services and maintain a minimum service level. In the first year, Maersk will launch six new services with eight weekly calls, increasing to seven services and 10 weekly calls in 2026 following DP World’s capacity expansion.\n“This announcement is another strategic step for DP World in Brazil, reinforcing our presence at the Port of Santos, and accelerating new expansion opportunities in the country,” said Márcio Medina, Commercial Vice President at DP World in Brazil. He noted the agreement with  Maersk “not only allows us to expand our operational capacity for container handling but also ensures long-term aces to Brazil’s leading port and logistics hub.”\nCurrently, the terminal handles 1.4 million TEUs annually. To accommodate growing demand, DP World is investing R$450 million (US$79 million) to expand its container-handling capacity to 1.7 million TEUs by the end of 2026. The company also plans to invest an additional R$1.6 billion (US$280 million) to further increase capacity to 2.1 million TEUs by the end of 2027.\n“This agreement with DP World secures service capacity for Maersk at the Port of Santos,” said Paulo Ruy, Regional Head of Terminal & Port Procurement for Latin America at Maersk. “By having this commercial agreement with DP World, we are able to meet the growing demand for container handling and enhance our service offerings, ensuring that we continue to provide end-to-end logistics solutions, in addition to our stand-alone products.”\nDP World reports it set a new record for container-handling volume at the Port of Santos in 2024, surpassing 1.25 million TEUs – a 14 percent year-over-year increase. The growth was driven by expanded container operations and the introduction of new services. The company recently invested R$50 million (US$8.8 million) in advanced port equipment as part of its ongoing R$85 million (US$15 million) terminal expansion project, which will increase capacity to 1.7 million TEUs. Additionally, DP World said it has strengthened its network through a new agreement with Rumo, Brazil’s leading railway operator, to develop a new terminal for grain and fertilizer shipments, adding 12.5 million tons of operating capacity per year.",

The incoming missile was shot down, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.\nAfter the attempted Houthi strike, a Pentagon spokesperson told reporters that the U.S. campaign to tamp down Houthi attacks would continue as long as needed, and U.S. Central Command said that it was conducting \"continuous operations\" against Houthi positions.\nCENTCOM continuous operations against Iran-back Houthi terrorists…#HouthisAreTerroristspic.twitter.com/ppggVK1Jgg\n\"The Houthis can determine when this ends, and until then, the campaign will be unrelenting. All options are on the table,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters Tuesday. \"This is not an endless offensive. This is not about regime change in the Middle East, this is about protecting American interests.\"\nU.S. President Donald Trump has warned that his administration will hold Iran responsible for further Houthi attacks, given Tehran's role as the primary supplier of weaponry for Houthi operations.\nIn public, Iran denies that it has direct control over Houthi decisionmaking, though it counts the group as a member of its \"Axis of Resistance\" in the Mideast. On Sunday, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Commander Hossein Salami asserted that the Houthi movement \"makes its own strategic decisions, and the Islamic Republic of Iran has no role in setting the national or operational policies of any movement in the resistance front.\"\nIn private, Iranian officials have quietly told reporters that Tehran has asked the Houthis to deescalate the situation. The group does not appear ready to comply: On Monday, Houthi foreign minister Jamal Amer told Reuters that \"there will be no talk of any dialing down of operations before ending the [Israeli] blockade in Gaza.\" He added that Iran \"mediates sometimes but it cannot dictate things.\"\nThe renewed regional conflict is likely to prolong the timeline for the full resumption of maritime commerce in the Red Sea. Independent analysts suggest that container lines will be reluctant to return to the region until tensions calm down, and the hostilities could keep vessel diversions around the Cape of Good Hope going much longer into the year than expected. This is welcome news for the top-10 container lines, which have projected strong profitability as long as the longer Cape route continues - and low profitability as soon as the Red Sea reopens. The resumption of the Suez route will shorten voyages on the busy Asia-Europe trade lane by weeks, releasing excess vessel capacity onto the market and pushing down rates.",

It is part of a history-making move that brought a 1994 French-built LNG carrier into the U.S. registry using a provision added to the Jones Act for shipping LNG or LPG to Puerto Rico.\nCrowley acquired the LNG vessel in December 2024 from a subsidiary of Malaysia’s MISC Berhad. After U.S. Coast Guard inspection and approval, the vessel was renamedAmerican Energyand placed in the U.S. registry as of January 2025. It had previously operated as theIntanand was registered in Liberia. The vessel, originally known asPuteri Intan, was built by France’s Chantiers de l'Atlantique.\nThe 900-foot-long (274 meters) LNG carrier has a capacity 130,400 cubic meters (34.4 million gallons) per voyage and is now owned by Crowley and will be crewed by U.S. mariners providing regular service from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Puerto Rico. Crowley reports it will operate in accordance with the U.S. Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996. A provision made it possible for a foreign-built vessel to enter the U.S. registry for the trade to supply gas to Puerto Rico.\n\nCrowley is building on our 70-year commitment to the island of Puerto Rico. We’re proud to officially launch American Energy, the first domestic liquified natural gas (LNG) carrier to transport U.S.-sourced natural gas to Puerto Rico. In partnership with@Naturgy, each delivery…pic.twitter.com/XwmOeZbi1n\n\n“The entry into service of?American Energy?marks a significant step for fuel supply reliability in Puerto Rico for our energy grid, which will greatly benefit our people,” said Puerto Rico Governor Jenniffer González-Colón. “This partnership is an initiative to act using existing regulations to increase access to a U.S.-based LNG source that expands our options for the stabilization of our energy grid, as we work towards providing our residents and businesses a more consistently reliable power generation source.”\nCrowley highlights that the new operation builds on its 70-plus years of service to Puerto Rico. Annually, Crowley reports it delivers more than 94 million gallons of LNG through its LNG Loading Terminal in Penuelas as well as provides ocean delivery and land transportation using ISO tank containers. The company also operates the full-service marine Isla Grande cargo terminal in San Juan for its container and roll-on/roll-off vessels, including two LNG-fueled ships, and logistics services.\n\n\nU.S. flag raising on the American energy which has a homeport of Jacksonville, Florida (Crowley)\n\nCrowley and Naturgy have entered into a multi-year agreement that provides for the regular delivery of the U.S. mainland-sourced LNG to Naturgy’s operating facility in Penuelas, Puerto Rico.\n“This contract strengthens our presence in the global LNG market, particularly in the United States, and allows Puerto Rico to obtain a stable and competitive energy supply route,” said Jon Ganuza, general manager of supply and wholesale markets, Naturgy.\nThe U.S. Merchant Marine Act of 1920, widely known as the Jones Act, requires that cargo transported by ship between U.S. ports must be handled on vessels that are owned and registered in the U.S. While it also requires U.S.-built ships, provisions and exemptions have been provided when unique vessels, such as LNG carriers, are not available so that the ships can be added to the U.S. registry.\nThe new LNG service, which is expected to travel to the island twice each month comes as the recently-elected governor also looks to strengthen the island’s manufacturing sector. Today, she announced a new initiative to reshore manufacturing to the island as part of an effort to attract investment and strengthen the job market and economy of Puerto Rico.",

    "input": "Continuing its efforts to incorporate new technologies to advance its efforts at reducing emissions, Stena Line is adding two wind rotor sails to one of its two NewMax hybrid vessels and completing the other sister ship “rotor sail ready.” The two vessels currently under construction in China are among the most advanced designs incorporating new technologies to be “future proof” as the company seeks to expand on its strategic ambition of shifting to renewable fuels and cutting CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030.\nThe NewNax vessels were ordered in early 2023 to be built by China Merchant’s Jinling Shipyard in WeiHai. At 147 meters (428 feet) in length and with 2,800 lane meters of capacity, the vessels represent an 80 increase over the current ships operating the freight service on the route from Belfast, Northern Ireland to Heysham, England. The ships will be equipped to carry 12 passengers and 26 crew.\nAmong the advanced features incorporated into the design is a hybrid propulsion plant able to operate on methanol fuel. In addition, to future proof the design, Stena reported during construction it was incorporating technologies that would take advantage of both battery propulsion and shore power when it becomes available.\nThe company reports it has now completed a deal with Norsepower to add two Rotor Sails to one of the vessels. Each rotor will measure 28 x 4 meters (approximately 92 x 13 feet) and is expected to deliver a further nine percent fuel savings on the planned route. The sister ship will be delivered ready for the future addition of rotor sails.\nAccording to Stena, operating on the Irish Sea between Belfast and Heysham, the vessels will have wind conditions that are very favorable for wind-assisted propulsion. The company has also said that the unique tidal systems prevailing in Heysham can be challenging, so each vessel will be fitted with a technology configuration making the ships more resilient to the prevailing weather conditions. They will have three bow thrusters for maneuverability and specially designed engine/propeller configuration to enhance berthing capabilities in extreme weather conditions.\n\n\nThe first vessel of the class, Stena Futura, was launched in October 2024 (Stena Line)\n\nSteel cutting for the first of the vessels began in January 2024 and its keel was laid in July. The vessel was floated in October as theStena Futurawhile the keel for the second shipStena Connectawas laid at the same time.Stena Connectawas launched at the end of February 2025. The first of the ships is scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of this year and the second one in 2026.\nThe company highlights that it became the first ferry operator to run a vessel on methanol with the 2015 conversion of theStena Germanica. Since then, it has pursued further steps including the addition of more bulbous bows, tilted propellers, additional shore power capabilities, and experimented with battery power. It views the rotor as the next step in its continuing effort to improve performance and reduce emissions from its fleet.",

While the government was quick to report the damage was minor, it renewed the questions about the use of pilots and the recommendations in theOS 35report that highlighted that pilots would likely have prevented the incident.\nShortly after midnight on Tuesday, March 18, the Panama-flagged LNG carrierSM Kestrelwas getting underway from the Western Anchorage. The vessel built in 2023 in Korea is part of the new Korea Line LNG subsidiary launched by SM Line. It is 114,000 dwt and 984 feet (300 meters) in length.\nA spokesperson for the Gibraltar government confirmed to the news outlets that the LNG carrier “came in contact” with another vessel. They said there were no injuries and no significant damage to either vessel, but both were ordered to remain in the anchorage. Class, flag, and port inspectors were due to inspect both vessels.\n\nLNG tanker comes into contact with anchored Bulk Carrier in western anchoragehttps://t.co/wHDHoAhNIa\n\nTheSM Kestrelmade contact with the Panama-flaggedDiamond Star II(57,700 dwt). The bulker had arrived in the anchorage on March 17. It was at anchor in the Western Anchorage, which is a busy part of Gibraltar Bay. Gibraltar has two anchorages, the Eastern which is used for provisioning and crew changes, and the Western where bunkering operations are conducted.\nTheOS 35was also maneuvering to leave the Western Anchorage in August 2022 and the vessel was encountering problems with the turns. As it got underway, it struck the bulbous bow and anchor of theAdam LNGcarrier, which only suffered minor damage. However, the cargo ship started taking on water and was ultimately directed into another part of the bay so that it could be grounded. It was a total loss and it took more than a year to salvage the vessel.\nGibraltar’s regulations only require pilots for berthing and unberthing, and not for departing the anchorage. In the case of theOS 35, there also was no requirement for the master to advise Gibraltar’s VTS of the intended plan so the VTS could not realize the vessel was off-plan. The VTS only called the vessel when it became concerned.\nThereport on the lossof theOS 35recommended that the Gibraltar Port Authority consider introducing compulsory pilotage for vessels departing the Western Anchorage. It also recommended the involvement of the VTS which could advise vessels on their departure plans. Short of these steps, it also called for the Gibraltar Pilots to highlight their availability for departures, and that they should make clear the process for requesting pilots for departures.\nBecause of its strategic location at the entrance to the Mediterranean, Gibraltar is a key port for many vessels. It is a busy bunkering port and a frequent stop for vessels for supplies and other services arriving from overseas or before they depart from the region. The Gibraltar Port Authority highlights that approximately 60,000 vessels transit the Strait of Gibraltar each year, with around 240 million gross tonnes of vessel calls per year at Gibraltar and its anchorages.\nTop photo byYmblanter-CC BY-SA 4.0",

The motion was opposed by Maersk's board, and when it was put to a vote at the company's annual general meeting Tuesday, it did not pass.\nMaersk denies shipping weapons or ammunition to Israel. In a statement Tuesday, it noted that its U.S. subsidiary - Maersk Line Ltd. (MLL) - has never even filed a transportation plan to ship \"classified or sensitive cargo, which includes weapons and ammunition.\" MLL is a U.S. Maritime Security Program (MSP) participant, and it operates U.S.-flagged vessels that carry federal cargoes, including the military assistance shipments that are a critical element of U.S. foreign policy.\nHowever, Maersk's critics have differing opinions about which cargoes could be considered \"weapons.\" Investigative journalism group Danwatch has obtainedbills of ladingthat appear to show that more than a dozen Maersk-owned ships carried thousands of tonnes of militarily-useful goods to Israel since the beginning of the Gaza conflict. In one example of a complete system delivery, one bill of lading appears to show that MLL shipped seven armor-equipped Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks (HEMTTs) to Haifa in November 2023. While HEMTTs are cargo vehicles, they meet EU definitions for military equipment, and Israeli forces have used armored HEMTTs inside of Gaza for logistics and prisoner transport.\nThe tabloid Ekstra Bladet alsoidentifiednine bills of lading with HTS code 9306.90 (explosive munitions and parts thereof), four with HTS code 9305.91 (cannon parts), and 31 with HTS code 9306.30 (cartridge components).\n\"The transport of cargo on behalf of the US government does not contain weapons or ammunition. These shipments contain military-related equipment and are derived from US policy under the US-Israeli security cooperation program,\" Maersk told Extra Bladet in response.\nIn its statement Tuesday, Maersk again denied transporting weapons to Israel and pushed back against \"misrepresentations\" about its business.\n\"The [activist] campaign is spreading inaccurate allegations and has in some instances involved assumptions presented as documented facts and what looks like misleading information through twisting of publicly available data,\" said Maersk in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we have also experienced vandalism and illegal, aggressive demonstrations on our premises and against our employees. This will not change our position or our business practice, guided by international standards.\"\nThe company said that it has a strict policy of not shipping weapons or ammunition to active conflict zones, and that it complies with all international regulations. \"We fully recognize our responsibility as a global logistics provider and that it is on us to always reinforce the internationally agreed responsible business practices – even more so when operating in areas of active conflict,\" the carrier said in a statement.",

Six months after reporting it wasdiscontinuingits efforts to acquire Austal, Hanwha today announced it is moving to become the largest shareholder in the Australia-based shipbuilder.\nHanwha announced the acquisition of 9.9 percent of Austal’s shares in open market transactions in Australia. Under Australian securities law, foreign companies can only purchase a 10 percent stake without filing with regulators, a step that Hanwha reported it has taken today. In addition to the shares purchased, Hanwha has entered into a swap transaction for an additional 9.9 percent of the shares with an Australian securities firm using a mechanism that allows it to receive the interests of shares without direct ownership.\nIn a filing with the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), Hanwha declared its interest in becoming an investor with a 19.9 percent stake in Austal. Analysts are calling it a clever move to quickly deepen the relationship without the time required to renew the acquisition bid, but at the same time, it achieves a first level of review from Australian regulators.\nIt became public in April 2024 that Hanwha was proposing to acquire Austal, but the Australian shipbuilder immediatelyrejectedthe approach saying it did not believe it would gain regulatory approval. Hanwha dismissed it saying that it already had strong ties in Australia and that a combination would strengthen the capabilities of the company in its role as national interest in Australia. However, it later accused Austal of insisting on onerous conditions to proceed with the offer.\nHanwha has indicated that it is paying a 16 percent premium to the closing price of Austal’s shares on Monday to increase its holdings. It reported paying $117 million for the initial share of 41.2 million shares. The acquisition was done through an Australian subsidiary owned by Hanwha Systems and Hanwha Aerospace.\nWhile Austal also builds high-speed ferries, offshore wind farm vessels, and oil and gas platform ships, Hanwha’s interest lies in its leadership role in naval shipbuilding. Hanwha highlights that Austal is one of the four key suppliers that directly build U.S. military vessels (along with Hutchison Ingalls, Lockheed Martin, and Fincantieri) and that Hanwha “plans to strengthen its position as a key player in the global shipbuilding and defense industry through this investment.”\nAustal is reported to rank first, holding 40 to 60 percent market share in the U.S. small surface combatants and logistics support vessel sector. It has shipbuilding facilities in Mobile, Alabama and San Diego, California in the U.S. as well as Australia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. It recently highlighted its fundraising efforts to support further expansion of its U.S. operations. Austal is reported to have an orderbook valued at US$9 billion.\n“As a strategic investor, we will support Austal’s growth and innovation and spare no effort in investing in strengthening the local defense industry and naval shipbuilding capabilities in Australia,” said Michael Coulter, President and Head of Overseas Business at Hanwha Aerospace. “Hanwha’s smart shipbuilding and defense industry capabilities can provide Austal with capital, network, operational and technical expertise.”\nHanwha said that its recent equity acquisition aims to strengthen its strategic partnership with Austal, not only in Korea and Australia but also in the United States, amid the favorable conditions of the global defense and shipbuilding industries.\nThe investment in Austal follows Hanwha’s acquisition of Philly Shipyard at the end of 2024. The company highlighted the opportunities to expand in U.S. shipbuilding and specifically for the U.S. government before Donald Trump took office and set expanding the U.S. Navy and restoring the U.S.’s shipbuilding capabilities as two of his first priorities.",

Chinese PLA Navy warships berthed for months at a newly-constructed pier at Ream in early 2024, raising concerns of a permanent Chinese presence in the Gulf of Thailand.\nAlthough Cambodia has long insisted that the base will be open to many foreign navies, it was not used to host the littoral combat ship USS Savannah in December 2024, nor was it used to welcome the Japanese destroyers Shimakaze and Suzunami when they arrived at Sihanoukville in February 2024.\nThe base will formally open on April 2 with a visit by Cambodia's ruler Hun Manet, son of Hun Sen, who ruled the country for more than 30 years and still controls the nation's senate. The Japan Maritime Self Defense Force's next call in Cambodia will be hosted at Ream, Cambodian armed forces spokesman Maj. Gen. Thong Solimo said this week.\n\"This would appear to be a conscious demonstration by Cambodia, that Ream is not exclusively for [China],\" ASPI's Euan Graham told AP.\nIn an earlier era, the U.S. Navy used to hold exercises with the Cambodian Navy at Ream Naval Base, and the U.S. and its allies invested in building small-scale infrastructure for the base. That changed rapidly after China began growing its economic and military ties to Cambodia. In 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported on an agreement between Cambodia and China to grant the PLA Navy a 30-year lease on Ream Naval Base, in exchange for assistance in expanding the facility. Beginning in 2022, China invested heavily in base construction and installed military-grade infrastructure beyond Cambodia's ability to construct on its own, like a carrier-sized finger pier and a large new drydock. Space-based surveillance companyBlackSkyhas noted that the pier is identical to the PLA Navy's new finger pier in Djibouti.\nThe U.S. Navy has not called at Ream since Chinese construction began, but earlier this month, Cambodian officials said that U.S.  warships would also be able to call at the base in the future.",

A new partnership between the innovation arm of Lomar Shipping, lomarlabs, is launching a partnership with a startup called Newlight to develop hydrogen retrofits to solve the challenge.\n“Hydrogen has enormous potential as a maritime fuel, but transitioning entire fleets to pure hydrogen is a long-term challenge,” said Haran Cohen Hillel, CEO of Newlight. “By taking immediate steps with the current fleet, we can decarbonize ship by ship—delivering real impact today.”\nNewlight reports it has developed a dual-fuel retrofit technology that will be a low Capex solution that enables existing vessels to integrate hydrogen as a fuel source. According to the company it on average should reduce fuel consumption by 20 percent.\nBy retrofitting existing diesel engines to operate on a hydrogen blend, the companies believe it can provide an immediate, scalable solution that cuts emissions without requiring a complete overhaul of the propulsion systems.\nLomarlabs announced a strategic collaboration that will make it possible to test the concepts using a vessel within the Lomar Shipping fleet. It reports that savings of up to 30 percent were demonstrated in workshop trials and through the collaboration will seek to replicate the results onboard vessels.\n“Decarbonization isn’t about waiting for the perfect fuel; it’s about acting now with every viable tool at our disposal,” said Stylianos Papageorgiou, Managing director of lomarlabs. Newlight’s dual-fuel retrofit technology promises an immediate, scalable, and cost-effective way to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. This is exactly the kind of practical innovation that will bridge the gap between today’s operational realities and the long-term vision of a net-zero maritime industry.“\nThe collaboration will focus on retrofitting conventional diesel engines to operate on a hydrogen-diesel mix. Lomarlabs and Newlight report they will conduct a pilot installation scheduled for summer 2025 on board a Lomar vessel to collect data and carry out harbor and sea trials.\nThis is one of several projects that lomarlabs has in its portfolio. Others include an effort to capture CO2 emissions from a vessel’s funnel or another technology to convert it to natural sea salts. It is also supporting a technology to reduce methane from the atmosphere and to develop autonomous magnetic crawler robots for hull cleaning. It is also involved in AI for autonomous navigation and the CargoKite, a concept to transport goods on autonomous ships propelled by a high-altitude wind kite system.",

The low availability of e-fuels will delay the expected timeline for methanol-fueled engine adoption, according to LR, and more vessels will have to retrofit later if the fleet is to meet IMO emissions goals.\n\"A key assumption of the [previous] modeling was that all vessels built beyond 2027-2030 would be capable of using zero- and near-zero emissions fuels. Without further effective drivers to take up these fuels or visibility on alternative fuel availability, that date could be pushed back – meaning that more vessels need to be retrofitted in a shorter timeframe, exacerbating strains on retrofitting capacity,\" the class society said in an update.\nSo far, only Europe has enacted regulations that could motivate shipowners to make the costly switch to zero-emissions fuels, and carbon-tax discussions at IMO are still ongoing (with changing U.S. government views on climate change a wild card). Until IMO's deliberations are completed, shipowners will have difficulty picking the right investments to meet future targets. For now, owners are favoring conventional bunker-fueled propulsion or dual-fuel LNG engines, and orders for green fuel-capable vessels have taken a back seat, LR reported.\n\"Over 2024, increasing numbers of shipowners turned to LNG to reduce exposure to carbon pricing. More than 305 LNG-fueled ships were ordered, far outpacing growth in the methanol- and ammonia-fueled fleet. This included major shipowners, such as Maersk, that had previously touted progressive decarbonization plans based around methanol fuel,\" LR noted.\nMethanol conversions are just getting started but are expected to pick up over the next four years, primarily in the container segment. Methanol accounts for most of the planned conversions through 2029, but the numbers are small, in the single digits per year.\nIf the IMO adopts a regulatory structure to drive the uptake of zero-carbon fuels, as is expected, shipyard capacity for future alternative fuel retrofits might not be enough to meet the demand. LR has identified 16 yards that have the experience to carry out the work, and MAN has highlighted an additional 11. Taken altogether, these yards could handle about 465 conversions per year, less than the 1,000 per year that LR expects at the peak of demand.\n\"In 2025, there will be many more conversions based on existing orders, offering vital experience for the fledgling market. Whether the growth in order numbers themselves will accelerate will depend largely on the signals that both alternative fuel producers and shipowners receive from regulators,\" LR concluded.",

The walkout comes at a critical time as the BAE Systems’ yard is preparing to move into full production of Australia’s new Hunter Class frigates as well as other major projects scheduled for 2025.\nThe Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union (AMWU) reports that over 400 of its members walked out to demonstrate their frustration on Monday, March 17 during an all-hands meeting hosted by BAE Systems Maritime Australia Acting Manager Director Paul Berryman. They were joined by around 100 workers from the Australian Workers’ Union (AWU) and the Electrical Trades Union (ETU).\nA BAE spokesperson confirmed to the local media in Australia that the company is “negotiating an Enterprise Agreement that seeks to ensure improvements to wages and longer-term job security for our employees.”\nThe blue-collar workers at the shipyard have been undertaking stoppages during the last month. Negotiations for wage increases and other issues reportedly started in July 2024. AMWU says it is seeking a 30 percent wage increase on average over three years to “keep them in line with industry rates.” It reports that BAE Systems Australia is currently offering workers a 12 percent wage increase over three years.\n“Workers at BAE are rightly angry that they are paid on average 20 percent less than other workers with the same skills in the same industry,” said AMWU SA Acting State Secretary Stuart Gordon.\nThe dispute comes at a critical time for the shipyard which is currently staffing up as it prepares to move from test modules to the full construction of the first of three Hunter Class frigates and a total of six in the program. In 2018, the Australian Government selected BAE Systems to deliver the Hunter program for the Royal Australian Navy.\nThe shipyard recently highlighted that it had added 47 apprentices joining the Hunter Class Frigate Program at the Osborne Naval Shipyard in Adelaide. It said it was part of its largest-ever intake of apprentices in the state.\n“The future of the industry is built on attracting and retaining our skills and experience,” said Gordon. “We are the highly skilled tradespeople who are building the next generation of ships for the Australia Defence Force.”\nIn addition to the Hunter program, the union highlights the yard will also commence maintenance and upgrades mid-year on the Hobart-Class destroyers as part of the Defence Capability Enhancement Program. The workforce will also conduct work on Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs).\nBAE reports that it will continue to ramp up recruitment for the Hunter program with 400 new trades roles to be offered in 2025.

The group was selected in 2023 for the project but the government has recently decided to shift the focus to new ships better suited for the Arctic.\n\"The situation has changed in several areas since the decision to design new patrol ships was made in 2021,” said Minister of Defense Troels Lund Poulsen. At the end of January, he said, “We are in a significantly changed security policy situation, and the Danish Armed Forces are demanding a replacement for the aging Thetis class. The contracting parties have therefore agreed to reorient the existing patrol ship project to focus on the Arctic ships.\"\nThe Danish patrol ships were originally designed to operate in the Baltic Sea and Danish waters. According to the minister, the mission changed after Sweden and Finland joined NATO. He said there would be more countries and assets available for the security patrols in the Baltic.\nWhile the Baltic remains a Danish focus, the Defense Command has also expressed a desire for an early replacement of the current Arctic ships, the existing Thetis class. Commissioned in 1991, they are four 3,500-ton displacement patrol ships deployed by the Royal Danish Navy. The goal was shifted to design modern ships that will be more efficient and require less maintenance as replacements for the aging Thetis class. The new ships will strengthen Denmark’s support of Greenland as well as its operational capacity in the Arctic and the North Atlantic.\nPoulsen said in January, \"The work so far has by no means been wasted. A reorientation makes it possible to get started more quickly with the design work on the Arctic ships. It is expected that sub-elements from the design work of the patrol ships and experiences from the work with a Danish construction strategy can be reused.\"\nThe partnership then known as Danske Patruljeskibe (Danish Patrol Ships) received a contract for the front-end engineering and design activity for a new class of flexible patrol ships in June 2023. It consists of Denmark's largest defense company Terma, Odense Maritime Technology, a world leader in the design of military ships with ongoing frigate projects in, among others, the UK, Poland, and Singapore, one of Denmark's largest pension funds and investors in infrastructure, PensionDanmark.\nSemco Maritime has entered into an agreement to take over ownership of the group now known as Danske Flådeskibe.

In service, it will replace the Navy's MH-53 mine countermeasures helicopter platform and the aging Avenger-class minehunting vessels.\nDesign of the Independence-class formally began in 2004, and the mission packages were designed in parallel. Initially, the minehunting package centered on Lockheed Martin's Remote Multi Mission Vehicle, an unmanned semisubmersible that the Navy bought in low-rate production to use for sonar towing. The Navy struggled to keep the RMMV in service at sea for more than 75 hours between failures, and it was ultimately replaced with a Textron USV design. This required the development team to start over in testing USV-sonar integration. The General Dynamics Knifefish unmanned submersible was also part of the initial package for neutralizing buried mines, but was canceled in 2021.\nThe revised MCM package achieved initial operational capability (IOC) in March 2023, nine years behind schedule, and the first unit was embarked aboard USS Canberra in April 2024. Installation involves craning the USV and containerized support equipment into the starboard side loading hatch, then maneuvering it around the mission bay with a compact, special-purpose straddle carrier.\nAfter a year of further experience with the package, USS Canberra and USS Santa Barbara have now deployed from San Diego on a mission to replace existing minehunting assets in Japan and the Mideast, according to USNI. One more vessel is expected to deploy this year.\nWork on the package is not yet done. In February, the Navy awarded Bollinger an advance order for $8 million to procure \"items needed to improve the MCM USV based on findings from operational testing.\" Production is under way for the minehunting payload for the USV, as well as the minesweeping payload.\nThe twin LCS classes were initially intended to accept all mission packages and to be interoperable with each other. This concept proved impractical in service, and in 2016, the Navy assigned the mine countermeasures role to the Independence-class and the antisubmarine warfare role to the Freedom-class. The ASW sonar suite failed to develop, in part because of interference from high noise levels from the Freedom-class' machinery, and the ASW package was canceled in 2022.\nThe Navy has downsized the Freedom-class, as the vessels cannot perform the ASW mission without an ASW sonar suite. Under then-Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday, the Navy sought to decommission the first nine Freedom hulls - one just five years old. Five Freedom-class vessels have been removed from service to date, along with the first four Independence-class hulls.",

The vessel is primarily designed for activity unrelated to fishing, like geological and geophysical surveys, seabed mapping, ROV deployment and deep sea exploration. It has DP2 diesel-electric propulsion to maintain position to within one meter of accuracy.\nThe 3,500-tonne vessel will be built at Wenling's Tenglong Shipbuilding. With a speed of 14 knots, a range of 5,000 nm and endurance of up to 60 days at sea, the vessel has the capability to conduct long research voyages. It is also envisioned as a support vessel for wind farm maintenance, seabed engineering and offshore oil field operations.\n\"It has great potential in deep-sea scientific research and operations. The deep-water equipment, power system and DP system equipped on board are all at the international advanced level,\" said Wang Haozhao, chief ship designer of Fujian Fuchuan Marine Engineering Technology Research Institute, which provided the design.\nThough fishermen-funded, it will be operated by Quanzhou-based Fujian Baozhou Shipping Co., Ltd. The vessel will be the first privately-run oceangoing research vessel in China. It will also be the first research vessel built at Tenglong Shipbuilding, better known for small specialty vessels like dredgers, distant-water fishing vessels and asphalt carriers.\nLike Hainan's fishing community, Zhejiang and Fujian fishermen are known for involvement inmaritime militiaorganizations, state-backed paramilitary groups that leverage private vessels for presence operations in foreign waters.

By 2028, Viking expects to take delivery on 25 additional river cruise ships, and by 2030 nine additional ocean cruise ships. With these orders, Viking will have 109 river ships in 2028 and 21 ocean and expedition cruise ships in 2030.\nThe first of the new deliveries was completed on March 18 at the Neptun Werft shipyard in Rostock in the Warnemünde region of Germany. It is number 66 in the “Longship” series built by the yard for the company using a patented river cruise ship design. The partnership between Viking and Neptun Werft built the luxury river cruise ships for more than a decade marking the completion of the first series in 2021. Two river ships were delivered in March 2021 and one more in February 2023.\nRecovering from the pandemic, Viking placed its first order for a new river cruise ship with Neptun Werft in February 2023 and that is the ship that was delivered yesterday. It is part of a “shortened Longship” specifically designed for navigation on France’s Seine. It measures 125 meters (410 feet) making it possible for the vessel to dock in the center of Paris. Named,Viking Nerthis, it has 86 passenger cabins accommodating 168 passengers.\n\"With this delivery, we can continue our extraordinarily successful partnership with Viking. For Neptun Werft, each new ship means further employment in the core business of river cruise ships. With the new orders from the beginning of the year, we are fully utilized until 2028,\" says Stephan Schmees, CEO of Neptun Werft.\nAt the end of 2023, Viking expanded its cruise ship orders with Neptun Werft for a total of nine river cruise ships, one additional for the Seine plus eight of the Longship series. The larger vessels are 135 meters (443 feet) long and accommodate 190 passengers.\nOne ship from the Seine series and four of the Longships will be delivered in 2025 and another set in 2026. Viking also added another eight ships to the order in January 2025. Those are scheduled for delivery in 2027 and 2028.\nNeptun Werft had previously built four river cruise ships,Viking Kari,Viking Radgrid,Viking Skaga, andViking Fjorgyn, in the Seine class. All the newer ships are being equipped with a hybrid system consisting of a diesel-electric drive, a battery system, and exhaust gas after-treatment. This will absorb peak loads and save a considerable amount of fuel. The ships will also be equipped with a number of technical innovations, such as a compact system for wastewater treatment as well as connections for shore power. Onboard, they have solar panels to further contribute to the ships’ energy efficiency.\nFounded in 1997 by Torstein Hagen, Viking is one of the pioneers in the modern river cruise industry.  It operates river cruises in Europe, Asia, and Egypt and has one ship on the Mississippi in the United States.",

A collective of 11 NGOs from West Africa have filed a complaint with the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office, demanding that Bolloré pay restitution for alleged corrupt practices that secured allegedly noncompetitive concession terms for the company's port operations.\nBolloré Africa Logistics - now known as AGL - got its start in the 1920s and grew into a ports empire across West and Central Africa. Bolloré Group sold the division to MSC for $6 billion in late 2022, and MSC retained the unit's separate identity and kept its longtime president at the helm. At the time of the sale, Bolloré had built up a presence in 47 countries with 16 container terminals, seven ro/ro terminals and two wood terminals, and it had 21,000 employees across the continent.\nAlong the way, Bolloré Group racked up complaints for allegedly corrupt dealings in West Africa. In 2018, French authorities put then-president Vincent Bolloré under investigation for allegedly using his media empire to help the election campaigns of leaders of Guinea and Togo, providing them with advertising at below-market rates in 2010. These politicians later granted lucrative container terminal concessions to Bolloré Logistics at Conakry, Guinea and Lome, Togo, respectively. Bolloré Group settled the matter with French authorities in a 2021 plea agreement and paid a fine.\nOn Wednesday, a coalition of African NGOs from Togo, Guinea, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Cameroon accused Vincent Bolloré, his son Cyrille Bolloré, and Bolloré Group of securing the right to operate ports in the region illegally, then later profiting from these arrangements by selling the business to MSC. The accusations relate to the Togo and Guinea cases, but also to activities at Tema, Ghana; Abidjan, Ivory Coast; and Douala and Kribi, Cameroon. The coalition - “Restitution for Africa” (RAF) - accused Bolloré of money laundering and fraud, and called for a full criminal prosecution.\n\"The continued ownership and operation of these assets until 2022 constitutes the offense of receiving stolen goods, which punishes the possession, use, or profit derived from fraudulent property,\" RAF argued in its complaint.\nRAF hopes to leverage a recently-enacted French law that allows the assets recovered from foreign corruption investigations to be returned to the countries affected, for use in economic development projects.",

The oil was transported by shadow fleet vessels, some of which have been sanctioned for their role in transporting Iranian petroleum linked to the Houthis. It specifically identified the tankers Mehle (Panama flag) and Kohana (renamed Limas and sailing under the flag of Guyana) which were sanctioned by the Biden administration in January 2024 as transporting oil to the refinery.\nThe U.S. Department of State today also designated Huaying Huizhou Daya Bay Petrochemical Terminal Storage, an oil terminal in China.

It comes as the French group has said it plans to continue to grow in the air cargo segment including expanding with a base in the United States.\nAir Belgium was founded in 2016 and started operations offering long-haul passenger flights and cargo operations in March 2018. It was struggling to establish its operations when the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the industry and forced it to ground its operations and convert passenger planes into cargo aircraft for medical transport. Citing the impact of COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, soaring fuel prices, inflation, and falling consumer purchasing power, the company ceased its passenger operation in September 2023 to focus on air cargo and leasing for passenger and cargo flights.\nThe company currently has two Airbus A330-200 and two Boeing 747-8F planes in operation highlighting the enhanced payload capacity and a variety of options provided by the fleet. The company however was placed under judicial supervision in September 2023 and moved a year later into judicial liquidation.\nA group called Air One Belgium, a joint venture of the UK’s Air One International and the Dutch company Peso Aviation Management, made a bid for the company which was accepted in December 2024. The deal has failed to close which last week led the Belgian authorities to revoke the acquisition permission and declared the deal had failed. The court gave Air Belgium till March 27 to find an alternate investor or face liquidation.\nCMA CGM was familiar with Air Belgium having started its cargo operation in 2021 working with the Belgium company. CMA CGM obtained its operating certificate in 2022 and launched its own fleet. CMA CGM currently operates four cargo planes, including three Boeing 777Fs and an Airbus A330F with orders for two more 777s and eight Airbus A350Fs due in late 2027 and beyond. Last week as part of a $20 billion investment plan for the U.S., CMA CGM said it would also establish a new air cargo hub in Chicago, and deploy five new Boeing 777 freighters, operated by American pilots.\nAir One Belgium announced that it was appealing the court decision as it wanted to proceed with its acquisition of the troubled Belgian carrier.

The MDTA was on thenational panelthat came up with updated ship strike engineering standards in 1991, and it had three decades of well-informed advance notice to evaluate the Key Bridge, according to NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy.\nMDTA couldn't even provide the underlying data to perform the analysis when NTSB asked, so NTSB worked with the National Highway Administration to gather the needed information and do the engineering work itself. NTSB's analysis found that the Francis Scott Key Bridge's risk of collapse from a ship strike was 30 times higher than recommended by existing federal guidance, and 15 times higher at the pier that the boxshipDalihit on March 26, 2024.\n\"We were very surprised that they were so high, almost 30 times greater than the threshold thatAASHTOsets, and 15 times for pier 17 and pier 18. That was a surprise to all of us. But you know, it's something that MDTA could have known and should have known,\" Homendy said.\nIf MDTA had carried out the risk analysis anytime after 1991, the year that MDTA helped create the national standard, the state agency would have concluded that the bridge needed protection from a ship strike, Homendy said - and it could have prevented the collapse by making infrastructure improvements.\n\"There's no excuse,\" said Homendy.\n\nShe noted that as of late 2024, MDTA has still not performed the same risk analysis on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, which was designed in the same era as the Francis Scott Key Bridge and experiences the same ship traffic, but at higher vessel speeds.\nNTSB has issued an urgent recommendation to 30 bridge owners around the country to perform the standard ship strike risk analysis on 68 bridge spans, including both spans of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.\n\"We are saying there is a safety deficiency here, a potential safety risk, and you need to take immediate action,\" said Homendy. \"It shouldn't take an urgent safety recommendation to get action, and we expect that to be done now, and we'll follow up.\"\nMaryland's transport agency had decades of advance notice. In addition to the 1991 AASHTO recommendation, which MDTA helped draft, a senior Maryland pilot raised concerns about the risk of an allision between a big ship and the Francis Scott Key Bridge at least as early as 2006 - and continued to discuss the matter in local safety meetings for years, according to detailed records uncovered by the Washington Post.\nThe documents also show that at the staff level, the Maryland Transportation Authority was aware that their bridge was \"not designed to withstand collisions from large vessels,\" and that the cost of protecting it would be high.\nIn neighboring Delaware, a state agency has shown that safety upgrades are possible - and costly. Ten years ago, in 2015, Delaware's bridge transport authority set aside $2.5 million to design new protective dolphins for the Delaware Memorial Bridge to defend against ship strikes. The agency bundled the dolphin project into a large package of renovations, secured a permit from the Corps of Engineers, raised tolls on motorists, convinced two state governors to sign off on the cost, and issued bonds to raise funds. Construction started on theeight protective steel-and-rock dolphinslast year, and should be done by the end of 2025.\nNTSB will release its final report later this year, including the findings of its maritime investigative team on the factors aboard theDali.",

It became the latest of the major carriers to highlight the uncertainties and predict that the industry would continue to experience declines in profitability in the year ahead.\n“We anticipate earnings in 2025 to be lower than in 2024,” CEO Rolf Habben Jansen told investors. “The economic and geopolitical environment remains fragile.” He highlighted a long list of challenges to the industry including an expectation that the outlook for U.S. economic growth is now reduced. Hapag was the first of the major carriers to discuss its outlook after Trump’s tariffs and trade war began.\nOutlining the results for 2024, Jansen said they had been confronted with “a challenging market environment.” Container volumes however were up 4.7 percent to 12.5 million TEU while he said that freight rates overall remained stable for the year. As a result, Hapag reported revenues increased to just over $20 billion.\nThe carrier said that earnings increased slightly on an EBITDA basis to $5 billion, but the bottom line profitability was down versus 2024 to $2.6 billion. It sighted lower interest income, higher tax expenses, and higher transportation costs as it rerouted ships around the Cape of Good Hope. While the company remained strongly profitable, the board however is proposing a greater than 11 percent cut in its annual dividend reflecting the lower profitability.\nHapag’s results were largely in keeping with the other major carriers. Analysts at Sea-Intelligence yesterday forecast the sector would have total profitability on an EBIT basis of around $60 billion in 2024. That represents a significant decline from the peak of nearly $200 billion each in 2021 and 2022 according to the report.\n“The 2024 level of profitability is still significantly higher than the pre-Covid years,” noted Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence. “In fact, the EBIT recorded in 2024-FY is higher than the combined EBIT of 2019, 2020, and 2023.”\nHapag pointed to its efforts to consolidate and expand its terminal business in 2024 and its efforts to further improve processes which it said would yield results in the future. While saying it would keep “a very close eye” on unit costs while focusing on increasing efficiency, Jansen pointed to the implementation of the Gemini network with Maersk and continued efforts to develop its terminal business in 2025.\nNoting the “considerable uncertainty,” Hapag forecasted that earnings on an EBITDA basis would decline to a range between $2.5 to $4.0 billion. On an EBIT basis, Hapag predicts it will be between breakeven and $1.5 billion in 2025\nDespite the forecasts for 2025, Hapag continues to have a longer-term positive outlook.

The recommendations take the unusual step of calling on the trade organizations to become involved in developing a minimum operational safety standard for stevedores conducting cargo operations aboard member vessels.\nDespite international and industry guidance on the training stevedores should receive before working on bulk carriers, MAIB highlights InterManager data that shows of the 257 enclosed space fatalities reported between 1999 and 2023, 67 (26 percent) of which were stevedores or shore workers. It concludes after investigating the 2022 incident that training and drills for emergency scenarios need to include the possible presence of shoreside staff.\nThe report details an incident in June 2022 aboard the Berge Bulk dry bulk carrierBerge Mawson(181,000 dwt) built in 2015. The vessel was in the Bunyu Island anchorage in Indonesia loading coal from barges using a floating crane. Stevedores were leveling the coal in hatch no. 7 using a bulldozer but the operation was paused and all the hatches were closed due to heavy rain.\nOnce the rain stopped, MAIB believes one of the stevedores made several attempts to gain access to the bulldozer. It concludes that unsupervised the worker descended into the cargo hold no. 8 access space where he collapsed. While theBerge Mawson’s crew was getting its rescue equipment, two other stevedores attempted to rescue their colleague and they two collapsed.\n“It is evident that the stevedores did not have a sufficient understanding of the hazards posed by coal cargos,” says Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents Andrew Moll. He also highlights that the shore personnel did not have training about the dangers associated with entering enclosed spaces and the crew aboard the ship did not prevent their access.\nMAIB concludes that the oxygen was depleted in the area creating a noxious atmosphere. As a result, all three men died.\nIt lists a series of failures saying that the atmosphere was not routinely tested before stevedores entered a compartment. The stevedores were not adequately supervised and had not been trained on the dangers of enclosed spaces. Further, they were unable to understand the safety labels and warnings posted on the ship.\nWhile it finds that the crew aboard the ship was trained, they were not trained for consideration of shoreside personnel working aboard the vessel and their safety drills did not involve scenarios with shore workers. As they rushed to get the safety equipment, the ship’s crew did not block or guard entry into the space.\n“To help prevent further loss of life it is essential that bulk carrier and terminal operating procedures, practices, and training equip shore workers to operate safely on board the vessels,” writes MAIB.\nThe report recommends reviewing and revising the Code of Safe Working Practices maintained by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. In addition to also making safety training recommendations to both the terminal operator and the shipping line, it is calling on Intercargo, InterManger, and RightShip to develop a minimum operating safety standard for stevedores conducting cargo operations on board their member’s vessels. It also says the trade groups should encourage members to introduce minimum operational safety standards for stevedores.",

It was said to have lost power and navigation and to have been drifting in the Baltic off the coast of Ruegen, Germany. The vessel was brought to an anchorage and that’s where the story began to unravel.\nBuilt in 2006, it became clear that the tanker registered in Panama was part of the shadow fleet servicing the Russian oil trade. It had loaded in Ust-Luga departing on January 7 with a declared destination of the Suez Canal. Three days later the vessel was drifting in the Baltic.\nA review of its documentation showed it has been owned by the mysterious Laliya Shipping since May 2024 with no known address. The vessel was being managed out of Dubai. Reports link the tanker to Fractal Marine DMCC, the Dubai-based tanker firm also involved in the Russian trade.\nWithin days, the captain of the vessel reportedly filed for permission to depart Germany after the Federal Ministry of Transport was informed the engine had been repaired. The ministry however said that it wasdetaining the tankerand inspecting the vessel’s documentation.

The details of the effort showing the depths of the efforts by the drug gang are contained in a new indictment filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Florida.\nThe U.S. extradited two former employees of Colombia’s Armada Nacional to Florida to stand trial for a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The U.S. contends there is “reasonable cause to believe” the cocaine would have been illegally imported into the United States.\nAccording to the indictment and news reports in Colombia, Alberto Alvarez Valenzuela, age 54, worked for Armada Nacional as a civil electromechanical engineer at a base in Uraba, Colombia until he retired in 2022. Luis Carlos Diaz Martinez, age 32, worked for the Colombian Navy until 2012, according to the newspaper USA Today. Both individuals arrived in the U.S. on March 13 to stand trial while the court filing indicates that other former Navy officials were also involved in the scheme. A sergeant, ensign, and other low-ranking officers were named in the indictment.\nThe U.S. contends that in exchange for money from the drug traffickers, the individuals recruited active-duty members of the Colombian Navy to plant GPS tracking devices on the navy’s vessels. It says that the frigate ARC Antioquia and three patrol boats, ARC Punta Espalda, ARC 11 de Noviembre, and ARC Toledo, were tracked by the drug cartel between November 2022 and March 2023. The vessels were used for patrols and interdictions.\nBy tracking the movements of the vessels, the drug traffickers hoped to route their vessels around the patrols and avoid detection. The tracking was going on while the vessels were in the Caribbean, including spots near Panama, and approaching Cartagena, Colombia.\nThe U.S. highlights that drug runners from Colombia move more than 1,000 metric tons of cocaine via the Caribbean and Pacific, often on go-fast semisubmersibles. This latest case illustrates the lengths the drug cartels are going to in moving the drugs to the United States. Previous reports said the cartels have also bribed fishermen to act as spies and report the movement of naval vessels.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s office reports the two individuals extradited to the U.S. will be prosecuted as part of the Organized Drug Enforcement Task Forces Strike Force Initiative. If convicted, both defendants face a maximum penalty of life in federal prison.",

Dozens of subsea cables crisscross the Pacific, linking data customers in Asia's thriving business hubs with markets in the West. These cables - and others just like them around the world - handle about 95 percent of all international data traffic, including phone calls, internet data and private network data.\nAt water depths greater than about 2,000 meters, the cable lay industry does not typically bury subsea data cables, and avoids the cost and hassle of trenching by simply placing the cables on the seabed instead. These fiber-optic lines are thin and unobtrusive, just 20-60 mm in diameter, but they are comparatively strong, capable of withstanding a strain of up to 20-70 tonnes before breaking.\nHu's robotic device is titanium-clad to withstand the extreme pressures of 4,000 meters of depth, which happens to be the same depth range where unprotected subsea cables are found. With a six-inch diamond blade, the saw can cut through steel-armored cables of up to 60mm in lab testing (image at top).\nCSSRC is one of the research arms of state-owned giant CSSC, the world's largest shipbuilding company and the builder of the PLA Navy's fleet.

Neither government officials nor the shipping companies, the National Iranian Tanker Company or Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Company, have publicly commented or denied the claims.\nLab Dookhteganposted messages on Telegram and X boasting of its accomplishments saying it was to celebrate the sixth anniversary of its operation. “In an unprecedented move, we successfully disrupted the communication network of two Iranian companies that, among various terrorist activities, are responsible for supplying munitions to Houthis,” the group wrote while also reposting links to reports from the Iranian media.\nIt claimed to have also timed the attack to coordinate with the U.S.’s current offensive against the Houthis and in parallel to the U.S. and European sanctions against Iranian shipping. It asserts that the communications for 50 ships belonging to the National Iranian Tanker Company and 66 ships operated by the Iran Shipping Lines have been disabled.

The Iranian media speculates the vessels use encrypted networks to speak with the military but likely depend on satellite communications systems such as VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) technology. They said it would be impacting the ability to coordinate operations, transmit data, and navigate.\nThe speculation is that the vessels might be limited to traditional radio systems with VHF and HF frequencies used for short-range communications, such as ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore.\nCyber security analysts at Cydomepublished an analysisof Lab Dookhtegan noting while there was no evidence of this attack or its results it was based on the previous credibility of the group. They said while the group does not disclose its exact tactics, they believe the group uses a search engine device that could locate ship satellite terminals. They speculate the group could have remotely compromised the terminals using factory-set passwords, giving it the ability to alter system settings or even upload malicious firmware.\nFurthermore, they believe there would have been a high degree of automation and coordination required to deliver malware or malicious commands to 116 vessels simultaneously.  They speculate it may have involved prior reconnaissance and required advanced capabilities.\nBased on this attack, Cydome is recommending that all shipping companies perform a comprehensive risk assessment. They cite the need to install a dedicated maritime cybersecurity solution that is independent of the communications devices.\nIf this attack is proven legitimate, it would not be the first time Iranian shipping has reportedly fallen vulnerable to cyberattacks. In 2024, unconfirmed reports from NBC News said the American forces carried out a cyberattacktargeting an Iranian spy ship.

Compared to the existing Svitzer fleet of tugs working alongside theTaurusin Amsterdam, the new design recorded an average fuel efficiency improvement of 15 percent.\nThe trials also showed that at speeds above 2-3 knots in dynamic modes, the TRAnsverse tug expands the operating envelope by around 50 percent compared to ASD tug designs. It can push and sidestep effectively in a full speed range up to 10 knots, has greater maneuverability and better usage of hydrodynamic forces during pulling and braking. The new design’s improved transition capability also means that the tug requires less power, time and fuel than other tugs.\nThe TRAnsverse tug design started in 2019 with the initial concept developed by Robert Allan. The company says that throughout the design process, the intention was to widen the operational envelope and challenge preconceptions about tug design.\nAmong the key elements of the TRAnsverse design is the towing staple, aimed at increasing stability in operation, improving its direct and indirect capabilities, and increasing maneuverability when connected to the ship - while also helping to avoid thruster-to-thruster interaction. Another element is the double-ended hull and propulsion. While the propulsion units are the well-known azimuth thrusters, the TRAnsverse provides higher slewing rates than the industry norm. Though currently powered by conventional diesel engines, plans are underway to integrate battery power.\nIn coming up with the design, Svitzer was responding to the fact that port congestion has become a major challenge in global shipping, causing delays, driving up costs, and creating ripple effects throughout supply chains. Vessels have become larger and larger, making it a daunting task getting them in and out of ports. While the towage industry has responded by building larger tugs, the company opted for a ‘smarter’ option.\n“We believe that the TRAnsverse tug has the potential to become a game changer in harbor and terminal towage. It can address common port pain points, including severe challenges with port congestion, larger vessels, and more extreme weather conditions,” said Kasper Karlsen, Svitzer Chief Operating Officer.\nAlready, eight TRAnsverse tugs are in operation or on order, with Svitzer expecting more orders after gathering data on the tug’s ability to solve most of the daily jobs faster and better than standard tug designs.",

During that time, the Army Corps reports maintenance crews performed a variety of critical tasks on the Poe Lock, including fabricating and replacing anchorages on gate 3, commissioning the temporary dewatering system, filling in nonoperational ship arrestor recesses on the downstream end, flushing and cleaning the hydraulic systems for the rehabilitated ship arrestor systems, navigation button rehabilitation, removing underground storage tanks and repairing the winter work bridge recesses. The Poe Lock was not dewatered this year for the scheduled maintenance but contractors also used the time to complete upstream stop log recess repairs.\n\n\nFirst vessel honors for the 2025 season went to the tug-barge combo as the lock reopened to vessel traffic (USACE)\n\nHonors for the last vessel through the lock on January 16 went to theAmerican Mariner, a 730-foot freighter loaded with more than 20,000 tons of wheat. Through the Poe Lock this morning first was the tugClyde S.which is 130 feet in length and was working with theErie Tradera 740-foot barge. Both are owned by VanEnkevort Tug & Barge.\nThe Army Corps reports it opened the Poe Lock early in response to requests from the shipping community. It started the 2025 season giving shippers a head start before the St. Lawrence Seaway reopens on March 22. They expect an influx of Canadian vessels and international shipping when the full system is open for the season. The Army Corps was pleased to make it possible for the larger lock to begin operations early. However, the smaller MacArthur Lock will remain closed opening in April.\nTo ensure navigation would be possible, the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Mackinaw made its way through Soo Locks on March 19. It went to break ice in Whitefish Bay on the northern side of the lock where vessels enter Lake Superior.\nOnce completing the locking, the vessels are heading across Lake Superior to Duluth, Minnesota.",

It represents a £1 billion (US$1.3 billion ) project which when completed will add 50 percent capacity to the UK’s logistics sector.\nWork is due to start in May, the DP World reports it will take four years to complete the expansion. The project will add two further 400-meter (1,300-foot) all-electric berths and a second rail terminal. It follows recent investments in new cranes and logistics capabilities. The expanded container port, part of the Thames Freeport, will be able to accommodate six of the world’s largest container ships, which will be served by Europe’s tallest quay cranes.\nDP World worked to gain regulatory approval for the investment, which was first announced in October 2024. Today, the chairman of DP World Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem hosted the UK Minister of State for Investment, Baroness Poppy Gustafsson, at London Gateway to discuss the investment, growth plans, and 400 new permanent jobs that will be created at the logistics hub.\n“This investment enhances London Gateway’s position at the heart of British trade, creating new capacity and new connections between the UK and the global economy,” said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. “DP World has invested more than £5 billion in its UK operations, providing more than 5,500 jobs, and is proud to be supporting national economic growth by enabling businesses to thrive and increasing resilience in the supply chain.”\nThe start of construction follows the agreement between DP World and the Gemini Cooperation (Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd) for Gemini’s Asia-Europe and Middle East-Europe services to call at London Gateway. The first ship arrived at London Gateway this week following DP World Southampton welcoming its first ship under the Gemini Cooperation on February 3. The cooperation is focusing on the DP facilities moving these routes to Felixstowe as Genimi seeks faster port turns and 90 percent schedule reliability.\n“DP World’s expansion in London Gateway will turbocharge the UK’s logistics sector and help?deliver the long-term, stable growth that supports skilled jobs and raises living standards across the UK,” said Baroness Poppy Gustafsson, Minister of State for Investment, said: “The UK is open for business and DP World’s major investment is the latest vote of confidence in our economy, delivering economic growth and showing our Plan for Change is working.”\nThe company reports the project will create over 1,000 construction jobs, plus 400 permanent new jobs at the port. The terminal opened its fourth berth in the fall of 2024, which DP World said was the first all-electric berth in the world. When this project is completed it will have reached the planned design with a total of six large berths for containerships.\nCombined DP World’s Gate and Southampton terminals handled approximately 3.6 million TEUs each year. The Thames Estuary hub opened in 2013 and last year handled approximately 2 million TEU. The company reported it was one of the fastest growing in its global portfolio achieving double-digit growth over 2023.",

    "input": "\nFLNG developer Delfin has secured a long-sought license from the Maritime Administration to install a three-unit FLNG liquefaction hub in the U.S. Gulf, based around existing infrastructure.\nIts proposed Delfin LNG project centers on the UTOS pipeline, or U-T Offshore System. The pipeline runs from Cameron Parish out into the U.S. Gulf, and was originally built to bring gas from offshore wells back to land for processing and sale. Former owner Enbridge shut down the pipeline in 2011 as gas flows reduced to levels that were no longer commercially viable; Delfin bought it in 2014 and filed an application with the Department of Energy to use it as an export line for an FLNG complex.\nDelfin's plan is to reverse the direction of flow in the existing line and sell now-abundant supplies of U.S. natural gas to foreign buyers via a floating export terminal. At the seaward end would be as many as three anchored FLNGs, capable of up to 13 million tonnes per annum of output, and situated in water deep enough to accommodate fully laden LNG carriers alongside.\nDelfin has already arranged long-term offtake contracts with trading house Gunvor and with Chesapeake Energy, and has explored additional options with Chinese buyers. Two years ago, it entered into an agreement with Wison Offshore for the design and engineering of the FLNG units, and said that market conditions were prompting an acceleration of project plans. At the time, the objective was to be ready to begin construction on the first of the planned FLNG units by mid-2024.\nDelfin had applied for an operating license from MARAD in 2015, and MARAD confirmed Friday that this piece of the puzzle has now fallen into place after a 10-year review. The license is now in hand, and it lets Delfin own, build and operate a deepwater port for LNG export purposes. Paired with its Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval for exports to non-free trade agreement countries, it is now one step closer to moving forward.\nFor future expansion, Delfin has rights to a second, adjacent subsea gas pipeline system that could be used for a parallel development, Avocet LNG. It believes that permitting would be easier for this expansion because of the work previously done for MARAD's Delfin LNG approval.\nThe company is also a partner in the Haisla LNG project, a small-scale FLNG project with the Haisla Nation in British Columbia.",

But it seems likely that all parties want to pause the talks for the present, while the United States is apparently considering whether it should make a direct bid for sovereignty for the 60 km2 tropical paradise itself, given both its defense utility and potential as a resort destination.",

According to the news accounts, the vessel was first questioned in February just days after it was stopped by German federal police for an investigation related to cable damage in Sweden. Again, yesterday, March 20, the Irish authorities were tracking the ship as it was sailing in its coastal waters.\nThe ship which is registered in Antigua and Barbuda and managed from Latvia is now docked in the Irish port of Aughinish on the southwest coast near Limerick. Its AIS signal indicates it was coming from Spain where it had departed on March 15. The Air Corps tracked the vessel yesterday according to the newspapers in part due to a previous incident off the northeast coast of Ireland earlier this year.\nThe ship was identified as suspicious after German authoritiesreported stopping iton February 24 in Kiel. At the time the reports said it was missing its port-side anchor. Fears were running high after Sweden reported cable damage near Gotland, but after a three-hour investigation, the German authorities permitted the vessel to continue its voyage.\nThe Journal.ie reports that Irish authorities then detected the same ship off the northeast coast and the Air Corps was sent to investigate. According to the unconfirmed reports, the surveillance airplane filmed the vessel dropping its anchor. The Irish Defense Force reportedly contacted the ship ordering it to stop its anchoring and back away from the sensitive area with the cables.

It comes mounting evidence points to Russia building a supply chain to alleviate Syria’s ongoing energy crisis.\nIn a posting online, Syria reported the arrival on Thursday night, March 20, of the tankerAquatica(106,000 dwt) carrying nearly 100 million metric tons of crude oil. The report said the tanker would begin offloading at the oil terminal in Baniyas marking the first shipment to reach the country “since the liberation.” Media reports said it is critical fuel to be used for electric power generation.\nThe new government has been desperate to build fuel supplies to address a lack of domestic production and a suspension of imports. The Financial Times has reported that Syria was getting as much as 100,000 barrels a day from Iran before the fall of the Assad regime. Iran reportedly was supplying approximately 90 percent of Syria’s crude oil but cut it off when Assad fled the country.\nAquaticais registered in Barbados but databases list its management in Azerbaijan and ownership in the Seychelles. The tanker was added to the U.S. sanctions list in January 2025 and the European Union followed with its listing of the tanker in February.\nWhile it is the first reported crude oil tanker to arrive, according to TankerTrackers.com it is not the last. Theyreported onlineearlier this week that they are tracking another tanker,Sabina(158,000 dwt) registered in Barbados but owned and managed from Hong Kong. TankerTrackers.com says it is transporting one million barrels of Russian crude oil to Syria, where it is due to arrive in early April. Reuters is also reporting that a crude oil tanker namedSakina(157,000 dwt) also registered in Barbados with management and ownership in Hong Kong is heading toward Syria.

France 24published an exposéon March 20 tracking the growing number of tankers suddenly arriving in Syria. It believes the common link is Russia and quotes analysts speculating that Russia has made a deal to supply oil products in exchange for maintaining its military presence in Syria.\nThe Syrian Arab News Agency announced the first arrival of badly needed gas supplies into the country last week. It highlighted two gas tankers,Prosperity(40,000 dwt registered in Barbados) andGas Catalina(7,800 dwt registered in Palau) arriving around March 12.

The Canadian Coast Guard highlights the dangers remain, but that no pollution has been observed so far from the stranded vessel.\n“The tug and barge, contracted by MSC, were able to go alongside the MSC Baltic III to load some frac tanks and a containment boom onboard the vessel,” said the Canadian Coast Guard in its latest update. “The frac tanks will be used to store and offload the fuel.”\nThe containership blacked out and was driven ashore in a remote cove on Newfoundland’s western shore on February 15 not far from Corner Brook. The Coast Guard along with T&T Salvage have reported that the efforts however were complicated by the remote location and winter weather which has included high winds and ice in the cove.\nThe priority is the fuel and other potential contaminants aboard the vessel. The salvage teams after inspecting the 680-foot (207-meter) vessel reported that it was resting on the seabed but that the hull had experienced significant damage. They said there is water in the cargo holds and the engine room and that the vessel cannot be safely refloated at this time. Tank soundings confirmed approximately 1.7 million liters of heavy fuel and marine gas oil are onboard the vessel.\nThe Coast Guard reports that several containers that were carrying polymeric beads (plastic nurdles) which are considered dangerous goods have been removed from the vessel. MSC Mediterranean Shipping had previously said those containers had been secured to reduce the danger of the contents being released.\nThe fuel aboard the vessel will need to be heated before it can be pumped from the tanks. MSC and its salvage company have proposed several salvage options, including loading the fuel and containers onto barges or also using an access road onshore. However, the road requires upgrades to get the heavy equipment to the area where the ship came to rest.\nLocal news media reports that the efforts are ongoing and fishermen are hoping that it will make progress by the end of the month. The local fishing season opens on April 1 and the concern is for access to the areas as well as the continued danger from pollution.",

EUNAVFOR Atalanta notes it is the third piracy-related case involving a Yemeni fishing vessel and is in addition to a Chinese fishing vessel that was hijacked late in 2024.\nThe hijackers are reported to have left the dhow in the vicinity of Dhinowda during the day on March 20. The boat was in a position to the south of where it was boarded. Seven individuals were reported to have taken control of the vessel on March 16 in a position off Durdura, in the vicinity of Eyl, on the Northern coast of Puntland which is a semi-autonomous region in Somalia. The area has been a hotbed of piracy activity.\nA naval vessel working with EUNAVFOR Atalanta conducted a “friendly approach,” to the fishing boat today, March 21. They report that they boarded the vessel to check on the welfare of the eight Yemeni crewmembers. The team also gathered evidence of the hijacking.\nOperation Atalanta repeated that it strongly recommends merchant and other vulnerable vessels operating in the areas should register. It reports that the operation remains vigilant to any piracy-related events in its area of operations to ensure maritime security and cautions vessels to take extra precautions in the area.\nThe incidents with the Yemeni fishing boats have mostly been cases of armed robbery where the pirates board the vessels and leave within a few days. The Chinese vessel however was held for approximately a month before the Chinese embassy reported it had been freed without providing details.\nThe incidents of piracy in the region resumed after the Houthis also began to attack shipping in the area. Atalanta has cautioned that the danger remains high while working with the local authorities to increase security in the region.",

The tanker,Nexus Victoria(75,000 dwt) is also reported to be the largest vessel to incorporate Value Marine’s SOx scrubber with advanced carbon capture technology.\nThe installation was recently completed in Singapore aboard the tanker, which is owned by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and registered in the Isle of Man. The tanker, which is managed by Synergy Maritime, was built in Japan and runs with a single two-stroke six-cylinder diesel engine from Mitsui Engineering.\n“This system represents a crucial step in decarbonizing vessels that cannot yet transition to next-generation fuels,” said Hiroyoshi Kubo, Executive Officer – Tanker Unit at MOL. “Together with Value Maritime, we are committed to advancing carbon capture solutions and building a CO2 value chain that contributes to a sustainable, carbon-neutral industry.”\nVM’s Filtree system is designed to filter sulfur, CO2, and (ultra) fine particulate matter from the vessel’s exhaust stream. The company was started in 2017 focusing on scrubbers but has now developed a system that combines the two functions. The system’s plug-and-play design includes onboard CO2 capture and storage capabilities, enabling captured CO2 to be offloaded onshore for reuse in greenhouse cultivation, methanol production, or the food industry.\nThe system consists of two elements, including a small prefabricated, pre-installed, “plug and play” gas cleaning system in a road transportable housing. This system filters the sulfur, 99 percent of the particulate matter (fine dust), and CO? from the exhaust gases of ships. The second stage is equipped with a filter that cleans the washing water. Oil residues and particulate matter are removed from the washing water and fed to the sludge tank.\nAccording to the company, its VM 15MW next-generation EGCS Filtree system will capture 10 percent of the tanker’s CO2 emissions. It is potentially scalable to 30 percent.\nThis project was agreed to in April 2024 as the company’s first in Japan. Value Maritime aims to expand its partnerships across Asia and enhance its carbon logistics.\nEastern Pacific Shipping installed onboard its MR tankerPacific Cobalta first-of-its-kind fully integrated carbon capture solution developed by Value Maritime in February 2023. At the time they reported the system would be capable of capturing up to 40 percent of CO2 emissions from the vessel’s main and auxiliary engines as well as 99 percent of SOx emissions. Ardmore Shipping in September 2023 also began fitting the first of nine systems aboard its tankers at a shipyard in China.\nThe shipping industry is showing increasing interest in the technology. It could become a key tool in addressing the emissions of the in-service fleet extending the life and financial performance of these vessels.",

    "input": "\nDays after the National Transportation Safety Board took state highway agencies to task for unassessed bridge strike risks, a team at Johns Hopkins University has published a comprehensive list of the bridge spans that are most exposed to the hazard. The Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which was struck and destroyed by the boxshipDalilast year, emerged in the top-10 list for bridges most likely to be hit.\n“With this investigation we wanted to know if what happened to the Key Bridge was a rare occurrence. Was it an aberration? We found it’s really not,” said Michael Shields, Johns Hopkins associate professor and lead author. “In fact, it's something we should expect to happen every few years.”\nThe study suggests that the likelihood of ships alliding with bridges has been greatly underestimated, and that we should all expect to see more bridge strikes in our lifetimes. Owing to the dramatic increase in the size of ships, and the fact that most bridges are witnessing an unprecedented increase in vessel traffic, future allisions are virtually certain - though the severity will vary, and there are engineering interventions to reduce harm. For example, the group calculated that the Huey P. Long Bridge outside New Orleans and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge are likely to be hit by a ship within two decades.\nJohns Hopkins is releasing the preliminary findings of the study on the first anniversary of the Key Bridge collapse after it was struck by the boxshipDali, killing six people who were carrying out roadway repairs on the bridge deck. While investigations are still ongoing on the cause of the allision, the reality is that the chances of another similar incident are much higher. Ship strikes should be extremely rare, with bridge design standards stipulating that the annual chances of a bridge collapse from ship allisions should be less than 1 in 10,000 years. But after collecting, mining and analyzing 16 years of U.S. Coast Guard data, the team concluded the next allision could be in the pipeline. Notably, even iconic bridges like San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and Maryland's Chesapeake Bay Bridge are not immune to allisions.\nThe team based its study on AIS tracking, port data and bridge data from the National Bridge Inventory to determine which large ships passed under which bridges. Using the traffic data, along with average mishap rates from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the team was able to estimate the probability of very large ships hitting the piers of major bridges across the U.S. (Bridges without in-water piers were excluded from the study.)\nThe Key Bridge allision provided an unfortunate confirmation of their methods: the team predicted it would have likely been hit by a ship within 48 years. The bridge was 46 years old when it fell, having sustained a minor hit from a ship previously.\nThe study identifies the bridges facing the highest risks of allision over the next five decades or less. These include the Huey P. Long Bridge (17 years), the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (22 years), the Crescent City Connection in New Orleans (34 years) and the Beltway 8 Bridge in Houston (35 years). Others include the Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge west of New Orleans (37 years), Bayonne Bridge, N.Y./N.J (43 years) and Fred Hartman Bridge, Texas (47 years).\n“There's still a lot of uncertainty in predicting the frequency of ship collisions, even with the best data we have,” said Shields. “But the important point is not whether it will occur every 17 years or every 75 years. It's that it's happening way too often.”",

    "input": "Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines is moving forward to become one of the first of the major carriers to incorporate ammonia-fueled vessels into its fleet. MOL is joining with CMB.Tech which launched a project in 2023 to build the first ammonia-fueled large dry bulker carriers and will also expand ammonia as a fuel to its chemical tanker segment.\nMOL and CMB.Tech have agreed to joint ownership of three ammonia-fitted 210,000 dwt Newcastle bulk carriers. The vessels have already been ordered at Qingdao Beihai Shipyard due for delivery in 2026 and 2027. CMB.Tech launched the project in 2023 working with WinGD to develop a 72-bore ammonia-fueled engine. After nine months of work, they announced good progress as CSSC Qingdao-Beihai Shipbuilding and CSSC Engine Company joined the project.\nThe vessels which were being developed for CMB’s Bocimar and were anticipated to be the first large ammonia-fueled vessels in the commercial industry. Under the terms of the new agreement, CMB.Tech and MOL will jointly own the vessels. The Japanese company will charter the three vessels each for 12 years.\nThe companies are expanding ammonia-fueled installations reporting a new order with China Merchants Jinling Shipyard (Yangzhou) for a total of six chemical tankers. Two of the vessels will be ammonia-fitted on delivery and the other four will be built ammonia-ready. CMB.Tech will own the vessels, which are due for delivery in 2028 and 2029, and charter the two ammonia vessels to MOL Chemical Tankers for 10 years. The Japanese company will have 7-year charters on the ammonia-ready vessels.\nThe MOL Group reports it intends to adopt ammonia and integrate it into the corporate environmental vision initiative. MOL’s goal is to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\nWinGD has reported that it is making solid progress in the testing of its first ammonia-fueled engines. The company has said the first engines could be ready for delivery this year.\nWhile there is strong interest in ammonia due to its ability to eliminate carbon emissions, the shipping industry has been waiting for progress with the engines. DNV calculates that there are 31 vessels on order for delivery by 2027 that would be built for ammonia, but so far only three vessels have been retrofitted for ammonia operations. Australia’s Fortescue completed certification in Singapore for an offshore vessel while Japan’s NYK Group converted its LNG-fueled tugboat to operate with ammonia.\nAlexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.Tech has been a strong proponent of ammonia as one of the tools to decarbonize shipping. He noted with these orders, CMB.Tech has increased its contract backlog by $921 million to a total of $2.94 billion. He says it demonstrates the progress on their vision of fleet rejuvenation, decarbonization, and diversification.",

    "input": "\nOn Monday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative held its first hearings on a plan to charge the owners of Chinese ships an additional fee for every port call in the U.S., ranging up to $3.5 million for each instance. If enacted as described, the fee structure would increase shipping costs, critics say - and the list of concerns continues to grow.\nThe proposed fee structure is steep, and the USTR's notice contains several policy alternatives. Each U.S. port call for any vessel operated by Chinese interests will be subject to a fee of up to $1 million; each U.S. port call for each vessel built in China will be subject to a fee of up to another $1 million, depending on the proportion of Chinese-built ships in that operator's fleet; and operators with newbuilds on order in China will face additional fees of up to another $1 million per port call. To support the American merchant fleet, the proposal contains discounts for operators who also have U.S.-built tonnage, and it has minimum-volume  requirements that mandate the use of increasing amounts of U.S.-flagged and U.S.-built tonnage for American exporters.\nCritics of the plan have previously raised many concerns, including the forced shutdown of a few American-based shipping lines that use Chinese-built ships; the increased export costs for U.S. ag and energy commodities, which will make American exporters less competitive compared to foreign alternatives; a possible reduction in growth for U.S. oil and gas production; and a reordering of liner trades to favor a handful of calls in major U.S. ports, increasing congestion at the main gateways while reducing business for secondary seaports.\nTwo new issues emerged Monday. The CEO of NYK Line, the Japanese shipowner that co-owns carrier ONE, told Reuters that Japanese and Korean shipyards are not in a position to expand the production of non-Chinese ships until at least 2028. Since there are few other competitors on the global market for oceangoing merchant vessels, this would mean that expanding the orderbook for no-fee tonnage would be delayed for at least another three years - even though the USTR's proposal would take effect on a much shorter timeline.\nThe World Shipping Council (WSC), which represents ocean carriers, added another concern: the possibility of litigation. Since USTR has said that it is partly motivated by a desire to grow the U.S. shipbuilding industry, WSC suggested that the proposed port call fees might not be legal.\n\"Generating demand for domestic products and raising government revenue – whether to support a domestic industry or for other purposes – are not permissible bases for actions under Section 301,\" said WSC CEO Joe Kramek in a statement, referring to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974.\nAs a practical matter, Kramek noted that the U.S. shipbuilding sector is already backlogged with U.S. Navy production and maintenance needs, and that \"labor shortages constrain the ability of U.S. shipyards to take on additional orders.\"\n\"The Administration should work with Congress on a forward-looking strategy that is constructively designed to revitalize the U.S. maritime industry,\" Kramek said.",

The company plans to make significant investments in the terminal located in Elizabeth, New Jersey in support of the port’s long-term growth plan.\nAccording to the port, the lease extension which will be voted on by the Porth Authority’s board on March 27, takes a unique, nontraditional approach of incorporating performance, infrastructure, and sustainability requirements into the contract. The port says this will ensure steps are taken to enable the terminal to handle growing cargo volumes while prioritizing customer service and sustainability. The port has also recently reached similar long-term extensions with other terminal operators.\n“This lease extension secures transformative infrastructure and capacity enhancements at the second-largest container terminal in the East Coast’s busiest port,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “These commitments will enable the Port of New York and New Jersey to move more goods, create more jobs, and further cement its role as an essential driver of our region’s economy and our nation’s supply chain.”\nMaersk’s current lease was due to expire in December 2029. The extension extends the term through December 2062. APM Terminals highlights that the terminal currently handles over 25 percent of the annual container throughput in the port. The company has already been investing in the complex including four new gantry cranes which arrived in November 2024.\nAs part of the agreement, APM Terminals will invest over $500 million over the coming years to enhance cargo-handling capacity at its 350-acre terminal. APM Terminals has also committed to the replacement and maintenance of all wharf and berth structures. Additionally, the Port Authority and APM Terminals will expand the lease to include portions of an adjacent parcel of land to APM Terminals for enhanced productivity. APM Terminals has also committed to future capacity enhancements driven by demand.\nUnder the new agreement, APM Terminals will also invest in zero-emission cargo-handling equipment over the coming years. As a Port Authority lessee, the terminal operator is also subject to the Port Authority’s marine terminal tariff, which incentivizes the adoption of cleaner equipment as new technology becomes commercially available. It is in keeping with the Port Authority’s goal of reaching net zero agency-wide by 2050.\nAccording to the Port Authority, the investments covered under the new agreement are in keeping with its Port Master Plan 2050. The strategy anticipates cargo volumes doubling or tripling by mid-century.",

The operation is expected later this week.\nAfter hitting the tanker which started fires aboard both ships,Solongwas abandoned and her crew was brought to shore by an offshore service vessel working at a wind farm in the area. One crewmember, a resident of the Philippines, was lost with reports saying he had been working near the bow of the vessel when it hit the tanker. HM Coastguard led an unsuccessful search to locate the missing seafarer.\nAfter initially drifting in the North Sea, salvage teams were able to attach a tow line to hold the still-burning vessel. It took more than a week for the fires to be put out.\n“Salvage of theSolonghas progressed to enable its relocation to the Port of Aberdeen for safe berthing,” Chief Coastguard Paddy O’Callaghan announced today. “Tug and tow are scheduled to arrive at Aberdeen later this week,” the Coastguard announced\nThe plan calls forSolongto be towed by one of the salvage tugs and accompanied by another tug. In addition, a vessel with counter pollution measures will be accompanying the tow. HM Coastguard said the pollution measures would be available if needed during the tow.\nAt the same time, the local authorities report the cleanup is continuing along the coastline as nurdles (plastic beads) have washed up following the incident. The Coastguard has said that it is likely that the nurdles entered the water at the point of collision, but the vessel’s owners through a spokesperson said that it believes no containers holding nurdles were thought to have been lost over the side of the ship. It speculates that some of the plastic beads were released during the fires which ruptured some of the containers.\nThe situation for theStena Immaculateremains unchanged with the tanker still at anchor. U.S. ship operator Crowley reported salvage teams determined only one of the tanks holding jet fuel had been ruptured and fed the fire. The remainder of the jet fuel is stable aboard the tanker. No details have been announced for the salvage which is being conducted by Boskalis’ SMIT group.\nThe crews from the two vessels were repatriated to the United States and the Philippines. However, the master of theSolongremains in a UK jail having been arrested on a count of gross negligent manslaughter. It came out in the initial court hearing that he had been on the bridge of the containership standing watch when it hit the tanker. His next hearing is scheduled for April 14 and the judge has set a tentative trial date of January 12, 2026.\n",

It is the latest in a series of incidents as tensions remain high and Taiwan has vowed to increase its monitoring of Chinese vessels entering restricted areas.\nThe alert went out early on Sunday morning, March 23, that an unidentified vessel had entered a restricted zone on the northwest coast of Taiwan. It was approximately 20 nautical miles north of the Yong’an District, near Kaohsiung.\nThe Coast Guard reports when it reached the area it tracked the unidentified vessel traveling 3 miles inside the restricted zone and ignoring repeated hails. When the Coast Guard broadcast for the vessel to stop for inspection, it reports the vessel started taking a zig-zag course attempting to avoid an intercept.\n\n\n\nWhen they boarded the vessel they reported the ship had no name visible and that it had been obscured or possibly painted over. In addition, the vessel did not have documents and a registration. There were six crewmembers aboard and none of them also had identification documents.\nThe Coast Guard reports the vessel had approximately 500,000 liters of fuel aboard and pipe equipment. The speculation is that the vessel was being used to fuel Chinese fishing boats which Taiwan also says are operating illegally in its waters.\n\n\nNameless fuel barge without documentation detained by the Taiwan Coast Guard\n\nThe barge was directed into the port near Taipei for further investigation.\nSince the start of 2025, officials have said Taiwan’s defense forces and the Coast Guard were coordinating efforts to track shipping acting suspiciously. They have been targeting foreign-registered, Chinese-owned ships loitering off Taiwan as well as vessels entering restricted zones.\nTaiwan in January accused a Chinese-owned vessel of damaging an undersea cable and in February the Coast Guard reported catching a vessel dragging its anchor and damaging other cables. Ten days ago, Taiwan chased away a Chinese research vessel sailing in a restricted zone and putting instruments into the water.",

    "input": "\nSenior members of the Trump administration, including the secretary of defense, accidentally texted the Pentagon's future war plans for bombing strikes in Yemen to a journalist whom they had invited into a group chat. TheWhite House has confirmedthat the conversation was authentic, acknowledging that some of the most well-known names in the Trump administration leaked the positions and planned operations of U.S. Navy and Air Force servicemembers in Yemen to a reporter. In addition to the security implications of the leak itself, the use of an unauthorized commercial app for the highest levels of secret defense talks raises questions about operational security and the preservation of federal records: the app, Signal, is typically used on low-security commercial phones, and it was set to delete messages automatically after a predetermined period of time, thereby erasing any record of the conversation (if the reporter hadn't saved it).\nThe journalist who was inadvertently invited to the group chat - The Atlantic's managing editor, Jeffrey Goldberg - had the integrity not to publish the details of the war plans, since doing so could compromise the safety of American soldiers. He did, however, release screenshots and text of the group's deliberations the day before the strikes, including apparent skepticism by Vice President JD Vance about whether the U.S. should be involved in Yemen at all.\nIt started on March 13, when Goldberg received a Signal invite from Michael Waltz, Trump's national security advisor. He was invited to join a meeting called \"Houthi PC small group,\" inviting a list of extremely important personnel to join a \"principles group\" [sic] meeting about \"coordination on Houthis\" to follow up on discussions in the \"Sit Room.\" (A principals group is a gathering of executive branch leaders at the cabinet level.)\nIn the group chat, Signal users with the usernames MAR, JD Vance, TG, Scott B, Pete Hegseth and John Ratcliffe responded to the chat invite and nominated representatives to attend, all of whom were well-known aides to top officials. The White House has confirmed the authenticity of the texts, and from either context or verbatim language, the Signal usernames appear to correspond to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe (respectively). Other users present on the invite list were Susie Wiles, likely the White House Chief of Staff, and S M, likely senior Trump advisor Stephen Miller.\nJeffrey Goldberg's username was included in the group chat list as \"JG,\" bearing some accidental resemblance to \"JD,\" and no one questioned his presence. At this early stage, Goldberg suspected that the chat was fake, either a disinformation campaign or someone attempting to embarrass a media organization. \"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" he later wrote.\nThe meeting began at 0805 on March 14, all by Signal. The account \"JD Vance\" wrote in to say that he was busy that day in Michigan (he was) and added that he thought \"we are making a mistake\" by intervening in Yemen, since Europe is the primary beneficiary of Suez Canal trade. He suggested that the American public might not see the point of opening up the Red Sea to European navigation, except for the purpose of sending a message to foreign adversaries. \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this [Red Sea campaign] is with his message on Europe right now,\" the \"JD Vance\" account wrote. \"I just hate bailing Europeans out again.\"\nThe person with the \"Pete Hegseth\" account concurred with \"loathing for European free-loading,\" but voted for going ahead with strikes on the Houthis in order to reestablish deterrence, even if \"nobody knows who the Houthis are\" in America and the strikes might require certain political messaging to explain. The \"Michael Waltz\" account suggested that the costs of the strikes could be billed to Europe after the fact.\n\"S M\" concluded the conversation by saying that \"the president was clear: green light,\" though he emphasized that \"there needs to be some further economic gain extracted [from Europe and Egypt] in return.\"\nAt 1144 hours on March 15, Goldberg received a \"team update\" from the account labeled \"Pete Hegseth.\" It contained the secret operational details for imminent airstrikes on Yemen, including \"targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" with the first strikes scheduled to hit at 1345 hours. Since the details could be used to harm American personnel if they were indeed authentic, Goldberg did not publish them. However, he was quickly convinced that they were real: at 1355, right on time for the \"team update\" schedule, the first strikes were reported in Sanaa, Yemen.\nGoldberg then followed up with Waltz, Gabbard, Ratcliffe and Hegseth by email and Signal, asking if the thread was genuine. A spokesman for the National Security Council responded later that day, confirming that \"this appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.\"\nU.S. intelligence agencies and cybersecurity experts have warned for years that Signal can be hacked or bypassed, including with commercially-availablespyware. The app is a knowntargetfor Russia's GRU intelligence agency.\nA former defense official told CNN that in order to copy the detailed Yemen war plans from a classified platform into the Signal chat, the details would have had to be re-entered manually. A simple \"copy and paste\" is not possible with the Pentagon's secure communications systems. \"You would either have to print it out or type it up while looking at both screens. So he had to have done it or somebody would’ve had to have done it for him that way,\" the official said.",

    "input": "Two of Japan’s leading shipbuilders, Onomichi Dockyard and Tsuneishi Shipbuilding, have taken the unusual step of partnering to develop designs for a new dry bulk carrier. The project sought to leverage the experience and expertise of each yard to advance the design concepts for a vessel they are calling Bingo 42 (Beyond Innovation, Navigating Green Ocean).\nThe shipyards highlight that traditionally each yard undertakes all stages of design from basic design to production. They note it creates a substantial design workload which they expect will be further increased in the future as yards seek to develop and deliver alternative fuel vessels.\nBoth companies produce handy size bulkers. The Bingo 42 project sought to leverage shared experience, development ideas, and strategies based on each yard’s previous work. They focused on a 42,000 dwt dry bulk carrier. The goal was to enhance the productivity of the design process and to potentially increase market share through orders and construction under the same brand. The structural design, construction, and sales will be carried out independently by each company.\nOne of the key focuses of the project was to enhance each other’s conventional hull forms. Working together, the designers lengthened the conventional hull by 3 meters (nearly 10 feet). By optimizing the hull form they were able to improve cargo capacity and fuel efficiency with the design being incorporated into Onomichi and Tsuneishi’s standard dry bulk carrier designs.\nThe design also incorporates the MT-Fast energy-saving device first developed by MTI and NYK Group. It improves propulsion efficiency by up to four percent by regulating water flow through the installation of multiple fins in front of the propeller. It is designed to be a methanol0dual fueled vessel/\nThe companies report that Bingo 42 design has achieved a reduction of more than 35 percent from their reference line under the EEDI index established by the IMO.",

The Saudi-hosted conversation in Riyadh lasted 12 hours, and the details of the results should be released tomorrow in a joint statement. Diplomats from most Black Sea nations were not present, but Ukrainian representatives gave their input to the U.S. delegation on Sunday and were on hand nearby for consultation on Monday.\nThe outlines of a ceasefire deal have begun to emerge, though so far it appears that most hostilities will be allowed to continue on shore, where Russia is making steady gains on the front line. On the ground, the ceasefire solely covers attacks on \"energy infrastructure,\" leaving ports and railways unprotected despite a Ukrainian proposal to include them. The details of the Black Sea ceasefire will likely be known Tuesday. Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy to Russia and Ukraine, spoke optimistically about the talks and told reporters there were signs of \"real progress.\"\nBulgarian and Romanian diplomats have expressed unease, according to the FT, as any deal is likely to provide a new military advantage to Russia after a year of comparatively peaceful navigation in the western Black Sea. Recent Russian attacks on Odesa have killed as many seafarers as the last year of Houthi violence in the Red Sea, but merchant vessels have recently enjoyed unhindered access to the ports of NATO's member states in the region (Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania). This was not always so: until Ukraine's missiles and suicide drone boats drove the Russian Navy out of the western Black Sea, mines and missile attacks were a near-constant threat.\nIn three years, Ukraine has yet to attack a foreign merchant ship in the Black Sea, though it has struck several civilian-crewed, Russian-flagged vessels used for military logistics. It has focused instead on the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and so far it has damaged, disabled or sunk about one third of the Russian Navy's warships in the region, including the fleet flagship Moskva and the Kilo-class attack sub Rostov-on-Don. The remainder of the fleet has been withdrawn to the relative safety of Novorossiysk and the northeastern Black Sea - but it could roam westward again if a temporary ceasefire were reached.",

Together with deliveries of 20 new ships to customers, it was enough to return Fincantieri to the black a year ahead of expection, ending a difficult run after the challenging years of the pandemic era took a toll on cruise orderbooks.\nFincantieri saw EBITDA margin increase markedly to six percent, and it earned a small profit of about $30 million on revenue of about $9 billion. Order intake doubled compared to 2023, thanks in part to a mega-order from Norwegian Cruise Lines for half a dozen cruise ships, and Fincantieri's total backlog now amounts to about $33 billion. Leverage is down faster than expected, and Fincantieri now has a long runway, with 98 ships on its orderbooks through 2036.\n\"In a geopolitical context characterized by significant discontinuities, we maintained our full focus on execution and commercial development,\" said CEO and General Manager Pierroberto Folgiero. \"We look to the future with entrepreneurial courage, confident that this solidity will enable us to accelerate in addressing the international challenges of the naval industry, both civil and military.\"\nFincantieri-owned Vard, the Norwegian offshore specialist shipbuilder, contributed to the results as well.

Brent Sadler (USN) has been nominated to run the U.S. Maritime Administration, the unit of the Department of Transportation responsible for the Ready Reserve, the Maritime Security Program, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and several other maritime-related programs. MARAD has been without a nominated leader since former administrator Adm. Ann Phillips' resignation in mid-January.\nCapt. Sadler is a Navy veteran with 26 years of experience, and currently works as a researcher with the conservative Heritage Foundation. He is an engineer by training and a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, with multiple Indo-Pacific submarine tours on his resume. As a policy leader at Indo-Pacific Command, he helped pass a program for maritime security training for Southeast Asian partners in FY2016, and helped direct $12 billion in defense funding to the Asia-Pacific under the \"rebalance\" initiative in 2013-15.\nWhen confirmed, he will help lead the drafting of new legislation to create a \"strategic commercial fleet\" focused on ensuring \"adequate cubed footage,\" according to a White House draft executive order obtained by USNI. This unit of measurement applies to ro/ro capacity, the most frequently-discussed element of the U.S. strategic sealift fleet.\nWhen confirmed, Sadler will have wide latitude to remake MARAD or reduce its size, an administration priority across government. High staff turnover and high retirement eligibility have left MARAD with more than 100 vacant positions (as of last September). In the fall, the agency had openings for 12 percent of all authorized positions, according to GAO - long before the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) offered all federal employees a voluntary buyout. MARAD officials told GAO last year that the staff shortages made it hard to accomplish missions, and that the problem was worsening.",

Only an estimated 50 individuals remain, and conservationists believe that without protection, it could become the first whale species ever to go extinct due to human activity - possibly even before the North Atlanticright whale.\n\"[Rice's whales] are on the brink of extinction and the few dozen left alive desperately need more protections from speeding vessels and other offshore oil drilling activity, not less,\" said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Centre for Biological Diversity.\nThe Rice's whale is a relative of the Bryde's whale, and was first identified as a separate species in 2021. In 2022, more than 100 marine scientists called for \"excluding leasing and other [oil and gas] activities from the whale's habitat.\"\nIn response, BOEM removed lease blocks in Rice's whale habitat areas from a federal lease auction, and it asked offshore oil and gas operators to incorporate whale-protection measures when transiting specific water depths, including all areas between the 100-400 meter depth contours - the areas where the whale is known to feed. Theseprotective measuresincluded a halt to nighttime OSV navigation and a 10-knot speed limit across the depth contour band.\nPushback from oil majors came swiftly, and a federal judge prohibited BOEM from incorporating the restrictions into the requirements of a 2023 lease auction. On February 20, 2025, BOEM rescinded the guidance altogether, citing the Interior Department's new guidance for \"Unleashing American Energy.\"\nIn a letter to BOEM this week, the NGOs Friends of the Earth, Centre for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club, and the Turtle Island Restoration Network said that they plan to sue to restore the recommendations. BOEM's guidance on Rice's whale protection never became mandatory, but the nonprofits want the agency to make it official policy once more.\n\"It cannot be overstated: Trump is dealing a death blow to the critically endangered Rice’s whale in the name of Big Oil handouts,\" said Hallie Templeton, legal director for Friends of the Earth.",

The announcement was seen as a vote of confidence for the sector and comes as Germany is embroiled in a political debate about its offshore wind policy.\nThe final investment decision for the Nordlicht 1 and 2 offshore wind farms signals that construction will begin on the first phase in 2026 with a capacity of 980 MW. The wind farm will be located approximately 53 miles north of Borkum in the German North Sea. The final investment decision for the second phase was made on a conditional basis pending the receipt of permits.\nAs part of the decision, Vattenfall has also agreed to re-acquire 49 percent ownership in the project from German chemical company BASF. It acquired the portion of the project in April 2024 but says it has decided to streamline its current portfolio of renewable power projects. BASF however secured an agreement for long-term supply of renewable electricity from the project.\n“The Nordlicht offshore wind cluster makes a significant milestone in the path to enabling fossil freedom,” said Helene Biström, Head of Business Area Wind at Vattenfall. “By accelerating Germany’s energy transition and supporting industrial decarbonization, it will provide clean, reliable energy while driving innovation and sustainability in the sector.”\nVattenfall also said it would use low-emission steel for the wind turbine towers at both wind farms to lower their carbon footprint by 16 percent. When completed the full project will produce more than 1.6 GW with the first phase expected to be operational in 2028.\nLast week, however, RWE’s CEO Markus Krebber called for Germany to lower its total target for offshore wind due to concerns about efficiency and rising grid connection costs. He expressed concerns about crowding and its impact on maximizing wind yields.\nGermany currently has approximately 9 MW installed but the government mapped out an ambitious plan to grow to 70GW by 2045 to ensure its economy achieves climate neutrality. Krebber called for a more realistic target of just over 50 GW but others in the industry quickly rejected his suggestions. It comes as Germany is looking to reinvigorate offshore development and drive the growth of the sector after years of slow growth.",

In its prototype configuration, it is powered by two outboard motors, an unusual but economical choice for a military vessel. It displaces about five tonnes with weapons loadout and fuel, and it can make more than 35 knots, according to manufacturer CSBC. Its small size and light weight make it possible to launch from small ports or even unimproved beaches, making deployments harder to interdict.\nUkraine's drone boats are smaller monohull designs with inboard propulsion. Initially they were one-way attack drones only, designed to deliver an explosive warhead directly to the hull of a target ship and detonate by ramming. They have gradually evolved to include reusable variants that carry FPV drone aircraft and antiaircraft missiles, among other payloads.\nThe Taiwanese design is expected to carry and use lightweight torpedoes, allowing it to make more than one attack run in a surface warfare role. It is equipped for ramming and detonation as well.\nIn initial configuration, the Manta has a cockpit for a human crewmember; it is unknown whether this would be removed for the final version. According to CSBC, it is capable of autonomous navigation, and will be able to return to port on its own if its command-and-control connectivity is interrupted.\nThe prototype aligns with U.S. war planning for a Taiwan Strait conflict: U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. Sam Paparo has called for building the technology for a \"hellscape\" of unmanned systems in the strait, which could fend off a Chinese invasion force long enough for a conventional response.",

The contours of the agreement largely align withpast Russian demands, and Ukrainian leaders said that they would watch Moscow's compliance closely in the days to come.\nAccording to the Kremlin, the agreementmustallow state-owned Russian Agricultural Bank (Rosselkhozbank) to relink to the international SWIFT bank messaging system, a key demand of Russian negotiators since at least 2023. The bank is under EU, UK and U.S. sanctions, and the agreement would require participation from European regulators to reconnect it to SWIFT.\nThe U.S. has agreed to help Russia restore its \"access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports,\" according to aWhite House readout, including ports, \"payment systems,\" and reduced maritime insurance costs. The White House did not describe any clear benefits for Ukraine.\nAfter the announcement, Ukraine's defense minister said that the success of the deal requires Russia to keep its military vessels in the eastern half of the Black Sea, continuing the status quo. Ukraine's military has damaged, destroyed or sunk about one third of the Russian Black Sea Fleet using missiles and drones, and as a practical matter, Russia's surviving warships have been largely confined to the safety of the eastern half the sea since last year. If the Russian Navy uses the ceasefire to transit near Ukraine's shores again, Ukraine will have \"full right to exercise right to self-defense,\" said Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov.\nThe three sides are still working out the details of the deal, along with a parallel agreement to stop attacks on \"energy infrastructure.\" Russia has had considerable success in destroying Ukraine's electrical grid with drones and missiles; for its part, Ukraine has been makingstridesin long-range suicide drone technology, and has been targeting oil refineries and pipelines deep within Russian territory. In talks with the White House last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin secured a U.S. agreement for an energy infrastructure ceasefire, which would allow Russia's refining industry time to recover from thedamage.\nLong-range sea drone and aerial drone attacks have been Ukraine's primary areas of success in the conflict over the past year, and these operations would cease under the twin agreements. Russia has gained a strong upper hand in front-line ground combat, which was not addressed in the talks and will continue as before. Even though the deal favors Russia's comparative military strengths, Ukrainian leaders expressed little certainty that the Kremlin would adhere to the terms.\n\"The behavior of the Russian Federation in the coming days will show a lot, if not everything,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \"If there are air alarms again, if there is military activity in the Black Sea again, if there are Russian manipulations and threats again, then we will have to take new measures - specifically against Moscow.\"\nThe details remain under discussion, and a full-spectrum pause in the fighting appears unlikely in the near term. Russian diplomats told The Moscow Times this week that the Kremlin's negotiators have been instructed tostall for timein meetings with the U.S. side so that Russian troops can continue to take more Ukrainian territory. \"These guys know the Ukraine talks inside and out. They’ve been tasked with nitpicking every comma,\" one source told Moscow Times. In an interview Tuesday, President Trump acknowledged the possibility that Russian negotiators could be \"dragging their feet,\" and noted that he had used stalling tactics himself earlier in his business career.\n\"Things are unfolding more according to Russia’s scenario. Whether this [Black Sea limited ceasefire] will happen is still unclear,” Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent pro-Russian journal editor, told Moscow Times. \"But even if it’s implemented, it won’t directly change the situation on the battlefield, where the initiative currently belongs to Russia.\"",

The vessel was theBITU River, a Panama-flagged bitumen tanker operated by Rubis Asphalt, a company that sources bitumen at the refinery and distributes it across West and Central Africa. At the time, no details were released on the status of the crew.\nFamily members speaking to Indian newspapers revealed the attack took place around 1930 on March 17 while the tanker was approximately 40 nautical miles southeast of Santo Antonio do Príncipe, on the island of Príncipe in the island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe off the west coast of Central Africa. The 15,500 dwt vessel had departed the anchorage at Lomé, Togo, and was proceeding to Douala in Cameroon.\nThe crew retreated into the vessel’s citadel and others hid in the engine room with family members saying they had lost contact with the crew at around 2330. The crew reportedly surrendered when the pirates forcefully breached the citadel and broke into the engine room. Earlier it was said the pirates were armed and there were reports of gunfire when they boarded the vessel.\nA total of 10 crewmembers were kidnapped from the vessel, including seven from India and three from Romania. The remaining crew were threatened with violence and confined to a cabin on the tanker. Before leaving the vessel, the pirates also stole personal belongings from the crew including gold, phones, and a laptop.\nThe families said the company informed them of the kidnappings the following day while assuring them the crewmembers were unharmed. The families are appealing to the Indian government citing the need for swift diplomatic efforts. The authorities have not commented further on the situation.\nMDAT-GoG said the company’s safety officer had advised that after the pirates left the vessel, it was proceeding to Libreville in Gabon for refuge.

To maximize their ability to dock in ports around the world the company highlights a range of environmental technologies that were incorporated into the design. In addition to the methanol-fueled propulsion system, the vessel is equipped for shore power and has a ballast water treatment system.\nHMM reports the new vessel will bunker with bio-methanol at the port of Shanghai. The bio-methanol is derived from waste resources. The company reports it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 65 percent, eliminate sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions, and cut nitrogen oxide (Nox) emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional bunker fuel.\nThe new vessel will be deployed on HMM’s independently operated route between Far East Asia, India, and the Mediterranean. It is part of a drive by the company which expects to reach the 1 million TEU capacity mark later this year.

    "input": "The UK’s Maritime Minister, Mike Kane, outlined a new detailed plan for the next stages of the efforts toward maritime decarbonization. While the policy presented to the House of Commons in Parliament builds off the efforts of the International Maritime Organization, it also launches a focus on smaller vessels and targeted subsectors which it says must also participate to reach the goals.\nThe policy highlights that the UK domestic maritime sector produced around eight million tonnes of CO2 equivalents, on a full lifecycle basis, in 2019. The government has already launched a sweeping Plan for Change and now it looks to bring more parts of the maritime sector in line with the broader policies. Following the IMO’s lead, the UK is setting its goal for the domestic maritime sector aiming for zero fuel lifecycle GHG emissions by 2050. The interim steps are at least a 30 percent reduction by 2030 and an 80 percent reduction by 2040, relative to 2008 levels.\nThe elements of the strategy call for expanding the UK’s Emission Trading Scheme to include domestic UK maritime GHG emissions starting in 2026. At the same time, the UK says it will advocate at the IMO for the introduction in 2027 of global emission pricing. As part of this, the government says subject to further consultation next year, it will introduce domestic fuel regulations to drive the update of zero and net-zero GHG emission fuels and energy sources. It will also consider further actions at the port vessel to reduce at berth emissions.\nThe UK also looks to expand its policies to smaller vessels, i.e. sub-400 gross tons. It points out that it will be difficult for some sectors such as fishing vessels while others such as offshore wind support vessels could lead the sector. The government is issuing a call for evidence to begin this policy development.\nThe government will also launch a further exploration of the efforts at the port level. It will look at whether ports are planning decarbonization and the strategies for wider environmental considerations.\nWhile recognizing that the efforts will be challenging for the sector, the government also cites opportunities for investment and creating new economic opportunities. They note that conservative estimates show that decarbonization of the UK maritime sector could support £130 to £180 million (US$168 to $233 million) of gross value added and around 1,400 to 2,100 jobs in the UK on average each year to 2050.\nThe UK Chamber of Shipping hailed the release of the new strategy saying it welcomed the Government’s publication of the Maritime Decarbonization Strategy, as a much-needed successor to the 2019 Clean Maritime Plan.\n“The Government’s strategy must now be matched by delivering the regulatory framework, technology and infrastructure, including a shore power revolution, required to support the green transition for UK maritime, bringing benefits to maritime communities and the UK economy,” said UK Chamber CEO Rhett Hatcher.  “We look forward to working collaboratively alongside government to progress this important agenda and reach our shared goals of a cleaner, more resilient maritime sector in the UK.”",

Previous research in the Baltic has documented that some observed jamming capabilities exceed commercial grade equipment, and can fool ship GNSS receivers into delivering inaccurate position readings - inaccurate enough to cause a casualty if the false reading went undetected by the crew. At least one accident, thegroundingof theMeghna Princessin the Baltic last year, has been attributed to GPS jamming.\n\"The safety of seafarers and shipping relies on the resilience of systems to support safe navigation and communication. Interference with Global Navigation Satellite Systems poses a serious risk to shipping activities, which could cause collisions and grounding. I urge all Member States to act to protect these critical systems,\" said IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez.\nIMO Maritime Safety Committee has previously urged member states to \"minimize interference coming from their territory,\" or at least issue warning notices to shipping about any planned time periods and areas affected by \"known interferences.\"\nSatellite signal jamming also affects airborne navigation, often at different times and locations than surface-level GNSS jamming, indicating different settings, techniques or equipment for high-altitude effects.\nSome of the most effective sources of intentional interference may be space-based, according to Professor Todd Humphreys of the University of Texas. Chinese and Russian satellite-based electronic warfare systems may be able to imitate GPS and Galileo from orbit, creating disruption by sending false signals when desired, he said at apanellast year.",

    "input": "The New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) has executed three maritime infrastructure-related contracts valued at $18 million as part of the plan to upgrade port operations at the Brooklyn Marine Terminal. It is part of a larger vision for the “Harbor of the Future” announced in 2024 that calls for increasing capacity in the Port of New York and creating a new “blue highway” for freight and commerce in the city.\nNYCEDC reports it is committed to redeveloping the terminal and container port. As a first step, it signed contracts for the removal of four out-of-service cranes across Piers 9A and 10, and the purchase of a new electric Ship-to-Shore (STS) crane to serve the Red Hook Container Terminal at Pier 10. Additionally, Pier 10 will receive crucial fender repairs to protect the pier from future vessel damage.\n“After decades of disinvestment and inaction, now the real work begins with an initial $18 million investment bringing this maritime port into the 21st century,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams. “This is a significant step forward for this 122-acre site and represents early signs of what’s to come as we reimagine the Brooklyn Marine Terminal to its full potential.”\nIn May 2024, the mayor along with New York Governor Kathy Hochulmapped the future visionincluding an initial $95 million investment by the state and city. NYCEDC now is spending an initial $18 million. This includes $15 million for a new electric STS crane, $2 million for fender repairs to Pier 10, and $1 million for the demolition and removal of four out-of-service cranes.\nDemolition and removal of the four out-of-service cranes will take place from April to August 2025 by Atlantic Coast Dismantling (ACD). The two cranes on Pier 9A are diesel-operated, over 50 years old, and are inaccessible due to the unstable condition of Pier 9A. The two cranes on Pier 10 that will be removed were damaged during superstorm Sandy, a near hurricane-force storm that hit the area in October 2012. The removal of these cranes will provide space for a new electric crane and the 3,000 tons of steel from the four removed cranes will be recycled by ACD.\nLiebherr USA has been contracted to deliver the new all-electric ship-to-shore crane to serve the Red Hook Container Terminal at Pier 10. The crane will be designed, manufactured, and delivered from Irish-based Liebherr Container Cranes, taking approximately two years, making the new crane operational in Spring 2027. Pier 10 is also receiving a fender, fender pile, and chock and wale repairs and replacement to ensure the longevity of Pier 10 and protect the physical integrity of the pier from berthing ships and barges, repairs are anticipated to go from May to September 2025.\n“After decades of decay and disinvestment at the Brooklyn Marine Terminal, these contracts are a small but meaningful step toward delivering a modern, all-electric, maritime port that activates our Blue Highway network and advances New York City's Harbor of the Future,” said NYCEDC President & CEO Andrew Kimball.\nNYCEDC reports that over the past eight months, it has regularly engaged with the task force, advisory groups, and the community to build a shared vision for this site.\n“In the last nine months, NYCEDC has done more for this port than has been done for the last several decades,” said Red Hook Container Terminal President Mike Stamatis.\nIn the coming weeks, the Brooklyn Marine Terminal Task Force will vote on a Vision Plan outlining the future of the site, which will include reinvestment for a modernized maritime port and a vibrant mixed-use community to serve Red Hook and Columbia Street Waterfront District.",

The Navy Fleet Command issued a statement saying that no one was injured but it is the latest incident as Taiwan remains on high alert to Chinese incursions.\nThe Navy confirmed that one of its Chung Ho class tank landing ships (8,800 displacement tons) had made contact with the Chinese vesselMinlianyu 61756. It happened in a position 45 nautical miles away from Taichung on the northwestern shore of Taiwan. The statement said the vessels were nine nautical miles outside “restricted waters.”\nThe Coast Guard was immediately dispatched to investigate the situation and collect evidence. The Navy reports that the damaged part of the ship did not affect navigation safety.\nThe vessel which the Navy referred to as a Zhonghe-class tank landing ship is mainly responsible for carrying, transporting, and unloading Marine personnel, equipment, supplies and supporting amphibious assault missions. It is 561 feet (171 meters) in length with a reported top speed of 20 knots. They are armed with a 40mm gun and a Phalanx rapid-fire gun. The Navy did not say what the vessel was doing when it hit the fishing trawler.\nChinese fishing boats have frequently encroached on areas Taiwan said are sovereign and restricted. Speculation in the media raised the question of whether the fishing boat was being used to spy on the Navy’s vessels and their movements.\nA spokesperson from the PRC Defense Ministry said they needed further understanding of the incident to address questions. She however also dismissed the “malicious speculation” over the incident. A spokesperson from China’s state council condemned the “vile behavior” of Taiwan while saying they were investigating the incident.\nTaiwan reported at the beginning of the year it was increasing its efforts to track suspect vessels that were loitering off Taiwan as well as Chinese-owned foreign-registered vessels. There have been a few incidents in the area in recent years involving fishing boats.\nThis year Taiwan however has accused smaller Chinese-owned cargo ships of damaging undersea cables. Earlier this month Taiwan also chased away a Chinese research vessel which was seen deploying instruments in a restricted area of the sea. Earlier this week Taiwan detained a Chinese fuel barge it referred to as a “three nos” meaning it did not have a name, home port, or registration documentation. The Navy has said it is using its systems to identify and track vessels and would work with the Coast Guard to stop and search suspect vessels.\n",

    "input": "\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has determined the cause of an STS crane allision at North Charleston Terminal last year. A towboat mate failed to consider the horizontal extent of the STS crane when he made passing arrangements with a dredge in the channel, and his chosen course put his tow - a tall crane barge - in contact with the STS crane's lowered boom.\nOn the afternoon of January 4, 2024, the towboatRoyal Engineerand the crane bargeStevens 1471got under way from a terminal on the Cooper River for a berth at the Pierside Docks, a short three-hour trip downriver on the other side of the North Charleston Terminal. The crane was lowered, but its upper mast extended about 145 feet above deck level.\nAsRoyal Engineerapproached North Charleston Terminal, its passage was blocked by the dredgerBrunswick, which was working on dredging out the bottom just a few hundred feet off the terminal's pier. The dredge's floating discharge pipeline extended all the way across to the opposite side of the river, and was temporarily blocking all of the navigation channel. The only options for safe passage were to ask the dredge crew to stop work and move their floating pipeline so that traffic could get by, or to go through a narrow slot between the dredger and the pier, where the terminal's cranes were working cargo.\nRoyal Engineer'smate had the watch, and he contactedBrunswickabout an hour out to make timely passing arrangements. He planned to ask the dredger crew to move their pipeline and wanted to give them enough advance notice. TheBrunswickdid not respond to two calls.\nAt 1605,Royal EngineerapproachedBrunswick'swork area. A large boxship was moored at the terminal and an STS crane boom was lowered to move containers. The boom extended about 200 feet out over the channel, 100 feet beyond the beam of the boxship.\nAt this point,Royal Engineer'smate was able to reachBrunswick'scaptain over VHF, and he asked him to move the pipeline. The dredger's captain declined because his crew was busy and he already had his crew on a task and would \"have to stop them to go do something else.\" Instead, he suggested thatRoyal Engineercould safely go through the 300-foot slot betweenBrunswickand the pier, and he offered to turn the dredger to make this possible.\nRoyal Engineer'smate accepted this arrangement. Considering the narrowness of the gap, he posted a deckhand to watch for obstructions. He did not consider the barge's air draft and the STS crane's reach out into the channel until he began to passBrunswick. The deckhand thought it would clear, but he was mistaken. The mate reversed engines too late to avoid contact.\nThe STS crane operator was in his control booth aloft and was in harm's way. He saw the hazard coming and sounded his warning horn moments before impact, then braced himself. Immediately after, he fled the operator's cabin and ran down a ladderway to the pier.\nThe STS crane stayed upright, and even had enough strength to stopRoyal Engineer/Stevens 1471'sforward momentum.Royal Engineer'smate reversed away from the crane; theBrunswickdisconnected its dredge line and left the area in case the STS crane were to collapse; and the boxship got under way, headed away from the terminal.\nThe STS crane was badly damaged, and was determined to be structurally unstable. Torqued like a screw by impact at the far end of its boom, the STS crane's vertical frame was twisted, the gantry assemblies were \"wrecked,\" and the base was rotated off its rails. Remarkably, it was repairable, and it was restored within a year and put back into service. The overall cost of the repair came to just $4.5 million, and was the only significant charge; the crane onStevens 1471was virtually undamaged.\nNTSB concluded that the root cause was the towboat mate's failure to identify the STS crane as an overhead hazard.\n\"Ship-to-shore cranes, when conducting cargo operations on a vessel and in the lowered position, may extend considerably beyond the side of the vessel and become a hazard to vessels with high air drafts transiting nearby. Mariners should always consider their vessel and tow’s air draft when identifying hazards to navigation,\" NTSB advised.",

Hurtigruten wants to design a ship that can sail without emissions in normal operation on the Norwegian coast from around 2030.\nThe project reports it completed a new phase of rigorous testing using digital simulations and physical trials in Trondheim, at the Norwegian research institute SINTEF Ocean’s facilities. In addition, Vard Design, DNV, Brunvoll, Plug, Corvus Enegery, and others are also participating in the project. Involving the partners, the recent testing worked to evaluate large battery packs, retractable sails, air lubrication systems, contra-rotating propellers, and an energy-optimized hull.\n“We are learning a lot from these tests, and we now see that many of the ambitious goals in this project can also be implemented in practice,” said Gerry Larsson-Fedde, Chief Operating Officer at Hurtigruten.\nFollowing months of design work and testing, they report theship designhas been further refined. The ship is now eight meters longer (143.5 meters/471 feet total) and slightly wider than earlier versions of the concept. The height has also been reduced by one deck to among other things provide better stability. The design has been reduced from three to two retractable solar sails.\n\n\nModel testing is helping to refine the design (Hurtigruten)\n\nThe Sea Zero concept aims to cut energy between 40-50 percent compared to today’s ships. The companies report that the sails alone could reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent. With that reduction, they report that batteries charged with shore power connectivity in key ports could make emission-free operations possible.\"With the reduction in energy use we’re aiming for, it’s realistic to fit a battery system with enough energy to allow the ship to sail between charging ports under normal weather conditions,\" said Trond Johnsen, Project Manager for Sea Zero.\nCommitted to setting a higher standard for more sustainable travel initiatives, Hurtigruten highlights that its fleet currently includes four battery-hybrid powered ships, while it also prioritizes energy efficiency and responsible waste management. Through the ambitious Sea Zero project, Hurtigruten aims to develop its first ship that can sail emissions-free in normal operations on the Norwegian coast and in response to Norway’s tightening regulations for shipping emissions.\nNorway’s Parliament last yearfinalized rulessetting a phased-in schedule to move coastal shipping and vessels operating in the fjords to zero emissions. Cruise ships and ferries under 10,000 gross tons will have to operate with zero emissions by January 1, 2026. For the large ships, the implementation is scheduled for January 1, 2032.",

    "input": "\nWhile it is only a little more than a month since the new alliances began to integrate into the operations of container shipping, the first results show the new organization has the potential to dramatically reshape the competition among carriers. Overall, the sector has struggled to claw back its schedule reliability after the surge in volumes and port congestion during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but according to new data from Sea-Intelligence, the new alliances have the potential to dramatically reshape the industry.\nMaersk and Hapag-Lloyd detailed a new model for their primary routes which will be operating in the new Gemini Cooperation. They highlighted a new approach wither fewer ports for the larger vessels being fed by more regional operations saying that the goal was to achieve at least 90 percent schedule reliability. Gemini has expressed confidence that as it rolls out and demonstrates the success of its strategy shippers will be willing to pay higher costs for the certainty that they can offer.\nFor all of 2024, the sector struggled to break out of a range in the low to mid-50 percent schedule reliability. Sea-Intelligence calculates the industry overall across 34 different trade lanes averaging just 53 percent schedule reliability. This was down nine percentage points from 2023 or 15 percent.\nThe report highlights that 2025 was following the same overall pattern. The average for the more than 60 carriers operating in the sector remained at 53 percent for the first two months of the year.\nGemini began its rollout on February 1 and the new Premier Alliance also began its rollout, while the former 2M between Maersk and MSC is winding down and the former The Alliance was reformulated with the departure of Hapag-Lloyd. In addition, MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, after amassing a strong lead in the number of vessels and capacity is mostly going it alone.\nSea-Intelligence calculates for February the Gemini Cooperation recorded 94.0 percent schedule reliability in origin ports in February 2025 for its first voyages, followed by MSC at 79.6 percent, and Premier Alliance at 60.4 percent. Ocean Alliance recorded 54.1 percent schedule reliability, while the outgoing THE Alliance scored 45.3 percent, and 2M achieved 44.2 percent.\n“It is important to stress that the new alliances are just in the beginning phase of their network roll-out, and they will only be fully rolled out in July 2025, and only then will it be possible to truly evaluate their performance. It is nevertheless an interesting data point, to see how they have performed on the initial origin arrivals,” said Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence.\nThe traditional February data further highlighted how the alliances are poised to reshape the sector. While global schedule reliability improved by 3.6 percentage points month over month, it was at only 54.9 percent for the sector. Murphy notes that it was the highest level recorded since May 2024 and that on a year-over-year basis, February 2025 was higher by 1.8 percentage points.\nOn a standalone basis for all its services, Maersk was the most reliable of the top-13 carriers in February 2025. It achieved a schedule reliability of 60.2 percent. MSC followed at 57.4 percent and Hapag-Lloyd at 57.3 percent.\nMaersk and Hapag-Lloyd in their financial reports highlighted forecasts for a down year in 2025 after strong results in 2024. Schedule reliability is poised to become an important selling tool for the alliances as they seek new competitive advances in what promises to be a challenging year.",

    "input": "\nAmerica's offshore vessel operators are pleased with the White House's proposal for steep fees on Chinese ships, and they would like the administration to go one step further - with a daily tax on Chinese-built vessels operating in U.S. waters.\nDespite the protections of the Jones Act for American shipping, the offshore vessel services industry is still exposed to low-cost foreign competition for certain tasks. Depending on the specifics of the work, a foreign offshore service vessel may not be covered by the Jones Act in U.S. waters. Crane ships, offshore wind turbine installation vessels, survey ships and other specialty service vessels can often compete for work on the U.S. continental shelf, so long as they do not move cargo between U.S. points. The definitions of \"move,\" \"cargo\" and \"U.S. points\" are often disputed, but foreign operators still regularly win charters for work in U.S. waters.\nLast month, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) announced a plan to impose steep multimillion-dollar charges on Chinese-owned and Chinese-built vessels for calls at American seaports - but the fees are only assessed once per visit, and only in port. Under USTR's fee structure, a Chinese-made offshore vessel could still work in U.S. waters without paying anything, so long as it avoided American port calls.\nTo offset the cost advantages of these foreign-built, foreign-crewed vessels, the Offshore Marine Services Association (OMSA) has asked USTR to include offshore work in its proposed schedule of fees for Chinese-built vessels.\n\"OMSA respectfully requests that the proposed actions be amended so that the service fees accrue on a daily basis for Chinese-built vessels working in U.S. sovereign waters on U.S. offshore energy projects. This clarification to the USTR proposed remedies will adequately ensure that the actions fully account for the harm that is being promulgated by Chinese-built vessels to U.S. shipyards, vessel owners, mariners, and other workers that engage or attempt to engage in U.S. offshore energy projects,\" said OMSA President and CEO Aaron Smith.\nSmith suggested that Chinese-built offshore vessels could easily be assessed a daily fee based on AIS data records showing their time in U.S. waters, or on their Coast Guard notice of arrival and departure paperwork. This would affect at least 10 foreign ships that have worked in the U.S. offshore wind industry, representing some the largest and most important foreign-flag competitors that U.S. service providers face in the sector.\n\"These vessels are coming into U.S. waters and staying—sometimes for years at a time—all the while taking opportunities from U.S. ships and shipyards,\" testified Smith.\nHe singled out one particular vessel as an example: Cadeler's brand new WTIV Wind Pace. The 20 MW-capable vessel formally delivered on Wednesday at COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry in Qidong, and will soon get under way for its maiden voyage to the U.S. East Coast. Wind Pace is a cutting-edge ship and is expected to outcompete previous generations of WTIVs on capacity, transit speed and efficiency, according to Cadeler. On arrival in U.S. waters, it will begin a long-term installation contract worth about $70-80 million - revenue that U.S. shipowners will not get.\nThe low, subsidized price of Chinese ships hurts American domestic competitors, but the sub-$100-per-day pay scale for foreign seafarers can be even more of a challenge, Smith said.\n\"U.S. offshore energy vessel owners can simply not compete with their foreign competitors because current U.S. law requires U.S.-owned companies to hire only U.S. citizens and permanent residents as mariners when its vessels work on U.S. offshore energy projects,\" said Smith. \"Conversely, U.S. law allows foreign-owned vessels to employ foreign mariners when conducting the same work. As foreign mariners command significantly less pay than their U.S. counterparts this gives foreign-crewed vessels a significant cost advantage.\"",

    "input": "The troubled U.S. effort to build a new generation of Polar Security Cutters received an important boost with the U.S. Coast Guard awarding a $951.6 million contract modification to Bollinger Shipyards. The program has struggled to move forward with years of design delays and cost overruns with the builders now asserting that the project is on a solid path forward.\nThe shipyard reports it received the modification which advances the Detail Design and Construction phase of the first of the three vessels. They report it was structured as a Fixed-Price-Incentive-Firm Target (FPIF) contract modification reflecting the efforts to get the project on track. Congressional members and the independent Congressional Budget Office have been very critical of the project and poor management and organization. The failures of the project were cited among the reasons that the Trump administration dismissed Admiral Linda Fagan as Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard on the president’s first day in office in January.\n“Securing this contract modification has truly been a Herculean effort and underscores the incredible trust the U.S. Government has placed in Bollinger to build and deliver the first heavy polar icebreaker in half a century,” said Ben Bordelon, President and CEO of Bollinger Shipyards. He recognized the issues in the project saying, “hard work and dedication have successfully put the PSC program on a strong path forward after a rocky start under the previous, foreign-owned builder. We now look forward to receiving the green light to begin full production.”\nBollinger took over the project in 2022 when it acquired the VT Halter shipyard. A Congressional report found that the project which had begun in 2014 was deeply flawed with significant design issues with the vessel which it said Bollinger was working to address.\nSince acquiring the shipyard, Bollinger highlights that it has increased its Mississippi workforce by over 61 percent. Further, it says that production rolls at the Mississippi shipyard group have increased by more than 178 percent. It expects to continue to increase these roles as the project moves forward. The current contract modification primarily supports operations at Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding, with additional project contributions from facilities located in Massachusetts, Illinois, Virginia, Georgia, Louisiana, and other regions.\nBollinger now reports that completion of the first Polar Security Cutter is anticipated by May 2030. That places the project six years behind the originally anticipated schedule. The Congressional report on the project acknowledged the complexity of the project and the difficulties associated with building a heavy icebreaker and recognized that it was 50 years since the U.S. had built such a vessel.\nPoor organization and design issues were cited as key contributors to the cost overruns. Earlier estimates set the projected cost at $1.3 billion for the first vessel but the latest Congressional estimate targeted $1.9 billion, a nearly 40 percent increase over the Coast Guard’s projections. They however expected the project would realize cost synergies for the second and third vessels which CBO set at $1.6 billion each. The total cost for the project was last estimated at over $5 billion.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has been forced to scramble with life extension programs to keep its only large icebreakers in operation. It currently depends on thePolar Starwhich was commissioned in 1976, and recently marked its 49th mission to Antarctica.Healy, commissioned in 1999, had one of its engines replaced due to a failure and this year was temporarily sidelined by an engine room fire. Stretched to maintain the mission, the USCG acquired from Edison Chouest Offshore a polar class 3 icebreaker built in 2012 as an icebreaking anchor-handler. She will enter service by 2026 as the USCGCStoris.\nThe USCG and the Navy Integrated Program Office received approval in December 2024 to begin building the first of the new icebreakers, which will be calledPolar Sentinel. Bollinger in 2023 cut steel for a series of up to eight prototype modules as it sought to demonstrate the capabilities and advance the project. The contract modifications are an important step while Congressional members said it was also a sign of the urgency placed on the project.",

    "input": "\nRussia's top diplomat said Wednesday that the U.S. could be willing to help Gazprom restart its giant subsea pipelines to Western Europe, which would slash energy costs in Europe and make U.S. LNG less competitive on the EU market. Gazprom's giant Nord Stream system has been shut down since 2022, but if repaired and restored to full service, it has the capacity to supply nearly a third of all EU demand.\n\"There is talk about Nord Stream. It will probably be interesting if the Americans use their influence on Europe and force it not to refuse Russian gas,\" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\nRussian pipeline gas is by far the cheapest natural gas source for Northern Europe, and its return would be welcomed by some European industrialists. When Russia invaded Ukraine and the EU responded with sanctions, Gazprom effectively cut off subsea and terrestrial pipeline gas deliveries to Western Europe - ending long-term contractual relationships that had existed since the Soviet era and hiking EU gas prices overnight.\nPoliticoreports that the concept under discussion would be to have an American operator buy the Nordstream system's pipeline infrastructure. To do this transaction legally would likely require lifting or waiving sanctions on Gazprom and Nord Stream 2. The American pipeline operator would then serve as a middleman, taking gas from Russia and selling it to European utilities.\nOne Nord Stream 2 pipeline is serviceable and could likely start if it gained European authorization, a politically difficult change. To reach full system capacity, the other three lines would have to be repaired to fix damage from a 2022 sabotage attack.\nIn his interview, Lavrov noted that U.S. businesses currently have an edge over Europe on energy costs because of low U.S. natural gas prices. He noted that most top EU leaders are firmly against resuming imports of cheap Russian gas; if Nord Stream were restarted with American involvement, it would lower the EU's energy costs and help European firms better compete with American industry.\nLess profitability for U.S. LNG\nWhen Gazprom cut off its supply to Western Europe in mid-2022, the EU replaced Russian volumes by buying more LNG from big suppliers, notably the United States. European sales have powered the U.S. LNG industry's growth: In 2022 and 2023, the U.S. was Europe's biggest LNG supplier, averaging about eight billion cubic feet per day. Europe bought more than half of all U.S. LNG exports last year, up from zero in 2015, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nIf cheap Russian pipeline gas returned to Europe at scale via the Nord Stream pipeline system, Russia would retake market share and regain its place as Europe's largest gas supplier, according to Dutch commercial bankING. Inexpensive Russian supply would cut EU gas market prices in half: European wholesale gas would likely plummet from $14 per MMbtu to about $6 per MMbtu, the minimum cost of production at American LNG plans.",

However, it will be dedicated to vessels equipped with dual-fuel engines that use fuel with a carbon intensity of less than 75 gCO2(e)/MJ, from extraction to combustion (Well-to-Wake, or WtW).\n“By motivating investment in vessels capable of using low-carbon fuels and energy-efficient technologies, we are recognizing and rewarding our clients who are leading the transition toward a more sustainable future,” said Ilya Espino de Marotta, the Panama Canal’s Deputy Administrator and Sustainability Officer. “This step joins other initiatives being developed with the vision of contributing to the global goals of efficiency and effectiveness in maritime operations while reducing the carbon footprint.”\nThrough the NetZero Slot initiative, the Panama Canal asserts that it is reaffirming its commitment to advancing cleaner, more sustainable maritime transport while honoring and encouraging its users’ dedication to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nFor shipping companies, it says the program will offer the ability to choose the transit date within the week offered. They will also offer a guaranteed transit time of 24 hours.\nThis new offering it said was being put in place while it awaits the development of regional infrastructure and logistics that will allow steady progress toward global decarbonization goals. A second phase, planned for 2026, will be announced in the future.\nThis program comes as the government of Panama continues to assert that it will not negotiate with the Trump administration on the operation of the canal. It dismissed talk that Trump would attempt to seize the canal asserting its sovereignty and denying allegations of Chinese domination.",

    "input": "A new project launched by a consortium of Dutch companies and supported by the government is focusing on what they are calling the world’s first zero-emission general cargo ship powered by liquid hydrogen. According to the project organizers, this initiative is a key pillar of the Maritime Masterplan, setting a new standard for decarbonizing European maritime logistics.\nThe project which is being led by the Dutch Innovation Company (Nederlandse Innovatie Maatschappij or NIM) focuses on designing, constructing, and demonstrating a hydrogen-powered cargo vessel that will operate in the North Sea and beyond. Managed by Van Dam Shipping, the ship is designed to transport bulk goods, eliminating harmful emissions and redefining the future of sustainable shipping.\n“By integrating hydrogen technology with digital innovation, we are proving that zero-emission shipping is not just a vision—it is an achievable reality,” says Sander Roosjen, CTO at NIM.\nAt the heart of the H2ESTIA Project is its integrated approach to hydrogen-powered propulsion. The vessel will be equipped with a newly designed cryogenic hydrogen storage and bunkering system, enabling safe handling and storage of liquid hydrogen at extremely low temperatures. A hydrogen fuel cell system together with batteries will provide primary propulsion, delivering clean power.\nTo further enhance energy efficiency, the ship will incorporate wind-assisted propulsion and waste heat recovery solutions, reducing hydrogen consumption. Digital twin technology will create a virtual model of the ship, allowing for real-time monitoring, operational optimization, and enhanced safety measures.\nThe project the organizers said is set to demonstrate technological readiness and economic viability, ensuring such vessels can be commercially deployed. It also addresses major challenges such as the certification of hydrogen systems, risk management, and crew training, paving the way for the safe integration of hydrogen technology into maritime operations.\nThe H2ESTIA Project is supported by a consortium of leading maritime and technology firms, TNO, MARIN, the University of Twente, Cryovat, EnginX, Encontech, classification society RINA, and the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management.",

Hoegh has fallen 10 percent since the start of the week; K Line is down by four percent; Wallenius Wilhelmsen is down nine percent; and Hyundai Glovis is down by nearly 10 percent. These firms have had solid financial success over the past few years thanks to booming exports out of China, but a contraction in the U.S. import market could weigh heavily on their prospects.\nTrade data shows that automakers appear to have anticipated new tariffs and frontloaded their shipments in the first quarter of 2025. According to ship tracking firm Esgian, five extra ro-ro shipments departed Europe for the U.S. in February, and eight extra out of East Asia in January (compared to the same periods last year).\nThe tariff threat would primarily affect seaborne trade lanes out of South Korea, Japan and Europe, the primary overseas sources of U.S. autos. China sells relatively few complete cars into the U.S. market, capturing a market share of less than two percent, and will be less affected by U.S. auto tariffs.\nBut foreign PCTC owners still have a tough road ahead in the Chinese market. The world's leading car exporter is building its own national car-carrier fleet to compete with longtime industry incumbents. According to Li Gang, Communist Party committee chair for China Citic Financial Leasing, the \"national vehicles and national transport\" strategy will reduce shipping costs and ensure capacity for Chinese automakers.",

The South China Morning Post and Chinese-controlled newspapers are reporting that the target date of April 2 for the signing of definitive documentation will not proceed but also said this does not mean the deal is canceled.\nChinese officials later confirmed that the State Administration for Market Regulation would be reviewing the transaction. The South China Morning Post reports that the officials said the review was to “ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interests.” Bloomberg adds that the review will be looking for potential security or antitrust violations.\nHutchison on March 4 announced that it had reached principal agreements with a consortium of U.S.-led BlackRock and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company’s TiL group which owns and operates terminals. The total deal valued at $23 billion is for the sale of 80 percent interest in the 43 ports in 23 countries outside China operated by CK Hutchison. In a parallel agreement, Hutchison said it would sell 90 percent interest in the Panama company that operates the terminals in Balboa and Cristobal, Panama at each terminus of the Panama Canal.\nHutchison said that “fundamental and essential terms” of the two transactions had been agreed in principle, subject to definitive documentation. It reported that the definitive documentation for the Panama portion of the transaction was expected to be signed on or before April 2. It also entered into exclusive negotiation and non-disclosure arrangements with the BlackRock-TiL consortium.\nChinese officials reacted negatively to the news of the sale as they saw it as U.S. intervention and worried about threats to Chinese shipping and trade. According to the media reports, China has been increasing the pressure on CK Hutchison including reports this week that the government had ordered that there be no new deals with Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire who controls Hutchison, and his family.\nPanama which has also been under pressure from the United States announced that it would be reviewing the transaction. Previously Panama had moved to review the contract with Hutchison and the Panama government filed notice that it was withdrawing from China’s Belt & Road initiative.\nMedia reports in Asia suggested that behind-the-scenes talks were happening between the company and government officials in Hong Kong. Hutchison has declined to make public comments and also canceled a planned briefing with investors after its year-end financial report.\nTrump has hailed the deal for the Panama ports and took credit with BlackRock for making it happen.

The Global Maritime Forum's \"All Aboard\" consortium has conducted extensive research on methods to improve life at sea and boost retention, and it has just released a report on real-world changes that could make the difference.\nSeafaring can be a hard life, and there have always been aspects that shoreside workers would find challenging, like fatigue, months-long work schedules, and (on some vessels) abusive work environments. Shipping has always had a certain amount of hazing and harassment under way, out of sight of the home office; the All Aboard Alliance found that this cultural phenomenon is a modern-day retention issue. 25 percent of study participants had experienced harassment and bullying in their careers, rising to more than 50 percent among female seafarers.\nWorking with 12 shipowners, the alliance came up with guidance to improve the crew experience, especially in abuse reduction. A positive work environment starts with setting clear policies and guidelines, then requires \"zero-tolerance\" enforcement for unacceptable behavior, the alliance advises.\nThe coalition also recommends clear guidelines for training and performance evaluations; avoiding discriminatory hiring practices; providing female-appropriate PPE and facilities on board; setting up a family leave policy; improving shore leave, a common point of friction since the COVID era; building onboard community; and providing timely relief at the end of a seafarer's contract, without involuntary extensions. The alliance advises a target of offboarding at least 85 percent of the crew on schedule at contract end, allowing them predictable time off for their personal lives.\n\"These guidelines serve as a roadmap for shipping companies striving to improve employee well-being, and will also help seafarers and other stakeholders identify companies that take sustainability and social responsibility seriously. They strike a strong balance between aspiration and realism, and we’re confident that they will improve outcomes for all workers in the maritime industry, ensuring that success is accessible to everyone — regardless of gender, race, sexuality, or background,\" said Mikael Skov, Chief Executive Officer at Hafnia and All Aboard Alliance Co-chair.\nThese inclusive, diversity-friendly HR policies may not be easy everywhere. Some overseas companies openly discriminate against female seafarers in hiring, or only hire personnel of certain nationalities, according to the study - and even for well-resourced Western companies, it can be hard to uphold \"zero-tolerance\" deterrence policies. Maersk, the number-two ocean carrier, has had torehireat least one officer who was previously dismissed for sexual harassment, and has noted that sexual offenders can return to work in its U.S. market. It will not provide numbers on the extent of any onboard abuse in its fleet, according to Danish business paperBerlingske.",

It was done as part of a campaign by the well-known group against fossil fuels and the EU’s lack of progress on ending Russian and other gas imports.\nThe campaigners are urging Europe to become energy independent by transitioning to renewables. They said ending fossil gas imports is crucial for safety and security.\nThe group in its inflatable boats and supported by its mothershipArctic Sunrisefirst targeted the Marshall Islands-registered gas carrierMarvel Swallow. The 93,510 dwt vessel was recently placed in service by Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. It was coming from Louisiana in the United States with a shipment of gas bound for Zeebrugge, Belgium.\nThe group circled and ran alongside the gas carrier displaying banners for the photo ops. Among the banners they were displaying were ones reading “Their gas, your cash.” The group reports it briefly interrupted the voyage of the gas carrier but it later docked in Belgium.\n“Autocrats like Putin fund their wars with gas revenues, while political bullies like Trump use their dominance as gas suppliers to pressure European countries economically and politically. Meanwhile, families and communities struggle with soaring energy bills and extreme weather fueled by fossil gas,” said Joeri Thijs, spokesperson for Greenpeace Belgium speaking from aboard Arctic Sunrise. “This dependence leaves us all vulnerable. Energy sovereignty through renewables is no longer just an environmental necessity, it is a matter of security.”\nGreenpeace cited data from IEEFA (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis saying despite promises from EU politicians gas imports from Russia grew 18 percent in 2024 with the EU spending €21.9 billion on gas. It reports 45 percent of Europe’s gas supply is coming from the U.S. making America Europe’s largest supplier.\nHours later the group returned to the waterways targeting the Cyprus-flaggedFedor Litke. The 96,839 dwt gas carrier was inbound for Sabetta, Russia. It is operated by Dynagas of Greece.\nThe second protest was to call attention to the new EU sanctions implemented on March 26 that aim to restrict Russian gas imports. Greenpeace highlights that one of the goals is to stop carriers such as theFedor Litkecoming from Siberia and transferring gas at either Zeebrugge or Montoir-de-Bretagne, France as part of a transshipment program to deliver gas across Europe.\nThe group which is well known for these activities asserts the EU must stop the persistent delays in phasing out Russian fossil fuels imports. They note EU officials under pressure from Donald Trump are considering increasing US LNG imports.\nWith Europe’s LNG imports declining and gas demand down 20 percent since 2021, Greenpeace says the EU must accelerate its shift away from gas imports. Greenpeace is urging a full phase-out of fossil gas by 2035 and a commitment to clean, independent energy.",

The rare deployment of seven B-2 stealth bombers at this remote airfield - a third of the entire inventory - has raised speculation about possible escalation against Houthi targets, or even against their sponsors in Iran.

This is the largest U.S. bunker-buster bomb, and would provide more capability for hitting hardened tunnels and command posts.\nIf the Houthis are hit hard by U.S. strikes, it would not be the first time: a U.S.-supplied force tried to defeat them on the ground for the better part of a decade, but despite billions spent, the Houthis expanded their reach and dug in.\n\"The Houthi leadership has been taken out in history in the past, and they are resilient,\" Vice Adm.

    "input": "The United States is continuing its “maximum pressure” against the Iranian oil industry reporting it has filed a new civil forfeiture in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. to seize $47 million from the proceeds of oil sales. It is part of a long-running campaign by the U.S. targeting Triliance Petrochemical Co., a Hong Kong-based broker with branches in Iran, the United Arab Emirates, China, and Germany, that the U.S. says is a well-known Iranian front company supporting the Iranian regime’s petrochemical industry.\nTriliance was first sanctioned by the United States in January 2020 on charges that it helps to finance Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) and its terrorist proxies. The U.S. said it had traced transactions in 2019 shipping oil to the UAE and China and transferring millions of dollars to Iran from the sale of oil which Trilance worked to conceal the Iranian origin of these products.\nToday’s suit details an elaborate scheme between 2022 and 2024 to facilitate the shipment, storage, and sale of Iranian petroleum products. U.S. prosecutors contend Iran was working to increase the marketability of Iranian oil in Europe and create future demand from European buyers.\nU.S. Attorney Edward Martin said the suit was to show Iran that avoiding sanctions “is not as easy as playing a shell game with tankers.” The filing alleges in January 2022 Iran loaded approximately one million barrels of oil to a tanker that would later be sanctioned by the U.S.\nAfter leaving Iran, the U.S. traced the oil including through three ship-to-ship transfers before it was offloaded for storage in Croatia. The U.S. alleges companies working with Triliance falsified documents and manipulated tanker AIS signals to conceal the origins and claim the oil came from Malaysia. Further, it is alleged that the facilitators paid the storage fees in U.S. dollars through U.S. financial institutions that would have refused the transactions had they known they were associated with Iranian oil. The oil was ultimately sold with the U.S. reporting proceeds of $47 million which the U.S. is moving to seize.\nIt is not the first time the U.S. has targeted Trilance and the proceeds of sales. In November 2024, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., ordered the forfeiture of nearly $12 million connected with Triliance. Government lawyers highlighted a series of transactions and money transfers in 2020 linked to Triliance. In 2022, the U.S. had also gone after oil producers that it said were working with Triliance.\n",

    "input": "\nKnutsen NYK Carbon Carriers, a subsidiary of NYK and Knutsen Group reports it is moving forward in the development of its concepts for the transport and storage of carbon as part of the emerging CCUS (Carbon capture, utilization, and storage) sector. The company obtained Approval in Principle (AiP) from ClassNK for the design of liquified CO2 carriers as well as the floating liquified storage facility that would work in conjunction with the vessels.\nWhile CCSU is expected to play a role in achieving carbon neutrality, the companies highlight that significant challenges remain to develop large-scale operations and lower the costs associated with the process. They highlight the issues that need to be addressed in developing the operations, including reducing overall costs and securing land for liquefaction and storage facilities.\nThe joint venture company was launched by Knutsen and NYK in January 2022 focusing on the commercial development of a liquefied CO2 marine transportation and storage business. To address the challenges, they are focusing on using the elevated pressure (EP) method to store and transport liquefied carbon dioxide (LCO2) at ambient temperature. Coupled with the vessels is the terminal concept with the companies saying by utilizing an FLSU (Floating Liquefied Storage Unit), the cost of CO2 liquefaction and the land area required onshore in the CCUS value chain can be reduced, expanding the possibilities for realizing CCUS.\nClassNK has carried out a design review of the ship which would use LCO2-EP Cargo Tank technology developed by Knutsen to transport LCO2 in a stable state. Since there is no need to cool LCO2 to cryogenic temperatures, Knutsen says it is easy to handle and potentially reduces energy and costs during liquefaction. It reports the LCO2-EP Cargo Tank has been developed to transport LCO2 at ambient temperatures and elevated pressures (0 to 10 degC / 34 to 45 barG). The companies reporting in December 2024 that theconstruction studieshad started for the vessel.\nNYK and KNCC also worked with ENEOS Xplora in developing the FLSU concept that combines the LCO2-EP Cargo Tank technology with the Isenthalpic Expansion Cooling & Liquefaction Process. According to the companies, this process has been researched and developed in collaboration among the three companies while ClassNK issued an AiP following a review.\nThey call the FLSU a pioneering concept explaining that it liquefies and temporarily stores CO2 that has been collected and transported as gas in an onshore facility making it ready for further transport by LCO2 carrier. By utilizing the features of the EP method, which has the potential to reduce the energy required for liquefaction, and adopting the process, which is expected to be simpler and more compact than conventional cooling methods, it has become possible to install a liquefaction plant on a floating structure.\nDevelopment of the concepts comes as the first commercial CO2 transport and storage operations, Northern Lights a joint venture between Shell, Equinor, and TotalEnergies is set to start operations this summer. It has taken delivery of two dedicated LCO2 carriers and today, March 27, reported it has also decided to proceed with an expansion raising capacity from 1.5 million to a minimum of 5 million tonnes of CO2 per year.\nOther projects are moving forward with both the UK and Denmark reporting a strong response to their offering potential storage sights. Royal Wandborg also reports it has reached a milestone in the construction of its EasyMax CO2 carrier as the hull sections are being assembled. It will be the first CO2 carrier built in Europe to serve the growing potential market.",

Its territorial integrity is under pressure in its western exclusive economic zone, where Chinese forces are gradually expanding their hold over reefs and waterways in the Spratly Islands. China claims most of the South China Sea under its historical \"nine-dash line\" policy, and has used increasing levels of force to pursue its claims - includingobstructingnavigation, ramming, water-cannoning and (on one isolated occasion) hand-to-handcombat.\nIn the run-up to Hegseth's trip, Chinese officials repeatedly tarred the U.S. as an unreliable partner. \"Those who willingly serve as chess pieces [of the U.S.] will be deserted in the end,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun warned the Philippines on Tuesday.

    "input": "After an extended pressure campaign from the United States and activist groups such as UANI (United Against Nuclear Iran) the Panama Maritime Authority is poised to purge its registry of sanctioned tankers. Bloomberg is citing comments by the General Director of Merchant Maine for PMA, Ramon Franco made during a conference in Singapore.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Panama is poised to remove 128 ships from its registry. They are ships sanctioned by the U.S. or its allies. The new Trump administration has been moving to expand the sanctions against tankers in the Iranian trade following a sweeping move in the last days of the Biden administration targeting the shadow tanker fleet moving Russian oil and gas.\nBloomberg highlights the move by Panama was made possible by changes to the administration process and regulations making it easier to expel violators from Panama’s ship registry. The report says at least 70 tankers have already been removed but the administrators pledged to become more aggressive in their actions against sanctioned vessels and other violators.\nSeparately, Bloomberg is also reporting the Trump “maximum pressure” campaign appears to be having an effect on tanker movements and deliveries. The news outlet calculates that 11 tankers are currently idle or slow steaming in the area around Malaysia and Singapore. Bloomberg reports the tankers have 17 million barrels of oil loaded. Further, it says more than 20 tankers are anchored idle near Iran’s Kharg Island terminal.\nBloomberg’s report asserts that more than two-thirds of the tankers that handled Iranian crude in 2024 had been sanctioned as of late February. Analysts at TankerTracker.com taking the wider view however said early in March that the U.S. has “only blacklisted 234 (or 45 percent) of the 522 tankers involved in the Iran sanctions oil trade” as of the beginning of this month.\nUANI has long been critical of Panama with the NGO asserting that Panama has 18 percent (96 vessels) of the 510 the group has listed in its “Ghost Armada List” tracking vessels in the Iranian oil trade. The group notes its list has grown from just 70 vessels when it started the listing in November 2020. They currently list nine tankers registered in Panama as having been sanctioned.\nPanamanian officials have highlighted their efforts in recent years to clear the registry after a change in administration. As the largest ship registry by number of vessels, Panama has had a large number but a small percentage of violators in the registry.\nDespite the ongoing pressure effort, UANI reports Iran continues to ship large amounts of oil. The group cites data saying Iran shipped 1.7 million barrels in February up from 1.3 million the month before. China according to the data is the largest customer receiving nearly all the oil Iran ships.",

In its reporting, it said the vessel which was due to arrive on Thursday, March 27, laden with approximately 100,000 metric tons of Russian crude would be turned away.\nBuilt in 2004, the vessel has now completed 20 years of service which is an important threshold under Indian regulations.

The tank represents a violation of an order by the USCG issued last month concerning hazardous cargo due to safety concerns.\nLast month, the Puerto Nuevo Terminal (PNT) was slapped with an order tostop handling hazardous goodsamong them being anhydrous ammonia owing to the facility’s lack of adequate firefighting capability. Weeks later, a Sector San Juan inspections team discovered an anhydrous ammonia hazardous cargo shipment at the terminal, something they contend poses a significant threat to the safety and security of the facility.\nThe discovery of the hazardous cargo happened during a routine examination. The Coast Guard team conducting the inspection identified three tank containers, one of which was deemed to be a violation because it was holding more than 5,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia. It is a hazardous, highly toxic, and corrosive gas or colorless liquid which is flammable in high concentrations. The product is mainly used for various industrial applications including detergents, pesticides, and fertilizers, among others.\nFollowing the finding, an interagency team conducted a sweep of the facility, inspecting other containers. They were looking for other hazardous materials while nothing the current order does not prohibit the terminal from handling non-hazardous general cargo.\n\n#BreakingOn Wed.,@uscgSector San Juan personnel discovered a#HAZMATcargo shipment of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Puerto Nuevo Terminals (PNT) port facility in#PuertoRico.

Robert E. Stiles, acting Coast Guard Sector San Juan commander and acting Captain of the Port.\nThe Coast Guard reports it has repeatedly raised concerns over the port facility’s inability to meet safety compliance measures regarding firefighting capability. After numerous concessions and repeated failures to comply with safety measures regarding the handling of hazardous cargo, the terminal was issued a prohibitive order on February 27.\nThe discovery of the dangerous cargo, which is a direct violation of the order, could result in PNT being fined about $120,000 for each occurrence and each day of violation. Willful and knowing violation of a Captain of the Port Order the Coast Guard also highlights is a Class D felony that is punishable by up to six years in prison or fines of up to $250,000 for an individual or $500,000 for an organization.\nPuerto Nuevo Terminal is a 50/50 joint venture between Luis Ayala Colon and Saltchuk-owned Puerto Rico Terminals.

Engaged in tugboat operations in Tokyo Bay, NYK which owns the vessel reports it achieved a GHG-emission reduction of up to approximately 95 percent. They believe it illustrates the potential of ammonia as a maritime fuel.\nThe 272-ton tugSakigake, which was built in 2015 as Japan’s first LNG-fueled tug, was selected for the pioneering project. When it was introduced a decade ago, the tug which is 122 feet (37 meters) in length was viewed as a proof of concept for alternative fuel operations in the class. It is again taking that role for ammonia-fueled propulsion.\nThe conversion program for the vessel was completed by Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) and IHI Power Systems Co. on August 23, 2024. They worked in cooperation with Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK) as part of a Green Innovation Fund Project sponsored by Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).\nThe development project of this vessel started in October 2021 as part of NEDO’s Green Innovation Fund Project which provided for the “development of vessels equipped with domestically produced ammonia-fueled engines.” The companies worked together to develop the designs and ultimately removed the LNG-fueled propulsion system to replace it with the new ammonia-fueled propulsion.Sakigakebecame the world’s first commercial-use ammonia-fueled vessel following Fortescue which converted an offshore support vessel and completed certification for its ammonia system earlier in 2024.\nNYK Group company Shin-Nippon Kaiyosha operatedSakigakein a three-month demonstration voyage while conducting tugboat operations in Tokyo Bay. NYK and IPS analyzed the ammonia co-firing and GHG-reduction rates during vessel operations and confirmed it consistently exceeded 90 percent. Depending on engine load rates, they were also able to achieve a 95 percent reduction in GHG emissions.\nAfter having completed this first demonstration, the vessel will continue to be used for tugboat operations in Tokyo Bay. NYK reports it will continue to accumulate knowledge related to the development and operation of ammonia-fueled vessels.\nNYK, Japan Engine Corporation, IPS, and Nippon Shipyard Co. are working together to develop an ammonia-fueled ammonia gas carrier, which is scheduled to be delivered in November 2026. This project is also sponsored by NEDO’s Green Innovation Fund Project and is part of NYK’s efforts to develop and introduce next-generation fueled vessels.",

    "input": "Carnival Cruise Line marked a new step for the brand as it completed the expansion of its operations in Australia taking over its former sister brand P&O Cruises Australia. With two P&O ships officially entering Carnival service on Saturday, March 29, the brand with 29 ships will have the largest fleet in its 53-year history.\nThe corporation announced last year its decision to sunset the P&O brand which had a long history with Australia. P&O (Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company) along with Orient Line traced their origins to the 1830s and the beginnings of liner service between England and Australia. The two companies initiated cruising from Australia in 1932. They merged in 1960, but Australia remained a key part of the operation including the transition into modern cruising in the 1970s.\nAfter acquiring P&O in 2003, Carnival Corporation sought to develop the Australian market transferring ships from its Carnival Cruise Line and other brands. The Carnival Cruise Line brand entered the Australian market in 2012 and positioned its first large ship,Carnival Splendor(113,300 gross tons) in the market in 2019. The corporation however cited higher operating and regulatory costs and the South Pacific’s small population as the reason to combine the P&O Australia and Carnival brands. P&O continues to operate its separate cruise operation from the UK.\nP&O Australia sailed its final cruises in February and the two cruise ships were sent to Melbourne, Australia where they spent the past 10 days undergoing overhauls and rebranding in a wet dock. Some structural alterations were made as well as redecorating with new carpet and adding new technology. They are also introducing Carnival’s signature entertainment programming to the ships.\nThe ships are now known asCarnival AdventureandCarnival Encounterafter having operated since 2022 for P&O Australia. Both ships were built by Fincantieri and entered service for the U.S.-based Princess Cruises asGrand PrincessandStar Princess. They are 108,865 gross tons with accommodations for 2,600 passengers.\n\"Our expansion in Australia demonstrates incredible enthusiasm for our brand and we’re grateful to our loyal guests who continue to drive our ongoing growth, solidifying Carnival as the world’s most popular cruise line,” said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line. “Doubling the fun in our Australia homeports enables us to deliver more sailing options, offer more variety, and deepen our partnerships in the Sydney and Brisbane communities.”\nCarnival Adventurearrived in Sydney, Australia on Friday morning, March 28, for events before her return to service on Saturday. She will be sailing year-round from Sydney whileCarnival Encounterarrives on Saturday to start her first cruise from Brisbane.\nCarnival Splendorcontinues to sail year-round from Sydney while the smallerCarnival Luminosa(92,720 gross tons) operates seasonally in Australia. With the four ships, Carnival Cruise Line reports it expects to sail more than 500,000 passengers from its Australian homeports this year.\n",

    "input": "\nWhile US forces continue to pummel Houthi targets in Yemen, primarily using aircraft launched from theUSS Harry S. TrumanCarrier Strike Group located in the Red Sea, tensions at sea are also rising in the Northern Indian Ocean. Signs of increased military readiness are evident both on the part of Iran and of the United States.\nIn comparison with the normal level of anti-American rhetoric seen on a daily basis in the Iranian online press, which is dominated by government-controlled websites, recent days have seen a dramatic increase in stories that imply that the Iranians feel they are under imminent threat. These stories are normally pitched as warnings to both America and Israel not to attack, brandishing Iran’s ability to counter-attack using its drone and ballistic missile forces. At times of tension, Iran often manufactures a display of some new missile capability, and in recent days has shown off what it claims is a new underground tunnel complex; in this instance, the story may be true, as similar tunneling, albeit with the normal complement of missiles on mobile launchers, has not been seen before.\n\n\nMajor General Mohammad Bagheri and Brigadier Amir Ali Hajizadeh tour the new ‘missile megacity’, March 25 (Press TV)\n\nIn an underwhelming display on March 27, the IRGC Navy (Nedsa) mounted a parade of old and unarmed dhows along the length of its coastline, which it said included vessels from Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen. A number of the trading vessels are likely to have been contracted by Nedsa’s Unit 190 in recent years to smuggle weapons to the Houthis and others. This somewhat pointless review, which was probably the ‘3000 boat event' originally planned for January 27, was led by the converted oil tankerShahid Bagheri(C110-4) and the Shahid Soleimani Class missile corvetteShahid Rais Ali Delvari(FS313-04).\nThe Regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) is adopting a slightly more relaxed posture during the Ramadan season. On March 28, satellite imagery of the main naval base at Bandar Abbas showed four Alvand/Moudge and one Bayandor frigates alongside. There was no sign in the harbor of the intelligence collection frigateIRINS Zagros(H313). A Kilo Class submarine was at its berth on the east side of the harbor, with a second Kilo seen in dry dock. The long-range logistic vesselIRINS Makran(K441) was at its normal pier in the outer harbor. The three operational Hengham Class amphibious ships were alongside, together implying that there are no long-range flotillas out of home waters at present, as these vessels normally provide logistic support for such deployments. It is not clear at present even if the Nedaja remains in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden area, a station which it has been maintaining continuously since 2008; if present, what would be the 101st Flotilla is maintaining an extremely low profile.\nWith the U.S. negotiating position outlined to Iran in a letter passed by President Trump through intermediaries to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, the Iranians understand they have limited room for maneuver and are under increasing pressure. At the same time, both the European Union and the United States have significantly tightened sanctions on the dark tanker fleet running sanctioned Iranian oil exports, which will have immediate detrimental effects on an Iranian economy already under very significant strains. On March 13, the US Treasury sanctioned an additional 30 tankers, in the third round of such sanctions. The EU’s 16th sanctions package listed an additional 73 Russian and Iranian tankers.\nOn the other side of the balance sheet, the United States is significantly reinforcing its strike capability in both the Red Sea and Northern Indian Ocean areas.\n\n\nImagery of Diego Garcia on March 25, sourced from @IndoPacWatch but reposted by @MenchOsint who is often sympathetic to Iran\n\nRecent satellite imagery shows at least seven B-2 Sprint strategic bombers on the British base at Diego Garcia. Nine KC-135 refueling aircraft are also visible on the southern-most ramp, with slots B1 and B2 on the ramp closed to other visiting military aircraft until the end of April. The KC-135 refuellers provide a significant payload and range boost, as they can refuel both the B-2 Sprints, the F-18 strike aircraft launching from the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, but also those from the USS Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group which is tracking west, and due to arrive in the area shortly.\nEarly on March 28, the MVJairan, the second of two sanctioned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) carrying sodium perchlorate from China, arrived in the Bandar Abbas anchorage. It can be expected to now move into the inner harbor and unload its cargo, to be processed into ammonium perchlorate which is the basis of the solid fuel which powers most of Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles.",

Construction on the vessel began in 2021 and it represents a significant step forward for the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), which will be responsible for the vessel’s operations.\nJapanese officials said as a country adjacent to and affected by the Arctic region, and as one of the world's leaders, Japan has a mission to contribute to resolving the various issues based on scientific evidence that impact the Arctic region. They noted that the Arctic is experiencing rapid environmental changes, such as a decrease in sea ice, which is resulting in increased economic activity in the region. They said that since the issues facing the Arctic are impacting the climate and weather on the entire planet they need to be viewed from a global perspective.\nJAMSTEC highlights the vessel will be equipped with equipment and facilities to enable a wide range of observations related to the atmosphere, weather, ocean, sea ice, and more. The design incorporates the maximum extent of Japan’s icebreaking construction technology. The new vessel will be Polar Class 4 capable of continuously breaking 1.2 meter (nearly 4 foot) of flat one-year ice at a speed of 3 knots.\n\n\nRendering of the completed research ship\n\nMirai II will be 13,000 tons with a length of 128 meters (420 feet). It will accommodate a total of 97 people, including 34 crewmembers and 63 researchers.\nConsidering the aging of the vessel, JAMSTEC reports it has decided to cease the operations of its current marine research vessel Mirai at the end of fiscal year 2025. The current vessel was launched in 1969 designed to become a nuclear-powered cargo ship. She was fueled in 1972, but two years later a controversy emerged due to questions over the vessel’s shielding for the nuclear reactor. It was used as a demonstration vessel and never entered commercial service before being retired in 1992. She was rebuilt as a diesel-powered ship and began operation as an oceanographic research ship in 1997.\nThe launching of the new vessel took place on March 19 at the Isogo Plant of Japan Marine United Corporation. Delivery is scheduled for November 2026.\nTo raise awareness of JAMSTEC’s activities and the new Arctic research vessel, the public was invited to submit names for the vessel. Using the public suggestions, the vessel’s workboat will be named Shirokuma, a common word used to describe polar bears, an animal that is being affected by environmental changes in the Arctic.\nJapanese officials said they expect once the vessel is in service it will make a significant contribution to advancing research into the global environment, including the Arctic region.",

    "input": "After weeks of negotiations with the Kremlin, U.S. President Donald Trump is beginning to show impatience with Russia's continued aggression in Ukraine, and on Sunday he threatened to create a new penalty on Russian oil: \"secondary tariffs\" imposed on the nations that buy it. In practice, this would mean new U.S. tariffs on China, India and Turkey, the three nations that buy meaningful volumes of Russian crude.\nThe peace talks with the U.S. have produced valuable results for Russia, like a pledge of American assistance to help Russian ag exporters compete for more global market share - but there have been few if any benefits for Ukraine. Russian forces continue to bombard civilian infrastructure and to seize territory, advancing Russia's strategic interests while ignoring Trump's pleas for peace. On Russian state television, prominent commentators have mocked Trump's lead negotiator as an \"empty head\" for trusting the Kremlin's statements, and havecelebratedRussia's ability to \"fight America in war and win\" in Ukraine.\nOn Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the creation of a transitional caretaker government to replace Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has led the nation's defense since the start of the invasion three years ago. Putin also said that his troops would \"finish off\" Ukraine's army, which has been steadily losing ground for months.\n\"I was saying not so long ago: 'We will get them.' There are reasons to believe that we will finish them off, too,\" Putin said.\nIn an early morning call with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, Trump said that he was \"pissed off\" with Putin for the suggestion, and said that Putin's remarks were \"not going in the right direction.\"\n\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" Trump said. \"That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can’t do business in the United States.\"\nThe U.S., UK and EU banned imports of Russian oil in 2022 (with limited exceptions). Russia sells virtually all of its crude oil to China (47 percent), India (37 percent) and Turkey (six percent), and these three nations would be most affected by any \"secondary tariffs.\"\nRussian LNG, refined products and coal are exported to a broader pool of buyers, but it is unclear if these energy commodities would be targeted.",

    "input": "\nThe scrutiny on the use of biofuels in Europe has intensified, with reports emerging last week that the EU is planning to suspend recognition of the ISCC certification of waste-based biofuels. The International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) has an EU certification scheme that verifies that biofuels entering the EU market are compliant with the bloc’s sustainability requirements, as set out in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) II.\nThe EU Committee on Sustainability of Biofuels, Bioliquids and Biomass Fuels had convened to discuss rising fraud cases of biofuels in the European market. While the deliberations of the committee are confidential, one of the outcomes reportedly is a proposal to the European Commission to suspend recognition of ISCC certifications for waste-based biofuels for 2.5 years. If the 27 member states approve the suspension, EU countries will have the discretion to accept or reject ISCC certificates.\nA surge of imports from South-East Asia has raised serious concerns on the compliance of these biofuels with EU market regulations. Market players blame this on lax verification procedures by ISCC, which is the largest feedstock accreditor. Data from fuel regulators in Europe estimate that 1.8 million tons of fraudulent ISCC-certified Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) entered the EU in 2023. POME is a byproduct of palm oil processing and is used as a feedstock in production of biodiesel. The biofuel is gaining widespread use in the shipping industry.\n“Based on European Commission data published in December, a third of the used cooking oil (UCO) is undoubtedly fake, most likely sourced directly from virgin palm oil,” James Cogan, EU Government Affairs, Industry& Policy Director at biotech firm ClonBio Group, told S&P Global. Virgin palm oil as a feedstock is ineligible for renewable energy incentives under the EU’s RED II initiative. This is based on its alleged contribution to deforestation abroad.\nIn addition, the EU proposal comes at a time when the shipping industry in Europe has started a journey on use of ISCC certified biofuels, as a measure towards a green transition.\nThe ISCC system said that it is aware of the EU Biofuels Committee’s discussions, noting that it was surprised by the suspension proposal.\nThis latest step from the EU adds to the growing pushback against use of biofuels in shipping. Next week, the IMO will be hosting MEPC 83 (Marine Environment Protection Committee 83) where a raft of mid-term measures on green shipping will be debated. In line with this, some shipping lines - including Hapag Lloyd and environmental NGOs - have come forward to warn about the widespread use of biofuels in shipping industry.\nNearly a third of global shipping could run on biofuels in 2030, up from less than one percent today. This would see close to 300 million bottles of vegetable oil (palm and soy) diverted to powering ships every day in 2030, according to a study by the transport NGO T&E. Unfortunately, vast amounts of farmlands - 3.4 million hectares, almost total area of Germany - would be needed to produce enough crops to meet biofuels demand for shipping, taking up resources that would otherwise be used to make food.",

    "input": "On Sunday, China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) announced the discovery of a significant new field in an undisputed area of the South China Sea.\nThe Huizhou 19-6 oilfield is located in the eastern part of the South China Sea, about 150 nautical miles off Shenzhen - far away from geopolitical hotspots and well within the Chinese exclusive economic zone. CNOOC assesses that it contains 750 million barrels equivalent of oil and gas (100 million tonnes). The test well produced minimal daily oil production and 2.4 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. It is a shallow-water field with a water depth of just 100 meters, but drilling the deep well of 5,400 meters was a technical challenge, said Xu Changgui, chief geologist for CNOOC.\n\"This discovery has confirmed the largest integrated clastic oilfield in the northern South China Sea in terms of original oil in place, breaking the traditional theoretical understanding, and demonstrating the enormous exploration potential of deep and ultra-deep plays in high-temperature and highly active basins offshore China,\" said Xu.\nThe find marks the second year in a row that CNOOC has found a resource this big. If commercialized and replicated at scale, it could help China reduce its dependence on foreign gas imports. China buys about 10 billion cubic feet of gas in the form of LNG every day - nearly three shiploads daily.\nClastic reservoirs like Huizhou 19-6 are a challenge for oil and gas development, and are more complex and less predictable than other plays. They are formed from deposits of geologic debris, like sand, rock fragments, clay and minerals, and often vary in composition throughout the formation.\nTop image:CNOOC headquarters, Beijing (Daniel Case / CC BY SA 3.0)",

    "input": "\nThe Trump administration may be willing to help a Canadian company get a head start on seabed mining in the deep Pacific. Administration officials are in talks to use an obscure domestic law to bypass the International Seabed Authority and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), granting a foreign firm a U.S. seabed lease in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nThe Metals Company (TMC), a British Columbia-based mining firm with a strongESG focus, has been trying to obtain an ISA permit to collect manganese nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone for years. It had hoped to have ISA approvals in hand for a 2027 start, with support from the island nation of Nauru, but its push for the agency to craft regulations has recently been slowed down. Under the leadership of newly-elected ISA Secretary-General Leticia Carvalho, the agency has taken a deliberate pace towards passing final rules, and more than 30 nations, including the UK, France, Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark, want the industry to pause indefinitely until there is better science on its impact.\nThe CCZ is little-studied, and oceanographers warn that removing manganese nodules could do lasting damage to the ecosystem before it is even understood.Researchfinanced by TMC found that the nodules may be a previously-undiscovered source of dissolved oxygen at the bottom, a revolutionary discovery.\nTMC's CEO and chairman, Australian national Gerard Barron, hascriticizedISA's slow movement on crafting final regulations. In a statement Thursday, he said that the company might simply bypass the ISA and obtain a license from a single nation - the United States.\n“We believe we have sufficient knowledge to get started and prove we can manage environmental risks. What we need is a regulator with a robust regulatory regime, and who is willing to give our application a fair hearing. That’s why we’ve formally initiated the process of applying for licenses and permits under the existing U.S. seabed mining code,\" said Barron in a statement.\nThe U.S. code in question is the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA), a little-known law passed in 1980 that created a domestic licensing mechanism for seabed mining. It serves as a substitute for the provisions of UNCLOS, which the U.S. has not ratified.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) told the New York Times that an approval process for TMC's permit request could begin soon, to include interagency consultations and public comment periods. To secure approval under the statute, TMC would have to use a U.S.-flagged vessel for the mining operation. Its contracted mining support ship, the drillship conversionHidden Gem,is currently owned in India, managed in the Netherlands and flagged in Malta.\nThe company's proposal has attracted international opposition. On Friday, ISA Secretary-General Leticia Carvalho emphasized \"that the authority holds exclusive jurisdiction over all activities in the international seabed area, which is recognized as the common heritage of humankind under UNCLOS.\"\nMore than three dozen nations, including China, Russia, the UK, France and India, have condemned TMC's plan and registered their support for the ISA. If the U.S. decides to support TMC and bypass UNCLOS, other nations could follow suit without constraints.\nTMC faces the financial pressures familiar to any startup. It has lost about $70-80 million annually for the last two years, has no revenue, and has expended $630 million to date. In its 2024 earningstatement, it projected that it has the financial resources to cover another 12 months of obligations, with $25 million in loan support from Barron and from board member Andrei Karkar.",

This was revealed in a letter leaked last week, which appeared to have been written by Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and addressed to the U.S President Donald Trump. Theletteris dated March 16.\n“Somalia is prepared to offer the U.S exclusive operational control over the Balidogle and Berbera airbases, as well as the Port of Berbera and Bosaso. These strategically positioned assets provide an opportunity to bolster American engagement in the region, ensuring uninterrupted military and logistical access in this critical corridor,” reads part of the letter.\nPorts of Berbera and Bosaso have long attracted global interest due to their strategic location near the entrance of the Red Sea. The U.S operates a naval base in the neighboring Djibouti, whose lease is scheduled to expire in 2034, with an option for 10-year extension.\nHowever, the offer from Somalia promises to expand America’s footprint in the Gulf of Aden. The U.S military is currently leading efforts to secure Southern Red Sea from the ongoing Houthi attacks on merchant shipping.\nBut Somalia’s proposal to the U.S has been interpreted as a desperate move to stop recognition of its breakaway region, Somaliland, as a sovereign state. Early this month, the Financial Times reported that Washington was in the initial stages of negotiating with Somaliland. The discussions are about a possible deal to recognize the de facto state in exchange for rights to establish a military base near the Port of Berbera.\nIn a speech on Saturday, Somaliland’s President Abdirahman Irro dismissed Somalia’s offer to the U.S. “The leadership of Somaliland rests with me and my people. No one can claim or negotiate over the territory of Somaliland,” said Irro.\nBerbera sea port is controlled by Somaliland while Bosaso is owned by Puntland, an autonomous state of Somalia. Both the ports are operated by the UAE’s DP World, which is currently modernizing the terminals.",

According to NRK and the shipowners' association, Ro Marine never had a presence in the building - and Norway's finance authority says that the company wasn't selling real insurance, either.\nA routine check of the insurer's paperwork revealed that it had sent clients a forged document that purported to be an approval letter from the Finanstilsynet, Norway's Financial Supervisory Authority. The seal was wrong; the signature was fake; and the document referred to nonexistent regulations, Finanstilsynet told NRK. The agency reported the apparent fraud to the police and on March 4, it instructed Ro Marine AS to cease operations immediately.\nFour people have been charged in connecton with the scheme: two Norwegians, who deny knowledge of any wrongdoing; one Bulgarian; and one Russian resident of St. Petersburg, who owns and manages the business. NRK contacted Ro Marine by email, and the company denied any violations of sanctions.\nThe firm's Russian owner is not in custody, and despite the instructions from Norwegian authorities, the company's website remains live. As of March 25, Finanstilsynet said that it was unable to reach the brokerage.\n\"Finanstilsynet warns against entering into agreements with Romarine AS and against using the services offered through the company's websites,\" the agency cautioned in a statement.\nThe new insurance inspection regime in the Baltic Sea turned up seven tankers that claimed to be covered by Ro Marine, authorities told Danwatch, including the dark fleet tanker Achilles. The false coverage documents passed muster at the time, given the Norwegian address and connections of Ro Marine, but had no actual insurance behind them. This left the tankers dangerously uncovered in the event of a casualty or a spill.\n\"False insurance is in direct violation of international conventions and increases the danger for everyone,\" Harvard sanctions expert Craig Kennedy told NRK. \"It violates a core principle of global shipping safety and should be of concern to all coastal states.\"\nThe Ro Marine case is one of many alternate insurance arrangements used by the \"dark fleet\" of Russia-linked tankers. These vessels cannot access Western insurance markets because of sanctions, and have turned to Russian and Indian insurers to plug the gap, with questionable results. It may be the most egregious example of a workaround, experts say.\n\"There have been isolated cases, but not on this scale and not this systematically. It’s outrageous. It completely undermines the system,” says Kristina Siig.",

Initial reports indicated that three Chinese nationals had been kidnapped from the vessel but today, March 31, Chinese officials reported the crew are “physically safe.”\nThe incident took place Thursday evening, March 27, according to the report from Ghana. The fishing vesselMengxin 1, registered in Ghana, was at sea when it was approached and boarded by seven armed pirates. The Ghana Navy reports warning shots were fired and several crewmembers on the fishing vessel went into hiding.\nThe pirates assembled the crewmembers they could locate on deck and robbed the crew of their mobile phones. After about three hours the pirates left the vessel. MDAT-GoG (Maritime Domain Awareness Trade - Gulf of Guinea), the French – British effort for maritime situational awareness in the Gulf of Guinea reports the incident took place approximately 16 nautical miles southwest of the Ghanian capital of Accra.\nThe crewmembers in hiding reported they emerged to find the captain, chief mate, and chief engineer, all Chinese nationals, missing. Because there was no mobile network coverage out at sea it took some time for the incident to be reported until the remaining crew could get the vessel close enough to shore to gain a signal.\nThe Ghanaian Navy began a search. It also issued an alert to neighboring countries to be looking for the pirates. The fishing boat proceeded back to the port of Tema in Ghana.\nAsked about the incident, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had been in touch with the embassy and Ghanian officials.\n“The crew members are physically safe now. China will work with Ghana to earnestly protect the safety and security of Chinese nationals and institutions in Ghana,” responded spokesperson Guo Jiakun during the ministry’s daily press briefing in Beijing on March 31.\nIt is the second incident with a Chinese fishing vessel in recent months. In November, a Chinese fishing boat operating in the east off the Horn of Africa was boarded and held by pirates from Yemen. The Chinese embassy reported that the vessel had been released in January 2025 without providing details.",

The suit alleges that 13 vessels either owned or chartered by the company were damaged due to faulty fuel supplied while they were in Houston, Texas.\nThe complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas reports between March and June 2023, CMA CGM took delivery of 33,628 metric tons of very low sulfur fuel oil for its vessels while they were docked in the Port of Houston. The company had a supply contract with GCC Supply & Trading for the manufacture, sale, supply, and delivery of maritime fuel.\n“Shortly after the fuel was supplied, the vessels encountered significant operational issues, including but not limited to fuel pump seizures, ICU leakages, loss of engine power and propulsion in some cases leading to blackouts. CMA CGM put GCC on notice of these issues as soon as they became known,” the complaint alleges. It goes on to state, “The vessels suffered physical damage to their fuel tanks, fuel purifiers, fuel systems, and their engines and engine components, causing CMA CGM damages.”\nThey are alleging that GCC should have known that it was delivering “contaminated, defective, off-specification, unfit for consumption,” fuel that would cause physical harm to the vessels. They contend the supplier failed to “employ reasonable practices and policies for testing and screening its product for harmful contaminants or components.”\nCMA CGM says it incurred disrupted and delayed operations, which caused operational cost increases, lost opportunities, demurrage, and further damages. They are suing for breach of contract, breach of warranties, negligence, and product liability.\nThe shipping company is demanding a jury trial. It asks the court to determine the final amount of damages and relief it will be granted.\nBunker fuel testing and advisory company VPS issued apublic report on the problemin July 2023 saying that it detected the presence of Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and associated isomers at significantly high levels in VLSFO bunker fuel deliveries in Houston. At the time, it said at least 11 vessels had been impacted but it caused widespread concern. Weeks earlier in March 2023 over 200 vessels reported issues after fueling in Singapore. Regulators later traded the problem back to the origin well and imposed significant penalties on the supplier.",

The ruling unwinds a Biden-era policy decision that supported offshore oil and gas - but it conflicts even more deeply with the priorities of the Trump administration.\nDistrict of Columbia Judge Amit Mehta found that the March 2023 lease sales violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) because the agency \"failed to take a hard look\" at the CO2 emissions from the project. BOEM projected that the 2,500-square-mile lease areas would produce about 110 bcm of gas and 1.1 billion barrels of gas over the course of the next 50 years, resulting in foreseeable downstream CO2 emissions. However, BOEM's analysis concluded that leasing in the Gulf would lower global CO2e upstream emissions because of the comparatively low carbon footprint of drilling in the U.S. Gulf (relative to other international sources).\n“We are pleased the court recognized the serious hazards Lease Sale 259 would have inflicted upon Gulf coast communities, as well as the harms it would have caused to Gulf ecosystems and highly imperiled species like the endangered Rice’s whale,” said Devorah Ancel, Senior Attorney with Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, a plaintiff in the suit.\nThe American Petroleum Institute panned the judge's decision and accused environmental groups of \"weaponizing\" NEPA, according to the AP.",

    "input": "\nDays after confirming that it was considering newbuilds for its UK cruise operation known as Marella Cruises, Germany’s TUI Group has entered into an agreement with Fincantieri for two cruise ships. They would mark the first newbuilds for the company’s UK operation and expand a relationship started with the Italian shipbuilder for the group’s Germany cruise joint venture Mein Schiff.\nThe group said it had entered into a Memorandum of Agreement for the two new cruise ships based on Fincantieri confirming building slots with tentative delivery dates in 2030 and 2032. Fincantieri reports the value of the order exceeds €2 billion (nearly US$2.2 billion). The deal is subject to financing and completion of binding shipbuilding contracts.\nNo details were announced on the size of the planned cruise ships. They noted the ships would be customized to the UK cruise market and continue the premium positioning of the brand.\nLast week, TUI outlined opportunities for its investors highlighting the UK cruise market as a growing segment of the business. The group said it expects the market will grow by 9 percent per year until 2030. In today’s announcement of the shipbuilding plan, the parent company TUI AG said the business case points to an EBIT of between €130 and €150 million (US$140 to $162 million) per ship per year and a Return on Invested Capital of 11 to 12 percent.\nThe cruise line started in the 1970s when Thomson, a UK tour operator, chartered an older ship for cruises. TUI restarted the operation in the 1990s based on the success of competing tour operators with the burgeoning cruise market in the UK. In October 2017, the operation was rebranded Marella Cruises. Its marketing is entirely in the UK and through a series of efforts it has been positioned in the premium segment of the market.\nMarella currently operates five cruise ships, between 70,000 and 77,000 gross tons each, with accommodations for approximately 2,000 passengers per ship built between 1995 and 1997. Two of the ships, operating asMarella DiscoveryandMarella Discovery 2, were acquired in 2016 and 2017 from Royal Caribbean Group which is TUI’s partner for the German cruise operations. Two more ships were acquired for Royal Caribbean’s Celebrity Cruises in 2018 and 2019 and operate asMarella ExplorerandMarella Explorer 2. The final ship,Marella Voyager, was added to the brand in 2023 coming from Mein Schiff, and built for Celebrity Cruises.\nTUI’s executives highlighted the challenges the brand faced with older ships that are also smaller versus competitors. Carnival’s P&O Cruises is the UK’s largest brand and has added new, large cruise ships, while Saga Cruises, a UK niche brand built two new ships. Fred. Olsen upgraded its fleet with second-hand ships acquired from Carnival’s Holland America Cruises during the pandemic.\nMarella said given the aging of its fleet it was exploring “re-fleeting” and was in discussions to secure newbuilding slots. It noted that Europe’s cruise shipbuilders are all fully committed till 2030. Cruise ship construction is specialized due to the vast network of subcontractors and suppliers involved in the projects and the complexity of the hotel operations integrated into the vessel.\nTUI has been working to rebuild the profitability of the group but emphasizes the strength of the UK cruise market. The group said in its release that it would also “continue to explore partnership options.” Mein Schiff was launched as a joint venture with Royal Caribbean and in 2020 the group sold Hapag-Lloyd Cruises to the joint venture.\nFincantieri highlights the addition of another brand to its orderbook, while it is completing the second cruise ship for TUI, Mein Schiff Flow, which will deliver in 2026. The shipyards also have large orders from Carnival Corporation, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas, Crystal Cruises, and Viking, as well as small, luxury ships for Four Seasons.",

Officials for the Port of Antwerp-Bruges said the disruptions began on Sunday evening and were expected to last until Tuesday with it taking days to fully recover.\nThe European Transport Workers’ Federation announced it was standing in solidarity with the Belgium Trade Union Confederation which led the call for the 24-hour nationwide strike. The union cited planned cuts to pensions, reforms to the labor market, and cuts to the public service sector. The universal call across all the groups was to maintain pensions and fair working conditions.\n“Transport workers are particularly affected, facing drastic budget cuts, job insecurity, and the erosion of collective bargaining rights. At a time when Belgium should be investing in its workforce and public services, this government is taking the country in the wrong direction,” said the ETF in its statement of support.\nThe Port of Antwerp-Bruges which manages the country’s two busiest ports, Antwerp and Zeebrugge, reported “very strong obstacles for ships.” The delays and backlogs grew as the day progressed with the authority’s final update saying only about 10 ships had been able to enter and leave Antwerp all day on Monday. It said the backlog grew to about 50 ships. Three of Antwerp’s locks were closed.\n“The disruption will continue until tomorrow morning (Tuesday). Afterward, we will see how we can quickly and safely clear the backlog. This is expected to take one to two days,” the authority said in its update at 2015 Monday evening.\nZeebrugge reported there had been a complete blockage since 1100 saying it would continue until 0700 on Tuesday. No seagoing vessels entered or departed the port on Monday afternoon. Earlier it had reported that one ship had departed and two arrived, before the end of the day saying a backlog of 25 ships was waiting for the port to resume activity.\nThe problems were not limited to the seaports. Brussels Airport canceled all 244 outbound flights for Monday and said incoming traffic might also be impacted. Public services were reported to be at a standstill, including the post office and garbage services. Some schools also closed for the day and much of public transport around the country was disrupted.\nThe government which came to office in February has presented an austerity plan for the country.

The Tasnim News Agency citing officials from the Revolutionary Guard is saying a “naval operation” was conducted in the central Persian Gulf.

Most cyber analyses focus on the economic and commercial impact of cyber meddling, but this study is squarely focused on defense - specifically on defense against China, America's most sophisticated adversary in the cyber domain.\nIn its 2024 report, the U.S. intelligence community predicted that China could use \"aggressive cyber operations against U.S. critical infrastructure and military assets” and attempt to “interfere with the deployment of U.S. forces.\" China's hackers have also proven themselves capable of penetrating utilities, videocameras, routers and the deep infrastructure of American telecom companies - giving Beijing a birds-eye view of American logistics, including military logistics.\n\"The nation can no longer afford to waste time debating the immediacy of the threat. Washington must identify and resource solutions now,\" wrote Annie Fixler, RADM Mark Montgomery (USN, ret'd) and Rory lane for the Cybersecurity Solarium Commission (CSC 2.0).\nThe threats affect all modes of transport - rail, road, air and maritime. Sealift may be the most important link in the chain, as it carries 90 percent of the cargo when America goes to war overseas. It is also vulnerable, as U.S. sealift capacity is already strained, reliant on aging tonnage and uncertain mariner availability. \"The nation’s lack of excess sealift capacity means that the U.S. military’s ability to mobilize forces could be severely degraded by any cyber or physical incident,\" the panel warned.\nThe authors singled out known vulnerabilities in Chinese port equipment, including unexploited security vulnerabilities in cranes built by ZPMC; likely logistics spying activity in China's free-to-use LOGINK container tracking platform; and low performance of a Chinese-made cargo inspection device that is marketed for detecting nuclear materials.\nThe Biden administration gave the Coast Guard more authority to directly regulate port and maritime cybersecurity, and USCG captains of the port are following up with stakeholders. However, \"the Coast Guard has no funding specifically designated for work with the private sector to improve the cyber resiliency of America’s port infrastructure,\" the panel warned. It remains to be seen if the Trump administration will prioritize cyber vulnerabilities in its next budget.",

Today, it is home to a Chinese-operated resort complex, along with the ruins of U.S.-built Fort Wint.\nThe five Chinese suspects were posing as recreational fishermen and tourists, according to the NBI, and were accompanied by one Cambodian national and one Filipino guard. (Initial reports appear to have misidentified the Cambodian suspect as a sixth Chinese national.)\n\"We have identified this group as the one flying drones during the day and night under the guise of sending fishing bait out to sea,\" NBI cybercrime official Van Angluben said at a press conference. \"These drones are actually being used for surveillance . . . of the U.S. Asiatic [Indo-Pacific] fleet.\"\nThe NBI recovered photos and videos of Philippine and US ships from gadgets of suspected spies arrested in Subic.

The police also recovered a handwritten document marked in Chinese characters, which described the date, time and ID of vessels coming and going from Subic Bay.\nImmigration records show that the foreign nationals entered and exited the Philippines frequently, the agency said.\nThe Chinese suspects declined to comment, but the Filipino man who was arrested with them - identified as Melvin Aguillon - told media that he was not aware of the alleged spying activity. \"I'm just the driver,\" he told ANC. He was in possession of an illegal firearm at the time of his arrest, according to the NBI.\nThe Chinese resort operator's lease on the island is now under review, according to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA).",

The company reported it is buying three under-construction dual-fuel methanol containerships from Japanese leasing company Shoei Kisen Kaisha.\nThe three vessels are reported to already be on order with Imabari Shipbuilding. They are scheduled for delivery in 2028 and 2029 and each will have a capacity of 8,000 TEU. The report says they will be equipped with energy-efficient main engines to maintain flexibility for the future adoption of alternative fuels. It also plans to pursue digitalization and smart technologies.\nYang Ming, which is currently number 10 on Alphaliner’s sector ranking with a capacity of just over 700,000 TEU, has said it is committed to strengthening its core business. The group is part of the reworked Premier Alliance that launched in February 2025 along with HMM and Once Network Express (ONE). The new five-year alliance agreement calls for the expansion of services to make up for the loss of Hapag-Lloyd in the former The Alliance. Yang Ming has already announced its new 2025 Transpacific trade service and Transatlantic routes. It said it plans to strengthen its regional services to broaden its service portfolio.\nAs reported two weeks ago, the company's financial results for 2024 achieved consolidated revenues of $6.9 billion. It reported a new profit of nearly $2 billion, while still highlighting the challenges in 2024. It cited supply growth outpacing demand last year while expressing long-term confidence in the sector.\nThe fleet optimization plan calls for replacing its over 20-year-old vessels with between 5,500 and 6,500 TEU capacity. The group plans the addition of 13 new vessels, including up to six 8,000 TEU dual-fuel-ready vessels. It is also planning seven 15,000 TEU LNG dual-fuel vessels.\nNo timing was announced for the fleet optimization program but the company reports it is a key part of the business strategy.",

Norges Bank Investment Management will invest $1.5 billion for 49 percent stakes in the projects RWE is developing in Denmark and Germany.\nRWE has been dealing with activist shareholders who have been demanding the company take steps such as share buyback to generate more value for investors. The company during its year-end financial report said it would be exploring partners for more of its wind farm while also cutting €10 billion (US$10.8 billion) from its planned green technology investments.\nNorges expects to close on the transactions in the third quarter of 2025 acquiring stakes in the Nordsecluster in Germany and the Tho project in Denmark. RWE has also said it would seek a 50 percent partner for a project in the UK in 2026. The company reports work is progressing on the two projects in today’s agreement as well as a new wind farm in the UK and another for the Netherlands. RWE currently operates 19 offshore wind farms.\nThe projects in Germany and Denmark have the potential to provide more than 2.6 GW. Nordseecluster, located approximately 50 km (30 miles) north of the island of Juist in Germany, is being built in two phases, with Nordseecluster A with 660 MW scheduled for commissioning in 2027 and Nordseecluster B with 900 MW, scheduled for full commissioning in 2029. Thor wind farm is Denmark’s largest offshore wind farm to date. Located approximately 22 km (14 miles) off the west coast of Jutland, it will have a capacity of 1,080 MW, and full commissioning is planned for 2027.\nNorges is reported to be the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund driven by the country’s oil and gas sector.

Without slowing or maneuvering,Solongrammed the port side of the anchored product tankerStena Immaculate, penetrating two tanks.\nStena Immaculatethird mate Jeffrey Griffin told SIU that he was working out on deck at the time of the accident.\n“All I could see was something big and blue heading toward us. I immediately knew, it’s not going to miss us,\" Griffin said. \"I was front and center when it allided between the seven port and six port cargo tanks. There was a great big loud crunching noise. That was followed by a whole lot of fire.\"\nAt first, the crew responded with shock and amazement. Those inside the deckhouse and belowdecks felt the vibration and knew something was wrong.\n\"It wasn't a huge jolt. I remember looking through the fog and . . . I could faintly see the white outline of the house of the other ship. And then that first fireball happened,\" recalled OS Benjamin Brown.\nThe crew ran out hoses and began to lay down foam to suppress the flames on deck. Two officers remained forward on the bow, and the firefighting efforts were successful enough that they could slip past and get back to the deckhouse.\nAfter half an hour of battling the fire, the master instructed the crew to abandon ship. \"I won't say we were close to putting out the fire, but we were doing well,\" Griffin said. \"I was about to do a muster when we heard the words, forget the muster, abandon ship.\nThe crew mustered at the lifeboat, and after the second mate confirmed all were aboard, they gravity-launched into the water and motored off. The bosun noted that there was burning fuel on the water surface during their escape. Despite fumes from the fire and heavy smoke, they were unharmed, and were quickly rescued by nearby good Samaritan vessels.\nGriffin said that he was already prepared to ship out again. \"I’m a little shaken but I’m ready to go back to work. The fire – it happened. The abandon ship – it happened. We trained for it, we prepared for it, and everybody survived, so we obviously are doing something right,\" he told SIU.\nStena Immaculate'scargo will be pumped off for safety, and the ship will be towed to Newcastle for a port of refuge. One crewmember of the boxshipSolongis missing and presumed dead; the master of theSolonghas been arrested on negligent manslaughter charges, and Stena and operator Crowley have sued the Solong's owner for damages.\nThe owner, a subsidiary of Ernst Russ, is setting up a claims fund in the UK as proceedings begin.

    "input": "\nSmart shipowners are getting prepared to pass any extra U.S. fees for Chinese ships onwards to their charterers, insulating the owner from the impact of millions of dollars in extra regulatory cost per port call. Special new charter party clauses will ensure that U.S. exporters and importers - not shipowners - will bear the extra near-term cost, says Genco CEO John Wobensmith.\nGenco is the largest U.S.-headquartered bulker operator, and has a substantial number of Chinese-built vessels in its fleet. As such, it is exposed to the proposed port fees on Chinese tonnage, written by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). If the fee structure is adopted as written, Chinese-built ships - and any global operators who use Chinese-built ships elsewhere - would have to pay millions of dollars for every port call in the United States. Exporters would also be required to ship an increasing percentage of their goods on U.S.-flagged tonnage, and eventually on scarce U.S.-built tonnage, raising costs for export shipments and creating new employment options for U.S. mariners.\nMultiple shipowners have described deep changes to their business if the fees go into effect. U.S.-based ro/ro liner ACL says that it will go out of business in the United States, and multiple ocean carriers have said that they will narrow their port calls down to a few major gateways to minimize fees. Genco's Wobensmith told Bloomberg that he shares USTR's goal of strengthening American shipping, but in the near term, his firm has two options: exit the U.S. market and focus on the rest of the world, which accounts for 90 percent of its business; or pass the extra U.S. costs on to the end user.\nIt's already using the latter strategy. To ensure that it does not get caught bearing unexpected new costs, Genco's charter parties now include clauses that require the charterer to pay for any new U.S. port charges, whatever they happen to be.\nIn reality, these two strategies (leave or pass on charges) are closely linked. The extra expense of the port fees will make some ag commodities \"uncompetive\" compared to foreign producers, Wobensmith said, as American farming interests have previously warned. Soy exports \"will come almost to a grinding halt,\" he said. For these cargoes, the extra pass-on charges may end the market, requiring shipowners with Chinese tonnage to leave.\nTop image courtesyBernard Spragg / public domain",

They received reports of six incidents between March 28 and 30 prompting the continued caution based on the increase in activity so far in 2025.\nAs with the incidents earlier this year, the perpetrators seem more brazen in their efforts but during the last incidents there was no direct interaction and none of the crewmembers were attacked. Other incidents in 2025 have included crewmembers being assaulted and tied up, but as with the prior incidents in several of the cases in the past few days, the boarders appeared to be armed.\nThree vessels were boarded in a period of one and a half hours on March 30, between 0125 and 0255 all in the Phillip Channel in the eastbound lane in the Singapore Strait. This area has seen a concentration of piracy activity in 2025.\nAmong the ships boarded was the containershipKota Halus(18,872 dwt with a capacity of 1,080 TEU) which is operating for Pacific International Line (PIL). Three perpetrators were seen aboard the vessel, but they jumped overboard into a small boat when discovered. A search showed that they had entered an air conditioning room and a portable welding machine was missing.\nIn the other two incidents on March 30, bulkers were boarded,Junior(92,995 dwt) andAndreas Petrakis(76,000 dwt), in each case by a single perpetrator. In both cases, the person fled when discovered and the ships reported nothing was stolen.\nFour perpetrators were sighted aboard theWan Hai 327(37,160 dwt) containership on March 29. They were moving between a small boat and the stern of the ship but also fled. Nothing was stolen. About an hour earlier that same day, five perpetrators were seen aboard a VLCC tanker,Agneta Pallas III(319,000 dwt). They also fled without taking anything from the ship.\nThe containership Selatan Damai (8,150 dwt with a capacity of 28 TEU) was boarded on March 28. The vessel, which also operates for PIL, reported four individuals were sighted going to the engine room. They escaped from the ship but the crew said that some engine spares were stolen.\n\n\n\nReCAAP emphasizes that there have now been 35 incidents reported in 2025 in the area around the Straits of Malacca and Singapore versus just 11 in 2024. A total of 18 incidents were in March, while 12 took place in February.\nShips are being told to intensify vigilance and maintain a sharp lookout while transiting the area.

He has repeatedly spoken against the industry citing assertions that it was not economically viable. He ordered the Department of the Interior to review the process and ordered a halt to future permitting during the review. This came after the Biden administration completed the review of several projects late in 2024 and early 2025.\nMassachusetts officials confirmed that negotiations with both Avangrid’s New England Wind 1 and SouthCoast Wind which is being developed by a partnership between EDP Renewables and ENGIE had not yet completed their power purchase agreements. The deadline was March 31, but for the third time they have failed to complete the deals, twice since Trump returned to the presidency. The companies have set a new deadline of June 30 with a target for late August to present the deals to Massachusetts.\nBoth projects are working to set new agreements after the developers in 2023 canceled prior purchase agreements due to changing costs. The joint venture OceanWinds paid a fine of $60 million while Avangrid paid $42 million to terminate the power purchase agreements.\nMedia reports indicate the companies are seeking to build protections into the new agreements against potential changes in policy from the Trump administration. The media is writing that state officials have said Trump’s opposition is “making it difficult” to complete the power purchase agreements. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved the construction plan for New England 1 in July 2024 and SouthCoast in January 2025. Massachusetts reselected both projects in September 2024 for power agreements.\nAdditional uncertainty came as the town of Nantucket filed an appeal against BOEM’s approval for SouthCoast. They filed a suit in U.S. District Court claiming that the review did not consider the full impact and how the project would hurt the town’s tourism industry. Additionally, a local activist group is challenging the Environmental Protection Agency calling for a reassessment of permits for New England Wind 1 as well as other projects.\nThe New Jersey Board of Public Utilities last week also withdrew consideration for Attentive Wind’s project planned for 42 miles off the central New Jersey coast. The Press of Atlantic City newspaper is reporting the development. The indication is that developer Attentive Wind is seeking a one-year extension for a $37.3 million payment as part of the state approval process.\nMaine’s Public Utilities Commission last week also reported that it was suspending negotiations with Mitsubishi which is working on the Pine Tree Offshore Wind project. It is part of a research project to develop a floating offshore wind array for the Gulf of Maine. The commission wrote in its order that Mitsubishi requested the pause citing “recent shifts in the energy landscape that have in particular caused uncertainty in the offshore wind industry.”\nAnxiety over the status of the U.S. industry was further increased when in March a court permitted the EPA to withdraw a permit for the Atlantic Shores project in New Jersey.  The permit related to the installation of the offshore wind farm and the move reversed actions by the Biden administration to clear the project for construction.\nSeveral other U.S. projects that were already underway are continuing despite the uncertainties created by the Trump administration.",

    "input": "Norway marked a milestone in its efforts to be a leader in green shipping with the introduction of the first of two vessels that will be powered with bio-methanol. The containerships which are operating in a partnership between North Sea Container Line and MPC Container Ships will expand Norway’s trade with Europe while also lowering emissions.\nNCL Vestlandis the first of the two vessels and today, April 1, they celebrated the naming and entry into service of the ship, with her sister shipNCL Nordlandto follow. The ships wereorderedin 2023 under a program in part sponsored by the Norwegian government to advance green shipping. The project received NOK 13.7 million (US$1.3 million) in funding from Enova SF, the state enterprise owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, and NOK 60 million (US$5.7 million) from the NOx fund (Næringslivets NOx-fond), the Norwegian business sector’s fund to reduce emissions.\nThe ships were built by China’s Taizhou Sanfu Ship Engineering and are fitted with dual-fuel engines capable of operating on conventional fuel or green methanol. The newbuilds will reduce NCL’s overall CO2 emissions by 50 percent, compared to the existing NCL fleet, when operating on diesel. In 2025, NCL will operate the vessels with a 5 percent blend of bio-methanol and the strategy is to gradually increase the bio-methanol going forward. NCL has signed an agreement with Equinor for the sourcing of the methanol and the vessels will be bunkering in Norway.\nThe hull, which is 149 meters (489 feet) in length, along with the propellers, and onboard systems are designed for maximum energy efficiency. The ships are each equipped with a 250 kWh battery pack and the capability to use shore power. Each ship has a capacity of 1,300 TEU. They feature an \"Open Top\" design which the companies highlight minimizes the need for crew on deck, further enhancing safety. The electric cranes on deck are designed to enhance efficiency when in port, independent of onshore infrastructure providing increased flexibility in the ports they can access.\nThe plan calls for three older vessels to be replaced by the two new ships, each of which has a 40 percent greater container capacity compared to the ships currently operating the feeder service. As such, NCL reports that the vessels will achieve a 63 percent reduction in energy capacity per TEU per nautical mile.\nThe ships are operating under a 15-year chart to NCL and have long-term contracts for transportation from Norway including with Elkem, a provider of silicon-based materials. With stops at key industry hubs in Norway, Elkem says they will enable larger weekly shipments of its silicon products to European customers in sectors such as automotive manufacturing, construction, renewable energy, and the defense industry, and enable growth and jobs along the Norwegian coast.\n“These state-of-the-art vessels will play a significant role in transporting Norwegian goods and strategic silicon metals and materials to the continent, cementing Norway’s position as an important and reliable supplier of critical inputs for European industries,” said Morten Viga, CFO of Elkem.\nThe vessel will operate between Stokmarknes and Rotterdam, Bremerhaven, calling at Salten, Mo i Rana, Orkanger, Averøy, Ålesund, Svelgen, Bergen, Haugesund, and Tananger. It will supply Europe with strategically important minerals, fish food, and other commodities via the ports of Bremerhaven and Rotterdam.\nNCL highlights this is the first of three zero-emission capable vessels it will be introducing. In addition to the two methanol-fueled feeders, NCL will operate the world’sfirst ammonia-powered container vesselin a project with ammonia-producer Yara International and its subsidiary Yara Clean Energy and the support of the Norwegian Government through its Enova investment fund. The ammonia-powered feeder project was announced in 2023 with a target of starting operations in 2026.",

While the vessel has done nothing considered improper, it is drawing wide attention in the Australian media which prompted Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to tell reporters, “I would prefer that it wasn’t there.”\nThe Tan Suo Yi Haodeparted Wellington, New Zealand on March 23 and its AIS signal shows it is bound for Sanya, China where it is due on April 30. However, instead of taking a northern course, the vessel transited the Tasman Sea, between New Zealand and Australia, crossed the Bass Strait, and is now traveling along the southern coast of Australia.  It has not requested a port stop in Australia.\nThe media was quick to highlight that it is the same route that Chinese warships took last month after conducting live-fire exercises that also raised concern in Australia. Concerns over the vessel’s purpose were further increased when China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun largely declined to respond to a question when asked during his regular briefing for the media.\n“I would like to emphasize that China has always carried out normal maritime activities in relevant waters in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I hope the Australian side will view it correctly and not be suspicious or make unwarranted speculations,” said Guo. He directed the question to the relevant authorities.\nThe vessel operates as one of three ships for China’s Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering (IDSSE) within the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It was built in 1984 as an offshore supply vessel and converted between 2014 to 2016 to its role as a research ship. China reports the vessel, which is 5,000 gross tons, has 11 research labs and supports two submersibles, one capable of nearly 15,000 feet (4,500 meters) and the other going to 32,800 feet (10,000 meters).\nIn 2016, it carried out China's first 10,000-meter and deepest exploration along the Mariana Trench. It again set a depth record on the Mariana Trench in 2020 of 10,900 meters.\nAlbanese told reporters that they were aware of the vessel’s presence. He said he was confident in the Australian Defense Force which was tracking the ship’s movements. The media reports note the presence of undersea cables in the area where the vessel is sailing as well as other critical infrastructure in the region.\n“It’s been in New Zealand on a joint research operation and this isn’t the first time that a similar vessel has been around the Australian coast. It occurred in 2020, just to give one example. Australia, as you would expect, is monitoring this,” Albanese said in response to reporter’s questions on Monday.",

The company last year agreed to take over the shipping business from ENEOS and reports it completed the acquisition on schedule, today April 1, for an estimated cost of just over $500 million.\nIt was a two-stage transaction that first saw ENEOS, a Japanese petroleum company, transfer its LPG carriers, chemical and product tankers, and cargo ships into a newly formed subsidiary ENEOS Ocean. That represented the bulk of its shipping operations but excluded the company’s 12 crude oil tankers which it retains. In the second stage of the transaction, NYK acquired 80 percent ownership of ENEOS Ocean which was rebranded today as NYK Energy Ocean (NEO). ENEOS retains 20 percent ownership.\nWhen the agreement was announced in July 2024, ENEOS cited the “increasing burden of investment driven by the rising cost of vessels, complicated by global environmental regulations.” It highlighted the focus on reducing CO2 emissions as well as the need for a digital transformation to improve both safety and operational efficiency.\n“We are convinced that conducting business under a new owner better equipped to devise a growth strategy in the global shipping sector will be optimal,” ENEOS said explaining the reasoning for the sale. NYK has cited its pursuit of growth including a strategy focusing on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance). In its energy transportation business, NYK Group reports it will be strengthening its LNG/LPG carrier business as a growth business and is aiming to fulfill its responsibility for stable energy transportation as an infrastructure company.\nNEO now operates 47 vessels, including 18 LPG carriers, 18 chemical and product tankers, and 11 cargo ships, all taken over from ENEOS Ocean. Together with the 16 LPG carriers currently operated by NYK, the NYK Group has become one of the world's largest operators of LPG carriers.\nThe NYK Group is also expanding its operations in LNG carriers. It is part of the expansion with QatarEnergy with a contract for five 174,000 cbm LNG carriers building at China’s Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding with deliveries starting in 2025. The company also struck a new deal with JERA and in December 2024 took delivery on a new LNG carrier it is operating for a subsidiary of Kyushu Electric Power Co.\nIn its last annual report (March 2024), NYK reported it was operating nearly 200 vessels owned or chartered in its energy group.

It is the first study of its kind, and if representative of the condition of the population at large, the results suggest serious potential effects on reproduction and vitality for the iconic species.\nThe team obtained the remains of ten loggerheads that were caught up as bycatch in fishing nets in the Mediterranean. Musculature and vital organs in both male and female examples contained high levels of microplastics, including the liver, kidney and heart. 98.8 percent of all tested samples contained foreign particles, and 70 percent contained microplastics.\nThe ultra-tiny particles measured about 15 microns, and researchers were surprised to find so many of these solid contaminants migrating from the turtles' gut into all kinds of soft tissue.  The majority of particles came from the kinds of plastic used to make synthetic clothing and packaging, notably plastic bags, which the turtles often mistake for jellyfish and consume by accident. Plastics can stay in a turtle's gut from 40-120 days, depending on the turtle's activity level and whether there are blockages caused by the plastic. The turtles may also have picked up microplastics by rooting in contaminated bottom sediment, inhaling sea air containing plastic fibers, or consuming prey that already contained contaminants.\nReproductive organs contained an average of 15 particles per gram, ranging as high as 25. Heart tissue contained up to seven particles per gram.\n\"Exposure to MPs in reproductive organs can cause reproductive toxicity, and be vectors for contaminants and additives that can disrupt the endocrine system (EDCs), such as bisphenol A and PCBs and phthalates,\" the researchers noted. \"Microplastics accumulation can lead to a suite of sublethal physiological impacts that are likely to be far less conspicuous, and harder to detect at both the individual and population level.\"",

Earlier this year they announced plans to rebrand away from Resorts World Cruises back to the traditional brand names as part of the future growth strategy for the company.\nStar Cruises was launched 30 years ago and became known as one of the pioneers of modern cruising in Asia. The brand went on to build cruise ships at Meyer Werft in Germany and in 2000 acquired the faltering Norwegian Cruise Line which had been one of the pioneers in North America. After rehabilitating Norwegian including the introduction of “freestyle cruising” (cruising without schedules or assigned dining arrangements) the company also launched Dream Cruises in Asia as a premium brand.\nThe 2022 bankruptcy of the German shipyard owned by the company, MV Werften, caused the collapse of the parent company and its cruise lines. The ships were sold but Genting was able to reestablish the business as Resorts World Cruises with two of its former ships. Last year, the company acquired the 77,400 gross tons built in 1997 by Fincantieri and operates as P&O Cruises Australia’sPacific Explorer.\nRenamedStar Voyagerand having completed a $50 million refit, the cruise ship returned to service on March 26 in Singapore and March 29 in Indonesia. The ship will be sailing a circuit between Singapore, Jakarta, Melaka, and Ho Chi Minh City officially relaunching the brand as StarCruises. She is joined by the rechristenedStar Navigator(77,300 gross tons), introduced in 1999 asSuperStar Virgo. She resumed sailing in 2023 asResorts World Oneand operates seasonally from Singapore and Taiwan.\n“We are thrilled and honored to return to our roots with the launch of the revitalized StarCruises and Dream Cruises brands, offering an enhanced cruising experience,\" said Michael Goh, President of StarCruises and Dream Cruises. “To celebrate this milestone, we are also excited to introduce theStar Voyager, as she embarks on her maiden voyage from Singapore, exploring the wonders of Southeast Asia.”\nStarCruises will be positioned as an affordable cruise brand with the two ships. The group says its focus will be on ships with accommodations for approximately 2,000 passengers.\nDream Cruises was also restarted as the premium brand within the group. It will continue to operate theGenting Dream(150,600 gross tons). The ship was built for the company by Meyer Werft and entered service in 2016. It sails year-round from Singapore.",

    "input": "Denmark's A.P. Moller Holding (APMH), an investment company and the parent company of the A.P. Moller Group, believes that tug and towing company Svitzer has failed to gain a proper valuation from the investment community. A year after the company was spun off from Maersk, the parent company now wants to take Svitzer private in a deal valued at about 9 billion kroner ($1.3 billion).\nSvitzer, which had been part of A.P. Moller-Maersk for 45 years, demerged from the shipping giant last year in a move that was described as a “natural next chapter” for the towage company’s growth journey. Listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, APMH is currently the largest shareholder in Svitzer with a 47 percent stake and it is offering a 31.3 percent premium compared to the three-month volume-weighted average price for the remaining shares, or DKK 285 (approximately $41.25) per share.\nAPMH says that the listing has done little to create the desired platform for growth that is essential for maintaining Svitzer’s market position in a competitive and fragmented industry undergoing consolidation. If the status quo is maintained, it says this could have detrimental effects in terms of limiting Svitzer’s ability to pursue opportunities in the market.\n“Since Svitzer was listed, the company has consistently delivered results above expectations. However, we have not seen this reflected in the valuation of the share, which means that the listing has not offered a foundation from which Svitzer can grow,” said Martin Larsen, APMH's chief finance officer.\nHe added that Svitzer would be better supported through private ownership and that, with the financial support of APMH, the company would be better positioned to strengthen its market position and capitalize on the opportunities in the market.\nSvitzer’s independent directors agreed announcing they supported the cash offer after carefully considering the offer and alternative options for the shareholders. They highlighted the offer is a 42.5 percent premium compared to the opening price on the first day of trading after the spin-off. APMH reports it has already secured support for the offer from other shareholders, meaning it now has control of 61 percent of Svitzer’s share capital. APMH requires approval from 90 percent of Svitzer’s shareholders to complete the transaction and delist Svitzer. They are targeting the beginning of May to complete the transaction.\n“We aim to secure Svitzer's market position and growth and are offering an attractive price above the highest historical closing price and well above current trading, reflecting Svitzer’s strong performance,” noted Larsen.\nUpon completion of the deal, Svitzer will remain an independent firm with its current management and strategy. Svitzer recorded another solid year in its financial performance last year. Revenues rose by 8.9 percent to 6.3 billion kroner ($911 million) from 5.7 billion kroner ($824.2 million) in 2023. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased to 1.8 billion kroner ($260.3 million) from 1.6 billion kroner ($231.4 million).\nSvitzer reported today that during the first two months of 2025, its revenues were up 2.6 percent while EBITDA earnings declined by approximately 1 percent. The financial performance it reported was driven mainly by positive development in the Americas operating segment, while harbor towage overall decreased by 4.8 percent. In March, Svitzer reported that it expects revenues in 2025 to grow by around 1-5 percent and that EBITDA earnings would grow by around 0-7 percent compared to 2024. Svitzer was founded in 1833 and serves approximately 2,000 customers in more than 140 ports and 40 terminals across 37 countries and said it expects to invest up to $190 million CAPEX in 2025.",

The vessel was headed for Korea and would soon be berthing at the port of Okgye, south of Gangneung on the peninsula's east coast.\nA force of 90 personnel met the vessel at the pier to carry out a search.

    "input": "Stena Line, one of Europe's leading ferry companies and a pioneer with advanced designs, presented its latest thinking for Stena Futuro, a RoRo that would reduce energy usage by 20 percent or more. The company’s goal is an overall 30 percent reduction in its CO2 emissions by 2030.\n“The mission is to develop the most efficient and competitive vessel possible for a specific cargo capacity, using today’s available technology. The goal is for the vessel to have the lowest fuel consumption on the market,” says Nicolas Bathfield, Project Manager at Stena Teknik, who has been involved in developing the concept.\nStena Futuro would be a 240-meter (787-foot) long RoRo vessel intended for transporting semi-trailers and cars. Stena Teknik, a resource within the group for all its business units, is exploring the full range of technologies to advance the efficiency of this next-generation vessel. The group is focused on newbuilds as well as the energy and digital transformation mostly in the maritime sectors.\n\n\n\nStena Line's latest concept for the new generation of vessels uses a low and streamlined design to reach its ambitions. The hull and superstructure have been optimized to achieve the most efficient use of cargo space possible. At the same time, low weight and optimized hydro- and aerodynamics are central to achieving low fuel consumption. The hull of Stena Futuro would also be equipped with an air lubrication system.\nThe concept for Stena Futuro also includes four 40-meter (131-foot) tall wing sails, which can be retracted when needed — for example, when passing under a bridge. Recently, Stena’s developers, together with the Swedish research institute RISE, have conducted tests and simulations of the sails’ usage to document both energy savings and how the sails affect the ship’s maneuverability and safety.\n\n\n\n“The tests showed that Stena Futuro’s sails could potentially result in as much as 15 percent fuel savings. We also confirmed that the vessel meets all requirements for stability and maneuverability in scenarios such as sudden wind shifts or quick course changes,” says Bathfield.\nThe vessel would also have hybrid propulsion, batteries, and engines with low fuel consumption that can run on several different fuels. The battery system makes it ready to partly operate the vessel on electricity alone, for example, when entering and leaving ports. Solar panels will also contribute to the ship’s electricity needs. A waste heat recovery system will make it possible to reuse the hot exhaust gases from the ship’s engines to meet other onboard heating needs as well as supporting electric power generation.\nStena says the ship design will play a vital part in its future tonnage planning in the coming years. Currently, however, there is no finalized plan for the production of Stena Futuro.",

He was 115 days into his latest record-setting adventure when the support team advised that based on damages and equipment malfunctions on the rowboat, he needed to abandon the attempt to cross the Indian Ocean to Australia.\nKobyakov, who holds previous records including crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat in 46 days and the best 24-hour distance (110 miles), had set out from Patagonia in South America on December 5. He covered approximately 11,000 km (6,835 miles) crossing the South Atlantic in 68 days. He was south of Madagascar and nearing Reunion Island, 5,000 km (3,100 miles) from Australia with the team saying it would have conservatively taken two more months to complete the trip. They also emphasized that he would have reached Australia in winter adding to the difficulties of the journey. At 115 days it was not his longest trip, which is reported at 154 days in the Pacific.\nThe 73-year-old was reluctant as he had never before abandoned one of his boats. Consulting with his support team he however confirmed the weather conditions had proved extreme with cold and waves up to 40 feet resulting in the vessel experiencing multiple capsizes. His autopilot unit had stopped working, the four onboard wind indicators had failed, and his main desalination unit had failed leaving him on a backup unit.\n\n\nKonyukhov in February 2025 as he was crossing the South Atlantic to Africa\n\nWorking with the National Sea Rescue Institute of South Africa, the team determined the Chinese-owned bulkerOre Hong Kongwas 400 miles away from his position and agreed to undertake the rescue. When the vessel approached his position from the AIS signal, they were able to establish radio contact with Kobyakov.\nThe challenge remained to get him aboard the massive bulk carrier. They maneuvered the vessel close and tried a net. Then they fired a towline and Kobyakov was able to tie it to his rowboat. They pulled his boat under the stern of the dry cargo carrier and dropped a storm ladder meaning he had to climb at least 22 meters (72 feet) in his weather suit and boots. The crew also dropped lines to pull his personal effects and radio equipment on the vessel.\n\n\nKonyukhov was rescued by Ore Hong Kong (Telegram posting)\n\nKonyukhov reported it was a challenging climb even for a man who twice surmounted Mt. Everest. He got the rhythm and made it safely aboard. He was taken to the infirmary for the first days and now is in a cabin on the vessel. The bulker was sailing from Brazil to China and now Kobyakov has to wait till April 20 till the vessel reaches the port of Qingdao, China. He reports he is being well treated, getting his first nights in a bed with sheets, but the Asian food is spicy.\nHe was forced to abandon his rowboat. They sealed the vessel’s hatches and left the AIS transmitter going. The support team reports they are tracking the vessel as it drifts eastward toward Australia.",

In 2022, as relations between the U.S. and China grew increasingly strained, CNOOC reportedly floated plans to extricate itself from Canada, Britain and the United States, according to Reuters.\nThe Chinese oil company remains an important U.S. partner abroad: it holds a 25 percent stake in Exxon's Stabroek Block development off Guyana, a keystone of Exxon's future development.",

The bomb had two intact detonators.\nFor safety, the dredge was moved to the nearby Koblenz Moselle lock. The bomb can't be safely removed, according to the Rhineland Palatinate EOD squad, so it will have to be defused on board the ship.\nSince this is an inherently dangerous operation, the dredger will be moved to a less populated area on the Moselle, on the outskirts of town. 1,000 residents will be evacuated, including staff and students at an elementary school and a daycare. The city of Koblenz said in a statement that it would set up alternate accommodations for those affected by the evacuation order. The defusing is scheduled for Friday, and the area will be cleared out by 0830.\nIt is the second time that workers have found a large WWII bomb at the Pfaffendorf Bridge construction site. The last one - a 250-kilo U.S. Air Force bomb - was discovered in September, and was relocated to a secure area for a controlled detonation.\nDuring the Second World War, Koblenz was the home of the command post of German Army Group B. Like many German cities, its downtown core was heavily bombed by the U.S. Air Force and Royal Air Force in the latter years of the war.\nBombing damage in downtown Koblenz, 1944.

Therefore, with the naval plan, we are initiating several urgent acquisitions that address specific challenges and threats that we face now and in the coming years,\" said Minister of Defense Troels Lund Poulsen.\nThe \"urgent\" track includes acquirting drones, unmanned units and equipment for subsea infrastructure monitoring. The risk of covert attacks on the seabed is real: NATO nations in the Baltic have experienced repeated subsea cable damage from merchant vessel anchor-dragging, some of which is believed to be deliberate. In addition, unidentified suspects blew up three of the four Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic in 2022, an unprecedented maritime security breach.\nThe order list includes four multipurpose ships that can be used for maritime surveillance, pollution response and mine laying. Denmark's existing pollution-prevention vessels are nearing end of life, and \"it is common sense that the [replacement] vessels can assist with naval military tasks such as maritime surveillance, monitoring of critical underwater infrastructure and mine laying in light of the security policy situation,\" said Minister of Public Security Torsten Schack Pedersen.\nThe Danish Navy's Home Guard will also get 21 new vessels for patrol duties. Down the road, the newbuild program includes options for buying a new class of frigates and vessels for open-ocean operation in the Arctic and the North Atlantic.\nGiven recent tensions over Danish-controlled Greenland, U.S. weapons systems appear unlikely to make the naval procurement list. The chairman of Denmark's parliamentary defense committee said last month that he regretted buying $3 billion worth of American-made F-35 fighters, because the U.S. could potentially shut off the parts supply chain for leverage.\n\"Buying American weapons is a security risk that we cannot run. We will make enormous investments in air defense, fighter jets, artillery, and other weapons in the coming years, and we must avoid American weapons if at all possible,\" said Rasmus Jarlov of the Conservative People's Party.",

    "input": "\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced sweeping double-digit tariffs on imports from all countries, starting at a minimum threshold of 10 percent.\nThe administration released a table of rates that it has calculated for 50 different foreign nations' tariffs on American goods, including the equivalent impact of non-tariff trade barriers. In a press conference Wednesday, Trump said that the U.S. would impose a tariff equal to half of each nation's rate on U.S. goods, as a \"kind\" discounted reciprocal charge.\nMost of the nations facing the steepest U.S. tariff hikes are developing countries in the Indo-Pacific, including Cambodia (49 percent), Laos, Madagascar, Vietnam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand (36 percent). Vietnam and Thailand have relevance for American industry, as they have become hubs for Chinesemanufacturerslooking to source inexpensive labor and evade American tariffs.\nChina is the most important trade partner on the list, and will be subject to a rate of 34 percent, higher than many analysts predicted. The new tariff stacks on top of a previously-declared 20 percent rate on Chinese goods, so it will bump the net rate on China's exports to a total of 54 percent.\nTaiwan - which supplies most of the advanced semiconductors used in the U.S. market - will be subject to a rate of 32 percent. European goods will be subject to a flat 20 percent rate for all member states, from Hungary to Germany.\nLIBERATION DAY RECIPROCAL TARIFFS ????????pic.twitter.com/ODckbUWKvO\nCanada and Mexico will be treated separately from the rest of the global list, and are still subject to previously-announced 25 percent tariffs, according to the Wall Street Journal. Likewise, Russia, Cuba, Belarus and North Korea are not covered; a White House spokesperson told Axios that they were left off because they already face significant sanctions and barriers to U.S. trade.\nSome commodities will be treated differently. The new country-by-country tariff schedule does not apply to copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, bullion, and \"energy and other certain minerals.\" The semiconductor exclusion will be of particular relief for Taiwan and for U.S. tech companies.\nA separate new tariff of 25 percent on all foreign-built autos takes effect immediately, with repercussions for ro/ro carriers. The administration's 25 percent tariff on foreign steel and aluminum also remains in effect.\nThe new tariffs take full effect on April 9, giving time for bilateral talks with affected nations. \"The silver lining for investors could be that this is only a starting point for negotiations with other countries and ultimately tariff rates will come down across the board,\" Northlight Asset Management chief investment officer Chris Zaccarelli told the Wall Street Journal.\nSome anomalies on the initial public list have attracted attention. Lesotho, a small landlocked nation surrounded by South Africa, was hit with the highest U.S. tariff rate on the schedule, 50 percent. France's island territories of Reunion, Saint Pierre and Miquelon received elevated tariffs of 37 percent and 50 percent, respectively. The list released by the White House also imposed a 10 percent tariff on the Heard and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian territory in Antarctic waters. The formallistattached to the executive order is shorter, and it omits these entries.",

Commissioned in 1976, the USCG needs to keep her operation until at least 2030 when the much-delayed next-generation heavy icebreaker is anticipated to be delivered.\nPolar Stardeparted Seattle bound for Antarctica on November 22, 2024. She traveled over 25,000 miles through the North Pacific, South Pacific, and Southern Oceans returning to San Francisco on March 30. It was a 128-day deployment to Antarctica in support of Operation Deep Freeze (ODF) 2025, the annual joint military service mission to resupply and maintain the United States Antarctic Stations.\nThe vessel provides heavy icebreaking capabilities to facilitate sealift, seaport access, bulk fuel supply, and cargo handling for two of three permanent U.S. research stations in Antarctica, with NSF McMurdo Station being the largest. The cutter’s icebreaking capabilities enable the safe delivery of critical supplies to sustain year-round operations and support international partnerships in the harsh Antarctic environment.\nIn Antarctica, this year the cutter encountered 14 miles of fast ice up to six feet thick. At a length of 399 feet,Polar Staris 13,500 tons and has six diesel and three gas turbine engines producing up to 75,000 hp. This gives her the capability of breaking through ice up to 21 feet (6.4 meters) thick and can steam continuously through 6 feet (1.8 meters) of ice at 3 knots.\n\n\nThe only USCG heavy icebreaker, 49-year-old Polar Star will start the final phase of her life extension program (USCG)\n\nDuring this year’s deployment,Polar Starcreated a navigable route and cleared Winter Quarters Bay for two cargo vessels and HMNZSAotearoato reach NSF McMurdo Station. While operating in McMurdo Sound,Polar Star, andAotearoaconducted an at-sea crew exchange to build a shared understanding of each vessel’s unique capabilities in the polar regions.\nAt the conclusion of vessel operations at McMurdo Station, the cutter departed the Antarctic region on March 3 after 60 days.Polar Starmade two logistical stops in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Sydney en route to Antarctica. On its journey back to the United States,Polar Starmoored in French Polynesia for a community relations stopover.\n“But our work isn’t done,\" said Capt. Jeff Rasnake,Polar Star’s commanding officer. “As we wrap up ODF 25, we must quickly transition to the first phase of ODF 26 – heavy depot maintenance. There’s no time to waste as we work to ensurePolar Staris ready to roll into her 50th year of service.”\nPolar Starwill enter the final phase of its five-year Service Life Extension Project which is being conducted at Mare Island Dry Dock in Vallejo, California. It calls for recapitalizing targeted systems, including the cutter’s propulsion, communication, machinery control, and auxiliary systems, and conducting significant maintenance to extend the cutter’s service life. Each phase of the life extension has been coordinated so that operational commitments, like Operation Deep Freeze missions in Antarctica, would still be met.\nAccording to the Coast Guard, “Completing SLEP will significantly mitigate the risk of lost operational days due to unplanned maintenance or system failures by replacing obsolete, unsupportable, or maintenance-intensive equipment.”\nNext year’s Operation Deep Freeze will bePolar Star’s 29th and will coincide with 50th anniversary of her commissioning.",

    "input": "As part of the “Zero Emission Ships Project” sponsored by The Nippon Foundation, Japan last week launched its first hydrogen dual-fuel tug. The vessel is pioneering using a high-power internal combustion engine with the industry seeking to develop expertise in the emerging sector.\nThe new tug was launched by Tsuneishi Shipbuilding on March 28 and is the first vessel in Japan to be equipped with a high-power output hydrogen dual-fuel internal combustion engine. It also has a high-pressure hydrogen gas storage system with a large capacity. With facilities to store approximately 250kg of high-pressure hydrogen gas, Tsuneishi says it will be possible to maintain the same operational performance as when using conventional fuel while also making use of hydrogen fuel. In the unlikely event of failure of the hydrogen fuel system, the vessel can operate with only traditional marine fuels, thus ensuring the same level of safety as conventional vessels.\n“We have successfully launched our first hydrogen-fuelled tugboat. We will utilize the know-how and design processes we have developed in the construction of hydrogen-fuelled tugboats, which require high power, in the construction of further new fuel vessels,” said Nishijima Takanori, General Manager of the Design Division and Managing Executive Officer of Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co.\n\n\nJapan's first hydrogen dual-fuel tug with an internal combustion engine (Tsuneishi Shipbuilding)\n\nThe shipbuilding notes that one of the challenges for tugboats is the need to be highly maneuverable and have high engine output to assist in berthing and opera operations of large vessels. This tugboat is installed with twin 12-cylinder hydrogen-blended engines (4,400 horsepower class), which will give it the needed capabilities. The vessel will be less than 300 gross tons with a length of 38 meters (125 feet).\nThe plan calls for operating with hydrogen in combination with traditional marine fuels. They are targeting reducing carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 60 percent compared to conventional tugboats that use traditional marine fuels.\nTo further enhance the project’s overall sustainability Tsuneishi is also incorporating “JGreeX” produced by JFE Steel Corporation, It is a green steel product that was used for all of its steel plates.Many projects are focusing on hydrogen fuel cells instead of internal combustion engines as hydrogen remains a technology in development as a marine fuel. The Port of Antwerp-Bruges and the Savery family’s CMB.TECH launched what they said was thefirst hydrogen-fueled tugin 2023.Hydrotug 1was also reported to be the largest vessel currently capable of operating solely on hydrogen. It is operating demonstrations in the port of Antwerp while CMB.TECH has developed other vessels including a crew transfer vessel using hydrogen.",

Among the activities the U.S. is citing is the stealing of Ukrainian grain from Crimea and shipping it to Yemen and it included the captains of the vessel among the sanctions.\n“The Houthis remain reliant on Sa’id al-Jamal and his network to procure critical goods to supply the group’s terrorist war machine,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “Today’s action underscores our commitment to degrading the Houthis’ ability to threaten the region through their destabilizing activities.”\nThe Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took action against a network of Houthi financial facilitators and procurement operatives working in coordination with Sa’id al-Jamal, a senior Houthi financial official backed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF). This network OFAC reports has procured tens of millions of dollars worth of commodities from Russia, including weapons and sensitive goods, as well as stolen Ukrainian grain, for onward shipment to Houthi-controlled Yemen.\nIn one effort, the U.S. reports in the summer and fall of 2024 at least two shipments of stolen Ukrainian grain were involved. They report it was loaded in Crimea on board the Russia-flaggedAM Theseus, also known as theZafar, and shipped to Yemen. The vessel which is 37,300 dwt and built in 2015 was acquired in 2023 by Hong Kong-based AM Asia M6 and has switched between flags in Russia and Palau and back to Russia.\nThe U.S. reports these shipments as well as other support were being orchestrated by Russia-based Afghan businessman Hushang Ghairat (Hushang) and his brother, Russia-based Afghan businessman Sohrab Ghairat (Sohrab) assisting Sa’id al-Jamal with Houthi commercial initiatives in Russia, including arms procurement. Hushang and Sohrab, at Sa’id al-Jamal’s direction, the U.S. says orchestrated the grain shipments.\nIn addition to the ship manager, the U.S. is also sanctioning Russian national Vyacheslav Vladimirovich Vidanov (Vidanov) who served as the captain of theAM Theseusduring some of the 2024 voyages between Crimea and Yemen, and Russian national Yuri Vladimirovich Belyakov (Belyakov) served as the vessel’s captain through the end of 2024.\nThe vessel was also listed and OFAC has also identified eight digital asset wallets used by the Houthis to transfer funds associated with their activities. Hushang, Sohrab, and Sa’id al-Jamal they report use financial facilitators to conduct financial transactions in support of the Houthis’ trade ventures involving Russia. Turkey-based Iranian money launderer Hassan Jafari (Jafari) has worked with Hushang and Sa’id al-Jamal to launder dollars on behalf of Sa’id al-Jamal’s network, enabling the network’s sanctions evasion schemes.  Jafari also arranged payments worth millions of dollars in support of shipments benefiting the Houthis.\nThe sanctions were announced as U.S. Central Command continues to report attacks on Houthi positions in Yemen. The last attack they highlighted was on March 31 more than two weeks after Trump launched the new campaign.",

The CPC pipeline handles 80 percent of Kazakhstan's oil exports, including volumes produced by American oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil, and it accounts for about one percent of all global oil supply.\nLast month, Russia's Federal Agency for Transport Supervision inspected two older moorings at the pipeline's offshore loading terminal. The snap inspection resulted in unspecified \"violations,\" according to CPC.\nRussian authorities ordered the two buoys taken out of service on April 1, reducing CPC export volume from 1.4 million barrels a day to about 700,000 barrels. There are no restrictions on the pipeline itself, and the third mooring at the terminal continues to operate as normal.\nThe decision hasn't had an immediate effect on production within Kazakhstan, but as storage begins to fill up, operators at the Caspian's prolific oilfields will likely have to begin shutting in production. The giant Tengiz field, operated by Chevron-led Tengizchevroil, is responsible for 700,000 barrels a day of Kazakh production and could be affected.\nChevron is investing a staggering $48 billion in expanding production at Tengiz. If successful, the program could boost output to nearly one million barrels a day by mid-2025 - if the CPC pipeline comes back online. The prolific output at the field has pushed Kazakhstan's annual production past its OPEC limits, and March set a new all-time record for Kazakh oilfields. If the terminal had not been partially shut down, the CPC pipeline would have exported about 1.7 million barrels per day in April.\n",

While it is the first railroad operation in the company, executives highlighted that it is in keeping with Maersk’s intermodal logistics focus.\nNo price was cited for the railroad which is reported to generate revenues of $77 million and EBITDA earnings of $36 million annually. The railroad was rehabilitated in the early 2000s and reports it has a capacity for trains per day and 500,000 container moves annually while it was targeting expansion to a capacity of 2 million boxes. Reprots indicate it currently moves about 300,000 boxes annually, but its volume was up 20 percent in 2023 - 2024 when the drought reduced ship transits. It also operates passenger service between Colon and Panama City.\n“The Panama Canal Railway Company represents an attractive infrastructure investment in the region aligned to our core services of intermodal container movement,” said Keith Svendsen, CEO of APM Terminals.\nMaersk hadworked with the railroadin 2024 when it began sending containers across the isthmus by rail during the water shortage in the canal. Maersk separated one of its routes having ships exchanging boxes in Panama instead of making the transit. Some large containerships due to draft restrictions were also required to offload boxes for transit by rail during this time.\nThe railroad dates back to the 1850s and provided a vital cargo route long before the construction of the canal. It passed to the Panama Canal Company when the U.S. built the canal but by the 1970s was in decline. The lack of investment continued into the 1990s when it was reported the railroad was losing $4 million annually.\nKansas City Southern and Mi-Jack Products acquired the rights to the railroad in 1998 and began an $80 revitalization to relaunch the operations. They created a modern railway, but today the company calls it a non-core asset as it focuses on operations in North America after the merger with Canadian Pacific.\nThe sale of the railway comes as the transaction for control of the terminals at each end of the canal remains in doubt. Today, April 2, was CK Hutchison’s target date for completing the definitive deal with BlackRock and MSC’s TiL group. China confirmed it is reviewing the deal while media reports are indicating Hutchison may be reconsidering the sale after pressure from the Communist Chinese government.\nDonald Trump has continued to vow the U.S. will take control of the Panama Canal to remove Chinese influence over the operation. The railroad while separate is a vital part of the overall operation and could play a vital role as an alternate route similar to the efforts in 2024 during the drought.",

It will open a key market for Canada as it launched the LNG industry shipping gas to Asia in competition with the U.S. and Australia which have been the traditional large suppliers.\nThe project calls itself the largest private sector investment in Canadian history. Construction began on the project in 2019 with an initial two trains and two docks to handle LNG carriers. The terminal will process up to 2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), representing approximately 11 percent of current Canadian gas output, or a total annual capacity of 14 million tonnes annually, and designed to potentially expand with two additional trains.LNG Canada is a joint venture company comprised of Shell, PETRONAS, PetroChina, Mitsubishi Corporation, and KOGAS. It is also the start of an industry that is expected to develop over the second half of this decade.\n\n\nCooldown cargo arrived from Australia as testing proceeds at the new facility in British Columbia (LNG Canada)\n\n“We’re pleased to announce that today, in a well-coordinated effort with HaiSea Marine personnel and tugboats, British Columbia Coast Pilots and Pacific Pilotage Authority Canada, with support from the Canadian Coast Guard and Canada Border Services Agency, our marine team welcomed for the first time an LNG carrier to the LNG Canada facility in Kitimat,” the company wrote online. Careful planning has gone into the process of moving the vessels along a 159-nautical mile route from an initial point near Prince Rupert to the terminal.\nThe initial LNG cargo arrived from Gladstone, Australia aboard theMaran Gas Roxana(95,194 dwt). It will be offloaded and used to test the systems during this phase of commissioning. It will cool down the pipes and storage tanks under cryogenic conditions preparing them for operations. LNG Canada reports it will only require this cargo and that this phase of testing and commissioning should last three to four weeks.\nAfter the vessel is offloaded, the pilots will complete their testing process navigating the vessel back to the Pacific. HalSea Marine also completed the commissioning of its tugs which are being used to escort the vessels during the trip to and from the terminal. Canadian authorities are requiring as a precaution escorts for all the LNG carriers.\nThe project is close to realizing its key milestones as production and shipments begin after years of planning and construction.",

The port bow of the cruise ship was torn open, leaving a gaping hole measuring about 200 square feet in area. Remarkably, none of the 140 passengers and crewmembers on board were harmed, and no injuries were reported aboard the cargo vessel.\nAll of the hull damage was above the waterline, and both vessels remained able to transit safely. The cruise boat berthed in Wesel and disembarked its passengers for onward travel.\nThe Duisberg Water Police suspect that the cargo vessel may have caused the collision, and detained it for an inspection. The master was taken to the central station in Duisburg for blood alcohol level testing. Germany's Waterways and Shipping Authority is conducting a parallel investigation into the cause of the collision.\nCollision on the Szczecin Lagoon\nOn Monday evening, nine people were injured in a collision between a river cruise vessel and a fuel barge in Poland's Szczecin Lagoon. The cause of the casualty is under investigation.\nNear Chelminek Island, the cruise boatJunker Joergcollided with the fuel bargeArgonaut, tearing a large hole in theJunker Joerg'sport bow.

    "input": "\nThe UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch released initial results from its ongoing investigation into the “very serious marine casualty” resulting from the containershipSolonghitting the anchored tankerStena Immaculate. While many of the details have already leaked in the media, it confirmed the now-arrested master of theSolongwas alone on the bridge despite the presence of fog in the area and functioning with no more than approximately seven hours of sleep between watches.\nThe Portuguese-flagged containership was moving at a speed of 16 knots having departed the prior evening from Grangemouth, Scotland, and on a planned passage to Rotterdam following a route the ship had used in the past. The master of the containership, Vladimir Motin, was on the bridge when the ship departed around 2000 on March 9, handed over the bridge at around 2400 to the second officer, and returned to the bridge at 0700 to assume the watch. He was the lone watchkeeper, despite requirements for a lookout at night and in foggy conditions, a violation that MAIB has emphasized in previous collision reports.\n“The visibility in the area north of the Humber light float was reported to be patchy and varying between 0.25 nautical miles (nm) and 2.0nm. NeitherSolongnorStena Immaculatehad a dedicated lookout on the bridge. At 0947,Solongcollided with the anchoredStena Immaculate’s port side on a heading (HDG) of 150° and speed over the ground (SOG) of about 16 knots (kts),” MAIB states in its interim report. It also says there was a slight swell of 1 meter.\nCrowley responded to the report with a statement highlighting, “It is important to note that watch requirements for vessels at anchor are different from ships that are underway. The Stena Immaculate was operating in compliance with applicable watch-standing safety regulations and Crowley company policies for an anchored vessel. We are confident that the forthcoming comprehensive investigation report will clarify the facts and circumstances of the incident, demonstrating that Crowley exercised appropriate vigilance.”\nThe report states that the tanker’s second officer was on watch. Crowley says the officer began a 12-hour lookout shift just before midnight.\nMAIB emphasizes in thereportthat the findings are preliminary and that the investigation into the accident is ongoing. It states among the factors it will be exploring are “the navigation and watchkeeping practices on board both vessels, manning, and fatigue management.”\nOther issues that will be considered in preparing the report include the use of the offshore area as an anchorage for vessels waiting to enter the Humber Estuary and the environmental conditions at the time of the allision. MAIB is also reviewing the condition and maintenance of the vessels.\nIt highlights that both vessels were above their minimum safe manning level and the efforts of the crews in managing the fires after impact. MAIB says the aviation fuel from theStena Immacualte’s damaged number 7 tank was released into the sea on the bow of theSolong. The heat generated by the force of the collision ignited the fires which spread to the contents of the containers on theSolong. It notes the severity of the fire hampered the efforts to find the missing seafarer on the containership and the efforts to control the situation before both ships were abandoned.\nIt had come out in court that the captain was alone on the bridge of the containership when he was formally charged with gross negligent manslaughter. He is due for another appearance in court this month with a tentative date of January 2026 set for the trial.\nThe release of the report comes as salvage efforts continue. Local officials from Lincolnshire on the east coast of England said this week they so far have retrieved approximately 11 tonnes of plastic pellets that washed up on the beaches mostly in burnt clumps. The priority has been on the clumps, but they expect there are large quantities still to be recovered.\nCrowley reported that the tankerFure Vyle(17,950 dwt) has been hired and was anchored near theStena Immaculateto begin the lightering of the remaining 202,485 barrels of Jet-A1 cargo from the damaged tanker. It will be shuttled to its original destination of Killingholme in the UK for the U.S. military while theStena Immaculatewill be towed to Newcastle upon Tyne for further inspection. Two ocean-going tugs appear to be working at theStena Immaculatewith theFure Vylestill standing by as of April 3.\nTheSolongarrived in Scotland on March 28. She was tied up in Aberdeen where she is being inspected.\n\n\nImages from the CCTV on Stena Immaculate from Crowley showing the impact released by MAIB\n",

    "input": "A new project led by the Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping addressed the challenges and processes required to convert one of the largest segments of the current global shipping fleet, the Kamsarmax bulk carrier, for dual-fuel methanol operations. With involvements from leaders across the segments of the industry, the project leaders believe it is a key step in decarbonization that provides critical insights into the feasibility of retrofit projects.\nThe project, which aimed to assess the techno-economic feasibility of a retrofit from fuel oil to dual-fuel methanol, has been granted an Approval in Principle (AiP) by Japan’s ClassNK, which also contributed regulatory advice and facilitated safety risk assessments.\nThe Center highlights that Kamsarmax bulk carriers represent a significant share of the existing fleet. It believes that developing a general retrofit package could drive low-emission solutions across the maritime industry. Additionally, the project sheds light on the challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed when deciding to retrofit a bulk carrier.\nThe retrofit project was based on a standard Kamsarmax design developed by Tsuneishi Shipbuilding which worked along the Center as a lead in the project. They explored the technical and operational challenges and opportunities of converting vessels to dual-fuel methanol. The retrofit design and technological solutions were developed in close cooperation with MAN ES, which provided the main engine and FuelTech expertise on design reviews and HAZID processes (Hazard Identification). Cargill offered operational and technical insights bringing in the charterer’s perspective, while the Danish Maritime Administration participated as an observer.\n“With the medium-sized bulk carrier segment representing a substantial share of the industry, this modular retrofit solution paves the way for an accelerated transition to methanol and other sustainable fuels,” said Evangelos Fragkoulis, Head of Ship Design for the Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping. “It demonstrates a paradigm shift towards non-intrusive, safe, and agile solutions that enable the integration of green fuels without compromising safety.”\nThe Kamsarmax is an 80,000 to 84,000 dwt dry bulk carrier which is very popular in the industry with the first vessel of the class delivered in 2005. Tsuneishi alone reports having built over 300 of the vessels, and the number one market share in the category, which generally measure approximately 230 meters (755 feet) in length making it a versatile and economical design. Tsuneishi highlights with a lifespan of 20 to 30 years, it is a critical segment of the industry that will significantly impact maritime decarbonization efforts.\nThe project generated multiple design solutions, including novel and modular fuel handling onboard, as well as methanol storage and integration options that optimize safety, capacity and ultimately reduce cost and conversion lead times. Additionally, the project has developed general design principles for methanol retrofit aimed at ship designers, shipyards and operators, providing a navigational framework through key design decisions.\nThe Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping reports that it will be releasing a comprehensive case study on the design. The guidelines developed during the project will also be released late this year.",

The company is presenting itself as a new concept in residential ships as it reconditions popular small luxury cruise ships into residencies.\nThey announced today an agreement with Oceania Cruises, one of the brands of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, to take over the cruise shipInsigniain late 2027 and convert her into a residency cruise ship. Cresent Seas will be marketing the residencies while Norwegian will continue to own the cruise ship and the well-known cruise management and hospitality services company The Apollo Group will manage all onboard hospitality and culinary offerings. Crescent Seas emphasizes that its ships will be staffed by their existing onboard service provider to ensure continuity in the product.\nTheInsignia(30,000 gross tons) was one of the first cruise ships used in 2002 to launch Oceania Cruises. The ship was built in 1998 by Chantiers de l’Atlantique for a cruise company called Renaissance Cruises, which was an early entrant in the small ship luxury cruise segment.Insigniawas introduced asR One, the first of a new class that called for eight cruise ships, but the line went bankrupt in 2001. Oceania was launched as the successor brand and today operates four of the cruise ships with competitor Azama Cruises now operating the other four.\nJason Montague, Chief Luxury Officer for Oceania, wrote in a letter to the cruise line’s loyalty club, thatInsignia’s departure is “bittersweet news” saying we are “sad to seeInsigniadepart the fleet.” He noted her pioneering role for the company while highlighting she is being replaced by the addition of the newAllura(67,000 gross tons) in the summer of 2025 and a new class of ships currently called “Quattro” which is being built by Fincantieri and launching in 2027. Oceania is planning a “Farewell Tour” forInsignia.\n\n\nInsignia will be converted to residential cruising late in 2027 (Crescent Seas)\n\nCrescent Seas reports she will undergo a more than $50 million comprehensive revitalization reducing her current 333 staterooms to 290 residences. The ship, which is 593 feet (181 meters) in length currently accommodates 670 passengers (double occupancy) and is considered small by current industry standards.\nThe company reports residencies will be priced between $650,000 to $10 million aboardInsignia. She will return to service with an inaugural voyage for New Year's 2027-2028. Sales will begin in the late summer of 2025.\nCresent Seas is a part of GFO Investments, a company managed by Russell Galbut, a lawyer and real estate developer who was on the board of Oceania and later chairman of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. His company Cresent Heights is a developer of luxury urban projects including in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City.\nThe cruise line was announced in March 2025 with anagreementwith Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings to assume theSeven Seas Navigatorfrom sister brand Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Navigator is due to start sales this month with residencies priced between $750,000 and $8 million. She will enter service in December 2026.\nCresent Seas highlights that it will maintain the luxury of the ships. Among the onboard features will be butler service, gourmet dining, Starlink Internet connections, and more. The company promotes that its ships will provide extended stays in global destinations. They plan to spend two or three nights or up to five days in each port of call.\nCresent Seas says that it plans to announce three more luxury residence ships over the next five years. The segment was pioneered byThe World, which entered service over 20 years ago, and another start-up launched theVilla Vie Odysseyrebuilt from a 30-year-old cruise ship as a residency in September 2024. With the growth in high-end luxury cruising, several firms are looking to leverage interest in cruising to expand residential cruise ship offerings.",

    "input": "\nThe U.S. Navy air strike campaign against Yemen's Houthi rebels is producing results, according to officials in Iran and the United States. The Iranian military is pulling personnel out of Yemen in order to reduce the risk of casualties or escalation, a senior Iranian official told the Telegraph - a significant victory for the Trump administration's policy. The strikes have also forced the Houthis to slow the pace of their missile attacks on Israel and on U.S. forces in the Red Sea. However, American officials told the New York Times, the Houthis still retain large weapons stockpiles in hardened bunkers, and the U.S. has yet to deploy the capabilities required to reach them.\nOn Wednesday, a senior Iranian official told The Telegraph that the Trump administration's military campaign is now the center of discussion in Tehran, and the regime's many proxy groups - Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Shia militias in Iraq - have taken a back seat. Hezbollah and Hamas have both been dealt serious blows in combat with Israel, and Tehran sees the Houthis as another losing force, the official claimed.\n\"The view here is that the Houthis will not be able to survive and are living their final months or even days, so there is no point in keeping them on our list,\" the Iranian official said. \"They were part of a chain that relied on [assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah and [former Syrian dictator Bashar] Assad, and keeping only one part of that chain for the future makes no sense.\"\nThree U.S. officials told the New York Times that the U.S. Navy airstrikes on Yemen have been more intense than publicly reported. The Institute for the Study of War, a nonpartisan research group, identified 28 airstrikes on April 2-3 alone. This campaign will likely intensify: a second U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is under way to join USSHarry S. Trumanin the Red Sea, doubling the available firepower. The bombardment could go on for months, the officials said - an indication that the resumption of Red Sea merchant traffic may not come until later in the year.\nA Pentagon spokesperson strenuously denied that the timeline for the bombing campaign is months long, saying only that it was \"on track\" for future phases.\nLocal U.S. Navy commands now have control over targeting decisions, the Times reports, and as the pace picks up, the task force is consuming a meaningful number of precision munitions. The Houthis still have air defenses, and Navy pilots are using a combination of glide bombs and cruise missiles to achieve mission success without entering the Houthis' weapons envelope. The cost of these weapons so far is comparatively small for a regional war, about $1 billion, but Pentagon planners are more concerned about the low rate of stockpile replenishment. The U.S. supply chain for precision air-launched munitions is limited, andwar gamingfor a Taiwan Strait conflict suggests that U.S. success against China hinges on an adequate supply of these high-tech weapons.",

    "input": "\nThe French cooperative Windcoop completed the construction order for its revolutionary open-hatch sail-powered cargo ship, the first of what the group envisions will be a pioneering fleet of ships. The order was placed with Turkey’s RMK Marine, which is also building the sail-powered RoRoNeoliner Origin.\nThe group reports it has had to overcome major technical and logistic challenges to integrate a wind-powered propulsion system while also ensuring efficient container handling. This was in part solved with asymmetrical sails, the open-hatch design, and the placement of cranes on the opposite from the sails. It helps to provide stability and balance while also giving the vessel total autonomy for loading and unloading.\nThe vessel will be 91.3 meters (approximately 300 feet) in length with a capacity for 210 TEU and 40 reefer plugs. The three wingsails designed by Computer Wingsails (CWS) are each 350 square meters (approximately 3,800 square feet) or a total sail area of 1,050 square meters (11,300 square feet). The vessel is projected to have an average sailing speed of 9 knots.\n\n\n\n“After four years of development, we are finally taking decisive steps toward realizing what was once considered an audacious dream,” said Matthieu Brunet, Chairman of Windcoop. The effort was started in 2022. Based in Lorient, France, Windcoop was created through the collaboration of Zéphyr & Borée, Enercoop and Arcadie.\nThe project with RMK calls for orders to the subcontractors including the sails and engines and finalization of the studies and tank tests for the vessel this year. Construction is due to begin in 2026 and trials, delivery, and commissioning in May 2027.\nThe total construction cost is set at €28.5 million ($31.5 million). Windcoop reports it has secured financing of €28.5 million structured by Crédit Maritime Grand Ouest – Banque Populaire, with a counter-guarantee from Bpifrance. The financing includes €6.8 million ($7.5 million) raised through the cooperative. This involved 1,600 citizens, committed shippers (Arcadie, Valrhona, Prova, Lobodis, Ethicable, Cafés Richard, Demad, Arawak), and institutional investors (La Nef, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, SIDI, Mer Invest, Inddigo, Bretagne Capital Solidaire). It is the first cargo ship of this size to include cooperative funding.\n\nThe first service route was selected to focus on secondary ports that are traditionally neglected because they lack the capacity or equipment to load goods. The group says it aims to “rebalance the logistics network” while also reducing carbon emissions by limiting land transport. The vessel will be registered in France and sail a route between France and Madagascar, connecting Marseille to the ports of Tamatave, Diego Suarez, and Majunga, without transshipment and including transits of the Suez Canal. They project a transit time of 31 days.\nFrom Madagascar, they will carry cargo including aquaculture, cocoa, vanilla, spices, essential oils, and textiles. While they expect to export from France to Madagascar retail goods, glassware, paramedical products, and textiles.\nWindcoop has ambitious plans. It aims to secure financing and rapidly build a second vessel to ensure a monthly service on the Madagascar-France route. At the same time, Windcoop plans to expand its fleet by launching new maritime routes designed to meet the needs of the shippers and the territories involved. A regional line in the Indian Ocean, a transatlantic connection as well as a direct link to West Africa are currently in the planning stages.",

TheBruma'slifeboat is also missing, raising the possibility that the crew may have abandoned ship and could be adrift somewhere else.\nComienzan a aparecer más restos de la embarcación Bruma en la cuadra de búsqueda cercano a la Isla Santa María.

Moller Holding. The proceeds will primarily be used to fund the final development of a Louisiana project to produce green methanol as well as to advance C2X’s current efforts in the U.S., Spain, and Egypt to build green methanol production for the shipping, aviation, and chemical sectors.\nC2X reports the investment is a critical step to advance the development of the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy project in Louisiana to FID, which is being developed with SunGas Renewables. The project will use SunGas’ S-1000 gasification technology system to convert biomass into low-carbon methanol. The project will also capture and permanently sequester approximately 1 million tonnes per year of surplus biogenic CO2 from the gasification process, generating carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits.\nThe multibillion-dollar project aims to start construction in the second half of 2026. Once operational, which is targeted for the end of 2028, it will produce over 500,000 tonnes of green methanol annually. C2X reports it is also in discussions to secure long-term offtake agreements from Maersk and other customers in its targeted shipping, chemicals, and industrial sectors.\nThe Beaver Lake facility is the first of several facilities planned by SunGas and C2X to supply green methanol. It would repurpose a former International Paper site in Rapides Parish, Louisiana that closed in 2009. SunGas has estimated the facility would be valued at $2.4 billion.\nSunGas and C2X announced a strategic partnership and C2X’s investment in SunGas in May 2024. ENEOS’ new investment is accompanied by a strategic partnership with C2X, which considers methanol offtake and the application of SunGas’ gasification technology into its system portfolio.\nAP Moller launched C2X to help expedite the process of developing a global production and supply chain for methanol. The company has previously announced projects in Spain, Egypt, and the United States. With the new commitment from ENEOS, Maersk, and APM, it looks to continue to accelerate the development of its portfolio of projects.",

American seaports and importers are bracing for the effects of a 20 percent tariff on the EU, a cumulative 54 percent tariff on China, and 40 percent-plus tariffs on Southeast Asian nations.\nAt the twin ports in San Pedro Bay, any decline in trade volume will be acutely felt. More than 60 percent of Port of Long Beach's imports come from China, and at neighboring Port of LA, the Chinese share is about 40 percent. Hundreds of thousands of jobs in the vast warehousing districts around LA - where containers are unstuffed and the contents loaded for delivery around the U.S. - will be directly affected.\n\"If we have reduced container volume and more specifically imports, be it from China or Southeast Asia, it would have an impact on jobs,\" said Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, speaking to CBS.\nLA and Long Beach have been booming over the past few months as importers raced to beat the tariff deadline. Port of LA posted its second-best February ever, driven by strong import volume. That boom may be followed by a bust cycle, Port of LA CEO Gene Seroka has cautioned.\n\"Given the substantial inventory already here and the uncertainty of tariffs, it’s possible we can see a 10% drop in volume in the second half of this year,\" Seroka said at a press conference in March.\nSmaller import-dependent businesses may be the most affected by the new tariffs, and smallcap stocks have now fallen by more than 20 percent since before the election. \"They’re not like large corporations. They operate on very thin profit margins,\" Bank of America Institue economist Taylor Bowley told Politico. \"Frankly, they just don’t have the bandwidth or operating expenses to do that.\"",

    "input": "South Korea’s shipbuilding industry is highlighting a rebound in orders in March after a slow start to the year. It comes as the industry looks for ways to benefit from the proposed U.S. fees on Chinese-built ships.\nTo combat the growing Chinese domination of shipbuilding, South Korea’s strategy has included a focus on high-value ships and larger, more technologically advanced ships. This includes all forms of gas carriers where South Korea continues to lead the orders despite China’s growth in LNG tankers. In the long term, South Korea looks toward ammonia carriers, ammonia-fueled ships, automation, and other technologies.\nReports are the strategy worked in March 2025 with the South Korean yards garnering 55 percent of the orders based on tonnage according to data from Clarkson Research Service. South Korea recorded orders for 820,000 compensated gross tons (CGT) compared to the Chinese yards booking 520,000 CGT in March. By the number of vessels, however, China continued its lead booking 31 ship orders compared to South Korea’s 17 ships.\nThis is a strong rebound from February when China booked 70 percent of the orders by tonnage. South Korea’s yards booked just nine percent of the tonnage ordered in February. The reports highlighted that the Korean yards historically have lagged behind the Chinese in the first quarter of the year while also noting that last year South Korea only received 16 percent of the orders for the year versus 70 percent booked in China.\nChina also continues to hold a strong overall lead in the sector, Clarkson’s data shows Chinese yards have an order backlog of nearly 94 million CGT which is 59 percent of the global total. South Korea’s yards while ranking second have a backlog of just over 36 million CGT or 23 percent of the total.\nThe South Korean industry is looking toward the U.S. to help drive future business. In February it was reported that the U.S. Trade Representative was proposing fees for Chinese-built ships calling in U.S. ports. The Trump administration has latched on to the concept as part of its plan to rebuild U.S. shipbuilding.\nThe Korean news outlet CHOSUNBIZ reports fears of the pending fees might already be impacting future shipbuilding plans. Citing reports from Daishin Securities it writes that ExxonMobil canceled orders for two liquefied natural gas bunkering vessels (LNGBVs) intended for China.\nHD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, South Korea’s largest shipbuilder, reported yesterday, April 3, that it had booked an additional order for an LNG carrier valued at approximately $263 million. The group said it has now received orders for a total of 24 ships worth $4.07 billion, achieving 22.6 percent of its annual order target of $18.05 billion. By ship type, the company has received orders in 2025 for an LNG carrier, four LNG bunkering vessels, an LPG/ammonia carrier,  and two ethane carriers, as well as 12 containerships, and four tankers.\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative held public hearings on March 24 and March 26, regarding the proposed actions in the Section 301 investigation on China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance. It also accepted written comments and for seven days afterward was also accepting rebuttal comments. No timeline was released for completing the review but it is expected the office will issue its final recommendations which Trump will incorporate into the overall plan for U.S. shipbuilding.  Combined with the new tariffs, many have warned it could have a chilling effect on global trade and the shipping industry.",

TheAndaman Skieshas been stuck holding off Mumbai reports say for two weeks since it wasrefused entryinto the port. Both Reuters and Bloomberg are citing sources in India saying that the approximately 100,000 metric tons of Russian crude is being transshipped to the second tanker and will be landed at the terminal in the coming days.\nIndia has continued to be one of Russia’s largest oil customers with as much as 35 percent of its crude imports coming from Russia in 2024. Reuters points out that the seller is responsible for the delivery of the crude including the vessel and its insurance. Reports indicate the cargo which is nearly 800,000 barrels was purchased from Lukoil, loaded near Murmansk, Russia, and is going to the Indian Oil Corp. terminal at Vandinar, India.\nTheAndaman Skiesbuilt in 2004 had been making the run from Russia but ran afoul of Indian regulations when it passed the 20-year mark this year. Regulations require older vessels to have seaworthiness and safety certificates from a recognized class society, which the Andaman Skies reportedly does not have available leading port officials to say it could not dock and unload its cargo.\nThe vessel was sold by Delta Tankers in 2023 and entered the shadow fleet with reports it is being managed from India. The Equasis database and others including Bloomberg report the vessel is registered in Honduras, while others including Reuters say it is registered in Tanzania. The European Union and UK added it to the sanctions list but it has not been cited by the U.S. or the UN.\nComing to its rescue is the equally shadowyOzanno, but built in 2008 it is under the 20-year mark. It is also listed as being under Indian management and currently reports registry as São Tomé and Príncipe. Equasis however lists that as a false flag. In 2024 the vessel reported registry in Barbados and in 2023 in the Cook Islands. It, too, is sanctioned by the EU and UK.\nIndia asserts it follows international regulations in the purchase and shipping of oil. However, it only recognizes the sanctions from the United States and the United Nations, permitting these tankers to continue in the trade.",

    "input": "\nThe latest Chinese port operation to come under pressure is Australia’s Port of Darwin which is now a headline issue in the upcoming federal elections. Today, April 4, Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared during a radio interview that Darwin “should be in Australian hands.” Concerns have been brewing over the now decade-old deal that ceded control of the port to a Chinese company.\nLocated on Australia’s north central coast the port while small in scope is seen as a strategic asset. It is Australia’s closest port to Asia and is playing an increasingly significant role in Australia’s expanding offshore oil and gas sector. In the port’s last fiscal year ended in 2024, it reported imports of more than 1 million kiloliters of petroleum products, handling over 280,000 head of cattle and being a major RoRo import operator for cars. It is a base to U.S. Marines and also a popular cruise ship destination.\nFaced with financial difficulties, the government of Australia’s Northern Territories put out a public tender in 2014 and the following year concluded a deal with a Chinese company Landbridge. The operator gained a 99-year lease for the port and promised to make investments. Reports indicate that the U.S. with then-President Barack Obama voiced concerns over the Chinese deal.\nAccusations have been raised about the operations with the Australian opposition party contending that Landbridge has failed to make the promised investments. In 2024 there were questions when Landbridge’s parent company went into default on an A$107 million (US$65 million) bond.\nThe company said in November 2024 that the “underlying operations of Darwin Port have improved significantly,” while reporting a nearly 50 percent increase in EBITDA earnings for FY 24. It blamed non-cash charges for an A$34 million (US$21 million) loss before taxes and said “Darwin Port remains a key asset of the group.”\nPrime Minister Albanese announced the federal government is in talks with private pension fund investors on a possible deal to take over the operational lease for the port. He said the options were private investment or the federal government taking over the port. When asked in 2023, Albanese had ruled out a similar move to regain control of the port.\nOpposition leaders have already spoken publicly about the need for the federal government to take control back from the Chinese. Media reports indicate they were going to make a formal public statement this coming Sunday, April 6, ahead of the May 3 federal elections.\nMedia reports said in March the federal government had discussions with the new government of the Northern Territory over possible steps. This came after Federal Labor MP Luke Gosling also made a public statement saying the federal government wanted to “return the port to Australian hands.”\nResponding to the statements and media speculation, Terry O’Connor, Non-Executive Director for Landbridge in Australia, issued a statement in March calling the minister’s statement “a surprise,” and he asserted “Landbridge and Darwin Port have not been involved in any discussions on the matter.” He said they would engage with the Northern Territory government but the “port is not for sale.”\nA local news outlet, NT News, however early in March reported Landbridge “could be willing to sell the port’s lease, but was asking A$1.3 billion (US$795 million). Reports indicate that is nearly A$800 million (approximately US$490 million) more than it paid in 2015 for the 99-year lease.",

Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and lawyers are confirming the CEO of a California-based title insurance company was charged in San Juan, Puerto Rico this week after an altercation that started with a fellow passenger dancing barefoot on a bar aboard Virgin Voyages’ shipResilient Lady.\nThe widely reported incident took place last Monday night, March 31, approximately 70 nautical miles west of Martinique in the Caribbean after the cruise ship had departed bound for San Juan. The exact time was not reported, but it was said to happen in a cocktail lounge called “On The Rocks,” a venue Virgin Voyages bills as a martini and cocktail bar on Deck 6. On its website Virgin Voyages writes, “On the Rocks is the perfect place to make bold choices.”\nA passenger only identified by initials in the complaint reportedly was on the bar dancing when Nichol DeGiorgio, made a remark to the order of “Look, we are all grown-ups here – can you put your shoes on?”  The irony of course is that the cruise line is associated with Sir Richard Branson, famous for dancing on furniture, and other antics.\nThe unidentified passenger reportedly responded making crude remarks and an obscene hand gesture to Ms. DeGiorgio. This was later confirmed by the ship’s closed-circuit security cameras with the video handed over to the FBI as evidence.\nAccording to the FBI statement and the complaint filed in the court in Puerto Rico, Kenneth DeGiorgio, age 53, CEO of First American Financial Corporation, confronted the individual who he did not know. He put his hands around the man’s neck and reportedly said he was going to kill the man.\nThe cruise ship’s captain later confined DeGiorgio to his cabin and handed the matter over to the FBI when the ship reached Puerto Rico. Crimes aboard cruise ships fall under federal jurisdiction.\nThe reports go on to say that DeGiorgio refused to answer questions from the FBI and requested a lawyer. In a statement, the lawyers are now asserting that he was responding to the actions of an individual who harassed his wife, making her feel threatened and intimidated.\nDeGiorgio was charged with a simple misdemeanor. However, if convicted of assault, The New York Times reports he faces up to one year in prison. His lawyers said DeGiorgio “looks forward to being absolved of any wrongdoing.”",

While the preliminary report released in November 2024 identified human error issues including failing to disengage the autopilot, the final report delves deeper to identify the underlying issues that they believe contributed to the loss of the vessel.\nThe interim Court of Inquiry focused on the direct issues, and it put the blame squarely onmistakes made by the crew. Failing to turn off the autopilot, the bridge crew attempted to maneuver the vessel. When the vessel did not respond they failed to check if they had manual control with it taking more than 10 minutes to regain control. The vessel however had grounded and the following morning after the 75 people on board were rescued the ship foundered.\nIn the final report, the court identified 12 additional issues that it says contributed to the grounding and sinking. Key among them were training issues and the qualifications of the ship’s personnel, as well as planning, instructions and procedures, supervision, haste, leadership, distraction, and interruptions. All these factors they believe made the loss more likely.\nThe court thanks the officers and crew of the vessel recognizing their braveness as well as their willingness to provide detailed testimony. The result was a120-page reportthat was released online for public review.\n“The Court found deficiencies in the training and qualifications of key ship’s personnel involved in the incident, risks related to the survey task were not sufficiently identified, discussed, and mitigated, and instructions or procedures were lacking,” said the Court of Inquiry president Commodore Melissa Ross. It also found leadership was inadequate in some areas, supervision was not at expected levels, and time pressure influenced the way the survey task was conducted.\nChief of the Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding accepted the report acknowledging that it illustrated a gap between work as imagined on shore by command and work as done on the vessel.\n“Fundamentally we need to do things differently. We need to adapt to new technologies, change the way we approach what we do, and find new ways to continue to deliver on what is expected of us,” he said.\nThe Court issued nine recommendations ranging from risk management to training. It cited the process around orders, instruction, and procedures as well as the experience of the crew.\nAdmiral Golding said the Navy has already moved forward in some areas, such as reviews of risk management, oversight, and documentation. He said among the audits was a review of the state of training. However, he recognized that some of the issues would be more complex and time-consuming to resolve.\n“Ultimately, there are a range of issues, including the lack of commonality across the fleet, which means our people need to constantly adapt to new procedures each time they change ships,” said the admiral. He called for embarking on a transformation program that seeks to reform the approach to operating the Navy.",

    "input": "\nCarnival Corporation and Fincantieri signed the group’s first new order for cruise ship construction for its AIDA brand since the pause in operations in 2020. It also marks the corporation’s efforts to resume shipbuilding and expansion of its brands outside the U.S. after focusing on its Carnival Cruise Line.\nSpeaking with the media on Sunday, April 6, CEO Josh Weinstein hinted that the corporation was planning to move forward with the expansion of its brands based on demand in the different segments of the market. He highlighted the corporation’s success in reducing debt accumulated during the pandemic and growth in demand globally for cruising. In FY 2024, the corporation reported a 40 percent increase in its EBITDA earnings ($6.1 billion). It nearly doubled operating income for the recently reported first quarter on $5.8 billion in revenues.\nCarnival Corporation had previously said it would add new cruise ships at the rate of approximately one per year across its nine brands. The corporation in 2024 ordered seven cruise ships for Carnival Cruise Line due between 2027 and 2033, split between Meyer Werft in Germany and Fincantieri in Italy. It also has one legacy order from before the pandemic due for delivery this year for Princess Cruises.\nFincantieri termed today’s order “very important,” reporting that it represents a value exceeding €2 billion ($2.2 billion). They will be the first cruise ships Fincantieri will build for AIDA. Except for two cruise ships built a decade ago in Japan by Mitsubishi, AIDA has worked with Meyer Werft for its fleet.\nAIDA has elected to build two midsized cruise ships between the size of its largest cruise ships Helios Class (183,900 gross tons with 2,732 passenger cabins) and the Hyperion Class (125,572 gross tons with 1,643 passenger cabins). No details were released on the new ships other than they would have 2,100 passenger cabins. Delivery is scheduled for early 2030 and late 2031.\nThe new ships will be equipped with multi-fuel engines which Fincantieri reports will be capable of operating on LNG, bio-diesel, and future sustainable fuels. AIDA has prided itself on being at the forefront of sustainability. The two Japanese-built cruise ships,AIDAprimaandAIDAperla, were the first to be outfitted with engines to use LNG dockside, and theAIDANovacommissioned in 2018 was the first cruise ship capable of sailing on LNG. The company has also adopted shore power and other energy-saving technologies.\nAIDA’s President Felix Eichhorn notes the brand will reach 13 ships with the addition of the new order. He said the ships will have new features and experiences without providing details.\nThe cruise line has also launched a revitalization program for three cruise ships in its fleet. The program started last month withAIDAdivaand will improve technology and refurbish passenger areas. They are adding new restaurants, including a maritime-themed cafe, French and Asia restaurants, and a Tapas Bar. TheAIDAlunaandAIDAbellawill follow in 2025 and 2026.\nAIDA has been one of the strongest-performing brands in the portfolio. It focuses on the German-speaking market.",

The pollution is near the site where two aging tankers broke up and sank in December - but Russian officials deny that any additional pollution from the disaster has been observed.\nOn March 31, ecologist Georgy Kavanosyan released a synthetic aperture radar image of the Kerch Strait on social media, showing what appeared to be a long slick at the entrance to the strait. The site corresponds to the location of the bow section ofVolgoneft-239,one of the two lost tankers. A second environmental scientist, Igor Shkradyuk, told Russian investigative reporting outlet Agentstva that the leak is likely in the range of hundreds of liters per day - and that it will likely continue through the warm months of the year as the fuel cargo heats up and seeps out.\n\"Unfortunately, government agencies are not telling us what is happening with the spilled fuel oil. They are pretending that none of this is happening,\" Shkradyuk said.\nRussia's Ministry of Emergency Situations says that it continues to monitor the wreck sites daily, and it claims that no additional fuel leaks from the tankers have been recorded. \"The sunken fragments of the tankers are constantly being examined by divers, the bottom is being monitored in a kilometer-long zone from the coast using remotely controlled vehicles, space monitoring technologies, drones, and patrol groups of rescuers on boats are being used to monitor the situation in the water area,\" ministry chief Alexander Kurenkov said Friday.\nRussia's environment ministry (Rosprirodnadzor) has filed a new claim for compensation for damages against the owners ofVolgoneft-239andVolgoneft-212.The two riverine tankers were operating in the open waters of the Black Sea in wintertime, beyond the limits of their design parameters, and the ministry laid blame on the captains and on their employers.\nThe total claim comes to about 85 billion rubles ($1 billion), split between Kama Shipping and Volgatransneft CFC. The two firms have one month to pay for the damages, after which the ministry will initiate a lawsuit, said Svetlana Radionova, head of Rosprirodnadzor.",

    "input": "\nOn Sunday, Japan’s Defense Ministry launched a new military unit, the Maritime Transport Group. The unit is expected to improve Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) maritime logistics, allowing swift deployment of ground troops and equipment to front-line bases. The inauguration ceremony was held at Kure naval base in Hiroshima Prefecture.\nThe plan for a specialized maritime transport unit for the JSDF was initially announced in 2018. The aim was enhancing JSDF ability to transport troops to remote islands - especially the islands west of Okinawa, a response to China’s maritime expansion in the region and the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\nThe new Maritime Transport Group is part of the Japanese government's strategy to strengthen its island defense system, and will be managed by Japan's army (Japan Ground Self Defense Force, or JGSDF). This command structure is similar to the United States' landing craft fleet, which is housed within the U.S. Army Watercraft Systems division.\nThe Maritime Transport Group consists of about 100 members, drawn from the three branches of JSDF including the Ground, Maritime and Air Self Defense Forces. For the operations of the unit, the ministry plans to procure 10 vessels by March 2028. The vessels include two LSVs (Logistics Support Vessel), four LCUs (Landing Craft Utility) and four maneuver support vessels. They will be based at Kure base and the Hanshin base in Kobe city. There are also plans to prepare wharfs on the island of Amami-Oshima in Kagoshima Prefecture. Two vessels have already been launched.\nThe LCUNihonbarelaunched in October last year at the Naikai Zosen shipyard in Onomichi City of Hiroshima. The LCU is about 80 meters long, has a draft of 3 meters and displacement of about 2,400 tons. It has a crew capacity of 30 and it can transport a dozen twenty-foot containers. In addition, the LCU has beaching capabilities that allow it to load and unload on sandy areas.\nA month later, the LSVYokowas launched at the same shipyard. The LSV is about 120 meters, has a draft of 4 meters and a displacement of 3,500 tons. It can load and unload vehicles and supplies through a side ramp on the starboard side. However, Yoko does not have beaching capabilities like Nihonbare.\nThe strengthening of Japan’s military transport capabilities comes at a time China has become more assertive in the East China Sea. The two countries have a long-standing maritime dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which Japan controls. In the past year, China has sent a record number of heavily armed ships to patrol the islands.\nAccording to data by Japan Coast Guard (JCG), Chinese government vessels entered the contiguous zone of the Islands (12 to 24 nautical miles from the coast) on 355 out of 366 days in 2024. This set a record for the highest number of days since 2008, when Chinese vessels were officially confirmed patrolling the Islands.",

    "input": "\nSince the introduction of a global sulfur cap in marine fuel oil by IMO (International Maritime Organization) in 2020, there has been uncertainty on the environmental impacts of scrubbers for vessels using heavy fuel oil (HFO). But a newstudyreleased last week claims that the environmental impacts of burning HFO with scrubbers could be equivalent, and in some scenarios, outperform use of low-sulfur fuels for large bulk carriers.\nThe study includes researchers from MIT and Georgia Tech, with partial support from Oldendorff Carriers. The bulk carrierHedwig Oldendorffwas selected for onboard emission measurements and collection of scrubber wash water samples.\nWhile multiple studies have monitored marine fuel emissions and the effects of scrubbers, the researchers said that the existing lifecycle assessments (LCAs) lack onboard measurements or focus on specific impact categories, such as climate change. For this study, the scientists claimed to have developed a robust assessment of the environmental impacts of using scrubbers with HFO versus low-sulfur fuels. This involved conducting a comprehensive Well-to-Wake (WtW) LCA, accounting for the impacts from fuel sourcing, production, conversion, transport, distribution, and eventual use onboard the vessel.\nIn considering this entire supply chain, burning heavy fuel oil with scrubbers was found to be the least harmful option in terms of nearly all 10 environmental impact factors that were studied. Some of these factors include greenhouse gas emissions, terrestrial acidification and ozone formation.\n“Claims about environmental hazards and policies to mitigate them should be backed by science. You need to see data, be objective, and design studies that take into account the full picture to be able to compare different options,” said lead author Patricia Stathatou, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech.\nAccording to data by Clarksons Research, the use of scrubbers has been on the rise in the past two decades. The number of scrubber-fitted ships increased from 243 in 2020 to more than 7,400 at the start of 2025. The majority of these vessels utilize wet, open-loop marine scrubbers, which consists of a huge vertical tank installed in a ship’s exhaust stack above the engines. Inside, seawater drawn from the ocean is sprayed through a series of nozzles, washing the hot exhaust gases as they exit the engines. But the scrubber wastewater contains compounds that may be toxic for the marine environment. In fact, many countries across the world have restricted scrubber discharge within ports and harbors.\nIn exploring this concern in the study, Stathatou and her colleagues agree that scrubber discharge is toxic, but its impact is less than burning low-sulfur fuels, when considered from a holistic point of view. Producing low-sulfur fuel requires extra processing steps in the refinery, causing additional emissions of greenhouse gases and particulate matter.\n“If we just look at everything that happens before the fuel is bunkered onboard the vessel, heavy fuel oil is significantly more low-impact, environmentally, than low-sulfur fuels. If you consider that the scrubber has a lifetime of about 20 years, the environmental impacts of producing the scrubber over its lifetime are negligible compared to producing heavy fuel oil,” added Stathatou.",

(These allegations could not be immediately verified, but his audience applauded.) \"I tell you what, if you guys had been at West Point or the U.S. Naval Academy . . . they would have quit a long time ago,\" he said.\nDuffy called the condition of USMMA a bipartisan issue, and he was accompanied on his visit by a Democratic member of Congress, Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-NY). Four representatives from Long Island, including Suozzi, have introduced a bill to invest $1 billion in federal funding for infrastructure improvements at the USMMA campus over 10 years.\nThe secretary declined to endorse any specific figure, but he pledged to support USMMA's efforts to find funding for improvements. He told Newsday that the academy needs to be rebuilt much more quickly than 10 years.\nDuffy said that part of his rationale for boosting USMMA is the need to counter China on the high seas. He pointed to China's increasing dominance in shipping and shipbuilding as a cause for concern, noting that CSSC built more tonnage in 2024 than the entire production of every American yard since WWII. \"That is going to change . . . and you all are part of that change,\" he told the audience.",

The company was started post-pandemic with a single ship but recently reported it waslooking to expandits operation.\nThe cruise shipsNorwegian Sky(77,104 gross tons) andNorwegian Sun(78,309 gross tons) were the company’s first effort at modernization in the late 1990s. Started in 1965, the brand had failed to keep pace with competitors and due to financial difficulties had not added new cruise ships at the same pace as Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International in the 1990s.\nTheNorwegian Skyhad been ordered by Costa Cruises as a sistership to theCosta Victoriaand was under construction in Germany at Bremer Vulkan when the yard experienced financial difficulties in 1996 and construction was suspended. Norwegian acquired the incomplete ship and finished it at Lloyd Werft introducing it in 1999. It has accommodations for approximately 2,000 passengers and sailed for the cruise line in the Caribbean and a brief period in Hawaii as thePride of Alohabetween 2004 and 2008.\nNorwegian decided to build a sistership which becameNorwegian Sunin 2001. The company had also planned a third sister but did not go forward with the order.\nThe smallest ships in the fleet they also predated Norwegian’s open cruise concept without assigned dining and multiple restaurants. The ships were adapted to the concept but lacked the space to have the full amenities of what the company markets as “Freestyle Cruising.”\nCEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Harry Sommer called the decision to charter a total of four ships from the fleet part of a “disciplined approach to fleet optimization.” Norwegian this week is introducing the third cruise ship in its new series,Norwegian Aqua, and Sommers notes it has a total of seven cruise ships ordered for the brand, including a new class of 200,000-gross ton plus ships.\nCordelia Cruises in its announcement said it would be “unlocking new destinations, introducing longer itineraries, and reimagining what cruising means for India and beyond.” The company to date has operated short cruises on theEmpressacquired from Royal Caribbean International. The renamed Cordelia Sky will enter service from Mumbai in August 2026. The company has not announced itineraries for the Sun which will be leaving Norwegian in the fourth quarter of 2027.\nNorwegian has also chartered theSeven Seas Navigatorfrom Regent Seven Seas Cruises and theInsigniafrom Oceania Cruises to Crescent Seas, a residential cruise line. These charters are scheduled to begin in 2026 and 2027.  The company has three new cruise ships on order for Oceania Cruises, and two cruise ships for Regent Seven Seas Cruises. All of the new ships are being built by Fincantieri in Italy.\n",

The terminal has been under construction since 2022, almost a year after the Adani Group signed the port deal.\nCWIT was developed by a consortium consisting of APSEZ, the Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) under a 35-year Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) agreement.\nThe $800 million CWIT project features a 1,400-meter quay length and 20-meter depth, allowing the terminal to handle approximately 3.2 million TEU annually. This capacity will elevate the status of Colombo port as a key transshipment hub in South Asia. According to APSEZ, CWIT is the first deep-water terminal to be fully automated in Colombo, improving cargo handling and vessel turnaround time.\n“The commencement of operations at CWIT marks a momentous milestone in regional cooperation between India and Sri Lanka. The opening is also a proud moment for Sri Lanka, placing it firmly on the global maritime map,” said Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group.\nLast year, the CWIT project was subjected to scrutiny after U.S prosecutors indicted Gautam Adani for an alleged bribery scheme. Adani has denied these allegations, but some countries - including Kenya - had to cancel deals associated with his companies.\nAlthough the CWIT project progressed, it proceeded without a $500 million loan guarantee from the U.S government. In November 2023, the U.S International Development Finance Corporation announced a loan providing support for the CWIT project. The financing had not been processed by the time Adani Group withdrew from the loan deal in December. At the time, Adani Group said it would finance the terminal through the company’s internal accruals and capital management plan.\nWith CWIT now open, it has to compete for cargo business with other major terminals in Colombo. The China-backed Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) controls the largest share of containers passing through the port. Last year, CICT handled 3.3 million TEUs. Two of SLPA’s controlled terminals - Jaye Container Terminal and the deep-water East Container Terminal - handled 2.4 million TEU. South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) operated by John Keells Holdings handled 2 million TEU. In total, Colombo port handled 7.7 million TEUs, up 12.3 percent compared to 2023.",

    "input": "For months, climate campaigners and industry insiders have projected optimism about the odds of a long-debated global carbon levy on bunker fuel at the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee's 83rd meeting (MEPC 83). Shipping's carbon is regulated by IMO, outside of the framework of the Paris Climate Agreement, and MEPC has repeatedly deferred the question of how to achieve a target of a 50 percent emissions cut by 2050. Consensus appeared to be building around a carbon levy in the run-up to MEPC 83, including a tax proposal from the International Chamber of Shipping.\nWith the change of administration in Washington, continued opposition to a bunker levy from certain petroleum-producing nations, and the global economic uncertainty created by the new U.S. tariff regime, the odds of getting an ambitious bunker tax passed at this MEPC are looking slimmer, campaigners now acknowledge.\n\"In recent years I have often commended the changed course in IMO, as it did indeed seem like there was a credible plan towards a global tax of significance,\" commented Søren Have, Mobility and Infrastructure Lead at Danish think tank CONCITO. \"Now this unfortunately seems much more uncertain. I urge Danish government and shipping firms to keep the course, and push others to follow.\"\n\"This week’s talks at the IMO have been a rollercoaster, with no clear path toward securing an ambitious universal GHG pricing mechanism,\" agreed Anaïs Rios, Shipping Policy Officer at Seas At Risk. \"A universal GHG pricing mechanism isn’t just one of many tools; it’s the only viable way to decarbonize shipping fairly and effectively, ensuring no one is left behind.\"\nIf it were passed, a strong MEPC bunker levy would be a major win for the clean-shipping sector and a major setback for opponents of climate action. It would be more than just a new shipping regulation: the levy would be the first international carbon tax, implemented and overseen by the United Nations.\n\"It would represent a huge moment of solidarity in the fight to tackle climate change,\" said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at Opportunity Green, speaking to the AP. \"For the first time, we will have, hopefully, an effective global framework tackling this international issue. Most emissions are tackled domestically.\"\nClimate researchers and advocate groups have long maintained that a strong, global carbon levy is the only way to provide shipping with an economic incentive to reduce its emissions to meet IMO targets. Green fuels are not commercially competitive with bunker fuel, the lowest-value residual fuel product from oil refining. Reversing this equation would require regulatory action to distort market prices for all players at once, making bunker fuel more expensive (with a levy) and green fuel less expensive (with a subsidy). Independent estimates for an effective bunker levy come to at least $150 per tonne of carbon emitted, which would nearly double the price of HFO.",

The new ship is named after the institute’s founder, the late Silicon Valley innovator and ocean philanthropist David Packard.\nPlanning forDavid Packard,which was funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, began in 2009 when the institute engaged U.S naval architecture and marine engineering firm Glosten to design the vessel. In 2021, the construction contract was awarded to Freire, a well-known specialty yard that also built the Schmidt Ocean Institute's R/VFalkor (Too).\nThe ship is a major addition to MBARI’s capabilities in ocean exploration. At 50 meters long, 12.8 meters wide with a draft of 3.7 meters, the new ship is bigger than its predecessor. The larger size will expand the institute’s ability to study marine life across the West Coast, from the Pacific Northwest to Baja California.\nTheDavid Packardwill replace MBARI’s flagship research vessel, theWestern Flyer,which was retired in 2022 and which was the institute’s workhorse for two and half decades. It now joinsRachel CarsonandParagonin MBARI’s fleet of research vessels.\nHaving arrived in Moss Landing, MBARI’s marine operations team is expected to take on the lengthy process of installing custom equipment and systems for oceanographic research. Also planned is a period in dry dock for maintenance and regulatory inspections before she can return to Moss Landing.\nScience missions aboardDavid Packard,which can accommodate up to 12 crew members and 18 scientists for voyages lasting up to 10 days, will begin later this year.\n“The ship will not only support advanced technology developed by the MBARI team but also promote collaboration across the marine science and technology community. Together, it’s all hands on deck to understand our changing ocean,” said Kaya Johnson, MBARI Director of Marine Operations.\nThe new ship boasts cutting edge technologies. It will serve as the command center for the institute’s remotely operated vehicle, Doc Ricketts, a robotic submersible that can dive up to 4,000 meters underwater.David Packardcan also support the launch and recovery of autonomous technologies, including underwater vehicles that can map the seafloor, conduct visual surveys of the midwater, and monitor ocean health.",

    "input": "\nWorld markets are still trying to adjust to the reality of a U.S. market with steep tariffs, and U.S. consumers are weighing the impact of rising prices for foreign goods. Luckily for consumers, those price hikes will likely be tempered by two things: cheaper oil, thanks to an OPEC production hike and a weakening economic outlook; and falling costs for ocean freight, thanks to reduced demand for shipping.\nAccording to UK-based Pantheon Macroeconomics, a drop in oil prices and shipping costs will offset about one quarter of the expected inflation effects of the White House's tariffs. The consultancy's base case forecast is a one percent additional increase to consumer prices due to the tariff schedule.\nSpot rates for freight to and from the U.S. have been falling since December, and the core Shanghai-LA route is now half the price that it was at the beginning of the year ($2,700 per FEU today vs. $5,500 in early January). Pantheon predicts that less expensive ocean freight will offset tariff hikes, and will take about 0.15 percent off of a key measurement of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index.\nEnergy is also getting cheaper. West Texas Intermediate has fallen from $72 per barrel last week to $61 per barrel on Monday. \"The drop [in oil prices] mostly reflects expectations that global demand will wither due to tariffs, but prices also fell after OPEC unexpectedly announced last week a bigger increase in output,\" explained Pantheon's chief economist Samuel Tombs in a research note.\nThe drop in oil prices means that domestic fuel prices will likely drop by about 14 percent, offsetting tariffs and knocking another 0.1 percent off of inflation.\nOPEC's oil production decision comes after repeated lobbying from the White House. President Donald Trump has been asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers to export more oil and lower the global cost of energy since his first week in office, citing a desire to reduce Russian oil revenue.\n\"[It's] his clear intention to use energy as leverage over Russia to end the war in Ukraine. That said, lower oil prices will certainly not incentivise US oil producers to 'drill, baby, drill' – particularly in high-cost Alaska,\" said David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, speaking to BBC after the inauguration.",

The crewmember was electrocuted after opening a high voltage electrical panel without authorization.\nOn the afternoon of October 13, 2023,Red Stagwas moored alongside at the Adriatic Marine dock in Port Fourchon, and was preparing for its next charter. At about 2000 hours, the vessel's first engineer adjusted ballast by activating the vessel's mud pump system, turning it on and off using the emergency stop button on the aft deck rather than the control panel belowdecks. When finished, he left the e-stop in the \"off\" position. This is normal practice, according to the Coast Guard.\nAt 2330 hours, the crew conducted a watch change. The oncoming engineering watchstander, the \"unqualified engineer,\" was tasked with cleaning the engine room.\nAt about 0530 hours, the unqualified engineer asked the deckhand where he could find a voltage meter. The deckhand did not know, and didn't know why his crewmate needed it. This was the last time that anyone saw the unqualified engineer alive.\nSometime thereafter, the unqualified engineer opened up the 480-volt electrical panel for the mud pump system. His body was found in front of the panel at about 0640, and his fingerprints were later found on a high voltage conductor inside the open panel door.\nThe master called emergency medical services on his cell, and the crew started CPR. The man could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 0740. His death was ruled accidental by the county coroner.\nAccording to the Coast Guard, the unqualified engineer was training for his engineering license but was not qualified to access and work on the 480-volt panel for the mud pump. It is unknown why he opened the panel, but the Coast Guard suspects that he was unaware that the pump e-stop on deck was turned off. He then bypassed company safety policies and attempted to troubleshoot it himself.\n\"It is reasonable to assume that if the Unqualified Engineer was more experienced with the operation of the mud pump system, he may have verified the status of the pump’s emergency stop and de-activated it, preventing him from having to open the 480 volt panel and prevented the incident from occurring,\" the Coast Guard concluded.\nThe investigators also noted thatRed Staglacked some form of an indicator to show that the e-stop was activated; if an indicator had been present, the engineer might have realized that the system was already working as designed. Likewise, a lock on the cabinet would have prevented unauthorized access.\nThe operating company initiated a fleetwide safety stand-down after the fatality to review policies with all crewmembers. The Coast Guard found no regulatory breaches, and made no additional recommendations.",

    "input": "\nAustralian oil and gas company Woodside Energy is selling down its equity stake in its Louisiana LNG project, starting with the sale of a 40 percent stake to U.S.-based investment firm Stonepeak.\nWoodside is getting near to a final investment decision on the LNG production and export project, which it acquired in a $900 million takeover of developer Tellurian last October. The cost of implementing the entire five-train facility near Lake Charles, Louisiana is estimated at $27 billion.\nThe Australian company says that the sale of the 40 percent stake to Stonepeak is timely. Stonepeak is expected to inject $5.7 billion in capital expenditure into the project, covering 75 percent of the project’s capital needs in both 2025 and 2026.\nWoodside says that the stake sale reduces its capital expenditure profile and brings the project one step closer to a FID. Talks continue with other potential partners as Woodside aims to sell another 10 percent stake in the project. Its aim is to retain a 50 percent operating stake in the megaproject, which will produce 27.6 million metric tons per annum (MTPA) when complete.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to a positive FID and the needed regulatory, legal, and other approvals. At that point, Stonepeak is expected to make available $2 billion as part of its capex contribution.\nThe Louisiana LNG project is being built in four phases. Phase I includes two trains with a capacity to produce 11 MTPA, while Phase II has one train with a capacity of 5.5 MTPA. In December last year, Bechtel was awarded the contract for phases one and two, which are estimated to cost $900 to $960 per tonne of capacity. Construction is already well under way, ahead of a final investment decision.\n“The project represents a compelling opportunity to invest in a newbuild LNG export facility nearing FID approval with an attractive risk-return profile and best-in-class partners in both Bechtel and Woodside to construct and operate the asset,” said James Wyper, Stonepeak Senior Managing Director and Head of US Private Equity.\nHe added the significant additional capacity from the Louisiana LNG project will be central in further propelling the status of the U.S as a leading LNG exporter. The country exported 11.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG in 2024, remaining the world’s largest exporter.",

With the termination of the “ineffective” program, the agency is expected to save $32.7 million, funds that have already been appropriated and which will now be redirected to address emerging needs.\nCG-LIMS was among the nearly 500 IT systems that the Coast Guard has invested millions to procure to help execute its various missions. Expected to begin operating in 2027 before reaching full capability in 2031, the CG-LIMS had been marketed as a system that leverages modern and cloud-based technology to deliver an integrated capability.\nIn particular, the system would have allowed the agency to better track its supply needs, ease the logistics burden on field units, provide a modern IT tool for maintenance teams and offer better cybersecurity than current systems. The system was also expected to support maintenance and supply of aircraft, vessels, and shore based assets besides managing asset configuration, supply, maintenance and technical data for capital assets in a single unit.\nThe Coast Guard intended to utilize the system on 245 cutters, 200 aircraft, 1,800 boats, shore-based systems, aids to navigation equipment and command, control, communications, computers, cyber, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment.\nHowever, with DOGE now determining that the program is ineffective, the Coast Guard is expected to stop any acquisition activities and reassign CG-LIMS personnel to fill other critical personnel shortages within the agency.\n“Another win for government efficiency,” said Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security. “$32 million in taxpayer savings thanks to the Coast Guard eliminating an ineffective IT program. I’m proud of the men and women of the Coast Guard, who continue to deliver on the President's agenda and deliver efficiency while securing our borders and maritime approaches.”",

    "input": "\nAs China and South Korea celebrate continued dominance in global shipping, Turkey has recorded a decline for another consecutive year in a sector that was once lucrative for the country. Recent data from the Turkish Exporters Assembly (TIM) indicate that shipyard exports in the first quarter decreased by 27.5 percent to $328 million.In March alone, the exports plunged 40 percent to $86 million compared to the same period last year. As a result, shipbuilding was the worst performing industrial export sector in the first quarter.\nThe decline has been attributed to rising operational costs and difficulties in accessing financing. According to the data, production costs have reached almost the same levels as Norway, which is a key export market for ships built in Turkey. This has seen major Turkish shipyards invest abroad, reportedly to counter declining market conditions back home.\nIn 2023, Tersan Shipyard, a leading shipbuilding company based in Altinova, Turkey, acquired Havyard Leirvik Shipyard in Norway. Tersan said that acquisition is part of its strategy to strengthen its position in Northern Europe and in the global shipbuilding market. During the same year, another Turkish shipbuilding company - Hicri Ercili - acquired Norden Shipyard in Netherlands.\n“Decrease in new orders continue to persist, and we foresee a contraction of over 15 percent in the sector’s exports by the end of the year. The weakening of the Turkish currency has also added new problems to the sector, causing a surge in foreign currency loan interest rates,” chairman of the Ship, Yacht and Services Exporters’ Association (GYHIB) Cem Seven told Ekonomim news.\nLost employment is also now a major concern. The data shows that across over 80 active shipyards in Turkey, employment fell nearly 10 percent in the last seven months. The last time the Turkish shipbuilding sector posted a positive outlook was in 2023, with exports rising 33 percent to $1.94 billion. During that year, the sector surpassed China in tugboat manufacturing and held a global lead in fishing boat construction.",

Both are leased and operated by CK Hutchison, a private Hong Kong-based firm with extensive holdings around the world. The review found potential irregularities, and it could delay or jeopardize the sale of the two terminals to U.S. private equity firm BlackRock - an undesirable outcome for the Trump administration, which supports the sale and wants to see the terminals in American hands.\nIn his review, controller general Anel Flores concluded that CK Hutchison's local subsidiary underpaid Panama by about $300 million, and he claimed that the firm had not properly renewed its contract to operate the two terminals. According to Flores, the renewal was negotiated on terms that were lopsided in favor of CK Hutchison, and he claimed that the resulting deal was never approved by the controller general's office. \"There must be something else going on here, because everyone [at the Panama Canal Authority] negotiated in favor of the company. Nobody wore the Panama jersey,\" Flores alleged.\nFlores plans to submit a complaint with specific charges to prosecutors within days, and Panama's attorney general has already started an ex officio investigation.\nThe decision raises questions about whether Panama will recognize CK Hutchison's right to sell the leases to BlackRock or any other buyer; if the renewal is invalidated, Panama could in theory nationalize the terminals and auction off operating rights to a new concessionaire, Johns Hopkins Latin America expert Benjamin Gedan told the New York Times.\nIt is the latest in a series of setbacks for BlackRock. China's government is strongly opposed to the sale, and has pressured CK Hutchison to delay or cancel it for patriotic reasons. Chinese state-owned ports operators are said to be in talks with Hutchison executives about possible offers to take over the firm's network if the BlackRock deal falls through.\nThe total global value of the Hutchison-BlackRock deal comes to $22.8 billion, and includes dozens of other terminals around the world. The alleged $300 million payment shortfall at Hutchison's Panama subsidiary is equal to little more than one percent of the value of the overall transaction.",

    "input": "For the first time, a small squadron of nine octocopter cargo drones will sail with HMSPrince of Walesand her carrier strike group, according to the Royal Navy. It is a money-saving technological milestone, and marks the first use of unmanned aircraft for replenishment and stores transfer between ships in the task force.\nThe drone squadron will operate alongside the F35B stealth jets and naval helicopters on HMSPrince of Wales, handling deliveries of food, personal packages, and engineering parts weighing up to 68 kilos (150 pounds). The Royal Navy says that this will take helicopter flight hours off of cargo missions and allow the helicopter aircrews to focus on their primary protective missions.\n\"95 percent of stores transferred weigh less than 50kg,\" said Lieutenant Matt Parfitt, drone flight commander with 700X Naval Air Squadron. \"In the past we'd have used a helicopter if a part was urgently needed on another ship. This time we're going to use a remotely-piloted, uncrewed system instead.\"\nThe Malloy T-150 drones used on the deployment have eight two-foot rotor blades and can fly at speeds up to 50 knots, with an endurance of 20-40 minutes. Each drone requires a two-person team - a remote pilot and a command unit monitor - and the unmanned systems can be flown manually or programmed to follow designated waypoints.\nThe drone systems were acquired in August, leaving the Navy with limited time to develop operational procedures, training, and integration with crewed aircraft operations. Lieutenant Parfitt noted the challenges of adapting the primarily land-based systems for maritime use.\n\"These systems have only really been used over land before, so we're also having to understand how we can operate and maintain them in the maritime environment,\" he said.\nThe 700X Naval Air Squadron has assembled a team of 12 sailors to operate the nine drones, initially from three ships in the group. The squadron includes personnel from various naval branches who have been retrained as drone operators.\nAmong them is Able Rate Michael Page, who transitioned from aircraft handling to become a remote pilot qualified on both the Malloy and smaller fixed-wing Puma drones. \"You've got a lot more responsibility in this role and they don't just need to look at your rank, instead they look at your level of skill,\" Page said.\nThe drones were developed through a Ministry of Defence research project aimed at accelerating the adoption of new technology. The Royal Navy's experimental 700X Naval Air Squadron trialed a far larger Malloy T-600 rotary wing drone at RNAS Culdrose in 2022, alongside a Windracers Autonomous Systems Ultra fixed-wing drone.\nThe Ultra is a twin-engine, aluminum-bodied unmanned plane that can drop a payload onto a carrier-sized landing pad at a range of more than 500 nautical miles - but it can't do ship-to-ship vertical replenishment runs, the day-to-day logistics workload of a carrier strike group at sea.",

    "input": "\nThe cruise industry enters 2025 in one of its strongest positions ever as the executives of the cruise lines discussed the near-term challenges looming for the economy and global instability. Speaking at the Opening General Season of the industry trade show Seatrade Cruise Global 2025 they highlighted the industry’s history of resilience and ability to adapt in the face of growing economic and political instability.\nAsked about the current economic climate and how it was impacting the cruise industry, Josh Weinstein, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation, admitted that the industry’s much ballyhooed “wave season” this year was inconsistent and “choppy.” He said Carnival Corp., like most of the industry companies, started 2025 heavily booked with a long duration stretching out to cruises in 2026 and 2027, but consumers have quickly pulled back in the face of the emerging uncertainties.\n“Bookings slowed,” said Weinstein as “people adjusted to the new conditions.” He however believes consumers adjust and the value proposition of cruising will put the industry in a better position. The executives avoided saying “recession,” but it is clearly on everyone’s mind. Weinstein admitted cruising “is not immune from a recession.”\nTariffs and the emerging trade war however they dismissed as having little impact on the cruise industry. The CEOs of Carnival Corp., MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, and Royal Caribbean Group all pointed to the industry’s local supply chains and ability to adjust to avoid tariffs. Pierfrancesco Vago, Executive Chairman of MSC Cruises, also noted that they continue to see Americans traveling to Europe and Europeans booking travel to the United States.\nThe new President and CEO of CLIA (Cruise Lines International Association), Bud Darr who left MSC to run the trade group, highlighted that about a third of the world’s democracies held elections in 2024, acknowledging a global “mood change in policy.” He noted a cyclical nature of policy while saying cruising would be an “evolving industry in an evolving world.”\n“We are not changing our strategy after two days,” said Harry Sommer, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, referencing the launch of Trump’s tariffs and the collapse in global stock markets.\nThe executives pointed to the continuing investments being announced for new ships. At least six cruise ship orders have been announced to coincide with the start of the conference.\n“We have great confidence in the long-term and are managing for the long-term,” said Jason Liberty, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean Group. He noted the lack of building slots at the four European shipyards that build large cruise ships noting the companies were managing construction for the long term.\nWhile CLIA calculates there are 60 cruise ships on order, it was noted that half are under 100,000 gross tons. They said however that cruise ships are getting larger in part to provide space for new and future technologies.\n“We are not building bigger for the sake of bigger,” said Weinstein. He acknowledges the economics of new cruise ships but said they design ships to provide different experiences for people looking for different options. Vago agreed pointing to the ability of smaller cruise ships to go “off the beaten track.”\nThe executives each highlighted that they remained optimistic while there was also a call for more collaboration. They said the industry needs to continue to educate elected officials and others of its value and contribution as well as working with local authorities to address concerns before they become a problem.\nThe conversation with the executives kicked off the three-day trade show. Organizers noted that the conference is marking milestones, including its 40th anniversary with 12,000 attendees. CLIA highlighted its expectations that cruising will continue to grow releasing its projection that 37 million people will cruise in 2025 and better than 13 percent growth to reach 42 million passengers by 2028.",

The Clemencau 25 Carrier Strike Group (CSG) now appears to be heading home to Toulon, and it probably includes a nuclear attack submarine, which has not been identified.\nAs the French return home, UK CSG 25 is preparing to set sail from Portsmouth for an eight-month round trip to the Yokosuka naval base in Japan, involving an outward and inward transit of the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. The CSG 25 flagship HMSPrince of Wales(R09) has completed Exercise Tamber Shield in the North Sea, a 20-day work-up in preparation for the deployment, and has loaded up from an ammunition depot in Scotland. A detailed timetable has not been issued for the deployment, but the CSG is scheduled to depart on April 22.\nBased on a similar deployment to the Pacific by its sister ship HMSQueen Elizabeth(R08) in 2021, the Prince of Wales CSG is likely to transit the Red Sea in May and to return in November. It is unclear whether this plan has been coordinated with the United States, for whom simultaneously maintaining two aircraft carriers in the CENTCOM area places a strain on resources.\nThe United Kingdom has previously participated in strikes on Houthi positions inside Yemen, rather than restricting activities to the defense of merchant shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Hence a precedent has been set politically for the UK CSG to supplement the current campaign against the Houthis, should this be desired, and to linger in the Red Sea. However, this would then impact planned engagements in the Indo-Pacific area, including with the navies of Australia, Japan and the United States.\nOn board HMS Prince of Wales will be two F-35B squadrons, 809 Naval Air Squadron and 617 “The Dambusters” Squadron RAF, Wildcat attack helicopters from 815 Naval Air Squadron, Merlin helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron and a number of Chinooks, as well as Royal Marines unit. It is unclear as yet if a US Marine Corps F-35B squadron will also be embarked, as it was during the similar 2021 deployment, but there will be no US Navy escorts for the CSG.\nOther ships in the UK CSG will include Daring Class destroyer HMSDauntless(D33), Royal Norwegian Navy Nansen Class frigate HNoMSRoald Amundsen(F311), Type 23 anti-submarine frigate HMSRichmond(F239), an Astute Class nuclear attack submarine and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels.

    "input": "\nThe Canadian public has responded to the American tariff on trade. Airline bookings from Canada to American destinations has dropped by an estimated 70%. Many Canadians who had earlier booked passage aboard cruise vessels sailing from American ports or sailing to American destinations - such as Juneau, Alaska or Hawaii - have cancelled their planned trips.\nIntroduction\nAmerica’s trade tariffs have had an impact on the Canadian public, with layoffs expected in multiple sectors across the Canadian economy. A large number of Canadians who had earlier planned to visit the United States as tourists have canceled their plans. Airline operators and cruise ship companies that operate to and from American locations have experienced a decline in customers from Canada, most of whom are planning to travel domestically. Canadian-owned and Canadian-registered cruise vessel operators who sail to and from Canadian locations have experienced an increase in bookings.\nCruise ships sailing from Europe and the UK to the North American Great Lakes have attracted an increasing number of customers over the last several years. The recent imposition of American tariffs on European and British products has potential to affect European and British tourism to North American destinations. Cruise ships sailing between the North Atlantic and Lake Ontario need to transit through American navigation locks located on the Upper St. Lawrence River, where American border patrol officials have the authority to check documents. Cruise ship operators have the option to arrange to have tourists bypass the American navigation locks.\nBypassing the Locks\nA dock capable of berthing Seawaymax size cruise ships is located at the former Port of Cornwall, which might need to be reactivated for the cruise industry. Cruise companies that sail vessels from Toronto and Kingston to locations that include Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City and ocean coastal locations, might consider sailing from Port of Cornwall. Likewise, cruise ship operators that sail from Europe and Britain to the Great Lakes also have the option of sailing to the Port of Cornwall, to transfer their guests to motor coaches for transportation to Port of Johnstown.\nDespite the Port of Johnstown being a bulk freight terminal, passenger cruise vessels have stopped there to transfer passengers to tour buses that carried tourists to and from nearby tourist attractions. There is potential for cruise vessel operators to keep a few vessels on the Canadian side of the Great Lakes, to sail from Port of Johnstown to Georgian Bay, via Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron with stopovers at Kingston, Toronto and Niagara Falls region.\nCanadian Cruising\nA 120-feet length mini cruise vessel dubbedKawartha Voyageurhas clearance to sail from Kingston at the northeast corner of Lake Ontario, through the navigation locks of the Rideau Canal that connects to Ottawa, with additional clearance to sail the Ottawa River to Montreal. The vessel does on occasion sail to Quebec City. A slightly larger vessel with 35 cabins, dubbedCanadian Empress,is cleared to sail the Ottawa River between Montreal and Ottawa. It regularly sails along the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City.\nWhile the dimensions ofCanadian Empressare slightly smaller than the navigation locks along the Rideau Canal, it usually sails along the Upper St. Lawrence River from Kingston to Montreal and the Ottawa river to and from Ottawa. Due to the imposition of American tariffs and a crackdown on foreign nationals in the USA, the operator has the option to divert guests around American customs at the navigation lock. The vessel is able to berth at Canadian marinas located on both sides of the navigation lock, potentially allowing guests to travel a short distance by bus between marinas.\nWestern and Northern Cruises\nSeveral Vancouver–area companies that own small cruise vessels offer the equivalent of river cruises by sailing the Inside Passage from Vancouver and into scenic inlets that connect to the Strait of Georgia. While not a tourist ship, a Canadian passenger ferry service sails the scenic route from Vancouver to small communities located along Canada’s Pacific coast. Canadian small – cruise vessel companies that sail from the Port of Vancouver aim their services at a different market than mega-scale cruise vessels.\nThe small vessels carry anywhere from 6 to over 50 guests and offer a very different itinerary to mega-scale vessels, which are unable to turn around within the limited width of the scenic inlets. Unlike cruise ships that make brief stopovers, the small vessels make extended duration stops at small coastal villages, to the delight of many of their guests. Summertime Arctic cruises are becoming popular. One multiday Arctic cruise sails from Port of Churchill on Hudson Bay with ports of call extending to Western Greenland. It interconnects with a passenger train from Winnipeg.\nConclusions\nAmerican tariffs have elicited a response from Canadian citizens who previously flocked to American tourist destinations and boarded cruise vessels at American ports. Tariffs have begun to hit the tourist industry. Canadians - along with guests from numerous overseas origins - are becoming selective when booking passage aboard cruise vessels.",

    "input": "\nThe Nordic Association of Marine Insurers (Cefor) has released its 2024 hull and machinery coverage report, shining a spotlight on emerging trends in the marine insurance market. Cefor has a coverage share of about 56 percent of the world fleet above 20,000 gross tonnage (GT).\nA major highlight in the report is the rising claim cost per vessel since the pandemic. While the major claims impact was benign in the period from 2015 to 2022, with only an occasional claim exceeding $30 million, both 2023 and 2024 saw claims above $50 million. In 2023 and 2024, the claim cost per vessel was 22 percent higher than the average of the period 2017-2019. Cefor attributes this to the shipping trend towards larger and more valuable vessels, which somewhat heightens the probability of very large losses.\n“Machinery damage showed a substantial increase in recent years, which should be seen in the context of an aging fleet. Among the largest losses, fires and collisions dominate,” said Cefor Actuary Astrid Seltmann.\nCefor predicts that a silver tsunami is in the offing, with many vessels delivered in the years after the financial crises (2008-2012) now getting old (13-17 years). These vessels are prone to fires, machinery claims and consequential damages. Machinery claims accounted for 56% of the claims cost for these vessels compared to a 35% share on vessels built in later years.\nLast year, eleven machinery claims above $5 million were reported. This compares to seven such claims in 2023 and nine in 2022. The majority of machinery claims represent damage to the main engine, followed by auxiliary engines and propeller shafts.\nAgain, fires and collisions represented the costliest claims in 2024. Since 2019, the number of fires in container vessels has increased, raising concerns in the shipping industry. In 2023, the two largest losses above $50 million were fires, and four out of eight losses above $10 million were fires. In 2024, four out of nine losses above $10 million were fires; the two largest were collisions.\nChristian Irgens, chair of Cefor’s Statistics Forum, also highlighted an increase in heavy weather losses, which might be linked to vessel rerouting through more weather-exposed areas. Weather-related casualties from the end of 2023 through the second quarter of 2024 showed a steady increase exceeding the seasonal variation of the preceding years. Increased exposure to weather events on the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope might have had an impact on the occurrence of weather-related damage.",

    "input": "\nSaudi-backed media outlet Al Hadath has reported the death of the Houthi intelligence chief, Abdul Nasser Al-Kamali, in an American airstrike. It is the latest reported fatality among the Houthis' leadership ranks from the intensified U.S. bombing campaign, which is now in its fourth week.\nWhite House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz claimed last week that a U.S. strike took out an unnamed Houthi missile expert, without providing further details. The Pentagon has not confirmed the claim.\n“It’s been a bad three weeks for the Houthis, and it’s about to get worse,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday.\nThe group continues to hit back, albeit at a slower pace than before the airstrike campaign. On Monday, a Houthi spokesman said that the group launched an attack on Tel Aviv with a drone, along with an attempted strike on two U.S. Navy destroyers. The Israeli Defense Force said in a statement that the drone was shot down before it crossed into Israeli airspace, and that no air raid alerts were required.\nThe Houthis have routinely launched strikes on Israeli and American targets, with limited success; the group has yet to land a confirmed hit on a U.S. Navy vessel, and it only managed to sink two merchant ships in more than 100 attempts in 2024. Both sinkings required repeated follow-up attacks.\nStockpile effects\nThe cost of the Trump administration's intensified bombing campaign on Yemen is approaching $1 billion, according to the New York Times, raising concerns about the effects on U.S. guided weapons stockpiles. Officials say that Navy pilots have to use standoff weapons to hit Houthi targets, consuming part of the inventory of slow-to-replace advanced munitions.\nOver the longer course of the conflict, the steady stream of incoming Houthi drones and missiles has also drained the U.S. Navy's stockpile of advanced interceptors, including the SM-class missiles it needs to shoot down high-end cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. In any future conflict with China, these missiles would be an essential ingredient for the defense of the surface fleet and shoreside installations.\nThe U.S. Navy's top officer, acting chief of naval operations Adm. James Kilby, said Tuesday that he regrets not pursuing modest laser weapons to take down drone-sized objects. The Navy fielded an anti-drone laser on a deployed warship as early as 2014, but fleetwide use has yet to materialize after 11 years of R&D. In the Red Sea battle environment, the lack of a laser means using up multi-million-dollar missiles on $2,000 inbound drones. Destroyer crews have used up about 200 SM-class missiles defending themselves and nearby shipping from Houthi munitions, and Kilby told Fox that the lack of \"better ways to more economically attrit the threat\" was a problem.\nUnder Adm. Kilby's watch as the former deputy commander of Fleet Forces Command, the Navy tried to develop exquisite high-end lasers in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 megawatts, \"and I have regret for that,\" Kilby told Fox. He said that the Navy is hard at work now on low-cost ways to counter autonomous threats, and he called on munitions manufacturers to speed up production.",

With H2 fuel cell power, it will be able to operate with zero carbon emissions, which will soon be a regulatory requirement for operations in Norway's World Heritage fjords (a major attraction in Viking's core Scandinavian market).\nIt will be fitted with fuel cells producing up to six megawatts of power, equivalent to roughly 8,000 horsepower of generator capacity. The PEM fuel cell technology and related equipment are supplied by the Fincantieri subsidiary Isotta Fraschini; to solve the supply chain problems of hydrogen bunkering, it uses a containerized fuel storage system to load and store the fuel.\n\nViking chief Torsten Hagen (left) unveils Viking Libra at Seatrade Cruise Global 2025 (Allan Jordan / TME)\n“LNG is not a way to the future, but . . . this new solution is a good bet for the future,\" said Viking chairman and CEO Torsten Hagen in a presentation at Seatrade Cruise Global.\nViking said that price is an issue for H2-powered operation, but they believe that the price will come down in the future, and they want to illustrate a path forward for the industry. The containerized approach addresses the challenges of storage and distribution, and makes it possible to add incremental power capacity with more 1.5 MW units.\n\"Viking made the principled decision to invest in hydrogen, which offers a true zero-emission solution,\" said Hagen. \"We look forward to welcoming the world's first hydrogen-powered cruise ship to our fleet.\"\nA follow-on vessel,Viking Astrea,will also be fitted for hydrogen power and is already under construction at Ancona.

The U.S. has also reportedly withdrawn its delegation from the talks, effective Wednesday.\nThe response is in line with the administration's combative rhetoric towards carbon regulations and other international agreements, but it is a stark departure from the neutral tone that U.S. negotiators previously maintained. It is unclear whether senior White House leadership was involved in formulating the moreaccommodatingU.S. negotiating position that American representatives projected in the runup to this week's MEPC meeting in London, which ends Friday.\n\"Should such a blatantly unfair measure go forward, our government will consider reciprocal measures so as to offset any fees charged to U.S. ships and compensate the American people for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures,\" the White House wrote in a last-minute warning to other national delegations. \"We must be clear the U.S. rejects any and all efforts to impose economic measures against its ships based on GHG emissions or fuel choice.\"\nAny participation in a tax on shipping's GHG emissions - the first global carbon levy of any kind - would have been in deep conflict with White House policy on climate change. President Donald Trump campaigned against climate action and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement on the first day of his second term, and he has promoted the production and use of all fossil fuels - including the renewed use of coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel.\nAn IMO bunker levy would also boost shipbuilding activity in East Asia, which would undercut White House policy goals. The Trump administration wants to reduce the power of Chinese shipyards, which lead the market and would stand to benefit from any IMO incentives for green retrofits and newbuilds.

    "input": "\nInfested boats are aiding the transportation of invasive termites across the globe, spreading insect species that cause economic damages running into the billions of dollars, a new study reveals.\nThe study by researchers at the University of Florida concludes that recreational vessels - yachts, cabin cruisers, sailboats and similar personal craft - have become the main means of transportation for termite stowaways.\nAided by maritime transportation, the damage caused by the invasive termite species like the Formosan subterranean, Asian subterranean and West Indian drywood is significant and continues to rise. Since 2010, termite infestations have been linked to an annual economic impact exceeding $40 billion globally, with the Formosan subterranean alone causing an estimated $20 to $30 billion in damage.\nAlthough historically termites have been suspected of being able to travel long distances on floating debris after natural disasters like hurricanes, tsunamis or landslides, private boats have made it much easier for termites to spread. The fact that recreational boats are not routinely checked for termites has allowed small vessels to become mobile breeding grounds for colonies, with the end result being unchecked spread.\n“Instead of a few termites accidentally crossing oceans once in a million years, we now have a high probability of them traveling on infested boats every year, dramatically increasing their spread potential,” said Thomas Chouvenc, lead researcher.\nIn the study published in the ScienceDirect journal, researchers summarized a combination of field surveys, genetic analysis and historical data to make a compelling case that boats, particularly those used for recreation, are a major cause for the spread of termites across continents. In fact, owing to the fact that termite pests are excellent at associating with human activity, boats provide an ideal environment for them to travel far beyond their native habitats.\nThe study states that most termites remain within their native regions, unable to thrive in urban environments. However, the species responsible for the most damage have adapted to urban climates.\nOnce an infestation is established in a boat, it can easily spread onshore. The termites, often carried in hidden colonies aboard boats, can spread to other on shore regions when flying termites are attracted to city lights. Once colonies are established on land, the species continue to spread, creating new infestations in other boats and urban areas.\nA case in point is South Florida, popularly known as the \"yachting capital of the world,\" which has also become a hot spot for invasive termite species - thanks to the many discoveries of termite colonies in recreational boats.\nData by the National Marine Manufacturers Association show that Florida is the top state in the U.S when it comes to recreational boating, boasting more than one million registered boats with an annual economic impact of $31.3 billion.\n“In Florida and many other tropical regions, the risk is high because recreational boating is so prevalent,” warned Chouvenc. “Boats in these areas are likely to be infested, but unless owners take proactive steps, the spread of termites will continue unchecked.”\nBy becoming the preferred means of transportation for termite stowaways, boats are aiding in their economic destruction - particularly for homeowners and businesses due to their tendencies to damage wood in structures and infest trees.\nChouvenc says that regular inspection of vessels for signs of infestation is one of the main ways to curb the spread of invasive termites.",

    "input": "\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union finalized a new regulation aimed at reducing microplastic pollution caused by plastic pellets. Representatives from the European Parliament and the EU Council agreed to provisional terms on measures designed to improve handling practices across the entire plastic pellet supply chain, both on land and at sea.\n\"Microplastics, including plastic pellets are now found everywhere — in our oceans, seas and even in the food we eat. Each year, the equivalent of up to 7,300 truckloads of plastic pellets are lost to the environment. Today, the EU has taken a landmark step toward reducing pellet pollution by adopting measures to tackle losses and ensure correct handling, including in maritime transport,\" said Paulina Hennig-Kloska, Poland's Minister for Climate and Environment.\nThe legislation lays out mandatory requirements for both European and non-European operators. The framework outlines clear responsibilities in cases of accidental spills, emphasizing immediate cleanup operations. Every facility handling plastic pellets will be required to develop a risk management strategy addressing packaging methods, loading and unloading procedures, employee training programs, and essential equipment specifications.\nTo ensure equal standards apply to all parties involved in pellet transportation, non-EU carriers must designate an authorized representative within European Union borders, promoting accountability and operational transparency.\nThe agreement takes a tiered approach. Large companies processing over 1,500 tonnes of pellets per year must obtain verification from independent third-party auditors. Smaller operations exceeding the same volume threshold will benefit from simplified requirements, including a one-time certification valid for five years following implementation. Microenterprises and those handling under 1,500 tonnes yearly will only need to provide a self-declaration of compliance.\nThe environmental impact of pellet contamination in aquatic ecosystems can last decade, since these materials resist natural biodegradation processes. With maritime shipping accounting for nearly 38% of all pellet transportation within the EU in 2022, the agreement also establishes specific maritime protocols. These include packaging requirements and mandatory disclosure of transport and cargo information, aligning with International Maritime Organisation guidelines.\nBefore final adoption, both the Council and Parliament must formally endorse the provisional agreement. Following legal and linguistic refinement, the regulation will be published in the EU's Official Journal, coming into force two years afterward. Maritime-specific provisions will receive an additional year for implementation to allow for industry adjustment.\nAccording to the EU, between 52,140 and 184,290 tonnes of plastic pellets entered Europe's environment in 2019 alone. Leakage occurs at multiple points throughout the production and distribution chain. Currently, no specific EU legislation addresses plastic pellet pollution, despite their ranking as the third largest source of unintentional microplastic releases after paint particles and tire fragments.\nA recent incident highlighted the ongoing threat. In March, half-burned plastic nurdles washed ashore along England's east coast after the allision of the boxshipSolongwith the tankerStena Immaculate.While not directly toxic, these plastic resin balls pose risks to wildlife if ingested, according to HM Coastguard.\nResearch has shown that pellets comprise about 70 percent of the plastic eaten by seabirds, with small plastic particles being found in the stomachs of 63 of the world’s approximately 250 species of seabirds.",

Only China remains subject to the White House's steep nation-by-nation tariff schedule, and its exporters now face a crippling levy of 125 percent. Most trade with other nations - including favored new locations for Chinese manufacturers, likeVietnam- will only be subject to a 10 percent levy.\nInvestors responded positively as soon as the White House announced the 90-day delay. The Dow shot up eight percent; the S&P 500 rebounded nearly 10 percent; and the Nasdaq soared upwards 12 percent.\nIn Asia, the Nikkei jumped up eight percent and Singapore's STI benchmark rose by five percent in early trading Thursday morning. Even the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hang Seng index ticked upwards, despite the extreme U.S. tariff rates facing Chinese manufacturers.\nBuoyed by positive predictions for economic growth in the U.S., cruise stocks were some of the biggest winners. Carnival Cruise Line's stock - a benchmark for the travel and leisure industry - soared by more than 17 percent. Royal Caribbean jumped by 16 percent, and Norwegian Cruise Line went up by 18 percent. In one day of trading, all three regained almost all of the losses they had sustained since April 2, the day that the White House first announced the new tariff regime.\nA parallel rebound in oil prices triggered some signs of share price recovery in the offshore segment. The rig leader Transocean rose by 10 percent, offsetting the massive 35 percent drop it suffered last week. OSV giant Tidewater also began to recover, posting a 10 percent jump. Tanker stocks have also done well, if not yet enough to reverse earlier declines: CMB.Tech rose six percent; Teekay rose five percent; and Scorpio rose by three percent.\nIn the liner segment, almost all players saw substantial single-digit gains, led by Yang Ming (up nearly 10 percent). Chinese operators face a more challenging picture, given continued tariffs and the threat of new port fees on Chinese vessels. COSCO Shipping Holdings, the publicly-listed component of state-owned giant China COSCO, edged down by one percent early Thursday.\nThe trade landscape could still change rapidly. The reciprocal-tariff suspension will last for 90 days, according to the White House, and will give time for nations to negotiate with the Trump administration in talks led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",

Four will be operated under the Grimaldi Lines brand sailing under the Italian flag, while two will be for Minoan Lines, under the Greek flag. These six, belonging to the “Next Generation Med” class, will serve routes in the Mediterranean. The other three, which debuts as the “Hansa Superstar” class, will be delivered to Finnlines to serve routes in the Baltic Sea.\nAt a length of 229 meters, the Mediterranean ro-pax vessels will have a cargo capacity of 3,300 lane meters for rolling freight and over 300 cars and up to 2,500 passengers. The Baltic Sea newbuilds will be 240 meters long with a cargo capacity of 5,100 lane meters for rolling freight plus 90 cars and up to 1,100 passengers.\nGrimaldi has a long relationship with China Merchants, and the new orders extend that partnership with the introduction of fuel-efficient technology. The new vessels will have optimized hull and propeller designs, energy-efficient onboard power management systems, shore power readiness and the application of silicon-based hull coatings. They will reduce CO? emissions per transported cargo unit by more than 50 percent compared to vessels currently operating on the same routes, Grimaldi says.\n“The new Next Generation Med and Hansa Superstar classes are the result of a thorough study of our customers’ needs and, more broadly, those of shipping. Today more than ever, the latter requires quality, efficiency and environmental sustainability to remain a key mode of national and international freight and passenger transport,” said Emanuele Grimaldi, Grimaldi Group Managing Director.\nHe added that the performance in CO? emission reduction and the use of methanol are critical components in the company’s net zero goals. Grimaldi is working to achieve zero emissions by 2050.\nThe new order comes just weeks after the company took delivery of the last of 14 hybrid ro-ro ships of its \"fifth generation\" class, built at China Merchants Jinling shipyard in Nanjing. This year and next year, the company also expects to start taking delivery of five new pure car and truck carriers from China Merchants.",

This week, Swan Defense and Heavy Industries Limited, the company that runs Pipavav Shipyard in Gujarat, signed an MoU with the state-run Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineering Ltd (GRSE). The partnership will see the two shipyards jointly pursue opportunities in the construction of commercial vessels and offshore structures.\nPipavav has the largest dry dock in India, measuring 662 meters by 65 meters, and a working space spanning 500 acres. Unfortunately, even with a big dock capacity, it has not attracted substantial orders after resuming operations in December.\nOn the other hand, the Ministry of Defense- controlled GRSE has built a legacy in naval construction. However, it is looking to expand into the commercial shipbuilding segment. This has started to take shape with GRSE last year getting an order for four multi-purpose cargo vessels from the German shipping company Carsten Rehder.\nAccording to industry analysts, the MoU could see GRSE utilize Pipavav’s facilities, especially in executing its commercial orders. On the defense side, GRSE has seen a surge in naval shipbuilding contracts. Currently, the shipyard has orders for about 40 naval platforms. Based on this rising demand, GRSE in a recent earnings call said that it has increased its annual capacity to 24 ships this year, with plans for a greenfield facility in the next 3-5 years.\nMeanwhile, GRSE this week announced receiving a letter of award (LoA) worth over $50 million from the government of India. This will go into the construction and delivery of two coastal research vessels for the Geological Survey of India.

But the reality is that this is a local issue, with Iran and the GCC having common cause in clamping down on the smuggling carried out by these small tankers. Subsidies paid out in Iran are a huge drain on the government budget. Within the GCC, VAT, sales and corporation taxes, depending on the country concerned, are effectively avoided by purchasing smuggled fuels sold on the black market.\nMany of the smuggling operations are bankrolled by Gulf businessmen, just as pirate expeditions were centuries ago. The enterprises often employ stateless captains and crews, and vessels that are incorrectly registered or were apparently scrapped years ago.  When Iran seizes an unregistered tanker that previously called in a GCC port, the GCC country concerned is often keen not to be identified and is reluctant to intervene on behalf of those detained.\nBeyond fuel, there is a thriving industry of small-boat smuggling across the Gulf. The flow of goods is determined by subsidy arbitrage, but also by the fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, all determined by market forces.  In one month, trader boats from Iran can be bringing out pistachio nuts and returning with appliances. In the next month it will be live sheep being taken south and cigarettes heading north.",

A copy of the finalorderwas obtained by TME, and it includes the following measures:\n- Directs the creation of a Maritime Action Plan (MAP) to revitalize U.S. maritime industries.\n- Directs the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to make recommendations about China’s anticompetitive shipbuilding policies, and to consider tariffs on Chinese-built cargo cranes.\n- Directs Customs and Border Protection to charge the U.S. Harbor Maintenance Fee on all foreign cargoes that arrive in ports in Mexico or Canada and then enter the United States via land, plus a 10 percent service charge.\n- Directs the Department of Transportation and Office of Management and Budget to propose a Maritime Security Trust Fund for U.S. shipping, funded by tariffs, fines, fees or other dedicated revenue streams.\n- Directs the Department of Transportation to write a legislative proposal for a Shipbuilding Financial Incentives Program, which would supplement or replace the Small Shipyard Grant Program and the Federal Ship Financing (Title XI) Program.\n- Directs multiple agencies to draft a legislative proposal for \"national maritime scholarships\" to send maritime experts abroad to learn \"cutting edge techniques and subjects.\"\n- Directs multiple agencies to propose a Maritime Prosperity Zone system to incentivize investment in waterfront communities.\n- Directs the Department of Transportation to take action on U.S. Merchant Marine Academy repairs and long-range infrastructure budgeting, in conjunction with the Department of Government Efficiency.\n- Directs a review of federal shipbuilding procurement, aiming to \"identify for elimination excessive requirements, including the number of government reviews and onerous regulations.\"\n- Directs a review of cargo preference rates and whether they could be increased to support U.S.-flagged shipping.\n- Directs the Departments of Defense, Transportation (MARAD) and Homeland Security (Coast Guard) to identify maritime regulations for elimination.\n\"We used to build a ship a day, and now we don't do a ship a year, practically,\" Trump said. \"We're going to be spending a lot of money on shipbuilding, we're way, way behind.\"\nAmerican shipyards and shipbuilders welcomed the news of the order.\n\"With this executive order, it is clear that President Trump and his administration is deeply committed to reenergizing and investing in our nation’s shipyards and we are eager to begin this important work alongside policymakers and industry partners to restore America’s shipbuilding strength,\" said Matthew Paxton, President of the Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA).\n\"We thank President Trump and the White House for taking historic steps to revitalize American shipbuilding,\" said the Florida-based shipyard Eastern Shipbuilding Group (ESG) in a statement. \"As a multi-generation, American-owned shipyard, we know firsthand how important our industry is to America’s economic prosperity and security. With the world’s most skilled craftsmen, we can strengthen our industrial capacity and uphold our dominance on the seas. Let’s get it done!\"\n“Today, President Trump delivered a major step towards resurrecting America’s maritime industry and ushering in a golden age in American shipbuilding,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy in a statement. “We will ensure the United States remains the premier maritime power and an economic powerhouse. And to the young Americans from all over the country who are interested in a maritime career – know that this administration has your back and believes you are a worthwhile investment in the prosperity of America.”",

It comes as the cruise line, which is already the largest in Europe, is further expanding its presence in the North American market including its largest deployment to date in 2026-2027.\nTheMSC World Americawas delivered by Chantiers de l’Atlantique on March 27 as the second of a planned four-ship class. At the same time, assembly began on the third cruise ship,MSC World Asia, which will enter service in late 2026 in the Mediterranean. Steel cutting also began forMSC World Atlanticwhich will be delivered in 2027 and will begin sailing from Port Canaveral, Florida. The class began withMSC World Europadelivered in 2022.\nAt 216,638 gross tons,MSC World Americais one of a few cruise ships to currently exceed the 200,000 gross ton threshold. MSC became the second cruise company to reach the mark with this class after Royal Caribbean International. Later this year, Disney Cruise Line will also deploy Disney Adventure which will be 208,000 gross tons, and both Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line have ordered ships that will exceed this size threshold being built by Fincantieri.\n\n\nArrival in PortMiami on Monday, April 7 (courtesy PortMiami)\n\nMSC World Americais 1,094 feet in length (333 meters) with 2,614 passenger cabins. The ship accommodates 6,762 passengers and has 2,138 crew. Like all modern cruise ships, it offers a wide array of amenities, including 19 dining venues and 18 bars and lounges. There is an outdoor water park with an over-water swing and ropes course, as well as both interior and exterior promenades with bars, cafes, and shops. The line highlights the additions of a sports bar, comedy club, and an outdoor family entertainment area among the efforts to tailor the ship to the American market.\nThe naming celebration included appearances by music stars Mark Anthony, Gloria Estefan, and Kimberly Davis. At the naming ceremony Drew Barrymore and Orlando Bloom, who are in MSC’s new branding advertisement “Lets Holiday” appeared and Barrymore was the ship’s godmother. The evening was capped off by a drone show over theMSC World Americabefore sailing to the Bahamas on a preview cruise. The ship starts commercial service on Saturday, April 12, sailing year-round from Miami.\n\n\nDuring Miami drone show (Allan Jordan)\n\nThe ship is the latest in the cruise line’s expansion in the North American market. MSC is using four homeports, Miami, Port Canaveral, Galveston, and New York, plus scheduling its first cruises to Alaska from Seattle. The 2026-2027 season will include a total of seven ships cruising in North America.\nAs another part of the expansion, the group officially opened what they are calling the world’s largest cruise terminal in PortMiami with nearly 500,000 square feet and the ability to process 36,000 passengers per day. Designed by Arquitectonia and built by Fincantieri Infrastructure at a cost reported between $400 and $500 million (including $186 million from PortMiami), it can handle three large cruise ships at one time and will be the terminal for both MSC Cruises and its luxury brand Explora Journeys. Among the advanced technologies in use will be biometrics to speed up the handling of passengers.\n\n\n(courtesy MSC Cruises)\n\nMSC Cruises highlights thatMSC World Americais the company’s 23rd cruise ship. In approximately 20 years, the group has built 19 cruise ships at Chantiers de l’Atlantique and Fincantieri using five prototypes. In addition to the two ships under construction in France, MSC’s Explora brand has four cruise ships being built in Italy. During tonight’s presentation, Chief Executive Officer of MSC Cruises, Gianni Onorato, said the family-owned business has promised to build even more cruise ships.\n",

    "input": "\nAs markets continue to fall on the news of a 145 percent tariff on all Chinese goods, the White House has quietly signaled that it will soften its plans for multimillion-dollar port fees on Chinese ships - fees that U.S. oil companies, exporters and farmers strongly opposed.\nSix sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the White House may delay or reduce the fees proposed by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). The head of the office, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, confirmed Tuesday that some of the fees might not be put into action and might not be added together.\nThe fees - which could have cost up to $3.5 million per port call for Chinese-built ships, under the original plan - drew protests from major domestic industries. The fees would have raised the cost of shipping for exporting oil, grain, machinery and other goods, making them less competitive or pricing them out of the global market, with broader effects on the U.S. economy. Some smaller U.S.-based carriers like Atlantic Container Line (ACL) warned that they would have to shut down American operations, and at least one major U.S. shipowner - Genco - said that it might cease calling in U.S. ports. Energy Products Partners, a leading U.S. midstream firm, warned that the fees would also have a devastating impact on oil and gas exports. If the fees take effect, \"there will be no ‘drill baby drill’ [and] the ‘liquid gold’ under our feet would stay in the ground,\" EPP told Lloyd's List.\nReuters' sources said that USTR had not considered all types and sizes of ships when it formulated the port fees. The multimillion-dollar flat-fee structure was designed only with the largest container ships in mind; the impacts on tankers, bulkers, ro/ros and smaller boxships were not taken into account before the policy proposal was released. Now that USTR is looking at the broader effects on shipping, the fee structure will likely be recalibrated based on vessel size, making it proportional to the amount of cargo carried.\nThe administration's new executive order on revitalizing American maritime - a policy directive signed Tuesday - could be used as an alternative way to pursue USTR's domestic  objectives, instead of penalizing foreign-flag shipowners with fees on Chinese ships, according to World Shipping Council President & CEO Joe Kramek.\n\"The Executive Order outlines several encouraging elements that reflect a serious focus on rebuilding the American maritime industry,\" Kramek said Thursday. \"Measures to impose retroactive port fees would disadvantage all aspects of the supply chain - from consumers to farmers, from energy producers to manufacturers.\"\nWSC previously raised the possibility of a legal challenge to USTR's fees. Last month, Kramek suggested that USTR's action was a plan to boost U.S. domestic shipbuilding, rather than a proposal to counter unfair trade practices. \"Generating demand for domestic products and raising government revenue – whether to support a domestic industry or for other purposes – are not permissible bases for actions under Section 301,\" said Kramek in a statement last month, referring to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974.",

The Level 1 AiP was given by Bureau Veritas Marine& Offshore. This brings the groundbreaking Service Operation Vessel (SOV) design closer to reality.\nThe 100% hydrogen-powered SOV will be able to operate 95 percent of the time with zero carbon emissions during standard operations. This will lead in a reduction of an estimated 4,000 tonnes of annual CO2 emissions. The vessel will have capacity to accommodate up to 90 technicians for up to 14 days at sea, eliminating the need for additional offshore infrastructure. Refueling has been streamlined, as bunkering can be completed in six hours using trailers, eliminating the need for high-cost port facilities.\nLDA introduced the hydrogen SOV concept design back in March 2024, in cooperation with Norwegian naval architecture company Salt Ship.\n“We believe in developing purpose-built SOVs tailored to specific projects and needs. We are already offering alternative fuel options such as full electric and dual-fuel methanol. We firmly believe that hydrogen will be one of the options in the near future. This AiP represents a key step in making hydrogen-powered maritime operations a reality,” said LDA.\nOther projects working to develop liquid hydrogen-powered vessels include the H2ESTIA Project, led by the Dutch innovation company NIM and supported by the Dutch government. The project launched last month, and aims to design, construct and demonstrate a hydrogen-powered bulk vessel to operate in the North Sea and beyond. The short-sea and inland shipping company Van Dam Shipping will manage the vessel.\nHowever, in its bi-annual 2025 Hydrogen Market Outlook report this week, BloombergNEF indicated that the hydrogen sector has been in decline. “Costs have remained high and demand stayed low as a result. Policy has failed to bridge the gap between prices suppliers need to build viable projects and the prices buyers need to get justifiable business case. As a result, investments in the sector fell in 2024, with developers canceling projects,” said Martin Tengler, Head of Hydrogen Research, BloombergNEF.\nBut Tengler believes a rebound could be expected in places such as Europe, China, Japan and South Korea, where there are incentives offering developers opportunities for investment.",

On Tuesday, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with Robert Maersk, Chairman of the A.P Moller- Maersk board, who was on a business tour in the country. Sharif hailed the investment as a significant boost to Pakistan’s maritime sector.\nMaersk initially announcedthe investment last year in October, during the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU) between Denmark and Pakistan on maritime development. At the time, the MoU was signed by Danish Minister for Industry and Business Morten Bodskov and Pakistani Minister for Maritime Affairs Qaisser Ahmed Shaikh.\nPrime Minister Sharif has directed Pakistani authorities to fast-track conversion of the MoU into a formal agreement. He also directed formation of a technical working group to accelerate drafting of a maritime collaboration agreement with Maersk, with recommendations to be presented within a month.\n“Pakistan has a crucial role as an economic corridor for trade with Central Asia, a key factor for our company. Maersk is committed to modernizing Pakistan’s port logistics and equipping them with advanced technology to establish a major maritime trade hub in the region,” said Robert Maersk.\nMaersk also emphasized that his company has a long history in the region, with the first Maersk ship arriving in Pakistan in 1924. Maersk is reportedly exploring options of developing a deep-water container terminal, with a focus on Karachi and Port Qasim.\nThe investment from Maersk coincides with reforms in Pakistan port sector announced by the Prime Minister’s Office on Monday. A maritime taskforce is already in place tasked with the responsibility of reviving Pakistan’s maritime economy. Some of the recommendations by the taskforce include setting up a National Dredging Company, which will oversee dredging of all ports in the country. In addition, a plan of action has been prepared for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) through a public-private partnership for the next 25 years.\n“The pace of installing the latest scanners at all ports should be accelerated. Trade tariffs should be reviewed to bring the country’s ports to a competitive standard,” Sharif said in a meeting with the taskforce.\nTop image: Port Qasim, Pakistan (Sana Sneha / CC BY SA 4.0)",

    "input": "The head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command supports reactivating the naval airbase at Adak, a remote Cold War station in the Aleutian Islands - but the U.S. military isn't the only interested party, according to Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). An unnamed Chinese shipping company has also reached out to the current landowner to express interest in negotiating a lease, Sullivan said at a Senate Armed Services CommitteehearingThursday.\nAdak was a key naval base throughout the Cold War, providing a logistics and surveillance hub near Russia's eastern shores. After the Base Realignment and Closure Commission process in the mid-1990s, it was shut down, and it ceased operations in 1997. The land is now held by the native Aleut Corporation.\nThe port's remoteness and austerity are hard to overstate: at 1,000 nautical miles west of Anchorage, it is closer to the capital of Russia's Kamchatka region than it is Alaska's main city. It is the second-rainiest place in the United States, and is subject to extreme winds, including hurricane-force North Pacific winter storms. As of 2022 it had a population of about 150 people, down from 6,000 at its peak.\nThe U.S. military still holds occasional exercises at Adak, and talk of reviving the base has circulated since at least2021. The regional security situation is changing: Over the last three years, Russian and Chinese forces have begun operating jointly in the North Pacific and Bering Sea, sometimes crossing over into the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. These transits have received considerable attention, and Adak would be a natural location for an enhanced U.S. deterrent presence, Sen. Sullivan said Thursday.\nAdm. Sam Paparo, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told the committee that he also favors reactivating Adak. \"It is a further western point which would enable . . . [gaining] time and distance on any force capability that's looking to penetrate,\" Paparo said. \"It would enable up to 10x the maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft coverage of that key and increasingly contested space.\"\nSullivan suggested that Adak should be reactivated as a matter of urgency, as the U.S. Navy is not the only prospective tenant.\n\"The Aleut Corporation, these are great patriotic Americans. Alaska Natives serve at higher rates in the military than any other ethnic group in the country. They would love to do a deal with the Navy for a 99 year lease or something like that. But you know who checks in with them once a year?\" Sullivan asked. \"It's a Chinese shipping company that is, certainly, in my view, a front company for the [Chinese military]. So how embarrassing would it be to the Pentagon or the Navy . . . if somehow they signed 100 year lease with a quote 'Chinese shipping company' that always is out there looking at Adak?\"\nSullivan emphasized that the Aleut Corporation would never sign a port lease with a Chinese firm, but asked Paparo his opinion all the same.\n\"I think it would be bad, because this is the modus operandi in [China's] Belt and Road Initiative,\" Paparo replied.\nNorthern Command and Indo-Pacific Command are working on a set of options to reactivate the base, Sullivan said, and he pressed for a final report before the end of the month.",

More than half of the drugs were captured in just 72 hours in seven back-to-back intercepts.\n\"I could not be prouder of theJamescrew and the teams who embarked with us to stand the watch over the holidays to keep our border secure and keep Americans safe,\" said Capt. Thomas Rodzewicz, commanding officer ofJames.\nAlmost all of the busts occurred on the high seas off Ecuador and Peru.James' embarked unmanned aerial systems crew did much of the legwork in detecting smuggling craft, many of which were found up to 300 nautical miles offshore. An embarked HITRON helicopter aircrew helped ensure the suspect vessels' compliance on multiple occasions, using \"airborne use of force tactics\" to make sure that the target came to a halt. (When authorized, HITRON crews may fire warning shots to deter smugglers, and can shoot out suspect boats' engines if noncompliance continues.)\nThe biggest bust occurred on January 6, whenJameswas operating about 280 miles off Ecuador. The cutter intercepted a set of three go-fast vessels at once, and with help from the HITRON aircrew,James' boarding teams intercepted and captured all three boats. Nine suspects were detained, and the cutter crew seized nearly 14,000 pounds (6.3 tonnes) of cocaine.\nJamesalso worked with the smaller cutterMohawkto interdict a fleeing go-fast vessel on January 18. Mohawk worked to recover packages that the smugglers had tossed over the side, whileJames' small pursuit boat chased down the suspect vessel from 60 nautical miles away.

Many have already discounted their goods to the lowest profitable price in order to offset the effects. \"It is a deal breaker,\" toy factory owner Chen Qingxin told the Wall Street Journal. \"No room for doing business anymore, for both sides.\"\nGiven the effective doubling of their wholesale costs, American retailers are already beginning to cancel or defer orders. E-commerce giant Amazon began to revoke orders this week, according to Bloomberg, and has already canceled shipments of summer goods like air conditioners, beach chairs and scooters.\nExporters in China are also adapting to a new reality. \"All factory orders are suspended. Any goods that have not been loaded will be cancelled and goods that are already at sea will be re-priced,\" one manufacturing executive told SCMP. \"The loss on each container we ship is now greater than the profit we used to make on two containers.\" He added that his firm has heard from at least one U.S. client that the goods would be abandoned on the dock when they arrived because the tariffs make them too expensive to sell.\n\"The major trend we see is shippers looking to not accept their freight,\" supply chain consultant Joseph Esteves told CNBC. \"A lot of these companies are levered financially. They don’t have the working capital requirements and they don’t have the cash. So they simply cannot just take on this [tariff] and hope to see what happens.\"\nThe steep tariff on China may force U.S. importers to diversify their supply chains to other alternatives, like Cambodia and Vietnam, already popular options for the \"China plus one\" diversified sourcing strategy. But there is little chance that more low-end consumer goods will end up being produced in America, some in the supply chain business say.\n\"They’re absolutely not going to go back to the United States,\" said Casey Barnett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, told CNBC. \"I can’t imagine that Americans want to sit down and sew a pair of sweatpants for long hours of the day.\"\nChina has also imposed its own retaliatory tariff of 84 percent on U.S. goods, and the increased cost is expected to hit agricultural interests hard, particularly soybean farmers. U.S. manufacturers may also feel the effects of a slowdown. In California, a leading maker of CNC industrial machine tools - Haas Automation - has announced that it is scaling back hiring, production and overtime because of a \"dramatic decrease in demand for our machine tools from both domestic and foreign customers.\"",

    "input": "\nAfter 10 years of deliberation, IMO member nations have agreed to implement the first global carbon fee for shipping. It is the first UN-administered carbon revenue system of any kind.\nAt the final day of talks for the Marine Environment Protection Committee's 83rd meeting, delegates agreed to a set of binding targets for shipping's greenhouse gas emissions, including intermediate objectives of a 20-30 percent greenhouse emission reduction by 2030, a 70-80 percent reduction by 2040, and net-zero by or around 2050.\nAccompanying the targets, delegates passed a set of long-debated technical and economic measures that are intended to incentivize compliance. Rather than an across-the-board carbon levy on all emissions, it is a tiered system of fees and compliance levels, and not all emissions will be taxed.\nThe core of the plan is a penalty of $380 per tonne of CO2 that ships will have to pay if they exceed a maximum level of emissions intensity, which will get stricter every few years on a set schedule. Ships that stay under this intensity standard will still have to pay a fine of $100 per tonne of CO2 for emissions in excess of a second \"direct compliance\" level. Ships that emit even less than the \"direct compliance\" standard get carbon credits for outperforming the requirements, which can banked or sold to underperforming ships.\nThe fee structure means that only emissions above a certain limit are subject to a penalty; emissions under the limit will be untaxed. And all ships under 5,000 GT - coastal vessels and workboats - are exempt.\nThe framework also leaves room for operators to use any alternative fuels that meet emissions criteria, including first-generation biofuels made from food crops like palm and soybean oil. These are the cheapest \"green\" fuels available, but they come with a significant environmental cost, as large-scale increases in production require more land-clearing.\n\"The IMO deal creates a momentum for alternative marine fuels, but unfortunately it is the forest-destroying first generation biofuels that will get the biggest push for the next decade,\" said Faig Abbasov, shipping program director for Transport & Environment (T&E).\nClimate advocates and industry groups agreed that the fee structure falls short of what would be needed to compel an industry-wide transition to high-cost green methanol and green ammonia in the near term. However, based on ananalysis by T&E, the IMO's schedule will result in a substantial reduction in emissions from about 2030 onward - a profound cut compared to the increases expected under a no-regulation, business-as-usual scenario. The schedule suggests that the industry will not reach net zero until some years after 2050.\nCourtesy T&E\n\"This adoption is a first step in the right direction, with now a part – although small – of shipping emissions being subject to what is effectively a global levy. However, with an expected fall in emissions of around 10% by 2030 compared to 2008, the level of ambition is largely insufficient to meet the IMO target of emission reduction, let alone to meet a 1.5 C trajectory,\" said Dr. Marie Fricaudet, a senior research fellow at UCL Energy Institute.\nAdvocates of a stricter emissions regime blamed longtime opponents of climate action for the outcome; the Trump administration, which registered itsoppositionto any carbon fees earlier this week, also attracted criticism. \"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5°C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Minister Ralph Regenvanu of Vanuatu, a proponent of ambitious climate measures at IMO.\nIndustry groups praised the MEPC outcome as a step in the right direction, if not a full resolution.\n\"We recognize that this may not be the agreement which all sections of the industry would have preferred, and we are concerned that this may not yet go far enough in providing the necessary certainty. But it is a framework which we can build upon,\" the International Chamber of Shipping's Guy Platten said in a statement.\n“This is a major milestone for climate policy and a turning point for shipping. Our industry has long been labelled as ‘hard to abate,’ but record industry investment and a new global measure can turn the tide on that,” said Joe Kramek, WSC President & CEO.\nUCL cautioned that without a high-revenue IMO levy powering multibillion-dollar investments in green fuel, national-level capital flows will now determine who wins from shipping's green transition - much as China has done with its investments in solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, EVs and shipbuilding. \"A significant risk now exists that the future of shipping will, like renewable energy and battery electric vehicles, be significantly owned and driven by nations with strong industrial policy,\" warned UCL.",

    "input": "\nOn April 11, Lebanese Judge Tarek Bitar resumed his investigation into the 2020 explosion in Beirut Port with the subpoenaed testimony of two former senior state officials implicated in the affair, Maj Gen Abbas Ibrahim (ex-Director General of General Security) and Maj Gen Tony Saliba (ex-Director General State Security).\nThe explosion in the port’s quayside Warehouse 12 on August 4, 2020 killed 218, injured thousands and devastated a wide area of central Beirut. The blast was heard in Syria and 125 miles away in Cyprus.\nJudge Tarik was appointed to his role in 2021. His predecessor had named a number of ministers and senior officials as suspects in the inquiry, who then had managed to remove him. The same indicted ministers and senior officials, working with a President and Prime Minister and others aligned with the Hezbollah, Amal and Free Patriotic Movement, used court cases and noncooperation to shut down Judge Tariq’s enquiry. But with a new President and Prime Minister, both dedicated to supporting the independence of state institutions, the Judge has resumed his work - notwithstanding numerous death threats and warnings of ‘chaos’ from Hezbollah-aligned senior Shi’a cleric Mufti Ahmad Kabalan. The new Prime Minister, Nawaf Salam, was (until his recent appointment) President of the International Court of Justice in The Hague.\nIn Lebanon’s highly divided and contested political landscape, the course of such inquiries never runs smooth. It took 11 years for the international tribunal investigating the assassination of Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2005 to issue its verdict – ineffectively, and from the safety of The Hague.\nMultiple conspiracy theories and suggestions of Israeli involvement were circulated in the aftermath of the explosion, most designed to put investigators off the scent and to protect the guilty. The cause of the explosion is clear. 2,750 tons of explosives-grade ammonium nitrate were offloaded from the impounded MVRhosus, which had been declared unseaworthy and detained while enroute from Georgia to Mozambique.\nThehigh densityammonium nitrate was stored in Warehouse 12, the location where customs-confiscated goods were normally impounded. On its own, ammonium nitrate is relatively inert, and even the blasting grade found in the warehouse becomes an explosive only when it is mixed with fuel oil or other more volatile explosives. Nonetheless, ammonium nitrate on its own is a potentially volatile substance, and has causedcountlessdeadly explosions over the last century. It is normally subject to dangerous goods safeguards.\nOn August 4, 2020, the ambient temperature - reinforced by storage in an unventilated warehouse - would have been at or near the annual peak for Beirut. The ammonium nitrate was being stored alongside a consignment of customs-confiscated fireworks. Apparently, a repair team was conducting welding repairs to the doors of Warehouse 12. A fire crew – Platoon 5 from the Beirut Fire Brigade – was called out to deal with a fire in the warehouse created by the welding activity, and before all perished in the subsequent two explosions, they reported they were dealing with a fire in the confiscated fireworks. There was an initial explosion in the fireworks at 1807 hours, before the catastrophic explosion occurred some 30 seconds later. The conditions and the sequence of events, plus the reporting of those at the scene before they subsequently were killed, make it absolutely clear that the initial firework fire provided sufficient shock, heat and detonating effect to ignite the ammonium nitrate - which because of the storage conditions was already unstable.\nWARNING THIS IS SHOCKING: Here is a live shot of the explosion today in Beirut via@jenanmoussashowing the moment the blast happens.pic.twitter.com/5KvOc1I2sE\nBeirut ???????? Roofs on nearby buildings flew away due to the blast . Reports suggesting it’s non nuclear .https://t.co/6tJRymjTei\nSpeculation that the explosion was the secondary effect of an Israeli attack on a nearby Hezbollah arms store was an attractive hypothesis to many. Video footage from multiple cameras showed no missile tracks, only seagulls flying above the seat of the explosion. The pattern of attacks in both Lebanon and Syria in preceding years suggested that any Israeli attack would need to be accompanied by an imminent and direct threat to Israeli safety and security, which was never evident in this instance.\nWhilst it became clear early on that the explosion had not been initiated by an external attack, many questions remain unanswered.\nFBI analysissuggested that only 552 tons exploded on 4 August, less than a fifth of 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate originally consigned to the warehouse. ‘Shrinkage’ in dockside warehouses worldwide is common, but who might have benefitted from this 2000 ton seepage in stocks, beyond any customs officers paid to turn a blind eye? Agricultural fertilizer merchants would have been interested in using the material. But also at this time, the Syrian government was in the throes of civil war, and its capacity domestically to produce ammonium nitrate for use in the manufacture of explosives for barrel bombsfellfrom nearly 90,000 tons in 2004 to 16,000 tons in 2013, when demand was increasing. A cheap supply from Warehouse 12 may have been a more attractive alternative to circumventing sanctions and ramping up domestic production.\nThe value of the slowly degrading ammonium nitrate in Warehouse 12 may have been the reason why it stayed put, despite some Port officials demanding that the material should be moved for safety reasons. Customs officials sent six chaser letters to the courts which had ordered the seizure of the ammonium nitrate. None of these follow-ups resulted in any action. This suggested a conspiracy between those pilfering the ammonium nitrate, and officials using their positions to facilitate this, whether for political purpose or for financial gain.\nJudge Tarik’s list of suspects is focused on officials who may have facilitated pilfering, rather than on the black market pilferers themselves. The dangers posed by the increasingly unstable ammonium nitrate appear to have been correctly identified by the responsible Port safety officials; neither their competence, nor that of the brave firemen from Platoon 5 from the Beirut Fire Brigade, is being pursued as a line of investigation.\nThe course of Judge Tarik’s inquiry still has some way to run. The fall of the Assad regime may help by freeing up some information sources in Syria. But whilst Hezbollah’s influence within the machinery of the state in Lebanon is much reduced, the militant group still has some bite in its capacity to disrupt proceedings.\nWafiq Safa(left,Mehr / CC BY 4.0), Hezbollah’s Head of Security and a prominent organizer of anti-Judge Tariq protests in 2020-21, remains an influential figure within the Port of Beirut. Thus in the rebuilding of the authority of the Lebanese state, it is morale-inspiring that the inquiry has not been offshored to the safety of the Hague. Convictions flowing from the inquiry will do much to create confidence in the government - and to give the relatives of the 218 killed some closure. Best of all, Judge Tarik remains in his post and pursuing the case.",

    "input": "\nWith the European wind sector facing competitiveness and security challenges, wind developers in the region have issued European governments a new call to action to protect the lifeline of the industry.\nWith EU targeting wind to contribute 35% of its electricity by 2035, countries across the region are making strides in expanding renewable energy capacity, especially in the offshore wind sector. But developers are concerned that the build-out has slowed in the past few years with the offshore sector facing increased risk and uncertainty. Some of the factors contributing to this include cost inflation, declining commercial viability and lower investor confidence.\nTo reverse the downward trend, developers at this year’s WindEurope summit want EU governments to auction at least 100GW worth of Contracts for Difference (CfDs) over ten years. Through the auction, the governments should guarantee fixed price and indexed contracts to create bankable projects.\nIn addition, wind farm developers want governments to plan the commissioning deadlines of the 100GW evenly, with 10GW annually from 2031-2040. This will help create market predictability, while ensuring there is sufficient time for investments. These measures - backed by power purchase agreements - will help the European offshore wind industry achieve 15GW installations annually by the 2030s.\n“Wind energy is already driving industrial growth and energy independence across Europe, we just need to scale up. This calls for increasing viable demand for wind energy, and strengthening wind’s market environment,” said Henrik Andersen, WindEurope Chairman.\nOne of the notable challenges identified for competitiveness is the high electricity price in some European countries. In its report released this week, WindEurope said that the high electricity prices are driven by taxes and levies, slowing renewables-based electrification and undermining use in the industrial sector.\n“Electricity is overburdened with taxes and charges compared with gas. In Spain for instance, electricity charges for households are 19 times higher than gas charges,” reveals the report.",

    "input": "\nInternal budget documents leaked to the media Friday suggest that the Trump White House wants to cut funding for NOAA's National Ocean Service in half, move the National Marine Fisheries Service to the Department of the Interior, end the Sea Grant program for oceanographic research and education, and \"eliminate all funding for climate, weather, and ocean laboratories and cooperative institutes\" - effectively ending NOAA's weather and ocean research program.\nCurrent and former NOAA staffers gave copies of the OMB budget for NOAA to Science, Politico and the New York Times this week. Among other items, the programs to be eliminated would include:\n- The Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), NOAA's core research division- The National Oceanographic Partnership Program and Sea Grant program- The National Marine Fisheries Service, to be folded into Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Agency- The National Ocean Service's Integrated Ocean Observing System Regional Observations, Competitive Research and Coastal Zone Management Grants- The National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science\nOverall, the OMB's plan would cut NOAA's top line by $1.7 billion. OAR would be the hardest hit division. Its budget would be cut by $315 million, and the remaining $170 million would be repurposed for other programs. “At this funding level, O.A.R. is eliminated as a line office,” the OMB proposal suggests.\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) FY2026 budget is formally a suggestion to Congress; in theory, any final numbers would have to pass the House and Senate.\n“I think it’s step one in the deconstruction of the agency,” former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told Politico after reading the plan. “Any one of these are by themselves destructive enough. But taken together they foretell a much more calamitous outcome.”\nSome of the biggest cuts were long foreseen: The dismantling of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research echoes the Heritage Foundation's well-knownProject 2025report, which described OAR as \"one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,\" proposed consolidating the office, and recommended \"breaking up\" NOAA altogether. OMB's top-line budget cut is also similar in scope to an earlierplanpublished in 2023 by the Center for Renewing America, founded by Project 2025 coauthor and current OMB director Russell Vought.\nThe OMB plan also includes specific cuts to NOAA's next-generation weather satellites, due to launch in the 2030s. OMB proposes eliminating individual sensors that (if installed) would track ocean color, atmospheric temperature, pollution levels and moisture content. Some of these factors are useful for storm prediction, but the data could also be repurposed to produce climate science. At the same time, parallel cuts that OMB proposes at NASA (reported Friday byArs Technica) could eliminate a large swath of existing earth science satellite sensing capabilities as well.\nThe OMB's reported cuts also align with recent administration orders thatcanceledoffice leases for certain NOAA departments, heavily focused on the National Marine Fisheries Service. The lease cancelations affect local NMFS port offices in Alaska, California, Florida, Guam, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Louisiana, Oregon, Washington and elsewhere, and many take effect in FY2025.\nInside NOAA, staffers told Axios that some operations have already been slowed by a requirement to have every contract approved by Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick. NOAA is one part of his portfolio, but the secretary is also a key architect of President Trump's global tariff policy, and the Wall Street Journal reports that Lutnick has beenoccupiedat the White House for much of his tenure to date. Dozens of NOAA contracts were awaiting his approval as of April 1, according toAxios.",

    "input": "\nThe re-ordering of global trade, escalated by the astronomical tariffs between the U.S and China, has left some countries with significant export advantages. Brazil is already showing signs as an early winner, with its port sector reporting increased demand. A strong preference for the Brazilian soybean has started to appear in China, historically a large-scale buyer of American soy.\nAccording to Reuters, China is expected to receive about 3 million tons of U.S soybeans in April-May, which its state stockpiler Sinograin purchased earlier this year. However, due to China’s new 125 percent tariffs on American goods, the shipment is likely to attract higher duties and possibly sell at a discount due to cheap competition from beans from Brazil.\n“The pressure of the soy crushing margins on Chinese industries will likely change the country’s import dynamics. As these margins come under negative pressure, China tends to slow down the pace of imports and rely on domestic stockpiles- as seen in the previous trade war in 2018,” said the Brazilian National Association of Cereal Exporters (Anec) in its monthly report this week.\nAnec predicts a potential export boom for the Brazilian soy this year of up to 110 million tons, representing a historic record for Brazil. In the first quarter of 2025, Brazil has already recorded shipments of about 27 million tons, a four percent increase compared to last year. Currently, China accounts for 77 percent of Brazilian soy exports.\nThe uptick in export volumes is also visible in the port sector data, with Brazilian ports moving 12.4 million tons of containers in February- the highest volume ever recorded, according to the National Agency for Waterway Transportation (Antaq). This figure represents a 9.26 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024. Of the total, around 70 percent (8.6 million tons) was from long-haul shipping, while the remaining 30 percent (3.7 million tons) was from coastal shipping (cabotage). Some of the major commodities behind the increase include corn, bauxite and fertilizers. Other shipments which rose by a significant measure include poultry products. Brazil’s exports of fresh and processed poultry reached 476,000 tons in March, up 19 percent from a year earlier, according to the Brazilian Animal Protein Association (ABPA).\nIn anticipating higher export volumes, some ports are already investing in additional capacity as well as diversifying operations. Porto do Acu, located in the state of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil’s top oil export port, has said that the tariff-induced distortions in global trade has given the port an incentive to expand facilities for agricultural and mineral commodities.\n“When threats started, demand started to rise. We are in a really good position here,” João Braz, the port’s logistics director told Bloomberg.\nBrazil’s agricultural shipments are also a factor in China’s interests in the Panama Canal. Chinese economist Li Xunlei hascalledfor improving government ties in the Central American country in order to ensure strategic access to the waterway for China’s food shipments; 90 percent of the Brazil-to-China soy trade passes through the canal, he said in a recent paper.\nTop image: Port of Santos (Agencia CNT / CC BY 2.0)",

The line has a strong orderbook and will also be looking to grow its private ports while continuing its focus on U.S. cruising with the widest assortment of homeports.\n“Since our inception in 1972, we have defined and led the modern cruise industry and our plans for the next five years and beyond are no different,” said line’s President Christine Duffy. “Having just integrated two ships into the Carnival fleet in Australia, we now stand at 29 ships, the largest global fleet in our history.”\nThe line has two additional LNG-fueled cruise ships on order from Meyer Werft and it revealed they will continue the naming pattern of the class which has celebrated the history of the now 53-year-old line. The next ships will be Carnival Festivale debuting in the spring of 2027 sailing week-long cruises from Port Canaveral, Florida. In 2028, it will introduce Carnival Tropicale. The line is planning new innovations including an expanded outdoor area and water park that will for the first time also host evening deck parties on some nights with music and activities for families. Carnival reports it carries more than one million children per year and it is expanding its accommodations for families on the new ships.\n\n\nExpanded water park will open some evenings for family deck parties (CCL)\n\nCarnival reports that half of the U.S. population lives within 5-hour driving distance to one of its homeports and it will expand its short cruise programs. Already half of its cruises are in the short duration category and in 2027, theMardi Graswill begin short cruises from Port Canaveral, the first time the line has used one of its largest ships on short cruises.As part of its strategy, Carnival says it will also return to year-round operations in Mobile, Alabama beginning in spring 2027. In addition, Carnival is exploring moving a larger Conquest class ship to Baltimore in 2027 that can accommodate about 1,000 more guests thanCarnival Pride, the Spirit class ship currently deployed from Baltimore.\nLike all the large cruise lines, Carnival is also increasing its focus on private destinations. In July 2025 it opens Celebration Key on Grand Bahama Island, which will have a capability in its first phase to handle 13,000 passengers a day. The line plans further expansion in Phase 2 while noting that 20 Carnival ships from 10 U.S. homeports on more than 1,400 sailings are already scheduled to visit Celebration Key in 2027.\n\n\nCelebration Key is being developed on Grand Bahama Island as a private destination for the cruise line's passengers (CCL)\n\nIt is also launching an expanded and renamed operation in the Bahamas, RelaxAway, Half Moon Cay, which it shares with Holland America Line. The new features including a dock for two of its largest cruise ship will open at the private island in 2026. At the same time, Mahogany Bay, Carnival’s destination in Roatan, Honduras, will be renamed Isla Tropicale and will be expanded to include a pool with a swim up bar and cabanas.\nThis expansion follows the growth of Carnival Cruise Line in Australia taking over two 109,000 gross ton ships and merged in the P&O Australia cruise operation. In the past few years, it also took over three ships from sister brand Costa Cruises giving Carnival Cruise Line a total 34 percent increase in capacity.\nLonger term, the brand also highlights it order with Fincantieri for three LNG-powered cruise ships which will be approximately 230,000 gross tons, the largest ships ever built by Fincantieri and an Italian shipyard. Called Project Ace, they will be delivered in 2029, 2031, and 2033 and have over 3,000 guest cabins, and a capacity of almost 8,000 passengers.\nWith strong advance booking and a strong increase in onboard revenue, Carnival Cruise Line points to strong momentum from the brand achieved over the past few years. The growth strategy looks to leverage the brands strengths for the future.",

The White House has also strongly encouraged Iran - the Houthi group's primary foreign sponsor - to cease supplying arms and advisors to the Yemeni militants. Iran has reportedly withdrawn its personnel from Yemen as a precautionary measure, and is starting Omani-brokered talks with U.S. negotiators.\nThe U.S. State Department also warned on Wednesday that the U.S. will not accept any shipping activity in and out northwestern Yemen. The divided country's main seaport, Hodeidah, is controlled by the Houthis and supplies the majority of the population with food and fuel.\n\"The United States will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports. Such actions risk violating U.S. law,\" warned the State Department.\nAid groups have objected to restrictions on basic necessities, given the long-term deprivation that Yemeni civilians have faced since the start of the nation's civil war more than 10 years ago.\n“US measures targeting the Houthi de facto authorities should provide clear and effective exemptions for humanitarian aid operations,\" said Diala Haidar, Amnesty International’s Yemen Researcher. \"The majority of civilians in critical need of aid live in Houthi-controlled areas in northern Yemen. The US’s designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization should not obstruct aid and other supplies indispensable for keeping people alive.\"\nThe Trump administration has designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization, and it recently stripped down U.S. aid funding for Yemen, including funds for food. The decision to withhold food aid was made by a 28-year-old lawyer for the Department of Government Efficiency, two sources at USAID told the AP.",

The official announcement did not report the date but the media indicates the seizure took place in early March in the port of Livorno.\nThe vessel was carrying a shipment of cocoa power which was concealing two tons of cocaine in approximately 1,800 blocks. The street value was estimated at over €500 million (more than $560 million).\nThe voyage originated in Guayaquil, Ecuador where they believe the cocaine was loaded onto the ship for retrieval once it reached Europe. However, the vessel also made intermediary stops in Colon, Panama, and again in Cartagena, Colombia. The vessel then made stops in Vigo, Malaga, and Valencia in Spain and Genoa, Italy where the drugs went undetected. It was finally intercepted in Livorno.\nAuthorities point out that the shipment while common was not in refrigerated cargo where they typically find large quantities of cocaine and other drugs concealed coming from South America. Italian media, InfoLibes, highlights that 1,400 tons of bananas and pineapples were offloaded from the same vessel on March 12 in Vigo.\nThe vessel is registered in Malta but owned and operated by a Turkish-based company. Built in 2017 it has a capacity of 2,586 TEU.\nThe same shipping company, which maintains regular service between South America and Europe, has beentargeted by other smuggling operations. The company’s vesselIzmit Express(37,000 dwt with a capacity of 2,586 TEU) reported locating “suspicious packages” in a hard-to-reach area of its cargo holds when it reached Spain in November 2024. Spanish authorities retrieved 23 kilos of cocaine and continued to inspect 100 containers carrying bananas. With the proper tools, the authorities cut into the containers and found 432 packages of cocaine with a total weight is over 500 kilos.\nRefrigerated containers have regularly been targeted by smugglers. Ports ranging from Spain and Italy to Rotterdam and Belgium have all reported large drug seizures found concealed with fruit shipments from South America.",

    "input": "\nThe first test steps were undertaken at the Port of Rotterdam to test the port’s capabilities for future ammonia bunkering operations. Rotterdam is the world’s second-largest bunker port and expects that ammonia-fueled vessels requiring bunkering will begin in 2026 or 2027. It looks to build on its existing efforts for LNG bunkering and now methanol to prepare for the future alternative fuel.\nThe port highlights that the safety protocol levels were raised to prepare for the test. The port has already implemented assessment tools so that it is fully ready for LNG and now methanol. Port officials said the raised levels and testing of the process will ensure it is prepared for bunkering of the first ammonia-fueled vessels.\nThe pilot on April 12 involved transferring 800 cubic meters of liquid, cold ammonia at -33 degrees Celsius between two ships. It took about 2.5 hours and was conducted alongside a new quay at the Maasvlakte 2 APM terminal. For this test grey ammonia was used but the port anticipates that clean (low carbon) ammonia will be used when the bunkering operations begin. They noted that the gray ammonia shares the same chemical properties as the future clean product helping to test the protocols.\n\n\n\nVarious parties collaborated on the pilot, facilitated by the Port of Rotterdam Authority. OCI, owner and operator of the port’s ammonia terminal, partnered with Trammo, which supplied the two tankers carrying OCI’s ammonia. James Fisher Fendercare provided equipment and expertise to ensure the safe execution of the ship-to-ship transfer at the berth location provided by APM Terminal. Bunker barge operator Victrol shared its bunkering expertise during the preparation of the pilot. The DCMR Environmental Protection Agency, Rijnmond Safety Region (VRR), and the Joint Fire Service (GB) were involved to ensure the pilot was conducted safely and smoothly.\nRotterdam’s test followed a similar testing process that was carried out last year in Singapore. Fortescue’s converted offshore support vessel received thefirst bunkeringas the Maritime and Port Authority tested its protocols and certified the vessel. In Japan, they are using tanker trucks to fuel the world’s first tugboat using ammonia. Demonstrations of the tug have been undergoing in Tokyo Bay with it supporting ship traffic after having operated for a decade as an LNG-fueled tug.\nDNV calculates that there are currently 33 vessels on order due for delivery in the next four years that will be capable of sailing using ammonia as a fuel. CMB.TECH and Fortescue announced a deal today, April 14, for the Australian mining company to use one of the Belgian company’s first ammonia-fueled Newcastlemax bulkers due for delivery in 2026. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines has also announced that it will co-own and operate three of the 210,000 dwt ammonia-fueled bulkers.\nDeveloping the infrastructure for bunkering is a critical step. Last year, Fortescue complained that it could not demonstrate its vessel on ammonia due to a lack of infrastructure and enable regulations. The companies look at their current efforts as pioneering and contributing to the development of the infrastructure needed to encourage the industry to accelerate the conversion to ammonia as one of the alternative fuels.",

    "input": "\nShipowners, governments, and labor unions agreed to a sweeping series of changes to the master agreement known as the Maritime Labour Convention, a global agreement that establishes minimum standards for the working and living conditions of seafarers. The updates, which are being called groundbreaking for the industry, come as the modern MLC prepares to mark its 20th anniversary after the consolidation of 37 conventions into the MLC in 2006.\nMany of the issues that were presented during the meeting in Geneva last week emerged during the pandemic when seafarers were trapped at sea. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) took the lead in representing seafarers during the negotiations after being at the forefront as an advocate during the pandemic to get seafarers designated as key workers and create greater freedom for shore leave, crew changes, and travel.\nUnder the auspices of the International Labour Organization, the Special Tripartite Committee on the MLC meets every three years to review the master contract. The ILO’s maritime tripartite regulatory structure brings together national governments, alongside a global shipowners group co-ordinated by ICS and a global seafarers group co-ordinated by ITF. It is highlighted that the ILO is the only tripartite UN agency through which national governments alongside sectoral social partners (employer and worker representatives) establish labor standards and policies, through open debates and negotiations.\n“We have been able to deliver some significant improvements to seafarers’ rights in collaboration with our government and social partners,” said Tim Springett, Chair of the ICS Labour Affairs Committee and Spokesperson for the Shipowners’ Group at the ILO meeting. “The accomplishments of STC prove that – whatever the issue facing our industry – when we come together, we can work it out.”\nAmong the amendments agreed to improve the working and living conditions of seafarers on board ships were provisions for seafarers to be designated as key workers. They also agreed to strengthen requirements to support seafarer repatriation, new mandatory measures to ensure that seafarers have access to shore leave without needing a visa or special permit, and enhanced protections against bullying and harassment.\nTHE ICS says recognizing that seafarers are among the most isolated people on earth when it comes to medical care, the ILO also approved new MLC provisions recommending carriage of the ICS International Medical Guide for Seafarers and Fishers on board ships. The first edition of the International Medical Guide for Seafarers and Fishers was published in March 2023 and is specifically designed for use by those responsible for medical care on board ships, rather than shore-based professionals. The guide was developed through a collaborative effort led by the ICS, with the support of the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) and the International Maritime Health Association (IMHA).\nThe meeting also agreed to a package of complementary resolutions, one of which established a framework for a future joint meeting between the ILO tripartite partners and Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to review and potentially align overlapping seafarer hours of work and rest provisions, within the remit of conventions overseen by both organizations.\nThe new measures adopted by the ILO are expected to be rubberstamped in Geneva, during the 113th Session of ILO’s International Labour Conference in June. They are then expected to enter into effect two years later in December 2027.\nThe text of MLC amendments as adopted can beaccessed online. The next STC meeting is set to take place in April 2028.",

    "input": "\nOn Friday, the Estonian Navy boarded and detained a sanctioned tanker in the Baltic for allegedly flying a false flag. The vessel was flying the flag of Djibouti, but the Djiboutian register of shipping said that the tanker - the 18-year-oldKiwala- had already been deregistered. International databases suggest thatKiwala'sDjiboutian flag service was canceled on January 1, 2025.\n\"During a routine inspection, there was reason to suspect the ship lacked a flag state and valid insurance. The vessel is also subject to sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland,\" said Cmdr. Ivo Vark, the head of the Estonian Navy.\nEstonian inspectors found 40 deficiencies aboard the aging vessel, and have detained it until repairs and improvements are made. The majority of the issues are related to documentation, including its flag. It is an example of NATO member states' newly-strengthened efforts to police tanker traffic in the Baltic, outside of the 12-mile limit of territorial seas: the interdiction was initiated in international waters and the crew was asked to divert into Estonian jurisdiction.\nKiwala(IMO 9332810, ex namePacific Apollo / Virgo Sun / P. Fos / Odysseus / Varuna) is a 115,000 dwt crude tanker built in 2007. Like many \"shadow fleet vessels,\" she has flag-hopped extensively: previous flags in the last three years include St. Kitts, Mongolia and Gabon. She is currently managed by a Chinese company, crewed by Chinese officers, and owned by an anonymous firm in Mauritius. Her ultimate beneficial owner is not known, but she was once part of the well-knownGatik Ship Management fleet.\nKiwala and gray-market vessels like her may face a new source of competition. Western tanker owners and insurers can now legitimately do business in the Russian oil market, thanks to the falling cost of crude. Due to steep U.S. tariffs on trading partners and investor concerns about the state of the global economy, oil prices have slid, and the Russian Urals grade has begun fetching less than $60 per barrel - the price cap set by the G7 in 2022 for Western shipping services.",

    "input": "The IMO'snew greenhouse gas feeis not quite a full-scale carbon levy, since it is only charged on some emissions, and not quite a green-fuel mandate, as it allows a long economic runway for biofuels. It is a compromise measure, and passed with less consensus than usually found at IMO: 63 nations voted for it, with 16 opposed and 24 abstaining. The U.S. delegation walked out midway through the talks, and threatened retaliation against any levy that would raise costs for American shipping.\nIMO secretary general Arsenio Dominguez noted that for all its compromises, the draft agreement is still a remarkable breakthrough. As the world's first industry-wide tax on carbon, it will significantly reduce shipping's emissions in the long run - assuming that the administrative details are worked out and that enough nations sign the final draft at the next MEPC meeting.\n\"The approval of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI mandating the IMO net-zero framework represents another significant step in our collective efforts to combat climate change, to modernize shipping and demonstrates that IMO delivers on its commitments,\" said Dominguez in a statement.\nMany participants - opponents, proponents, and brokers who helped craft the agreement, including Dominguez - expect that it will be revisited and strengthened in the future.\n\"We are not done. We will be back,\" said Ambassador Albon Ishoda of the Marshall Islands, an advocate of a much stricter levy. \"Still standing. Still steering.\"\n\"The work is not over, with much detail on emissions calculation methods and how near-zero emissions fuels will be rewarded needed before and after formal adoption of these measures in October to ensure a level playing field for green fuels,\" noted Green Hydrogen Organization CEO Jonas Moberg.\nMany climate activists were appalled by the comparatively lowfee structureand the five-year time gap before emissions will begin to decline. John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s leader at IMO, called the deal \"a total shipwreck.\" Transport & Environment's Faig Abbasov suggested that it is now time for nation-states and regional blocs to bypass IMO and begin implementing their own carbon rules, as the EU has done.\nThe Pacific island states - along with allies in the Caribbean, Africa, the Seychelles, Great Britain and Central America - had proposed a universal levy on all GHG emissions from shipping, the solution proposed by most climate researchers and analysts (including Maersk and bunker trader Trafigura). In a joint statement, island state negotiators said that MEPC's deal was \"too little, too late to cut shipping emissions.\" They expressed their disappointment by abstaining from the vote.\n\"We came as climate vulnerable countries — with the greatest need and the clearest solution. And what did we face? Weak alternatives from the world’s biggest economies — alternatives that won’t get us on a pathway to the 1.5 degrees C temperature limit,\" said Simon Kofe, Minister for Transport of the Solomon Islands. \"They asked us to settle for less, while we are the ones losing the most. We will not negotiate away our future.\"\n“Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5°C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn. These countries – and others – failed to support a set of measures that would have gotten the shipping industry onto a 1.5 degree C pathway. And they turned away a proposal for a reliable source of revenue for those of us in dire need of finance to help with climate impacts,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, Minister of Energy and Climate Change Adaptation for Vanuatu.\nIf anyone stands to do well from the agreement, shipbuilders can expect to benefit. Han Seung-han, a research analyst at SK Securities, told South Korean media that East Asian yards will probably see a boost in clean-ship orders sooner rather than later because of the timeline for construction. \"Currently, the order backlog at shipyards worldwide is around 3 years and 8 months. Even if orders for new builds are placed immediately, the earliest delivery will be in at least 3 years,\" he said.\nThough it went nearly unnoticed in the fierce debate about carbon, MEPC 83 also passed an agreement to create the world's largest emissions control area (ECA). The new Northeast Atlantic zone will extend from Portugal to the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel, North Sea and the GIUK Gap - bigger than any other ECA yet designated. Once implemented, it will cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 82 percent and particulate matter emissions by 64 percent, improving health-related air quality in Northern Europe.\nTop image: Cyprien Hauser / CC BY ND 2.0",

Fortescue will deploy one of the fleet of 210,000 dwt ammonia-fueled bulkers currently being built by CMB.TECH.\nBocimar, the bulker operator under the CMB.TECH umbrella reported in 2023 that it was working with WinGD toco-develop large ammonia-fuelled engines. The companies said they were aiming to install the ammonia dual-fuel X72DF engine on a series of 10 bulk carriers to be built at a Chinese shipyard in 2025 and 2026. By the end of 2023, they had progressed in announcing an agreement with CSSC Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding (QBS) to build the vessels and engine builder CSSC Engine Co (CSE) to construct China’s first ammonia dual-fuel engines.\nThe project was based on WinGD’s X92B engine, which they said would be an ideal starting point for developing large-bore ammonia-fueled engines. The design was for a 72-bore ammonia engine operating using high-pressure fuel injection with a small portion of pilot fuel.\n“Our landmark agreement with Bocimar sends a clear signal to the market – now is the time for shipowners to invest in green ammonia-powered ships. The days of ships operating on dirty bunker fuel, which is responsible for three percent of global carbon emissions, are numbered,” said Dino Otranto, CEO of Fortescue Metals. “We will continue to work with like-minded companies like Bocimar to transition our fleet to low and zero-emissions vessels and help accelerate the widespread adoption of green ammonia as a marine fuel.”\nThe vessel is expected to be delivered by the end of 2026. Will be a dual-fuel Newcastle bulker. It will be employed to transport iron ore from the Pilbara region of Australia to customers in China and around the world.\nAlander Saverys who is a strong advocate for decarbonization and at the forefront for ammonia and hydrogen-fueled vessels called the deal the “beginning of an exciting journey to build more ammonia-powered ships.” He believes that it will “stimulate more green ammonia production projects.”\nFortescue launched the first ammonia dual-fuel vessel last year with a converted offshore support vessel which also conducted the first ammonia bunkering operation in Singapore. The vessel went through extensive testing as part of a certification progress in Singapore. The vessel sailed to London in early March to call attention to ammonia ahead of the recent IMO meetings and according to the company will soon embark on a tour of global ports.\nThe agreement with Fortescue follows a deal between CMB.TECH and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines announced in March that the Japanese shipping company wouldjointly ownthree of the 210,000 dwt bulk carriers. It will take the three vessels on a long-term charter for operations and also plans to build six chemical tankers. Two of the vessels will be ammonia-fitted on delivery and the other four will be built ammonia-ready with delivery between 2028 and 2029.",

    "input": "\nThe NTSB has determined that the tankerHafnia Amessistruck a pier on the Cooper River last year because the pilot let the vessel get too close to the riverbank. The combination of bank effect and current overwhelmed the force of the tanker's rudder and propulsion, sending it into the end of the pier - much like the tanker Bow Triumph, which hit the same pier under similar circumstances in 2022.\n\"Bank effect can have an undesired effect on vessels, even for the most experienced ship handlers. Pilots, masters, and other vessel operators should consider the risks in areas known for shoaling when planning transits,\" cautioned NTSB. \"Where appropriate, employ additional measures to mitigate the risk, including use of tugboats, reducing or increasing speed, and/or delaying the transit until more favorable conditions exist.\"\nOn the morning of January 14, 2024,Hafnia Amessifinished offloading at a terminal on the Cooper River in Wando, South Carolina. The vessel prepared to get under way on a ballast voyage to Texas City, Texas. A local marine pilot with 25 years' experience and 5,000 transits - including more than 20 on this stretch of river - boarded to guide the outbound transit. Because the pilot was aware of the Bow Triumph's allision with Naval Weapons Station Pier B two years before, he instructed the escort tug to take a position on the starboard side and accompanyHafnia Amessidown the river as a precaution. \"This order was a direct result of what I had learned from the Bow Triumph incident in 2022,\" he told NTSB.\nHafnia Amessigot under way. At 1000, nearing a river bend at buoy 80, the pilot noted an extreme flood current rushing past the buoy - strong enough to reduce the tanker's speed to just five knots.\nThe pilot lined up to take the next bend, a hard 90-degree turn to port that would take the tanker past Pier B. The pilot aimed for the east side of the channel, expecting that the strong current would setHafnia Amessifurther out towards the center. That did not occur, and the tanker ended up passing tight against the eastern bank, a maneuver that the pilot had not intended. The eastern bank had a ledge that tended to shoal rapidly with silt, and it had to be dredged every few years.\nAt 1016:27, the pilot ordered hard to port, but the rudder order had no effect on the rate of turn. At 1017:23, the ship's echo sounder read zero feet, indicating shallow water. Pier B was dead ahead, and the pilot ordered full ahead to push more water over the rudder. He also directed the escort tug to push on the starboard bow with \"all she's got.\"\nCourtesy NTSB\nThe last-minute maneuvers were not enough to avert an allision, andHafnia Amessihit the end of the pier at six knots. The impact dented in the tanker's hull plating up to three inches and buckled three transverse bulkheads inward by about 1-2 inches, causing about $30,000 in damage. The end of the pier sustained about $8 million in damage to dolphins, pilings and concrete, in addition to the previous damage caused by Bow Triumph. (There was no disruption to cargo operations at the pier, as it was already out of service because of the earlier accident.)\nAccording to NTSB, bank effect from a known shoal on the eastern channel edge likely pulledHafnia Amessi'sstern to port. Meanwhile, the strong flood current pushed her bow to starboard. The effects were strong enough to neutralize the force ofHafnia Amessi'srudder, even hard over to port with engine full ahead.\nNTSB noted thatBow Triumph'sallision with the same pier happened under very similar circumstances: theTriumphpassed too close to the east side of the channel, suffered bank suction, lost effective control of her heading and destroyed a 300-foot section of the pier.\nThe shoal was a known hazard, and the Coast Guard had previously scheduled the installation of a buoy to mark the danger zone at the bend. The buoy was installed on the planned date, three days afterHafnia Amessihit the pier. \"If this Buoy 72A had been there [during the transit] . . . that would have given me the tools to come more to the right and the information that I needed to avoid that spot,\" the pilot told NTSB after the casualty.\nAfter two allisions in two years, the Coast Guard Captain of the Port issued a standing order requiring all vessels over 10,000 GT or drawing more than 25 feet to use a tethered, two-tug escort when transiting through this challenging section of the river.\n\n",

    "input": "\nShares in Canadian mining firm The Metals Company (TMC) soared Monday on news that President Donald Trump will likely order the creation of a federal \"stockpile\" of rare-earth minerals retrieved from the seabed. TMC - together with Swiss maritime engineering goliath Allseas - is the only company in the West with a purpose-built ship and a fully-tested deep sea mining capability.\nThe U.S. interest in seabed-sourced rare earths is strategic, and has recently become urgent. China supplies nearly 70 percent of the world's rare earth ores, and it dominates processing capacity for most of the rest. On April 4, in response to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese-made goods, Beijing restricted all exports of seven \"heavy\" rare earth elements and the products that contain them - not just to the U.S., but to any third country. These substances are used in high-strength magnets, high-temperature metal alloys, and other components that are critical for electronics, EVs, defense manufacturing and aerospace applications. When current stockpiles run out, U.S. manufacturers that need heavy rare earths will have few alternatives without a reliable Chinese supply.\nAccording to the Financial Times, the White House plans to issue an order to create a government-owned \"strategic reserve\" for critical rare earth minerals, creating a large-scale market for the new seabed-sourced product. The goal, FT's sources said, would be to \"create large quantities ready and available on US territory to be used in the future.\"\nThe Trump administration has already reportedly held talks with TMC about granting the company an American license to extract critical minerals in international waters, bypassing environmental concerns and ongoing regulatory talks at the International Seabed Commission.\nThe manganese nodules targeted by TMC's mining process grow on a timescale measured in hundreds of millions of years, according to researchers, and may play a central role in the little-understood abyssal ecosystem of the mid-Pacific. From preliminary studies, it appears possible that these polymetallic lumps can electrolytically split seawater into H2 and oxygen gas; if accurate, they would be the first known non-biological generators of O2 on Earth.",

Today, April 14, the media is reporting that the investigation has expanded to widespread bribery of government officials, police officers, and other officials receiving illegal gifts including free travel.\nAccording to media reports, approximately 40 officials are under investigation in a case that will begin presentation to a panel of judges on Wednesday, April 16. Prosecutors asked for two individuals to be placed under house arrest and 11 others to be suspended from their roles pending the outcome of the investigation. The accusations are that the company was giving out “gold cards” which provided free travel and making other gifts to the officials.\nThis builds on the investigation in which it is being charged that the ferry company tampered with vessels operating on its route between Genoa and Porto Torres. Tirrena has a government contract to provide the service and receives government payments for critical ferry operations.\nThe allegations include that Tirrena was concealing non-compliance by its vessels by making false reports to the registers or by counterfeiting public authentication on documents used to obtain and maintain certification for the vessels. The company is alleged to have been embezzling public funds by operating ships that were not meeting regulations.\nThe investigation reportedly revealed that “Components of the main engines and diesel generators had been tampered with, altered, or replaced with non-original spare parts.” As such, the vessels were reported to be non-compliant but kept in service with counterfeit and false documents.\nThree ships were placed under arrest under “precautionary custody” to protect public funds. The company however was permitted to continue to operate them to ensure consistency of service. The prosecutors were seeking to protect more than €64 million (nearly $77 million) in public funds that could be involved in the fraud case.\nThe shipping company responded through its lawyers saying it was “astonished” over the allegations. They said the company has faced significant expenses and made large investments to conform with regulations on pollution.\nProsecutors said the investigation into the vessels began in 2023 and dated back to issues in 2021. They believe since then Tirrenia has rectified the compliance issues on its ships. The bribery of officials with free trips is believed to be widespread involving police, magistrates, and other regional officials.\n",

    "input": "Prosecutors in Taiwan filed charges against a Chinese captain from the mainland alleging he deliberately instructed his crew to anchor above a key undersea communications cable. According to the Taiwan Tainan District Prosecutors Office, the captain was aware that he was in a restricted area and used the claw of his anchor to snag and damage the cable.\nThe captain who was only identified by the surname of Wong is reported to be facing a prison sentence of one to seven years and a fine of approximately $300,000 if convicted. Prosecutors said he denied the crime, refused to reveal the name of the vessel’s owner, and had “a bad attitude” after the crime.\nThe incident began in late February when the vessel which was alternately identifying itself asHongtai 168orHongtai 58and registered in Togo was observed loitering off the coast of Taiwan. Government officials from the island had earlier announced a new monitoring program for suspect vessels including a concentration on ships they believed were owned by the Chinese but under flags such as Togo.\nAfter sitting offshore from February 22 to 25, the vessel was observed dropping anchor in a restricted zone approximately 5 nautical miles offshore and then sailing in a zigzag pattern. Chunghwa Telecom reported an interruption of service on one of its cables for communications and data that connects Taiwan and Penghu.\nThe Coast Guard said it had attempted to contact the vessel seven times telling it that it was in a restricted area and needed to move without reply. After the cable damage was reported, the Coast Guardintercepted the vesseland directed it to a port of investigation.\nProsecutors report the investigation has been concluded, and they determined the captain was “fully aware” of the position of the cable from the electronic charts on his ship. Further, he was aware it was a restricted zone that prohibited anchoring.\n“With the intention of destroying the submarine cable, he instructed the crew to release the anchor… and drove the ship” over the cable, said the prosecutors. Initial reports in February had said it was possibly an accident.\nThere were eight Chinese crewmembers aboard the vessel and when questioned they said the ship wasHongtai 168and that name was painted on the hull. However, the AIS signal wasHongtai 58. Coast Guard officials called the vessel a “makeshift ship,” but they believe it is backed by Chinese capital.\nProsecutors decided not to charge the other seven crewmembers saying there was insufficient suspicion of committing a crime. However, they are being detained and will be deported.\nWhile this is the first time Taiwan has prosecuted a Chinese captain on charges of sabotage, the Navy and Coast Guard earlier this year announced a new effort to track suspicious vessels. This came after another cargo ship was accused of damaging a cable and numerous provocations by China. The Chinese Navy was recently observed practicing what analysts believe was for the invasion of Taiwan. Chinese officials have vowed to reunite the nationalist island with the communist government.",

    "input": "\nWith two US Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) now operating in the area, it appears that the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) has withdrawn from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden station.\nThe Nedaja has maintained a continuous presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden area since 2008.  Typically, deployments have consisted of a Moudge or Bayandor Class frigate, supported by a Bandar Abbas logistics vessel, or a Hengham Class landing ship operating in a logistics role.  Deployments have usually been of 90 days duration, sometimes either shorter or longer, and have often involved a port call in Salalah on the way home.  Returns to port have usually been greeted by a senior Nedaja commander and a press announcement, with details given of the flotilla that has deployed to replace the incoming vessels.\nSince the 99th Flotilla, comprised of IRINSDena(F75) and IRINSBushehr(K422), completed its deployment at the end of last year, the 100th Flotilla may have visited the Gulf of Aden.  But the primary mission of the 100th Flotilla was to take 200 cadets from the Imam Khomeini Naval University on their annual winter training cruise, and in this role the flotilla made a port call to Mumbai in late February.\nThere has been now been no word of Nedaja ships in the Red Sea or Gulf of Aden for several months, so it appears that after over 80 flotillas having successively deployed to the area, the Nedaja has at least temporarily withdrawn its presence.  What should have been the Nedaja’s 101st Flotilla has not been seen in the area.  If the Nedaja has cunningly succeeded in evading surveillance, it would only have been able to do so by withdrawing from the shipping lanes which hitherto had been its responsibility to patrol, or by redesigning its presence strategy.\nThe hypothesis that the Nedaja has pulled back is supported by the higher than normal numbers of frigates and support vessels seen in recent months alongside in the Naval Dockyard in Bandar Abbas.  For example, on March 18, five frigates plus the intelligence collector IRINSZagros(H313) were alongside.  On March 28, imagery identified four Alvand/Moudge and one Bayandor frigates, together with all three operational Hengham Class landing ships were alongside, together implying that there were no long-range flotillas out of home waters at that point.\nRecent satellite imagery has also shown that two of the Nedaja’s three Kilo Class submarines are in dry dock in the Bandar Abbas harbour; the one remaining operational Kilo is not, as of this morning and on the basis of poor quality imagery, at its normal berth.  The Kilo could be expected to be attempting to shadow the Carl Vinson CSG in the Gulf of Oman, and IRINSZagros(H313) with other vessels are likely also to be attempting a similar mission.\nIf confirmed, the withdrawal of the Nedaja from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden waters would be of significance.  The Houthis are known to have relied on the Nedaja and ships of the IRGC Navy to provide intelligence to support their anti-shipping campaign.  The Nedaja appears to have withdrawn when the Houthi need for support, under airstrikes mounted from the two US CSGs, is at its most acute.\nTop image: Moudge-class frigate IRIS Dena (file image courtesyFars Media / CC BY 4.0)",

If it is attempted, the ground offensive could result in fighting over the port city of Hodeidah, a focal point for back-and-forth struggles for control throughout the country's long civil war.\nDr. Abdulaziz Sager, head of the Saudi-based Gulf Research Center,tolda recent Chatham House panel that the Houthis have been hit hard by recent U.S. strikes, and that the internationally-recognized government of Yemen is making preparations to retake the country. While still hopeful for a political agreement, Dr.  Sager suggested that a military solution may be near at hand.\n\"To my best knowledge, there is a preparation of almost 80,000 Yemeni soldiers from the legitimate government in preparation in different locations to move toward taking over. That will be . . . supported by the drone surveillance and by the air coverage by the US side. There has been some serious discussion in that one and I can see that happening,\" Dr. Sager said. \"I think we might be on the stage of counting down to the end of the [Houthis], and they pushed it to this.\"\nThere appears to be preparation for renewed ground combat in the north, near Al Jawf and Sada, and in the south near Taiz, suggested Chatham House research fellow Farea al-Muslimi. \"That is the front lines that the [Saudi and UAE] coalition is arming, in preparation for possibility of resuming ground troops over the next few weeks, and I think that is most likely what will happen,\" said al-Muslimi. \"The current military discussions are moving unfortunately as if the [ground] war is to actually resume in the next hours, not just in the next weeks.\"\nThe Houthis have fought for this coastal strip before, but this time, their ability to defend territory will be limited because of U.S. control over shipping in and out of the port of Hodeidah, al-Muslimi said. The seaport is the main entry point for fuel in western Yemen.\nContinued operations in the Red Sea\nOn Sunday, Houthi sources reported six dead and 30 wounded from U.S. bombing attacks in Yemen. The group calculates the total death toll of the campaign to date at 120 people, including both combatants and civilians.\nThe group also claimed the downing of another American MQ-9 Reaper drone, which U.S. Central Command declined to confirm or deny. The Houthis possess short range surface-to-air missiles that have proven capable of shooting down Reaper drones before.\nCentral Command says that its assets are striking Houthi positions around the clock, but has released limited information about specific targets or individuals hit by the campaign.\nUSS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) living up to its motto: \"Vis Per Mare,\" which means “Strength from the Sea” in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility…pic.twitter.com/4t964ihhbg",

Shipping giant NYK is moving to expand its niche cruise operations with the addition of the newAsuka IIIwhile rival Mitsui O.S.K. Lines is expanding its cruise operations through the purchase of secondhand luxury cruise ships.\nAsuka IIIdeparted Emden, Germany on April 12 for her long delivery run to Japan before her maiden voyage on July 20. At 52,265 gross tons, she is small by international standards but represents a major step forward for the domestic cruise market. Built in Germany by Meyer Werft, it is highlighted that the ship which has accommodations for 740 passengers features a special design that combines open spaces with traditional Japanese aesthetics.\nNYK Cruises highlights that the ship will offer a variety of dining, entertainment, and wellness venues. She will also display Japanese art. The ship has 381 passenger cabins and will have a crew of approximately 470. She is 755 feet (230 meters) in length and joins theAsuka II(50,000 gross tons built in 1990 in Japan asCrystal Harmony) cruising from Yokohama and other Japanese ports. She will call at more than 30 destinations in Japan during her inaugural season, which includes a 12-night Japan Circumnavigation Cruise.\n\n\nInterior design of the ship combines modern elements with traditional Japanese aesthetics (Meyer Werft)\n\nThe order for the new ship was placed in March 2021 becoming the first cruise ship ordered since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the prior year. It was seen as an important demonstration of the future of the cruise industry. She is also one of the first smaller cruise ships to be powered by LNG.\nConstruction ofAsuka IIIbegan in September 2023 with the ceremonial first steel cutting. The first block, a 345-tonne 80-foot (24.6-meter) section, was lowered into the dry dock on December 12, 2023. Float out of the ship took place in January followed by her conveyance at the beginning of March. Sea trials were completed in mid-March.\nIt had been anticipated that NYK would use the ship as a replacement for its current cruise ship. The company however has announced additional itineraries for both ships as it seeks to expand the Japanese cruise market. Similarly, MOL recently acquired a second cruise ship from Carnival Corporation planning to expand to three cruise ships in 2027. It has also announced that it is studying new construction to further expand its cruise operations.",

    "input": "The Aponte family-owned ports operator Terminal Investment Limited (TIL) is in the running to take over the vast majority of CK Hutchison's global container terminal portfolio after adealled by BlackRock hit snags in Beijing. According to the South China Morning Post and Bloomberg, the restructured proposal would see BlackRock keep a 51 percent stake in Hutchison's two terminals in Panama - the sites of greatest interest to the U.S. government - while TIL would take over all 41 other sites around the world.\nIf completed, the transaction would cost TIL about $23 billion, including $19 billion in cash, a source close to the agreement told SCMP on Monday.\nThe accuracy of the reports could not be verified, and may reflect a negotiation in flux. In aninterviewwith Italy's ShipNews conducted Friday or Saturday, while MSCWorld Americawas at Ocean Cay, Aponte family top executive Diego Aponte laid out a much different deal: a three-way global split that would see ownership shared 70% for MSC, 20% for Blackrock, and 10% for CK Hutchison. It was unclear whether this version was still current as of Monday, as it contradicts other reporting.\nWhichever structure prevails, it would be among the biggest business deals in shipping in decades, so long as it can pass muster with authorities in China.\nState-linked media outlets in Hong Kong have publiclyslammedCK Hutchison for its initial attempt to sell the full portfolio to BlackRock, asserting that a mega-deal with an American company would be unpatriotic and would undermine Chinese security interests. According to Bloomberg, Beijing has retaliated by threatening to withhold government business and domestic regulatory approvals from CH Hutchison's family owners, who also have extensive business interests in mainland China.\nBlackRock's bid has heavy diplomatic support from the White House, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to \"take back\" the entire Panama Canal in order to counter alleged Chinese influence on the waterway. Following these maximalist threats, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently suggested that the U.S. has secured a more modest concession from Panama: local cooperation on reducing China's footprint.\nDespite apparent progress on the diplomatic front, Blackrock's attempt to buy the Panamanian terminals has run into a local hurdle. Panama's comptroller generalallegesthat CK Hutchison's most recent lease renewal was never fully approved, and that the Panamanian government has been underpaid by hundreds of million dollars in fees. (CK Hutchison's Panama subsidiary denies any wrongdoing.) If substantiated, the investigation has the potential to slow down BlackRock's portion of the deal.\nBy splitting off the other 41 terminals in the Hutchison portfolio and selling them to TIL, the revised deal would allow Hutchison to complete the majority of its ports divestment without waiting for a Panamanian review - so long as Chinese authorities approve of TIL as a buyer. That might not happen, according to local experts.\n\"Beijing doesn’t have to read the news before knowing who Hutchison is selling the assets to,\" Lau Siu-kai of the pro-government Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies told SCMP. \"Whether it is Italy or any other Western country taking control of the ports, Beijing still opposes the deal because these countries are vulnerable to pressure from the US.\"\nSpeaking with ShipNews, Diego Aponte appeared confident that the transaction would eventually go through. \"I am calm. There are discussions underway, but I believe that in a short time everything will be clarified with the various parties involved. Including the Chinese. To mutual satisfaction,\" he said.",

The Department of Transportation which oversees the Academy along with the New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) entered into a long-term agreement to upgrade the facilities.\nJust over a week ago, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffypledgedto help find the resources needed to restore the institution's infrastructure. During a speech to the midshipmen, he said he was astonished to hear about the conditions in housing and other areas of the campus.\n“Merchant marine cadets have answered the call to serve our country, and it’s our duty to deliver an institution worthy of their sacrifice,” said Duffy. “Our mariners are critical to President Trump’s agenda to make American shipbuilding great again, and more importantly protecting our national security.”\nUnder the terms of the agreement, signed on April 11, the Army Corps will lead the efforts. The initial agreement runs for 10 years. The USACE’s New York District highlights that it already is responsible for a diverse range of engineering projects and services in the New York and New Jersey region, including managing water resources, improving public spaces, conducting environmental restoration, and providing critical infrastructure development.\n“We are looking forward to rehabilitating and modernizing the campus infrastructure at the USMMA,” said Col. Alexander Young, Commander USACE New York District. “It is necessary to ensure current and future generations of midshipmen receive a first-class education. We hope this partnership will serve as a building block for additional collaboration both short and long-term.”\nOne of the nation’s five federal service academies, USMMA ‘s campus was established in the 1940s around the former Long Island North Shore mansion of Walter P. Chrysler. Most of the facilities at USMMA date back to the academy’s founding in the early 1940s, and have not been modernized since. According to the statements during the signing of the new agreement, the facilities are not conducive to the immersive training and demanding coursework today’s midshipmen are required to complete.  The Academy's website reports the Regiment of Midshipmen numbers approximately 950 young men and women.\nA 2021 report mandated by the U.S. Congress cited along list of problemsat the Academy. It cited a lack of investment in the infrastructure and the poor condition of many of the facilities. The report was also critical of the management of the academy.\nVADM Joanna M. Nunan, after a 35-year U.S. Coast Guard career, became the 14th Superintendent of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in December 2022 with a focus on reforming the operations. Earlier this month, USMMA named its first-ever permanent Director of Facilities and Infrastructure, John T. Shea (USMMA’89). He is responsible for overseeing the long-term planning, maintenance, and modernization of the academy’s physical plant and infrastructure and will be working closely with USACE to implement the revitalization and modernization.",

    "input": "\nLess than a year after becoming the first port in Europe to offer shore power for large containerships, Hamburg, Germany is on track to complete the installation of shore power capabilities at all its terminals for large containerships. Testing commenced last week at the third of the port’s container terminals with officials saying they remain on track to provide shore power at all the large containership terminals by the end of this year.\nThe port is well ahead of the EU mandate requiring the use of shore power. Regulations mandating shore power be phased in starting in 2030 for containerships and passenger vessels over 5,000 gross tons. By 2035, all EU ports are required to have an on-shore power supply or alternative zero-emission technologies.\nLast week, a further important milestone for the sustainable development of the Port of Hamburg was reached as the shore-side power station of the Hamburg Port Authority at HHLA Container Terminal Altenwerder (CTA) completed its first practical test. The first “ship integration test” was conducted and in the coming weeks, the terminal will continue to increase its power. Further test runs have already been planned to integrate the supply of shore-side power for containerships into regular operations in the Port of Hamburg.\nThe testing was done with theMSC Athens(110,853 dwt). It is one of the company’s smaller vessels with a capacity of 8,800 TEU but is a stepping stone to the larger vessels.\n“Every successful ship integration test brings us one step closer to integrating the power stations into regular operations,” said Friedrich Stuhrmann, Chief Commercial Officer of HPA.\nWith the power station at CTA, the third shore-side power station for containerships in the Port of Hamburg is now in the transitional phase leading up to regular operations. Additionally, the power station at HHLA Container Terminal Burchardkai is expected to be ready this year. The 18,000 TEU box shipCMA CGM Vasco de Gamabecame the first vessel to plug into shore power at the Container Terminal Hamburg in May 2024.\nTo facilitate shore power connections to box ships, Hamburg began investments in 2022 for the necessary infrastructure culminating in a plant that will operate at the container terminal providing connections for three mega-ship berths. Each has a connection capacity of 7.5 MVA. The plant will supply the ships with renewable energy from the public grid. Half of the funding for the shore power installation at Container Terminal Hamburg came from the German government through the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection.\nMSC announced in June 2024 that it had agreed to work with Hamburg to install shore power for its terminal. Later last year MSC became the lead investor in the port operator along with the City of Hamburg.\n“The integration of shore power into our fleet is an important step towards sustainable shipping,” saidNils Kahn, Managing Director, MSC Germany. The shipping company reports it owns approximately 40 vessels that can be charged with shore-side electricity. The number continues to grow as it takes delivery of its newbuilds.",

    "input": "\nIn a hearing Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board approved final conclusions from the investigation of the fire aboard the ro/roGrande Costa D'Avorioat Newark in 2023. The investigators confirmed that the fire started when the Jeep Wrangler that longshoremen used as a pusher vehicle overheated and burned inside the cargo bay, catching other nearby vehicles on fire.\nGrimaldi ro/ros likeGrande Costa D'Avoriocarry thousands of used cars from the U.S. to Africa, including \"forklift\" cars that are so damaged that they won't roll and \"non-runner\" vehicles that have to be pushed aboard. Terminal operator Ports America's local unit in Newark was in the practice of using ordinary passenger vehicles as pusher trucks to shove non-running but still-rolling cars up the loading ramp and up the interior ramps inside the ro/ro.\nThe pusher that caught fire was a Jeep Wrangler, and NTSB noted that it was in use in an \"industrial application for which it was not intended.\" This particular vehicle model was subject to a recall notice because its transmission had a tendency to overheat under extreme offroad use. Overheating would cause the transmission fluid to boil out of the housing and contact hot engine parts or exhaust piping, where it would catch fire. To address this known problem, the recall required installing an audible hot oil alarm and a warning light on the dashboard; the Jeep had had this service done - but the alarm was just a warning, not a shutoff.\nOn the day of the fire,Grande Costa D'Avoriowas loading 920 used cars for export, including nonrunners. At about 2100 hours, a longshoreman was driving the Wrangler on his 38th push run of the day up the ro/ro's interior ramps - a far heavier task than the offroading conditions addressed by Jeep's recall. He was shoving a nonrunner ahead when he heard a clunk, and he saw \"fireballs\" dripping from underneath the vehicle.\n\nSecurity camera footage shows the Jeep Wrangler making its final run as a pusher vehicle (USCG)\nBased on the recall notice, the evidence from the scene and the extreme duty cycle imposed on the Jeep, NTSB concluded that the casualty was caused by the decision to use a vehicle that wasn't designed for the application - resulting in its transmission oil boiling over and catching fire on hot engine parts.\nThe Jeep operator was not able to get the fire out with an extinguisher, and the ship's fire alarm system went off, alerting the crew. 22 minutes after the fire was discovered, the master ordered the space sealed off and the fixed CO2 firefighting system discharged. However, the crew could not close the Deck 12 garage door because there was no external control to operate it. In order to close it, one crewmember would have had to stand inside the burning space, hold an actuator button down to shut themselves in with the smoke and fire, then make their way 120 feet aft to a ladder well on the port side - between tightly parked cars. (The lack of a button on the ramp side of the door was a SOLAS violation, according to NTSB, but the class society told the agency that it was acceptable because the door stays closed while at sea and does not need to be operated under way - only in port.)\nThe remains of the pusher Jeep, showing its retrofitted channel steel bumper (NTSB)\nThe captain agreed that closing the door with crewmembers on the fire side would be unsafe, so the garage door stayed open. The CO2 system was discharged anyways with the door still fully open; an ATF study performed after the fact found that if the crew had had a practical way to close the door, the CO2 would have put out the fire.\nWhen firefighters arrived on scene, the incident commander ordered a squad into the space to attack the fire. The local fire department's decision to open and close other compartment boundaries for moving personnel in and out further reduced the CO2 concentration and the fixed firefighting system's effectiveness, NTSB concluded, \"ultimately increasing the severity of the fire.\" NTSB noted that this decision was contrary to normal marine firefighting practice.\nTwo firefighters went missing in the space and a SAR effort began. The compartment's ventilation system was turned on to clear smoke - removing the rest of the CO2 and introducing fresh oxygen. The two missing mentragically lost their livesinside the space, and the fire burned for days.\nNTSB believes that the two firefighters were exposed to unnecessary risk when they were ordered into the CO2 flooding zone without being informed that it had been activated. The incident commander did not communicate the fact that the CO2 system had been discharged to the personnel entering the ship; at one point, a fire battalion chief even climbed a ladder well and opened a hatch to look in, despite the risk of asphyxiation on the other side. \"His breath was taken away,\" said NTSB investigator Bart Barnum.\nNTSB found that most of the local first responders had not recently taken marine firefighting classes, and they were not familiar with the vessel's fire control plan or with CO2 flooding systems. \"Lack of marine vessel firefighting training left the land based firefighters unprepared to respond to a vessel fire, resulting in an ineffective response that contributed to the fire's spread, vessel damage and led to the firefighters' casualties,\" NTSB concluded.\nUltimately, NTSB's staff believes that local Newark firefighters should never have entered the space to fight the fire. \"The best method to extinguish that fire was to work with the crew to close the Deck 12 door and allow the CO2 to function,\" said Barnum.\nThe NTSB has issued a recommendation to AAPA to inform all port authorities of the risks of the dangerous misuse of passenger trucks as pusher vehicles. It also asked seaports to help out their local fire departments to increase awareness, adopt basic vessel familiarization and firefighter training among first responders.\nNTSB also recommended that theGrande Costa D'Avorio'sclass society should change its guidelines to require SOLAS fire doors to be closeable from both sides.",

These functions will now be handled by temporary \"workarounds,\" the service said, until the same functions are transferred to new \"secure information systems.\"\n“We recognize that Homeport has been a trusted tool for mariners and the broader maritime community,” said Rear Adm. Wayne Arguin, Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy. “We are committed to keeping these users informed and providing alternatives to the functions and information Homeport provided as we transition.”\nHomeport was developed to comply with the post-9/11 Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, and while dated, it was widely utilized by industry for everyday tasks. In addition to administrative forms and regulatory guidance, it included a full list of Captain of the Port (COTP) zones, and users could find all harbor status and navigation advisories from every COTP during hurricanes or emergencies. It also had tools that employers could use to confirm the validity of mariners' credentials and that mariners could use to track the status of credential applications.\nThe Coast Guard cited \"increased costs and system obsolescence\" for the shutdown. It plans to replace Homeport with a new version of the site within 12-18 months, and the new tool will \"provide users with the information they need in a more focused and secure format.\"\nFor now, Homeport's functions will be handled by temporary workarounds, according to USCG 7th District. Merchant mariner credentialing queries will be handled directly by the National Maritime Center (NMC).\nOther important Coast Guard legacy sites - like the portals for vessel inspection data, Coast Guard personnel wages, transfer requests, and fee payments - remain online.\nThe Coast Guard's planned investment for an internal logistics and parts-tracking database upgrade,CG-LIMS, has recently been canceled to save costs. The service said that the \"ineffective\" CG-LIMS program's $33 million in funding will be redirected to address \"emerging needs.\"",

    "input": "Chinese officials touted the new class of CMA CGM containerships as the “world’s largest dual-fuel powered” containerships as the naming and delivery took place of the new CMA CGM Seine (220,000 dwt). They highlighted the advancements in design and speed of construction for a vessel they are calling a “sea giant” and a “green cargo king.”\nThe CMA CGM Seine has the same dimensions as the five-year-old CMA CGM Jacques Saade class but greatly improves on efficiency. The ship, which is 399 meters (1,309 feet) in length and has a beam of 61.3 meters (201 feet), is reported will reduce emissions by 20 percent and nearly eliminate SOx and particulate matter. It has increased efficiency in its LNG-fueled engines and an 18,600 cbm MARK III LNG tank to give it a range of 19,500 nautical miles. The ship is also fully IMP Tier III compliant.\nCargo handling efficiency was also improved with an increase of approximately 764 TEU to a total of 23,876 TEU. This includes 2,200 reefer slots. Boxes can be stacked 24 layers. The fire safety systems for cargo operations were also improved. The ship rivals the first 24,000-plus TEU capacity vessels also built in China.\n“From the start of construction to undocking at the pier, the time has been compressed to 4–5 months, significantly ahead of the original construction cycle,” Liu Xuedong, deputy general manager of Hudong-Zhonghua Changxing Shipbuilding, told the Chinese media. “This ship was delivered more than six months early, with cycle control at a leading level in the shipbuilding industry.”\n\n\n\nThe naming and delivery took place on April 15 in Shanghai. The vessel will be joining the line’s Far East to Europe route.\nIt is the first of four new vessels being built for CMA CGM in this ultra large class. Shipbuilder Hudong-Zhonghau reports it has now delivered 17 containerships to CMA CGM, including 12 LNG-fueled vessels. Overall, the yard reports it currently has 20 vessels under construction and a total orderbook reaching 2029 and valued at $19.6 billion.\nThis new class is the latest step in CMA CGM’s effort with the company reporting it has invested nearly $20 billion to order LNG and methanol-powered ships. In 2024, the group took delivery of 12 new LNG-fueled vessels and says that by 2029 it will have 153 ships capable of using low-carbon energies (biogas, biomethanol, and synthetic fuels) in its fleet. CMA CGM is reported to have a total fleet currently of approximately 670 vessels with orders of 100 additional ships.",

A vessel of this class would be smaller and less capable than the Coast Guard's medium icebreaker, USCGCHealy, or the service's long-delayed Polar Security Cutter (PSC).\nThe RFI indicates that the Coast Guard has an interest in moving swiftly, as it is seeking a yard that can deliver within three years of a contract award. This would require a rapid wind-up at a capable yard or an open slot on a hot production line. Only a few shipyards in the world have recent experience producing thick-hulled icebreaking vessels, and all are located outside of the United States.\nThe RFI could align with the goals of the ICE Pact, the joint icebreaker construction agreement that the Biden administration signed with Canada and Finland in 2024. In parallel with the ICE Pact, Canadian shipbuilder Davie proposed to use its expertise to open a yard in the United States to build icebreaking vessels - though this plan would require a longer timetable than the RFI's three-year maximum.",

The group issued its statement targeting a transshipment of containers coming from the United States set to be transferred at Morocco’s Tanger Med Port this weekend.\nMaersk has repeatedly denied the allegations that it is transporting weapons to Israel during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The issue had been dogging the company and even became a topic at its annual shareholder meeting earlier this year. Shareholdersvoted downan activist investor resolution that would have banned the company from shipping arms to Israel.\nA spokesperson for Maersk told media in Morocco that the current claims were coming from activist groups and are “false and misleading.” The company said the claims it was transporting weapons or in this case, spare parts to the Israeli military are “unfounded claims based on assumptions made by activist groups.”\nThe latest accusations are that a container loaded with spare parts for U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets was loaded on theMaersk Detroit(84,626 dwt vessel with a capacity of 6,200 TEU) which is currently inbound for the Moroccan port. According to the reports that have been circulating for days, the container will be offloaded and transferred to theNexoe Maersk(31,500 dwt with a capacity of 2,250 TEU) for transshipment to Israel.\nThe Moroccan Union of Port Workers, affiliated with the Moroccan Labor Union, issued a statement calling on workers, employees, and executives of companies operating the port to boycott the shipNexoe Maersk. It cited the reports from the activists that the ship would be carrying the F-35 parts and other military equipment to Israel.\nTheDetroit Maersksailing under the U.S. flag is operated by Maersk Line, Limited, which participates in the U.S. Maritime Security Program (MSP) program and carries cargoes, including the military assistance shipments, which are reported to be a “critical element of U.S. foreign policy.” The line has been targeted by activists for previous boycotts due to its support of the U.S. government.\nTheNexoe Maersk, flagged in Hong Kong, is a feeder ship for the company. It operates a route that includes calls in the Mediterranean.\nWhile denying the allegations, a Maersk spokesperson noted when they carry F-35 parts they would be going to suppliers and not the military. They would also only be going to countries participating in the F-35 program.\nMaersk has repeatedly said it has a strict policy against transporting weapons or ammunition to conflict zones. The spokesperson said there are stringent controls in place.\nActivists have repeatedly targeted ships operated by Maersk Line, LTD. for its role in carrying U.S. cargoes. Last November, in Spain a group focused on two ships with reports the vessels woulddivertto Morocco due to the protests. Maersk operates the terminal in Tanger Med where the reports said the current transshipment will take place.\n\nTop photo ofNexoe Maerskin 2023 byFarid Mernissi(CC BY 4.0)",

    "input": "\nThe ICC International Maritime Bureau (IMB) issued its quarterly report on global piracy warning of a rise in global piracy and armed robbery incidents driven by a spike in attacks in the Singapore Straits. Southeast Asia, and specifically the regions around the Singapore Strait has become the global hotspot warns the report while the figures show that globally piracy continues to decline.\nThe UK-based group which is often referred to as the anti-crime arm of the International Chamber of Commerce, added its voice to that of ReCAAP in Asia and private security firms which have all sounded an alarm about the spike in robberies on ships transiting the Singapore Strait. IMB calculates that 31 of the total of 45 incidents during the first quarter happened in Southeast Asia. The Q1 report highlights that 27 incidents were reported in the Singapore Straits compared to seven for the same period in 2024.\n“The reported rise of incidents in the Singapore Straits is concerning,” said IMB Director Michael Howlett highlighting the urgent need to protect the safety of seafarers navigating these waters. “Ensuring the security of these vital routes is essential and all necessary measures must be taken to safeguard crew members.”\nRaising additional concern is the fact that 92 percent of all vessels targeted in the Singapore Straits were successfully boarded. IMB says this includes nine bulk carriers and tankers over 100,000 deadweight tonnage in size. Further, it highlights that while most incidents were considered low-level opportunistic crimes, crewmembers were at great risk with guns reported in 14 incidents. In 2024, guns were reported in 26 incidents globally. Ten crew members were taken hostage in six separate incidents, two were threatened and one was reported injured.\nGlobally during the first quarter, IMB calculates 37 vessels were boarded, four were hijacked and four had attempted attacks. The threat to crew safety remains high with 37 crew members taken hostage, 13 kidnapped, two threatened and one injured. Also in three-quarters of the incidents (35), the ships were underway when the attacks took place.\nWhile incidents are rising in Southeast Asia, the data also highlights that the number of reported incidents within the Gulf of Guinea continues to be at its lowest in nearly two decades.\nIMB however warns the danger off West Africa is not over. All 13 crewmembers reported kidnapped during the quarter were taken in these waters. Two separate attacks resulted in kidnappings and a total of six incidents were reported in the first quarter of the year. In March, pirates hijacked a bitumen tanker southeast of Santo Antonio, in Sao Tome and Principe, kidnapping 10 crew members, while a fishing vessel south of Accra, Ghana, was boarded by armed pirates who kidnapped three crew members.\n“While we welcome the reduction of incidents, the safety of crew members in the Gulf of Guinea remains at greater risk,” said Howlett. “It is essential to maintain a strong regional and international naval presence to address these incidents and ensure the protection of seafarers.”\nSimilarly, off the East Coast of Africa, the threat of Somali piracy also remains. Between February 7 and March 16, two fishing vessels and a dhow were hijacked off the coast of Somalia. In these incidents, 26 crew members were taken hostage, demonstrating the continued capabilities of Somali pirates. Reports indicate all crew have been released along with the vessels.",

The agency participated in the ongoing efforts to investigate theYi Peng 3(75,121 dwt bulker registered in China) which was linked to thedamageto two undersea communications cables.\nThe government agency that investigates accidents and incidents states that it “cannot be determined with certainty whether a Chinese ship intentionally damaged data cables in the Baltic Sea in November 2024.” It however also notes that its assessment does not prevent the Swedish Public Prosecutor’s Office from conducting a preliminary investigation into a suspected crime and that law enforcement authorities in several affected states are conducting criminal investigations into the incident.\nIn an 18-page presentation (online in Swedish) the board details its observations aboard the vessel. It however notes the limitations it was working under saying that the flag state normally leads the investigation and that the Chinese limited its access. They were not given an opportunity to access electronic evidence such as the surveillance images from the Voyage Data Recorder and limited crew interviews with interpreters and authorities present in the room.\nThe board concludes that there are “two alternative scenarios for the incident, one of which is that the ship deliberately released the anchor to cause damage to the bottom infrastructure during the voyage in the Baltic Sea. … The other alternative is that the anchor came loose because it was poorly secured or not at all.”\nThe crew asserted during the interviews that the release of the anchor was unintentional. Investigators pointed out that the vessel dragged its port anchor for 1.5 days or approximately 180 nautical miles. Among the points they highlight supporting a possible accidental release is weather conditions, which according to the logs on the ship were slightly worse than the Swedish authorities had believed. In an oncoming sea the report notes with extra force from the ship’s speed and bow hitting the sea, “could be sufficient to cause the anchor to start running out.”\nThey note the ship did not slow down saying it would have been natural to reduce speed to prevent risking damage to the ship or endangering the crew during the release. They also determined the anchor and a section of chain hit the seafloor leaving a mark. It then dragged and bounced across the floor.\nDuring the examination of the ship, they noted a number of conditions such as the lack of marks on the windlass to indicate the brake had been applied. They could not determine if the anchor had been fully secured after the vessel departed Russia, but also noted a lack of damage to elements that might have been expected if the anchor broke free. They also noted that elements such as equipment covers might have been changed before they were permitted to board the ship.\nIt is not the first time the authorities have failed to find specific evidence of sabotage after the series of incidents in the Baltic region. In February 2025, the Swedish Prosecutor’s Office released the Navibulgar bulkerVezhenalso saying it couldnot find evidenceof sabotage. A commercial fishing trawler was also detained after another incident but released after only a few hours.\nBaltic nations remain on high alert after a series of incidents and were successful in getting NATO to increase its assets in the region. Patrols have been increased while the nations plot new steps to safeguard their undersea infrastructure which they believe has become a target in a new style of war.",

Out of 476 people aboard, 304 were killed in the sinking, most of them high school students. The master of the vessel abandoned ship early without joining in the rescue, and he instructed the crew to tell passengers to stay in their cabins, potentially increasing the death toll. He was later convicted of murder by omission and is serving a life term in a Korean prison. Other members of the crew and one Korea Coast Guard officer were convicted of lesser offenses.\nIn an attempt to recover all human remains from the wreckage and investigate the cause of the disaster, Korean authorities hired Shanghai Salvage to raise theSewolin one piece and move it to shore - the deepest wreck raising ever attempted. The recovery effort gave investigators unrivalled access to a sunken ship, intact, dry and resting on its side on a seaport quay.\nIn the latest review of the much-studied accident, the Korea Maritime Safety Tribunal determined that there was no evidence of an external collision, and it focused on factors internal to the vessel. Previous inquiries have already determined that the vessel was heavily overloaded, and that it was intrinsically topheavy due to owner-initiated modifications on the upper decks.\nIn a conclusion similar to a 2018 investigation, the panel determined that a solenoid valve failed on the No. 2 steering pump, causing a malfunction. The resulting hard turn causedSewolto heel over; because the cargo aboard the vessel was not properly secured, it shifted to one side, adding to the heeling moment. The vessel lacked enough GM to overcome it, downflooded through hull penetrations, and capsized.",

An American-assisted forensic review of the devices shows that they were designed to collect data that could be used for \"underwater warfare,\" according to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\nIn a press conference Tuesday, AFP spokesman Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad said that the devices were found in locations that are \"important strategically in the defence and security not only of the country, but for international maritime navigation.\" Three were in the Taiwan Strait off Luzon; one was found off Masbate, near the center of the Philippines' internal waters; and one was found off Mindanao, the southern end of the archipelago. \"Most likely, these were dropped by a mothership,\" he said.\nTrinidad said that they were capable of collecting data \"beyond navigation.\" The sensor package aboard could be used to measure bathymetry, water depth, salinity and temperature - all essential data for operating or hunting submarines. Jonathan Malaya, a member of the National Task Force for the Philippine Sea, told media that the drones were \"in all likelihood deployed by China to map the Philippines' underwater terrain.\"\nOut of the five drones, at least one had sent signals to China, based on a forensics exam of a cell SIM card found aboard the drone. \"The last contact of the card was in mainland China,\" Trinidad said. Two drones also had Chinese markings.\nBased on the evidence, Trinidad put the probability that the drones belong to China at about 55-80 percent. Malaya went further, and said that the forensic data \"allowed us to conclusively determine that they are of Chinese origin.\"\nFew nations make seaglider drones, and images of some of the devices displayed Tuesday appear similar to the Chinese-built \"Sea Wing\" (Haiyi) UUV developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, previously found in sensitive waterways in Indonesia in 2019-20. The AFP also displayed photos of an unusual all-black glider, fitted with larger protrusions fore and aft.\n\n\nThe reveal of the new forensic evidence comes just days ahead of the launch of annual U.S.-Philippine Balikatan defense drills. This year, 14,000 troops will participate, the majority from the United States. \"It’s a defense plan being tested,\" Philippine Army Brigadier General Michael Logico told media.\nIn time for the exercise, Google Maps has adopted the Philippines' name for waters in its western exclusive economic zone, an area that is also claimed by China. Users of the Maps app will now find a marginal sea with a Philippine sovereign name - the West Philippine Sea - just off the coast of Luzon and Palawan. The decision has angered Chinese commentators, who would prefer to continue the use of the name \"South China Sea\" for the entire region.",

Fires can spread rapidly within enclosed ro/ro decks, and EV fires are even harder to put out.New industry guidancecalls for operators to respond with evacuation, ventilation shutdown and initiation of CO2 flooding very early in the firefighting process - before the fire can spread or injure anyone.\nAt about 1500 hours, a fire broke out aboard the ro/ro cargo vesselDelphineat the CLdN terminal in Zeebrugge. The blaze started on the third deck, which contained 60 electric vehicles and 40 conventional cars. The captain opted to fully evacuate the ship's 26-member crew, but stayed aboard to coordinate as firefighters and other first responders from shore came aboard to assist. Four firefighting tugs also arrived on scene to provide cooling water on the starboard side.\nForse brandweerinzet in haven van Zeebrugge.

The fire suppression system worked as designed, and the fire was brought under control, according to port vice-chairman Dirk de Fauw. \"There was a lot of smoke from the electric cars, which also made the extinguishing work more difficult,\" he said.\nThe fire department is aware of the possibility of a reflash and is standing by overnight, de Fauw told local VRT. The fire department said in a statement that it was trucking in a fresh supply of inert gas to release into the hold in order to displace any intrusion of oxygen.\n\"The vehicles are no longer burning, but as soon as fresh air comes onto the deck we will have a resurgence,\" the brigade told HLN. \"We have to avoid that. For that reason, we will blow nitrogen into the deck that we will have brought over from Antwerp. Although it is still not certain that the situation will be under control.\"\nResponders believe that 60-70 vehicles in the hold have burned out, but the full extent of the damage remains to be seen.

    "input": "\nAn interimfactfinding reporton the allision involving the boxshipMaersk Shekouat Fremantle last year suggests that the vessel's helmsman and pilots were operating with different goals. The helmsman was actively steering to maintain a heading of 083 degrees, his last received helm order. Meanwhile, the pilots were trying to make an emergency turn to port, using full ahead thrust, assist tugs, bow thrusters and the port anchor - unaware that their helmsman was applying starboard rudder to counteract them. The ship hit a historic tall ship and a museum, causing considerable damage.\nIn the early hours of August 22, 2024,Maersk Shekoubegan heading inbound into Fremantle's harbor and took aboard two pilots. The primary pilot assigned for the transit was fatigued, so the backup pilot took charge during the master/pilot exchange.\nAt about 0610, as they entered the narrow entrance channel for the inner harbor, southwesterly winds picked up to about 40 knots on the starboard quarter. The ship began to swing to starboard. The pilot ordered the helmsman to steer 083; the helmsman correctly acknowledged the order at about 0613:45. This was the heading that the helmsman would try to maintain throughout the final minutes of the casualty sequence.\nAt the time that the order was given, the helmsman had the rudder hard to port to counteract the effects of the strengthening wind. It wasn't enough to do the job, andMaersk Shekou'sheading was about four degrees off to starboard (087). The master suggested going to full ahead to increase steering forces, and at about 0614:34, the pilot agreed. There was a pier ahead, and they needed to turn to port fast in order to enter the harbor.\nWith more power and a series of assist tug movements,Maersk Shekoubegan to swing back to port. As it swung back from 087 through 086, the helmsman moved to check the swing: he brought the helm to midships, then briefly to 33 degrees starboard. The vessel steadied up squarely on 083, the last ordered heading he had received, which was straight towards the pier.\n\nCourtesy ATSB\nThe pilot was unsure why the vessel had stopped swinging to port, and at 1615:33 he told the (fatigued) secondary pilot that something was wrong. The secondary pilot had been on a phone conversation at the back of the bridge and had not been involved in the back-and-forth among the bridge team, but he interrupted the call and joined the decisionmaking process.\nTogether, without checking in with the helmsman, they began working the assist tugs to try to turnMaersk Shekouto port. The rudder was amidships at this point, and the helmsman was maintaining a steady heading of 083.5 towards the moored tall shipSTS Leeuwin II- now less than a ship length away, with the boxship full ahead and making seven knots.\nAt 0615:54, the master put the bow thrusters full to port. At 0616:10, the secondary pilot ordered stop engines, then full astern, and the master ordered the crew to prepare to drop the port anchor.\nBeginning at 0616:21, as these emergency measures to turn to port were under way, the helmsman applied more starboard rudder to try to counteract the effort to turn to port. The rudder would be over to starboard as much as 29 degrees over the course of the next minute.\nAt 0616:49, the engines reached full astern andMaersk Shekoubegan to slow. The anchor, tugs and bow thruster managed to start a swing to port, but not fast enough to avert an allision. At about 0618,Maersk ShekouhitSTS Leeuwin IIat about three knots, dismasting the sailing vessel and prompting the two crewmembers aboard to flee onto the pier. They escaped with minor injuries.\n\nMaersk Shekou makes contact with STS Leeuwin II\nMaersk Shekoucame to a full stop by about 0618:30, but continued to spin in place. The bow thrusters were still on full to port, and the ship was swinging to port at about 13 degrees per minute. At 0619:52, the master noted to the pilots that the bow thrusters were still running with full power to port, and the thrusters were shut down - but not quickly enough to prevent contact in the narrow confines of the harbor.\n40 seconds later, a stack of containers onMaersk Shekou'sstarboard quarter hit the roof of the Western Australia Maritime Museum. The ship's hull scraped along the wharf for a short distance, damaging the quayside and breaching a small section of the hull plating above the waterline.\nThe ATSB continues its investigation and will release its full report, including its formal conclusions, when it has completed its review.",

    "input": "\nThe Norwegian Storting (Parliament) has confirmed the requirements and schedule for the regulations to move passenger and ferry shipping to zero emissions while sailing within the country’s World Heritage fjords. The first phase is set to start in 2026 and progress as technology becomes available for larger ships to sail with zero emissions.\nThe process of developing the regulations began in 2018 with the Norwegian Maritime Authority. Implementation however has beendelayedas they worked to define the scope of the regulations and waited for technology to advance to the level required to maintain shipping while achieving the goals.\n“The process of developing zero-emission requirements for the World Heritage fjords has been long and demanding, both for the industry and for the Norwegian Maritime Authority,” said Alf Tore Sørheim, Director General of Shipping and Navigation. “Now that new provisions have been adopted, it is important to highlight that they provide the clarity the industry has long awaited. This ensures predictability and offers the opportunity to comply with the requirements.”\nThe first phase is just eight months away. As of January 1, 2026, passenger ships of less than 10,000 gross tons will have to meet the zero-emission requirement for the World Heritage fjords, which include Geirangerfjorden, a primary destination for the cruise industry, as well as Nærøyfjorden, Aurlandsfjorden, Sunnylvsfjorden and Tafjorden. All passenger ships, including ferries, must meet the requirement, but for larger ships of 10,000 gross tons and above it will be phased in with the requirement to sail with zero emissions as of January 1, 2032.\nThe Minister of Climate and Environment, Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, describes the legislation as a significant breakthrough for the World Heritage fjords. It is a key step in Norway’s overall sustainability programs and a commitment to the tourism industry.\nThe authorities note that the zero-emission requirement is technology-neutral and does not prescribe specific solutions. It is up to the operators in the World Heritage fjords to use energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide (CO?) and methane (CH?). However, when such energy sources are used, there are requirements for greenhouse gas emission reductions, in accordance with the EU regulatory framework.\nAs part of the final test of the regulation, the government determined that passenger ships may use biogas as an alternative fuel, but that when biogas is used as an alternative fuel, it must be kept separate from fossil fuels until it is bunkered. In addition, the biogas must be bunkered within the final month before the ship enters the World Heritage fjords, and the amount bunkered must correspond to the amount expected to be used during the voyage through the fjords. Biogas sourced from the gas grid, accompanied by a certificate based on a mass balance system, does not meet the requirements for operating in the World Heritage fjords.\nIt also includes a requirement that ships must use shore power where available. The Storting also agreed to create shore-side electricity in the city of Flåm. It is allocating NOK 100 million ($9.5 million) in support of a shore power project.\nNorway is at the forefront of developing technologies including batteries for its ferries as well as alternative fuels. In 2022, coastal ship operator Havila ran thefirst demonstrationof a passenger ship operating solely on batteries in Geirangerfjord. Competitor Hurtigruten has also released its concept designs for a zero-emission passenger ship.",

    "input": "In a stunning move late on Wednesday, April 16, the U.S. Department of Interior announced it has ordered a stop to the construction of Equinor’s Empire Wind offshore wind farm. The project had been approved in 2024 and was underway. The move is drawing sharp criticism from New York State Governor Kathy Hochul and leaving the industry stunned.\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum posted a brief message on X writing that Interior in consultation with Commerce is “directing the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to immediately halt all construction activities on the Empire Wind project until further review of information that suggest the Biden administration rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis.”\nWhile the Biden administration did approve several projects late in its term, Empire Wind receivedapprovalfor its Construction and Operations Plan in February 2024. The project also received its Clean Air Permit for construction in February 2024.\nNorway’s Equinor acquired the Empire Wind lease area in 2017 and in June 2024, announced the execution of the Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority for Empire Wind 1 power for 25 years at a strike price of $155.00/MWh. Thefinancial closefor the project was completed in December 2024. The expected total capital investments, including fees for the use of the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, Equinor reported would be approximately $5 billion including the effect of expected future tax credits. New York had issued itsfinal approvalsfor the project in May 2024.\nNew York’s governor who has already been fighting with the Trump administration over congestion pricing for vehicles in Manhattan issued an angry statement saying the federal government should be supporting its efforts for affordable energy “rather than undermining them.”\n“This fully federally permitted project has already put shovels in the ground before the President’s executive orders—it’s exactly the type of bipartisan energy solution we should be working on,” said Governor Hochul in her statement. “As Governor, I will not allow this federal overreach to stand. I will fight this every step of the way to protect union jobs, affordable energy, and New York’s economic future.”\nThe news site FreeBeacon obtained a copy of Burgum’s memorandum to the acting director of BOEM. In it, he contends that “serious issues” were raised on the approval for Empire Wind. He says it was rushed through without sufficient analysis or consultation among the relevant agencies.\nBurgum also writes that he is directing BOEM to continue to review the federal wind permitting practices “to both existing and pending permits.”\nWork had begun on the redevelopment of the site in Brooklyn which was to be used as the base of the wind farm during construction and its future maintenance operations. FreeBeacon reports rock work was scheduled to begin in the coming weeks at the offshore site along with other preparations. The wind farm was scheduled to provide power starting in 2027.\nEmpire Wind 1 and Empire Wind 2, both of which were approved in 2024, are located about 12 nautical miles south of Long Island, N.Y., and about 16.9 nm east of Long Branch, N.J. Together the projects would have a total capacity of 2,076 megawatts of renewable energy that BOEM estimated could power more than 700,000 homes each year.\nTrump in January 2025 ordered a review of the leasing and permitting practices but most expected it would be a stop to future activity. The administration however also pulled the EPA permit for construction on a New Jersey project. There are several other projects currently in the construction phase. The Biden administration had approved a total of 11 offshore wind farms and left others in review at the end of its term.",

According to court documents, Lowe's message read \"Hey, I think someone might have a bomb on your sunrise cruise ship [sic].\" Carnival took the matter seriously, andCarnival Sunrise- which was under way in the Caribbean - was diverted to Jamaica for an inspection. Officials had to search through more than 1,000 cabins for any sign of a hazardous device; none was found.\nLowe's motivation, according to prosecutors, was not related to  Carnival or to the ship. He was angry at his girlfriend, who had gone on a cruise with her family \"while leaving him behind to care for their pets.\" The FBI traced the email address back to Lowe and questioned him; he admitted sending the message.\nWhen he was charged, Lowe took responsibility for writing the email and pleaded guilty to a single count of false information and hoaxes. On Monday, he was sentenced to eight months in prison followed by two years of supervised release. The relationship he had with his girlfriend is now over, his counsel said in a memorandum before the sentencing.\n\"Bomb threats are not a laughing matter and are extremely irresponsible,\" said Cheyvoryea Gibson, FBI Special Agent in Charge for the case. \"When individuals make false hoax threats, they divert critical law enforcement resources and spread unnecessary fear. The FBI takes all threats to life seriously and will ensure that those who resort to this kind of intimidation face the appropriate consequences.\"",

North Korean ammunition is shipped in containers from Raijin to the Russian ports of Danube and Vostochny in the Vladivostok area.  By monitoring the four Russian flagged RO-RO container ships carrying the containers - MVAngara(IMO 9179842),Lady Mariia(IMO 9220641),Maya-1(IMO 9358010) andLady R(IMO 9161003) - then counting the containers on board and measuring volumes, OSC has been able to accurately gauge the number of artillery shells being shipped. All four of the Russian ships are US-sanctioned, and several have also been used for hauling military cargoes to and from Tartus in Syria.\nMVMaya-1has recently come off the Sea of Japan route, loaded cargo in China, transited the Suez Canal in February and conducted a turn-round in Kaliningrad, leaving on April 10 for an unknown destination.  It has apparently been unimpeded whilst in transit or during its port calls, despite being sanctioned.\nOSC tracked 64 trips by the four Russian ships between September 2023 and March 2025.  Traffic peaked in January 2024, when seven cargoes were shipped.  By March 2025, only three cargoes per month were being shipped.  Over the entire period, the 64 sailings sighted shipped a calculated 15,809 containers, with each container likely to have held 224 boxes of 152mm artillery shells, or other loads made up of rockets, 122mm or mortar rounds. Using these figures, OSC estimates that up to 6 million shells might have been shipped to Russia by North Korea by the end of March 2025.\nOnce unloaded at the Russian ports, the containers are moved by train directly to Russia ammunition depots servicing the Ukrainian front line. The main receiving depot at Tikhoretsk, 60 miles south of Rostov, was attacked by Ukrainian drones on September 21, 2024, with an estimated 90% of the stockpile destroyed.  In 2025, Ukraine is planning on producing 3000 of its own-design Bars, Peklo and R-360 Neptune missiles, the latter of which has a range of more than 600 miles, and all of which are capable of attacking Moscow\nUkrainian defense intelligence estimates that North Korea is providing half of the ammunition currently being consumed on the Ukrainian front line.  Batches of the Korean ammunition have to be proofed and separate range tables drawn up, as the performance of the Korean ammunition is inconsistent and inferior to Russia’s own production.  The North Korean shells are also prone to exploding in the breach, if loaded into barrels which are hot from high intensity fire missions.\nRussia is also known to receive shipments of 122mm and 152mm ammunition shells from Iran, albeit in lesser volumes. Iranian exports have tended more towards the supply of drones and missiles. Iran ships weapons through the Caspian ports of Bandar-e Anzali and Amirabad to either Kaspiysk in Dagestan or the Volga-Don trans-shipment port at Olaya. On January 2 this year, Iranian social media images showed Iranian air defense and truck-mounted Fath-360 tactical ballistic missile systems (comparable in capability to the M142 HIMARS) at the dockside at Bandar-e Anzali prior to loading.",

    "input": "The first large vessel designed to transport liquified carbon dioxide (LCO2) was launched in South Korea as the industry for the transport and storage of captured carbon begins to take shape. The vessels are being built for Greece’s Capital Maritime Group which in 2023 announced plans to expand into the developing market.\nThe launch took place at the HD Hyundai Mipo shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea. With a capacity to transport 22,000 cubic meters of liquified carbon dioxide, the vessels have about three times the capacity of the first LCO2 carriers. Norway’s Northern Lights project took delivery at the end of 2024 of two 7,500 cbm LCO2 carriers built in China and which are currently undergoing commissioning. They will operate in connection with the storage project started as a partnership between Equinor, Shell, and TotalEnergies.\nCapital Gas Ship Management Corp. will be managing the four gas carriers being built in South Korea and will place them into the commercial market. The new company will be known as Capital Clean Energy Carriers.\nThe vessels will measure approximately 525 feet (159.9 meters) in length with a beam of approximately 90 feet (27.4 meters). The vessels are equipped with three “Bi-lobe type storage tanks” that can maintain a low-temperature environment of around -55 degrees Celsius. According to Hyundai, this allows it to stably transport various liquefied gas cargoes such as LCO2, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and ammonia (NH3).\nThe design also enhances the vessels’ environmental performance. They are fitted with Selective Catalytic Reduction systems to reduce Nox emissions. They can use shore power and have ice-resistant design technology (Ice Class 1C) which will improve navigation stability. Capital also reported in 2024 that it was exploring adding onboard carbon capture systems to the vessels.\nTheconstruction orderwas originally placed in 2023 for two vessels and later increased to four gas carriers. HD Hyundai reports the vessel will complete outfitting and trials for delivery at the end of this year. The others are set for delivery in 20026.\nThe companies cite data from Clarson Research to illustrate the potential market for LCO2 transport. The analysts have written to achieve carbon neutrality, more than six gigatons of carbon will need to be captured and stored annually by 2050. They estimate that 20 percent will need to be transported by sea for storage or reuse. It is estimated that 2,500 LCO2 carriers will be required to meet future demand.",

    "input": "Authorities are investigating an incident that took place late on April 15 between an unidentified bulker and “multiple small craft” in the Gulf of Aden. The vessel reportedly was able to evade the small boats, but there are reports of shots fired before the small crafts left the vicinity.\nIt is unclear if the incident was pirates, the Houthis, the so-called Yemen Coast Guard, or others. The UK Maritime Trade Operation issued a warning about the incident which was the first since 2024. The Houthis in January suspended their attacks linked to the Gaza ceasefire but had recently warned they would resume attacks on ships linked to Israel. They have not commented on yesterday’s incident.\nUKMTO reports the vessel was 100 nautical miles east of Aden, Yemen. The multiple small crafts followed the bulker for approximately two hours. The master reportedly altered course towards the Yemeni coast.\nThe report says that shorts were fired but security analysts Neptune P2P Group notes it is unclear if the shots came from the small craft. They note the shots could have been from security guards aboard the merchant ship.\nWhile the incident could have been piracy, the analysts at Neptune note it is unusual for the pirates to operate with multiple crafts or as far east in the Gulf of Aden as this incident. They note it could have been the Yemen Coast Guard due to the vessel’s proximity to the coast or possibly fishermen. They note that local fishermen are known to carry guns to protect their equipment and fishing catch.\nNeptune reports that over 20 fishing vessels as well as four commercial ships have been hijacked since Somali pirates retuned their attacks on ships in November 2023. While two fishing vessels were robbed earlier this year and a third taken hostage in late 2024, the attacks on commercial vessels stopped earlier last year after the Indian Navy and others intervened to rescue vessels that had been boarded by pirates.\nThe ICC International Maritime Bureau in its quarterly report yesterday, April 15, noted the recent attacks demonstrate the continued capabilities of Somali pirates. Recognizing this, the EU also extended its efforts in the region for two more years till early 2027.\nUKMTO is advising vessels to use caution and report incidents while the authorities investigate to determine if it was pirates or other crafts attempting to approach the merchant ship.",

    "input": "A day after Iran’s Foreign Ministry confirmed that indirect talks are underway with the United States, the Treasury Department moved to further increase the pressure targeting a Chinese customer of Iran’s oil and more tankers involved in the trade. It was the second time the U.S. has targeted a private, so-called “teapot refinery” in China.\nSince declaring a campaign of “maximum economic pressure” on Iran, the Trump administration has now enacted six rounds of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales. A month ago, the first private refinery in China wassanctionedalong with a terminal operator.\nToday’s action added a second Shandong Provence-based refinery, Shandong Shengxing Chemical Company, to the sanctions. OFAC reports the refinery has received “dozens of shipments of Iranian crude oil worth more than a billion dollars.” According to the statement, between March 2020 and January 2023, Shandong Shengxing sent more than $800 million in wire transfers to China Oil and Petroleum Company Limited (COPC), an IRGC-QF front company that aided in selling Iranian oil to China. COPC the U.S. says laundered billions of dollars through the U.S. financial system in support of the IRGC-QF, $108 million of which was seized by the U.S. Justice Department.\n“Any refinery, company, or broker that chooses to purchase Iranian oil or facilitate Iran’s oil trade places itself at serious risk,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.  “The United States is committed to disrupting all actors providing support to Iran’s oil supply chain, which the regime uses to support its terrorist proxies and partners.”\nThe action is also adding five tankers to the sanctions, including one flagged in Cameroon (Reston– 115,482 dwt) and four flagged in Panama (Bestla-306,206 dwt; Egret – 299,868 dwt;Nyantara– 113,033 dwt; andRani– 107,123 dwt). According to the U.S., the vessels have been involved in ship-to-ship transfers with sanctioned tankers and shipped billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil, including to Chinese refineries. The U.S. also listed the associated shipping companies in Panama, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, and Hong Kong associated with these tankers.\nThe Islamic Republic News Agency yesterday reported that the Iranian Foreign Ministry expected a “second round of indirect talks with the United States” to take place in Oman on Saturday, April 19. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote on X that a first round of talks had already been executed.\nThe Trump administration says it will continue to pressure Iran into a new agreement. It has also increased the attacks on the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen all as part of the pressure campaign. However, it also confirmed that U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff spoke directly with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The White House termed the first discussions as \"very positive” and “constructive.\"\n",

    "input": "\nSaronic, a start-up launched in 2022 to focus on autonomous vessels for defense systems, acquired Gulf Craft, a Louisiana-based shipbuilder, to accelerate its growth into autonomous shipbuilding. The company says it gives it an immediate capability in shipbuilding as it also unveiled its concepts for a next-generation 150-foot vessel named the Marauder.\nGulf Craft located in Franklin, Louisiana is a custom builder of aluminum boats. Established in 1965, the company builds ferries, offshore support, and other commercial vessels.\n\"Today marks a significant milestone in Saronic's expansion into autonomous shipbuilding and lays the foundation for our vision of our larger, next-generation shipyard, Port Alpha,\" said Saronic CEO Dino Mavrookas. \"While we actively search for a home for Port Alpha, this acquisition gives us the immediate capacity to meet urgent customer needs for larger autonomous vessels and the flexibility to scale to address emerging commercial and defense applications of these advanced systems.\"\nSaronic announced in February 2025 that it had completed its next round of funding raising $600 million in its Series C round. Having invested in developing and expanding its manufacturing capabilities for its small ASVs over the past two years, the company outlined its vision for a new shipbuilding base that it calls Port Alpha. It said the new shipyard would be capable of delivering new classes of autonomous ships at the speed and scale needed to protect and defend the maritime domain.\nThe company reports the acquisition of Gulf Craft provides a strategically located shipyard on the Gulf Coast that will serve as the prototyping and production hub for its medium unmanned surface vessel (MUSV) fleet. The yard provides the infrastructure and skilled workforce it says will be needed to develop, rapidly iterate, and scale the production of Saronic's MUSVs today and into the future. Saronic has retained Gulf Craft's workforce and expects to create more than 500 new jobs over the next 3-4 years. In addition to bringing on skilled shipbuilders, welders, and electricians, Saronic anticipates creating new roles for engineers, technologists, and naval architects to develop and scale production of its MUSVs.\n\n\nGulf Craft builds aluminum commercial vessels at its shipyard in Louisiana (Gulf Craft)\n\nThe acquisition adds nearly 100 acres to Saronic's footprint, supporting both immediate MUSV development and production as well as capacity for significant expansion. Saronic plans to invest more than $250 million directly into the shipyard, which will encompass large facility upgrades that will enable it to apply a first-principles approach to shipbuilding. This includes modernizing infrastructure, acquiring new machinery, and updating the facilities while focusing on building a production system engineered for speed, scalability, and quality. These upgrades will support a rapid capacity ramp-up, enabling Saronic to deliver up to 50 unmanned ships per year.\nThe company also unveiled Marauder, a 150-foot Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV) designed to support a wide range of missions for the U.S., its allies, and commercial customers. With a payload capacity of 40 metric tons, the autonomous ship is designed to travel up to 3,500 nautical miles or loiter for 30+ days, depending on mission requirements.\n\nMeet the newest member of Saronic’s family of Autonomous Surface Vessels. Bayou-born. Mission-ready. Marauder.At 150-feet, Marauder is a medium unmanned surface vessel (MUSV) that will integrate the same proven autonomy stack used across Saronic’s existing ASVs. This new vessel…pic.twitter.com/A51DKOSl2t\n\nMarauder is designed to be fully unmanned and will integrate the autonomy stack used across Saronic's existing family of ASVs. The vessel incorporates Saronic's vertically integrated approach, disciplined engineering philosophy, and strong domestic supplier network.\nAs part of its long-term vision, Saronic says it intends to invest over $2.5 billion to develop Port Alpha, which it calls the world's most advanced shipyard, designed to produce hundreds of unmanned vessels annually. It looks to align its operations with the national efforts to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base and capitalize on the U.S. Navy’s growing interest in future autonomous systems.",

    "input": "In the face of global uncertainties and the potential impact on shipping from the trade war unleashed by Donald Trump, shipowners and the seafarers’ unions agreed to a better than six percent increase in monthly wages over the next three years. It comes after key agreements last week adding a designation as key workers and strengthening repatriation and shore leave for seafarers.\nDirector of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Sectoral Policies Department Frank Hagemann highlighted that the agreement came about as part of a “wholly unique global collective bargaining forum.” It was noted that maritime transport is the only industry with a formally recognized global minimum wage. Dating back to 1958, the agreement sets every three years the global minimum wage for seafarers.\nThe International Labour Organization led with meeting in Geneva on April 14 and 15 with the Subcommittee on Wages of Seafarers of the Joint Maritime Commission (JMC). Shipowners and seafarers’ unions from around the world, coordinated by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), meet to discuss the issues and negotiate the elements of the Maritime Labour Convention and wage agreement.\nThe wage portion of the talks highlighted the escalation in global trade tensions reports the International Chamber of Shipping. It said both sides expressed concern about the “current cloud of uncertainty” and prospects of a potential full-scale trade war. They recognized that the world’s nearly two million seafarers would be caught in the middle and impacted by a slowing in global trade. This comes after a period of high global inflation during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe terms of the wage agreement adopted yesterday call for a total 6.2 increase in the monthly minimum wage for seafarers between January 1, 2026, and January 1, 2028 (an increase from $673 a month as of January 1, 2025, to $715 per month as of January 1, 20208). Seafarers will receive a 2.5 percent increase in the first year followed by 2 percent and 1.6 percent in the following years.\n“This agreement strikes a careful and considered balance between recognizing the vital contribution of seafarers and maintaining the commercial sustainability of the global shipping industry,” said Pål Tangen of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and spokesperson for the shipowners’ group during the meeting. “These are not ordinary times, and this resolution reflects our respect for their service while ensuring that shipowners can continue to operate in a highly competitive and volatile global market.”\nDuring themeetings on the MLC, master contract for global seafarers, the discussions focused on the hardships encountered during the pandemic. The designation as key workers, seafarer repatriation, and visa-free shore leave were key elements. They also enhanced protections against bullying and harassment and added a new recommendation to provide reference materials on medical care for seafarers. These will go into effect by December 2027.\n“Last week we made an important breakthrough with recognition of seafarers’ key worker status in the Maritime Labour Convention. This week we have taken a further step to improve their welfare through pay rises that both retain and increase the value of the ILO AB minimum wage, taking into account increases in the cost of living since 2022,” said Mark Dickinson of Nautilus International and spokesperson for the seafarers group.\nBoth the wage increase and the revisions to the MLC require approval by elements of the ILO. The contract terms will be presented at the 113th session of the ILO’s International Labour Conference in June. The wage increase will be submitted for approval at the ILO’s Governing Body in November.  The next meeting of the Special Tripartite Committee on the MLC is set to take place in April 2028.",

The project combines the technology of STAX Engineering, a pioneer in maritime emissions capture and control based in California, and Seabound, a UK-headquartered leader in onboard carbon capture, offering what the companies call a comprehensive, cost-effective solution for the maritime industry.\nTrails on the solution began in March 2025 and the companies report they conducted three iterations, including with Wallenius Wilhelmsen and NYK Line. The latest demonstration took place in Long Beach, yesterday, April 16, serving a RoRo vehicle carrier operated by Wallenius Wilhelmsen. The companies said the end-to-end modular solution has now cleared its final trial.\nThe combined system integrates STAX’s mobile emissions control unit—which removes 99 percent of particulate matter and 95 percent of Nox from the vessel’s exhaust—with Seabound’s carbon capture technology. Connecting directly to a vessel's exhaust pipe, STAX technology first removes criteria pollutants, turning the exhaust into purified gas. The gas is then directed through Seabound’s capture unit, isolating and storing up to 95 percent of carbon and 90 percent of sulfur before releasing the cleaned exhaust. The companies report that all results were independently verified by Yorke Engineering, an environmental consultancy.\n“Our partnership demonstrates that effective, scalable emissions solutions are a reality that we can implement now,” said Alisha Fredriksson, co-founder and CEO of Seabound.\nSince its launch in early 2024, STAX has established itself as the only emissions solution servicing all major vessel classes in California. To date, STAX reports it has provided a critical pathway to CARB (California Air Resources Board) compliance in five major ports, and captured more than 126 tons of pollutants. CARB is expanding its in-port emissions regulations to cover all classes of merchant ships.\nSTAX positions a barge alongside the vessel which places a cap on the funnel tocapture emissions. The company reports it will deploy its eighth barge this month. STAX also recently announced $70 million in funding to fuel fleetwide carbon capture integration and international expansion this year.\nFounded in late 2021, Seabound has demonstrated its onboard carbon capture technology. Seaboundrecently installed its systemfor onboard carbon capture system together with Lomar Shipping and Hapag Lloyd, successfully capturing CO2 at approximately 80 percent efficiency onboard a 3200 TEU container vessel. Seabound will be launching its first full-scale commercial carbon capture systems this year.\n“Today marks a landmark moment in our journey toward a zero-emissions future, and it’s just the beginning of a global maritime emissions' solution,” said STAX CEO Mike Walker. “As we expand our carbon capture capabilities across the fleet, our inaugural partnership with Seabound has been instrumental, and we look forward to partnering again with ABP in the Port of Southampton.”\nSTAX and Seabound report they will continue their partnership in the UK's Port of Southampton. In March 2025, ABP accepted STAX and Seabound into its Energy Ventures Accelerator, a program designed to explore clean energy hardware startups to clean up ABP’s ports nationwide as it works toward Net Zero by 2040.",

While the ban will have little practical impact, it is the latest demonstration of the frustration of the Trump team to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n“The policies and actions of the Government of the Russian Federation continue to constitute a national emergency by reason of a disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations of the United States,” says the Executive Order signed by Trump on April 15. It was published today in the Federal Register.\nThe U.S. followed the lead of its European allies and Canadalaunching the bantwo months after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. It was seen at the time as a symbolic step demonstrating the U.S. commitment to penalize the Russian economy. However, it was highlighted that only approximately 1,800 Russian vessels had made port calls in the U.S. in 2021 and the Biden administration had already taken other steps to limit imports and trade with Russia.\nTrump has alternately threatened to take further steps against Russia and swung to blaming Ukraine for the war. He promised during the election to immediately end the war but has not been able to complete the proposed ceasefire. He has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and both sides have said an in-person meeting is being planned.\nRussia wants the U.S. to roll back sanctions and restrictions such as the vessel ban and the sale of oil. Trump has shown a willingness while the U.S. State Department has said there will be no agreements with Russia or lifting of the sanctions until a ceasefire in the war with Ukraine is achieved.\nThe order signed by Trump this week says the U.S. is “continuing for one year the national emergency with respect to the Russian Federation and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of Russian-affiliated vessels to United States ports.”\nThis follows an earlier move by Trump last week to extend the national emergency status concerning the “harmful foreign activities of the Russian government.”",

    "input": "The crew aboard an offshore support vessel has taken to social media with the aid of the International Transport Workers’ Federation to highlight their plight. It comes after the union groups called 2024 the “worst year on record for seafarer abandonment.”\nThe ITF posted on its social media channels a video of the 15 Indian crewmembers aboard the vessel which has remained in Indonesia since October 2024. They are holding handwritten signs saying they do not have proper food and the ship’s managers have threatened them when they ask for their back pay. They are appealing for the help of the Indian seafarer unions and the flag state of the vessel for help. The crewmembers want their pay and reparation back to India.\nAccording to the ITF, the vessel namedStar Apollo(1,500 gross tons) has been in the Batamec Shipyard in Indonesia since last year. There are 15 people, all Indian nationals, aboard who report they have not been paid since their contracts began between four and eight months ago. The ITF says it is trying to aid in the recovery of nearly $80,000 in unpaid wages.\nThe vessel, built in 2012, was sold in 2025 to Mumbai-based Vindhyawashini Offshore, according to the Equasis database. The ship is registered in St. Kitts & Nevis.\n\n\n\n“The crew are extremely frustrated, and the stress of not being paid is taking a toll on their health,” writes ITF Global Inspectorate Coordinator Steve Trownsdale on his social media account.\nThe ITF issued a warning in January that the abandonment of seafarers is “spiraling out of control.” It said abandonment of seafarers skyrocketed 87 percent (3,3133 seafarers compared to 1,676) in 2024 vs 2023. Vessel abandonment they reported was up a staggering 136 percent to 312 vessels in 2024.\nAbandoned seafarers the ITF warned can experience months of unpaid wages, extremely poor on-board conditions, inadequate food and clean drinking water, and long periods of work without proper rest. In some cases, they are left completely stranded for months – even years – on end.\nUnder maritime regulations and the Maritime Labour Convention overseen by the International Labour Organization, flag states are obliged to step in when seafarers are abandoned. It calls for the states to arrange the transport home of seafarers, but many are reluctant to leave the ship until they settle their wages.\nThe lack of enforcement and responsiveness from flag and port states, the lack of insurance for vessels, and shipowners refusing to accept that they are mistreating their crew are common factors the ITF said that contribute to abandonment and complicate the resolution of cases.",

The area has been closed to fishing ever since the national monument was expanded by former President Barack Obama in 2014.\n\"The economic zone . . . is huge and it's exclusively ours. So why wouldn't we have our fishermen fish there?\" said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick at a signing ceremony. \"Every country in the world, they all fish the 200 miles off the coast, and we were stopping our own fishermen.\"\nGoing forward, fishing permits and catch limits in the area will be regulated by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council and  NOAA Fisheries under U.S. law. Foreign vessels will be excluded, except for foreign-flag fishing tenders (with appropriate permits.) The extent of any agency resources for enforcement in this far-flung region is unknown: NOAA Fisheries is being downsized by the administration, and may soon be folded into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, according to leaked plans from the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe PIHMNM covers nearly half of the U.S. EEZ in the Pacific Islands. American Samoa is highly dependent on tuna for jobs and economic growth, and the administration says that withdrawing access to such a large swath of the fishing grounds in the U.S. EEZ was detrimental to Samoa's commercial fishermen.\n\"I find that a prohibition on commercial fishing is not, at this time, necessary for the proper care and management of the [PIHMNM] or the objects of historic or scientific interest therein,\" the president wrote in the order.",

If carried out, the strike would further slow progress on the Columbia-class nuclear ballistic missile submarine, a multibillion-dollar program that is already behind schedule and over budget.\nUAW Marine Draftsmens' Association Local 571 represents the 2,500 workers who draw up schematics and plans for sub construction at GD Electric Boat, one of the two firms in the United States that can build nuclear-powered submarines. Electric Boat holds contracts for the Columbia-class and the next generation of the Virginia-class attack sub, two of the Navy's highest-priority programs. Columbia is needed to replace the aging Ohio-class as the platform for the nation's at-sea nuclear deterrent, the most survivable second-strike option in the arsenal. The UAW MDA's members did the detail design for Columbia, and they produce the plans for construction.\nGD Electric Boat emphasizes that \"our nation needs submarines now more than any time in our history,\" and says that it has already made its best and final offer to the union. This includes a pay raise of 23 percent and certain retirement package improvements.\nThe union, however, says that the wage increase doesn't go far enough to offset recent inflation, and that a proposed hike in employees' insurance premiums would further erode the gains in the package. Meanwhile, the union says that Electric Boat has kept profits totaling $13 billion over 2022-2024 - more than the price of one Columbia-class hull.\n\"This company has a simple choice. They can get back to the table and get serious about the demands, or they can keep messing around,\" said UAW President Shawn Fain in an address to 1,200 Local 571 members on Monday.\nAt the meeting, rank and file union members voted to authorize a strike, and approved the motion by a margin of about two-thirds. The union leadership will keep working on negotiations with GD Electric Boat, but now has the power to start industrial action if the talks do not produce results.\nOn the same day as the meeting, Electric Boat filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that the union is refusing to bargain or is bargaining in bad faith.",

Houthi media outlets have reported that more than two dozen people were killed in the blasts. In a statement, the Houthi leadership accused the U.S. of \"direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people\"  and called the port \"a vital civilian facility.\" Central Command did not discuss casualty numbers, but emphasized that the goal of the strike was not to harm Yemeni civilians.\n#BREAKING: U.S. military destroys Yemen’s Ras Isa fuel port, targeting Iran-backed Houthis’ economic lifeline.

    "input": "After a 13-month investigation and complaints filed by five U.S. trade unions, the U.S. Trade Representative released its proposal calling for escalating tariffs on Chinese-built ships and the companies that operate them designed to address the perceived unfair Chinese trade practices. While the fees arenot as largeas the proposal in February 2025, they are broader targeting both LNG exports and vehicle carriers. The effort is tied to President Donald Trump’s call to rebuild the American shipbuilding industry.\nIn light of the information obtained during the investigation and taking into account public comments, the U.S. Trade Representative determined that China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance is unreasonable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce and is therefore actionable. Specifically, USTR found China’s targeting for dominance unreasonable because it displaces foreign firms, deprives market-oriented businesses and their workers of commercial opportunities, and lessens competition and creates dependencies on China, increasing risk and reducing supply chain resilience. China’s targeting for dominance is also unreasonable because of Beijing’s extraordinary control over its economic actors and these sectors.\nUSTR asserts that China’s targeting for dominance burdens or restricts U.S. commerce by undercutting business opportunities for and investments in the U.S. maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors; restricting competition and choice; creating economic security risks from dependence and vulnerabilities in sectors critical to the functioning of the U.S. economy; and undermining supply chain resilience.\nWhile it focuses on Chinese vessel operators and vessel owners, Chinese-built vessels, the industry was surprised by the inclusion of all foreign vehicle carriers (PCTCs) and the transport of LNG. The structure does offer some exemptions for vessels in the MARAD programs, engaged in short sea shipping, arriving empty at U.S. ports and below a certain size or capacity threshold. It also includes fees on container cranes, containers, and chassis made in China.\nThe proposal sets the fees for Chinese-built vessels based on the net tonnage of the vessel and a phased-in schedule. The fee would be charged up to five times per year, per vessel. The first fee effective October 14, 2025, would be $50 per net ton and step up six months later to $80. Annual increases would move to $110 and $140 per net ton in 2028.\nFor vessel operators of Chinese-built vessels, the fee starts at $18 per net ton in October 2025, moving six months later to $23 per net ton. The annual step-ups would be to $28 in 2027 and $33 per net ton in 2028. The alternative for vessel operators is based on per container discharged, starting at $120 for each container in October 2025, and then the step-ups at $153 per container in 2026, $195 in 2027, and finally $250 per container in 2028. The fee can be suspended for up to three years if the owner orders and takes delivery of a U.S.-built vessel of equal or greater net tonnage. Among the other exemptions are for vessels with a capacity of less than 4,000 TEU, specialized vessels, and Lakers.\nVehicle carriers get one of the harshest penalties, and it targets all foreign-built vessels in the sector. The fee is set at $150 per car arriving on the vessels starting in October 2025. Again, there is a possible exemption for operators who order U.S.-built vehicle carriers.\nLNG transport is also targeted with a requirement that one percent is exported on U.S.-built vessels starting in 2028. The percentage steps up every two years so that by 2047 fifteen percent of LNG must be exported on U.S.-built vessels.\nThe language in the proposal offers a much stricter definition of what constitutes a U.S.-built ship versus the current Jones Act definitions used by the U.S. Coast Guard which permits foreign-made elements and components. The language in the USTR schedule requires all major components of the hull or superstructure of the vessel to be manufactured (including all manufacturing processes from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings for iron or steel products) in the United States. It also specifies key components of the vessel must be built in the United States.\nUSTR which is led by Ambassador Jamieson Greer who was confirmed at the end of February 2025, said these steps are necessary because China controls nearly a fifth of the world’s commercial shipping fleet, allowing them to influence the pricing and availability of ships used to conduct international trade. It cites data from the Center for Strategic and International Studies that shows the U.S.only accounts for 0.1 percent of global shipbuilding while China produces (more than 53 percent) more than the rest of the world combined. Chinese officials have criticized the effort saying the U.S. was blaming its long-term decline on China instead of investing in its shipbuilding industry.\nWhile the industry was still analyzing the42-page outline of the fees, the unions were quick to respond calling the USTR effort “meaningful remedies put forward to reinvigorate domestic shipbuilding.” The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, one of the unions filing the original complaint, said it applauds the United States Trade Representative and vowed to “work to ensure these policies are properly implemented.”\nThe release of the proposal starts a comment period that runs to May 19, and once finalized the proposal calls for the fees to begin after 180 days.",

The vessel is set to set several new marks in size and speed as well as its charging capabilities as the largest of its kind yet built for operations in Norway.\nTheHinnøyis 7,115 gross tons and 117 meters (384 feet) in length. Built by Turkey’s Cemre shipyard for Norwegian ferry operator Torghatten Nord, the RoRo double-ended ferry was designed by Norwegian Ship Design. The companies highlight it will have a record-breaking speed of 14 knots and power systems capable of a one-hour run in the weather and exposed conditions in Norway’s fjords and Arctic waters.\nThe ferry is larger replacing LNG-fueled ferries that have operated on the route between Bognes and Lødingen for the past decade. Torghatten highlights the design is enclosed to handle the relatively weather-hard conditions. Typically, battery ferries that have been placed into service so far are open designs for shorter distance runs.\n\n\n\nThe new vessel has a capacity for 399 passengers and 120 cars. It was classsed by DNV and is registered in Norway. The shipyard lists propulsion as two Schottel 1.8 kW motors supported by a Siemens water-cooled battery system with approximately 4.750 kWh and a Siemens electrical system.\nIt was outfitted with two independent power systems to provide redundancy and ensure it could operate even if one fails. On-shore it will be supported by what may be the largest connections with 9,200 watts for fast charging of the onboard batteries. In case the shore power is unavailable, biodiesel generators will provide sufficient power for normal operation.\nThe order was placed for the ferry in April 2022 and it was launched in November 2023. The delivery trip commenced on April 15 from Yilova, Turkey after the final functional testing and certification.\nThe vessel is seen as a milestone for electric ferries and a key part of meeting Norway’s increasing environmental regulations.\nTorghatten Nord plans to continue its advanced ferry designs having selected Norway's Myklebust Verft to build two ferries which will be the world's largest hydrogen ships. The ferries, which will also be 117 meters in length are designed to carry up to 120 cars on Norway's longest ferry route between Bodø and Lofoten. They are scheduled for delivery in 2026.",

At the same time, the state’s regulators issued a strongly worded condemnation of the order following a vow yesterday for the state’s governor to fight the administration.\nThe company reports that it is suspending offshore work on the project, as ordered, complying with theorder received yesterdayfrom the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). It states the project has a gross book value of around $2.5 billion, including its investment in the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal which would be the construction and operational base.\nIt reports that it has drawn about $1.5 billion from the project finance term loan that was completed in late 2024. Equinor US Holdings has provided guarantees for the equity commitment in the project financing and would have to repair the $1.5 billion to the project finance lenders in a full-stop scenario. The company would also be exposed to termination fees from its supplies.\nBoth the state and Equinor are highlighting the long and rigorous review process the Empire Wind project went through before it received federal and state approvals in 2024. NYSERDA (New York State Research and Development Authority) highlighted that it was the first Trump administration that issued the lease for the project saying they are now showing “a complete disregard” for a project that is New York’s largest energy infrastructure project in 50 years and follows Trump’s prioritization of independence and locally produced energy.\n“The federal government’s interference not only ignores the reality surrounding the future energy security of our state and country, it’s fueled by a shortsighted, political agenda that ignores the well-demonstrated economic benefits that this industry can provide as the state and nation work to ensure an affordable, reliable and abundant energy supply for future generations,” said Doreen M. Harris, President and CEO, NYSERDA. “The irrefutable harm created by this action will send a chilling signal to any party investing in the U.S. market, all of whom rely on regulatory certainty.”\nYesterday, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum asserted that had information that “raises serious issues” with the project’s approvals. He asserted the Biden administration rushed the approvals “without sufficient analysis or consultation among relevant agencies.” Burgum directed BOEM to order Empire Wind to cease all construction activities until a further review is completed to “address these serious deficiencies.”\nWhile saying it will safely halt the offshore construction, Empire also said it is, “engaging with relevant authorities to clarify this matter and is considering its legal remedies, including appealing the order.”\nThe company highlights it has more than 35 years of history in the U.S. It says it has invested more than $60 billion in the U.S. to date, including in oil, gas, and renewables.\nSeveral companies including Shell and BP have already pulled back from the U.S. offshore wind sector while analysts were left to speculate on the broader implications of the stop work order against Empire Wind. Burgun in his memorandum said the review is ongoing of federal wind permitting practices with respect to “both existing and pending permits.”Two projects, Vineyard Wind and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind as well underway with offshore construction. Vineyard was delayed by a blade failure and subsequent inspection program while Dominion paused some offshore work during the winter and is due to resume this spring. Orsted also has two projects, Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, which have started onshore cabling and other work. In total, the Biden administration approved 11 offshore projects with one completed in 2024. Other projects remain in review at the federal and state levels.",

    "input": "\nU.S. officials are asserting that Chinese companies are providing support to the Houthi militants in Yemen with their attacks on Western shipping. The Financial Times is quoting a senior U.S. State Department official who says the Houthis have been receiving Chinese satellite data in addition to support from Iran for the attacks that started in late 2023 and targeted more than 100 merchant ships.\nIt was previously well understood that the Houthis were receiving targeting data for their missile and drone attacks on Israel and shipping in the Red Sea from both Russia and Iran, with IRGC Qods Force operatives based in Yemen acting as the conduit. The Iranian Khayyam satellite was jointly built with Russia, based on Kanopus-V imagery satellite, with the Iranian satellite likely to be operating within Russia’s own Kanopus-V constellation. The Iranians and Russians are likely to share most of the output of this combined constellation. Supplementing the satellite imagery data, the Iranians would have added in their own intelligence feeds from IRGC spy ships and regular Iranian Navy ships operating in the area, prior to these vessels being withdrawn from the area several months ago.\nA senior State Department official in Washingtonbriefed the Financial Timesthat the Chinese company Chang Guang Satellite Technology, a commercial entity owned by or with close links to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, has also been feeding targeting data to the Houthis. Chang Guang Satellite is reported to have had 100 mini-satellites in orbit in 2024, a figure which was planned to rise to 300 by the end of 2025. With such a constellation, a 10-minute refresh time would be feasible for any point in the target area.\nThe Financial Times report was unclear whether raw imagery was being passed to the Houthis, or whether processed information was shared either as intelligence or in the form of targeting packs. Chinese military standard communications equipment that would enable such transmission has regularly been seized in the same consignments of arms and ammunition dispatched by the IRGC Qods Force to the Houthis but intercepted at sea by Coalition naval forces. With the reported withdrawal of IRGC Qods Force embeds in the Houthi command and control structure, in the face of targeted US attacks, there will be even greater emphasis on building data links to support the Houthis remotely as the American attacks continue, destroying and degrading the Houthis’ existing communications networks.\n\n\nOn January 28, US Coast Guard Cutter U.S. Coast Guard cutter USCGC Clarence Sutphin Jr (WPC 1147) seized a consignment en route to the Houthis which included Chinese military-grade communication and network equipment (CENTCOM)\n\nThe unnamed senior State Department official briefing the Financial Times was supported by Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokeswoman, who was quoted on the record as confirming that Chang Guang Satellite Technology was “directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on US interests”. The feed of information from the State Department as opposed to the Defense Department suggests that the Chinese behavior is being considered as a factor in broader discussions with China on matters of tariff and trade.\nSurveillance carried out by the Chinese satellites may also enable the Chinese to warn off the Houthis from attacking Chinese ships as they transit the area. Chinese vessels are still regularly using the Gulf of Aden to Suez Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor, giving them a simple commercial advantage over shipping lines obliged by Houthi attacks to take the long way between Asia and Europe around the Cape of Good Hope.",

    "input": "\nThe Coast Guard has initiated the final of five planned phases of the service life extension program (SLEP) for Coast Guard CutterPolar Star, the service’s sole operational heavy icebreaker.Polar Stararrived at Mare Island Dry Dock in Vallejo, California, on March 30 to begin the remaining SLEP activities. The work is part of the In-Service Vessel Sustainment (ISVS) Program.\nThe SLEP is recapitalizing a number of major systems to extend the service life of the cutter and maintain polar ice-breaking capability until the polar security cutter fleet is operational. ThePolar StarSLEP was designed to address targeted systems such as propulsion, communication, and machinery control systems for recapitalization. The USCG is undertaking the major maintenance program to extend the service life ofPolar Starbeyond its original design of 30 years.\nCommissioned in 1976,Polar Staris the United States’ only heavy icebreaker capable of providing access to both polar regions. The Seattle-based cutter is 399 feet in length and 13,500 tons. The cutter's six diesel and three gas turbine engines produce up to 75,000 horsepower.\nThe life extension program began in 2021 in intervals timed between the vessel’s annual deployment to Antarctica. The current installment is the fifth and final phase planned in the program. The next generation polar icebreaker currently running six years behind the original construction schedule, with the shipyard Bollinger recently saying that completion of the first Polar Security Cutter is anticipated by May 2030 meaningPolar Starwill remain active until age 55 or later.\nAmong the work scheduled during this period is a refurbishment in the two remaining zones of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems refurbishments. These zones will be refurbished with ventilation trunks, fans, and heaters to improve air circulation and maintain a comfortable living environment for the ship’s crew during extended deployments. The gyro repeater recapitalization will ensure that these critical pieces of navigation equipment are updated to modern standards, enabling safe navigation of the cutter.  Ancillary pumps and motors are also targeted for recapitalization through the replacement of critical main propulsion and auxiliary systems with modern supportable units.\nIn addition, personnel from the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore will be on site this summer, recapitalizing the sewage pumps and tank level indicators to ensure the crew can successfully monitor and manage sewage capacity while the cutter is executing its missions in ice.\nKenneth King, ISVS program manager, said “This phase represents a significant milestone for bothPolar Starand the ISVS program, as our dedicated professionals ensurePolar Starmeets its multifaceted missions in the polar regions until the arrival of the polar security cutter fleet.”\nLast year’s effort targeted three systems aboard the vessel, including starting the refurbishment/ overhaul of the ventilation trunks, fans, and heaters that supply berthing areas of the ship. All the boiler support systems were also recapitalized/redesigned, including the electrical control station that is used to operate them. A complete recapitalization/redesign of the flooding alarm system also occurred from bow to stern to monitor machinery spaces for flooding.\nIn 2023, the program focused on improvements to shipboard equipment and numerous vital system upgrades for fire detection, communications, and monitoring water quality. Each year they also completed annual maintenance for the vessel.\nPolar Starrecently completed a 128-day deployment to Antarctica in support of Operation Deep Freeze 2025, the annual joint military logistics mission. This year’s deployment markedPolar Star’s 28th voyage to Antarctica in support of the joint military service mission to resupply and maintain the United States Antarctic Stations.",

    "input": "While recognizing the Trump administration softened the financial impact of its port fees on Chinese-built shipping for many carriers, the shipping industry was quick to respond raising serious concerns after the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office released the structure of the fees. Like the Chinese, the shipping industry asserts that the fees will do little to support the resurgence of U.S. shipbuilding while instead penalizing the U.S. economy and consumers.\nThe USTR outlined sweeping fees with the costliest targeted at Chinese carriers and while reducing the dollar amounts would also charge all carriers as Chinese-built ships arrive or offload containers. The surprise came with a fee on each vehicle landed from all foreign-built ships, which the World Shipping Council points out encompasses nearly every vehicle carrier in the world. The shipping industry lobbying group calls the fee on car carriers an “arbitrary action” that will slow U.S. economic growth and raise auto prices while doing little to encourage U.S. maritime investment.\n“We urge the U.S. to respect facts and multilateral rules and immediately stop its wrong practices,” said Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He said China believes the fees will “disrupt the stability of the global supply chain, and increase inflationary pressure in the U.S., but “ultimately fail to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry.” China highlights the decline of the U.S. shipbuilding industry began in the 1970s.\nTrump administration officials were quick to defend the president’s policy and tout the benefits. In anop-edin the Washington Examiner, Transportation Secretary Sean Duff writes, “The inauguration of a new Trump-era in maritime dominance is a fundamental feature of the golden age of transportation.”\nThe World Shipping Council while saving it supports the efforts to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding sector, says “the fee regime announced by USTR is a step in the wrong direction as it will raise prices for consumers, weaken U.S. trade, and do little to revitalize the U.S. maritime industry.”\nJoe Kramek, President and CEO of the World Shipping Council, points to serious problems with the structure saying the “backward-looking penalties” would disrupt investment, and risk harming American exporters. Basing the fees on net tonnage, the WSC contends “disproportionately penalizes larger, more efficient vessels that deliver essential goods, including components used in U.S. production lines.”\nThe WSC also flags “significant legal concerns,” noting that the proposed fees appear to extend beyond the authority granted under U.S. trade law.\n“The WSC is urging the administration to reconsider this counterproductive measure, which risks harming U.S. consumers, manufacturers, and farmers without delivering meaningful progress toward revitalizing the U.S. maritime industry,” the group writes in its statement. It instead calls for steps such as targeted investment incentives, infrastructure improvements, and streamlined regulatory processes to strengthen the U.S. maritime sector.\nChina has launched a public relations effort against the U.S. tariffs and highlights that it is taking the lead in lobbying other countries to resist Trump’s tariffs. Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned of unilateral bullying and protectionism in a speech delivered on Thursday hours before the port tariff regime was unveiled. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Vietnam and Cambodia urging opposing unilateral bullying.\nNext week, China is planning Reuters reports informal discussions at the UN Security Council. Reuters says China will accuse the U.S. of bullying.",

A week ago, the USCGpublisheda Request for Information for what were termed small icebreakers (370 feet in length) seeking shipyards that could deliver within three years of a contract award.\nFinnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomatbroke the newson Friday, April 18, saying it had confirmed the negotiations with three unnamed sources. Yle News has alsopicked up the storyciting discussions in March between Finnish President Alexander Stubb and President Donald Trump. The newspaper reports just over a week ago Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen discussed the matter with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nAccording to the report, the Rauma shipyard would build up to five medium-sized icebreakers, with the order valued at around €2.5 billion ($2.85 million). Helsingin Sanomat says that exploratory discussions are also underway regarding three larger vessels.\nRauma, located in southwest Finland on the Gulf of Bothnia, highlights on its website that three multi-purpose icebreakers were constructed in Rauma between 1993 and 1998 at the former Aker Finnyards and have been serviced at Rauma Marine. The yard also has experience with ice-strengthened hulls including for the ferryAurora Botniabuilt in 2021.\nThe yard has been building ferries, including for Tasmania, and recently completed the hull for the first of four multi-role corvettes for the Finnish Navy. The first vessel is due to launch this spring and the second has started construction with the yard highlighted the vessels will be able to “operate in icy conditions.” The yard built a new enclosed construction hall for this project and has been positioning itself for expected orders to replace existing icebreakers in Scandinavia.\nRMC, which was founded in 2014, is entirely Finnish-owned. It reports it currently has orders till 2028 valued at over one billion euros ($1.14 billion) as of October 2024.\nYle cautions in its report that the negotiations do not guarantee a deal. It says the U.S. Coast Guard has approached several shipyards around the world to assess their capacity to deliver icebreakers within 36 months. However, it also quotes Foreign Minister Valtonen who said after meeting Rubio, \"We will likely have concrete news fairly soon.\"\nA deal would be in keeping with the 2024 agreement between the United States, Canada, and Finland tojointly develop icebreakers. Canadian shipbuilder Davie was reported to be a driving force behind the agreement. Davie in 2023 acquired Helsinki Shipyard, which it was highlighted has built more than 50 percent of the global icebreakers. The Helsinki Shipyard was scheduled to build a new icebreaker for Russia, but the deal was blocked after the start of the war in Ukraine and that contributed to the financial collapse of the yard.",

While testing is still ongoing, the Canadian Coast Guard told the local media that it is almost certain the oil came from the vessel but they do not believe there is a consistent leak from the fuel tanks.\nThe first of the tar balls, which alternately are being described as the size of a tennis or golf ball, was found during a routine search on April 11 of the nearby beach, and two more were found the following day. Media reports indicate a total of six or seven of the tar balls have now been recovered and they were sent to a lab for testing.

The salvage effort had previously reported multiple cracks in the hull and water in the engine room and holds of the containership. The Coast Guard also says that no oil has been seen in the water or elsewhere in the bay so far.\n\n\nTar balls are being analyzed, but the Coast Guard thinks they are fuel washed from the ship during heavy weather\n\nA subsequent survey of the vessel has lowered the estimate to approximately 1600 metric tons of heavy fuel and marine gas oil aboard theMSC Baltic III. The salvage company hired by the owners placed frac tanks on the deck of the vessel and in late March began an effort to pump the fuel from the vessel. However, it is a slow process due to the time required to heat and pump the fuel.\nThe current process calls for pumping the fuel into the temporary tanks on deck and when they are full they will be pumped into tanks on a barge alongside. Once filled, the tanks are too heavy to lift onto the barge. The Coast Guard explains this process is being used because the weather makes it difficult to keep a barge alongside the ship doe extended periods.\nAs of early April, the Coast Guard reported that 184 cubic meters of fuel had been pumped into the frac tanks. In an interview yesterday, April 17, with the local newspaper The Telegram, the Coast Guard said no fuel has been transferred off the vessel so far. The process continues to move slowly due to weather conditions in the area.\nInitial salvage efforts in March removed from the vessel eight containers loaded with polymeric beads, which are considered dangerous goods. There were approximately 470 containers aboard when the vessel stranded on February 15. However, MSC reported approximately half were empties. The damage to the hull of the vessel makes it impossible at this time to consider refloating the ship.\nThe Canadian Coast Guard highlights that the country works under a “polluter pays” principle. The Coast Guard is overseeing the salvage effort which is being conducted by T&T Salvage hired by MSC. The vessel’s owners and its insurance will be responsible for all the costs of the salvage operation.",

    "input": "The diplomatic dispute brewing between Algeria and France has impacted a potential investment by the CMA CGM in the Algerian port sector. The French ship[ping company was reported to be negotiating a concession for the port of Oran through its subsidiary CMA Terminals, but the deal has been on hold as tensions rise between the two countries.\nEarly this week, the CEO of CMA CGM Rodolphe Saadé was scheduled to visit Algeria for a business trip. However, the visit was reportedly postponed as relations between Algeria and France further deteriorated this week. According to local media reports, Rodolphe Saadé was to be received by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune to finalize a port investment deal, which has been under negotiations for nearly a year.\nThe diplomatic incident emerged as Algeria protested after one of its consular staff was arrested in France. The indictment of the official was over suspicion of involvement in the kidnapping of an Algerian government critic in Paris in April 2024. This has seen the two countries expel diplomats from both sides in a tit-for-tat move.\nThe diplomatic dispute also appears to have taken an economic dimension. The Algerian Economic Renewal Council (CREA), the country’s largest business organization, canceled its planned visit to France next month, where it was to hold a meeting with the French employers’ association (MEDEF). CREA accused French authorities of blocking investments in Algeria.\n“The cancellation of the trip follows measures taken by French authorities, who strongly pressured a French maritime transport company to abandon its trip to Algeria to finalize an investment project,” said CREA. With the ongoing tension between Algeria and France, and Saadé’s visit on hold, the negotiations for the port concession are expected to be delayed.\nCMA CGM is already present in nine Algerian ports including Algiers, Annaba, Béjaïa, Skikda, and Ghazaouet. The interest in Oran is because of the port’s strategic location in the Western Mediterranean and its proximity to Europe. CMA CGM is believed to be considering a feeder shipping line between Marseille and Oran, to be operated by its subsidiary, La Méridionale.\n\nTop photo byHabib Kaki--CC BY 3.0",

    "input": "Scotland is largely operating blind in the management of its marine resources according to new research published this week as part of a project designed to create a better understanding of the exposure of whales, dolphins, and seals to coastal shipping. It emerged the researchers report that over half of vessels operating in the country’s coastal waters are “invisible” to standard maritime tracking systems.\nA team of researchers at Scottish Heriot-Watt University carried out a study that waspublished this weekwhich is sounding the alarm that the country is navigating blind in as far as understanding the potential adverse impacts of vessels crisscrossing its coastal waters is concerned. The study asserts that only 43 percent of vessels within a 10-kilometer radius of the Scottish coast broadcast an Automatic Identification System (AIS) signal, the standard global tool to monitor ship movements.\nSmaller vessels, such as fishing boats under 15 meters, recreational craft, and jet skis, accounted for much of the missing data. Though they are not legally required to carry AIS, the vessels have the option of voluntarily installing and broadcasting data.\nConsidering that Scottish coast waters are getting busier, the studypublished in the academic journalMarine Policy contends that lack of visibility poses significant risks to marine life, safety, and sustainable ocean management. This is because governments, conservation bodies, and researchers mainly depend on AIS data to model vessel-related impacts such as underwater noise pollution, whale and dolphin collision risk, anchor damage to the seabed, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate impact. Scotland’s coasts are a vital habitat for species like bottlenose dolphins, minke whales, and orcas.\n“With an improved understanding of the activities and movement of different types of vessels, marine planners and policymakers could tailor regulations to maximize their potential effectiveness,” said Lauren McWhinnie, one of the study’s authors. She adds that the wider maritime sector could further benefit through improved safety and awareness.\nThe study seeks to hold Scottish authorities accountable for assuming that they can rely on AIS to know what is happening in coastal seas. After analyzing over 1,800 hours of land and sea surveys conducted between 2019 and 2024 covering nine of Scotland’s 11 marine regions, the glaring fact is that a majority of vessels operate untracked with over 75 percent of vessel activity going unrecorded in some areas.\nIn the Outer Hebrides region, for instance, only 20 percent of vessels were transmitting AIS data despite the area being a hotspot for ecotourism, fishing, and aquaculture. The Orkney Islands region showed a higher rate, with 58 percent of vessels broadcasting.\nThe researchers are pushing authorities to take proactive actions in ensuring all types of vessels operating in the country’s waters, including smaller vessels, broadcast their position using AIS to effectively balance tourism and other vessel-based activities with local sustainability and environmental objectives.",

Commercial shipping primarily serves the ports of Bristol, Cardiff, Newport, and Swansea through a network of dredged channels, while the imposing Severn Bridge and Second Severn Crossing (now Prince of Wales Bridge) span the upper channel. Despite navigational challenges, the channel remains vital to regional maritime commerce for bulk cargo, automotive imports/exports, and energy infrastructure.",

Located at the mouth of the Brisbane River on reclaimed land at Fisherman Islands, this modern port complex features 29 operating berths including specialized facilities for containers, motor vehicles, general cargo, dry bulk, and wet bulk. A distinctive characteristic is its 90-kilometer shipping channel, which requires ongoing maintenance dredging and includes both riverine and bay sections navigable by vessels up to 300 meters in length with drafts to 14 meters. The port complex encompasses 1,860 hectares with substantial environmental buffer zones, including the Port of Brisbane Wetlands—a 150-hectare constructed habitat supporting significant biodiversity. Strategic road and rail connections link the port to markets throughout Queensland, while commercial developments within the port precinct include Australia's largest multi-user intermodal terminal.",

This sacred waterway supports extensive commercial navigation in its lower reaches, with the stretch between Kolkata and Allahabad designated as National Waterway 1 under India's inland waterway development program. The river's maritime infrastructure includes major ports at Kolkata and Haldia, where vessels up to 40,000 deadweight tonnage can navigate approximately 120 miles inland from the Bay of Bengal. Commercial shipping encounters significant challenges including seasonal water level variations of up to 30 feet between monsoon and dry seasons, sedimentation requiring constant dredging operations, and numerous shallow stretches limiting vessel draft. Despite these constraints, the waterway supports transport of coal, construction materials, fertilizers, and containerized cargo, with night navigation now possible through improved channel marking systems.",
