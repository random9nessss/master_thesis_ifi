        "content": "Efforts to develop the first ammonia value chain have taken another step forward with Japan’s NYK Line and Yara Clean Ammonia concluding the first charter for an ammonia-fueled medium gas carrier. NYK ordered the vessel’s construction in 2023 as the next step in a project initiated in 2021 as part of Japan’s Green Innovation Project Fund of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).\nThe companies believe this is the first commercial contract for a vessel of this type and represents a key step in putting the vessel into service. The project was designed to overcome key hurdles in the launch of ammonia as maritime fuel and to serve as a demonstration contributing to the decarbonization of shipping.\nStarting in 2021, the project was focusing on the key challenges of developing an ammonia-fueled combustion engine. They highlighted the hardly-flammable nature and low energy density of ammonia as well as the challenge that combustion generates about 300 times more N2O emissions, which need to be suppressed. The toxicity of ammonia also requires steps to prevent leakage and safety measures for the crew.\nJapan Engine Corporation and IHI Power System were working on the engine and fuel supply system. The goal was a main engine with an ammonia-fuel mixed combustion rate of up to 95 percent and an auxiliary engine with an ammonia-fuel mixed combustion rate of 80 percent or more. This, they said, would achieve an 80 percent or more reduction in GHG emissions.\nNYK and Nihon Shipyard were also working on the design of the vessel. A medium-sized gas carrier (40,000 cbm capacity) with an overall length of 590 feet (180 meters) was selected. They reported this was the currently most common size for marine transport of ammonia. The hull forms were optimized, and they set a goal of an ammonia-loading capacity equivalent to or more than that of conventional vessels.\nThe project received approval in principle from ClassNK in September 2022. After completing designs and successful tests of engines by Japan Engine and IHI Power Systems, the construction order was signed in December 2023. They said the project was in full swing toward its completion in November 2026. The vessel will be built at the Japan Marine United Corporation yard in Ariake, Japan, with a two-stroke engine produced by Japan Engine Corporation.\nYara Clean Ammonia reports the charter will provide the company with great flexibility to manage carbon emissions and product carbon intensity. The vessel’s entry into service will be a key milestone for the development of ammonia-fueled vessels.\nThe first-ever ammonia bunkering took place in 2024 as demonstrations with NYK putting into service the first ammonia-fueled tugboat. Other engine manufacturers, including MAN Energy Solutions and WinGD, each recently reported key progress in moving to full-power testing and verification of their ammonia-fueled engines. Wind GD predicted it could deliver its first ammonia-fueled engine by mid-year. DNV has forecast the first ammonia-fueled larger vessels might be delivered in 2025, while it expects the segment to expand quickly between 2026 and 2028."

        "content": "The captain of the ill-fated cruise shipCosta Concordiais back in the news 13 years after the loss of the ship which created global headlines. Italian media is reporting that Francesco Schettino, now age 64, has petitioned the courts in Italy for a form of early release from his 16-year prison sentence.\nSchettino was in command of the cruise ship owned by Carnival Corporation’s Costa Cruises. The ship was in service for just six years built by Fincantieri and delivered in 2006. It was 114,500 gross tons with a capacity for 3,780 passengers and 1,100 crew making a week-long cruise in the Western Mediterranean.\nOn January 13, 2012, theConcordialeft Civitavecchia, Italy, but Captain Schettino decided to deviate from the normal course to make a “salute” sailing close to Giglio island. He later blamed faults with the vessel, problems with the crew and misunderstanding of commands, and other issues, while it was alleged he was distracted by other people on the bridge.\nAs they sailed close to the island and the cruise ship sounded its horn, it struck an underwater rock outcropping that fatally ruptured the hull and flooded the electrical controls rendering the ship immediately powerless and drifting. There were 3,200 passengers aboard and over 1,000 crew. A total of 32 people would die as the vessel foundered and during a botched evacuation.\nInfamously Schettino abandoned the bridge with other officers. He later claimed he had fallen from the listing ship or that he had gone to shore to oversee the evacuation. A famous recording surfaced of the Coast Guard screaming and cursing at him, and ordering him back aboard the vessel. The cruise ship capsized, leaving passengers to fend for themselves and climb over the hull and down ladders in a rescue organized by the Coast Guard.\nSchettino was sentenced in February 2015 to 16 years in prison for dereliction of duty, multiple counts of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, and abandoning his passengers. His appeals were exhausted in 2017. He was ordered to surrender at a prison in Rome.\nUnder Italian law, Schettino filed for early release into a state of “semi-liberty” whereby he would be out of prison for the remainder of his sentence. This is available after the prisoner has served at least half their time in jail and has demonstrated good behavior.\nThe Italian media reports there are mixed reactions. The protests are expected to grow in advance of a court hearing. In addition to the 32 who died, many people were injured and carry emotional scars from the disaster. It was the largest cruise ship lost and led to extensive changes in the management of the industry. Costa Cruises paid a fine of more than $1 million in addition to settlements with the families and passengers. Carnival Corporation overhauled the management and training of its officers and in 2016 established a training center in the Netherlands.\nAn Italian court has set a hearing for March 4 to decide if Schettino will win his release from prison."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nIn its latest quarterly report, Japanese industrial conglomerate Mitsubishi revealed that it is taking a $340 million hit in connection with the reduced prospects of its domestic offshore wind portfolio, which it has placed under review.\nMitsubishi Corporation has announced plans to restructure its offshore wind portfolio in Japan, citing disruptions in the macroeconomic environment. It will be reviewing the future of three projects, including the 480 MW Noshiro Mitane Oga project off Akita Prefecture, 820 MW Yurihonjo City Offshore wind farm off Akita Prefecture and the 400 MW Choshi City project off the coast of Chiba Prefecture.\nMitsubishi was selected the operator of these projects in December 2021, when Japan completed its first fixed-bottom wind auction.\n“In the wake of the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis, the business environment for offshore wind power has significantly changed and is continuing to change worldwide due to factors such as inflation, the depreciation of the yen, tight supply chains and rising interest rates. We will consider the appropriate next steps after thoroughly examining the results of our review,” said Mitsubishi.\nAcross major markets, investments in offshore wind continue to face economic pressure, especially in Europe and the U.S. In Japan, there is also a noticeably bearish market sentiment on the profitability of offshore wind projects. In the third wind auction concluded in December, at least 15 companies in the sector, including Mitsubishi Corp. and Cosmo Energy Holdings, did not participate, according to Nikkei. This is despite some of these companies having conducted environmental assessments in readiness for the auction.\nJapan heavily relies on energy imports for its electricity needs and is targeting offshore wind as a stable supply that can be tapped locally. The country’s goal is to install 10 GW by 2030 and 45 GW by 2040.\nMeanwhile, the Japanese government has signaled raising the local content goal for offshore wind farms to 70 percent from the current 60 percent. Reportedly, the expert panel reviewing the local content rules begins meeting this month and is expected to finalize its findings by summer. Some of the issues to be deliberated include the necessary degree of government support to the wind sector.\nThe tightening of the local content rules is meant to reduce reliance on foreign companies, especially in the manufacturing of wind farm core components. Currently, Japan relies on imports of these components from western companies such as Siemens Gamesa and Vestas. Japanese firms are mainly concentrated in offering services like the installation and operation of offshore wind farms."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "A new report looking at what will be needed to spur the transition to e-fuels and the early adoption in the maritime sector concludes that targeted subsidies and a hefty GHG levy are needed to close the gap between scalable zero-emission fuels and other compliance options. The analysis was timed to the International Maritime Organization’s upcoming negotiations ahead of the Maritime Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting this summer to adopt the second phase of the strategy for the decarbonization of the shipping industry.\n“The path the sector is on now requires urgent and drastic correction from both commercial and policy actions to avoid significant risks to the sector and global trade,” warns thereportpresented by the UCL Energy Institute and maritime consultancy UMAS.  “Without maximum efficiency,” the report warns, “the transition will be more expensive, more difficult and disruptive, and more prone to failure and delay.”\nThe research set out to explore how the transition can be stimulated, coordinated, and delivered, not just by the IMO, but also national governments, regional bodies, and industry stakeholders. They analyzed the viability and costs of the IMO’sRevised Strategytargets released after the 2024 MEPC session.\nThe study concludes that the transition from fossil fuels in shipping has much in common with other transitions but that current policies of fuel standards and a flexible financial mechanism, even with a multiplier that boosts credits for e-fuel, are unlikely to start an e-fuel transition before 2040. Further, they warn the industry risks becoming locked into alternatives that could make long-term decarbonization goals more difficult.\n“This new analysis shows that the market will struggle to make an e-fuel business case before 2040, and therefore e-fuels such as green ammonia will not be available for shipping’s use in any volume,” says Dr. Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at the UCL Energy Institute. “Some suggest that the role of a GHG levy is only for addressing equity, this study shows that it is not the only role, it is also a critical enabler of shipping’s energy transition and for minimizing the long-run costs to trade.”\nGHG pricing starting at $30 per tonne of CO2e, the research warns looks unlikely to provide certainty of support to enable the energy transition to start and scale through the 2027-2035 period, and certainly would be unable to additionally support a just and equitable transition. They conclude that GHG pricing starting at $150 per tonne of CO2e, could generate sufficient revenue to support both the energy transition and ensure a just and equitable transition for affected communities.\nUsing the total cost of ownership approach, the study modeled a 14,000 TEU container vessel with different technology and fuel options. They used this to evaluate the effects of policy combinations (including a GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) requirement, flexibility mechanism, and a levy and subsidy/reward mechanism) currently under discussion at the IMO.\nThey believe the early low-cost routes to compliance could become uncompetitive within a decade. The study says that early action is needed to support e-fuels to bridge the gap between e-fuels and low-cost early compliance options such as LNG, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage. They believe that a GHG levy and targeted incentive for e-fuels, such as a subsidy/reward that would be derived from the GHG Levy, is critical to ensure the industry is moving quickly on the correct transition course. The report says that there are political, technical, economic and commercial requirements to deliver on the goals for decarbonization."

        "content": "\nOn Tuesday, following announcements from the U.S. and Israel that put the future of the Gaza ceasefire agreement in doubt, Yemen's Houthi rebels issued a reminder that they could restart ballistic missile attacks if hostilities against Hamas resume.\nOn January 15, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that an agreement for a ceasefire and hostage exchange had been reached with terrorist group Hamas, setting conditions for the end of hostilities in Gaza. This satisfied the demands of Yemen's Houthi rebels, who had been attacking shipping in the Red Sea for more than a year in protest of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip. Houthi leaders pledged to cease strikes on foreign shipping, with the exception of certain Israeli vessels.\nThe Israel-Hamas ceasefire has held so far, and so has the uneasy peace in the Red Sea. But the future of the detente appears tenuous: last week, U.S. President Donald Trump insisted that the U.S. will\"own\" and redevelop Gazainto a \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" requiring two million Palestinians to leave and never return. He demanded that all of Hamas' 76 remaining Israeli hostages be released by February 15 - a dramatic acceleration of the ceasefire framework that Hamas had negotiated with Israel.\nOn Tuesday, Netanyahu suggested that Hamas wasn't living up to the terms of the hostage exchange and promised to resume military action in Gaza if all 76 hostages are not returned by Saturday. Hamas asserts that it is committed to the ceasefire and hostage release agreement.\nThe prospect of renewed hostilities in Gaza has kept most large shipping companies from returning to the Red Sea, for fear of renewed Houthi attacks on shipping and skyrocketing insurance rates. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi reinforced that concern in a statement Tuesday.\n\"Our hands are on the trigger and we are ready to immediately escalate against the Israeli enemy if it returns to escalate against the Gaza Strip,\" said al-Houthi. \"Do you think the people of Gaza, who resisted the [Israeli] bombings, would sell their homeland to you?\"\nPrevious Houthi missile attacks on Israeli territory have drawn retaliatory Israeli bombing raids, devastating the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah and other critical infrastructure in western Yemen."

        "content": "T\nhe labor strife that has plagued ports around the world has spread to Rotterdam with reports of long delays and slowdowns due to a contract dispute at the Hutchison Delta II Terminal. Two labor unions have broken off negotiations and backed away from a tentative agreement threatening to continue their strikes until the operator meets the terms of the tentative agreement.\nThe terminal which was opened in Rotterdam in 2000 reports it handles up to a quarter of the container volume through the port, which is also the busiest container port in Europe. APM Terminals had owned the facility till selling it in 2021 to the Chinese Hutchison Ports. It is located adjacent to Hutchison’s other terminal and has an annual capacity of 3.3 million TEU.\nShortly after acquiring the terminal, Hutchison entered into a new partnership with MSC’s TIL group with a plan to develop a new automated container terminal. It would have five berths and be one of the most advanced operations in Europe. The companies reported they would open the new facility in 2027.\nWorkers at the Delta II terminal are represented by two union FNV Havens and CNV. Contract negotiations began in November 2024 and the unions set as one of their key conditions a generous severance package and financial guarantees from Hutchison for the package because according to the unions future employment is in doubt due to the plans for the new Omega terminal.\nAfter months of contentious negotiations, CNV reported on January 20 that it was planning to withdraw from the negotiations. The unions issued an ultimatum and set a January 28 deadline. After a marathon negotiating session lasting 19 hours straight and 29 hours in total, a deal was reported on January 31. It is for a three-year contract running till 2028 with a one-time payment as well as annual 1 or 1.5 percent wage increases and automatic price compensation for inflation. Hutchison agreed to the severance package but the unions demanded written financial guarantees before a February 10-11 membership vote.\nThe unions contend Hutchison informed them late last week that it needed more time for the financial guarantee. Members rejected the proposed deal and the unions said they were withdrawing from the tentative contract without the guarantee.\nWork stopped at the terminal on February 9 and remained suspended till this morning, February 11. Even after the workers went back and the gates were reopened, they were said to be staging slowdowns. Hutchison reported twice during the day it was closing the gates because of the crowds in the terminal. Hutchison confirmed it is experiencing delays in the handling of all modalities and long wait times.\nMaersk issued a statement to customers reporting, “a reduced number of moves per hour conducted at the terminal for an unknown duration. Consequently, prolonging the time vessels are operated on and significantly disrupting their normal schedules. To minimize disruptions and protect overall reliability to your supply chains, contingent decisions will be made in the upcoming days.”\nBoth unions advised members today that they expect this will “be a long-term matter.” CNV said the unions have started preparing actions while FNV predicted there will be more strikes.\nHutchison apologized to shippers for the inconvenience while warning of long wait times at its terminal."

        "content": "A new project uniting leaders in German industry and funded by the German government looks to develop a new generation of fuel cells using methanol to provide power for cruise ships. In the zero4cruise project, the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), will be working with Meyer Werft and the Freudenberg Fuel Cell e-Power Systems, to further develop PEM fuel cell technology for large-scale maritime systems.\nThe partners highlight that the project is designed to tackle one of the maritime industry’s most pressing challenges, the development of sustainable and low-emission energy solutions for cruise ships. Several smaller-scale projects are working on fuel cells for cruise ships and demonstration projects, but the challenge is the amount of power required to sustain the operations of a large cruise ship. The project looks to build on existing technology to create large-scale fuel cell stacks.\nMeyer, which is well-known for its large cruise ship constructions including the first LNG dual-fuel ships, notes the focus of this project is on retrofitting existing ships. In addition to extending the lifespan of current ships, they note it can accelerate the decarbonization process in the cruise sector. They are particularly focusing on sustainable operations in ports and coastal areas.\nA key focus of the project is the further development of PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cell systems for large-scale maritime applications. They note by combining with methanol as an energy carrier, this technology offers great potential for supplying ships with electricity, heat, and cooling - efficiently and with low emissions.\nThe DLR Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics is responsible for the pre-development of fuel cell stacks on a scale relevant to the maritime market. This includes the consistent implementation of innovative technology approaches in the field of both LT-PEM and HT-PEM. The aim is to build prototype fuel cell stacks with 250 kW (LT-PEM) and 120 kW (HT-PEM), including performance verification in the laboratory.\nThe DLR Institute of Maritime Energy Systems is carrying out long-term tests on a 500 kW maritime fuel cell system. The aim is to simulate the real load cycles of a cruise ship to prove the long-term suitability of the system. In addition, newly developed LT and HT PEM fuel cell stacks will be tested in the Maritime Energy Laboratory to ensure development to the system level.\nThe German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology funded the project with a total of €18.7 million ($193 million). The research project kicked off in January with a team meeting in Munich."

        "content": "\nAfter a long delay, the construction of the New Cebu International Container Port (NCICP) in the Philippines has finally kicked off. The Transportation Secretary Jamie Bautista in company of other senior government officials this week led the groundbreaking ceremony for the port. The $290 million NCICP is located in Tayud, a district at the northern end of Cebu City.\nThe project was first mooted in the early 2000s but experienced approval delays. However, in December the government gave the contractor the green light to begin civil works. President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. signed the project contract with the Korean company HJ Shipbuilding.\n“This project is set to improve Cebu’s cargo handling capacity, alleviate congestion at the existing facility (Cebu Baseport) as well as establish Cebu as a regional logistics hub. The construction is expected to be completed by 2028,” said Cebu Port Authority (CPA).\nThe project involves transforming 60 acres of reclaimed land into an international container port with an annual handling capacity of 395,000 TEU. The terminal will have five quayside cranes, a 500-meter berth and a water depth of 12 meters. This will allow the terminal to accommodate two 2,000 TEU feeders at any given time.\nThe NCICP project is being implemented under a bilateral partnership between the Philippine and Korean governments. The Import-Export Bank of Korea (KEXIM) is contributing around $172 million and the rest is coming from the Philippines’ national government. The International Finance Corporation of the World Bank is acting as the transaction adviser.\n“NCICP will significantly boost economic engagement between the Philippines and South Korea, especially with the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA), which came into force on December 31. Trade and cargo volumes between the two countries is expected to increase significantly in the future,” said the Korean Embassy in Manila.\nWith the Philippines working to improve connectivity and supply chains within its 82 provinces, the country has announced major port expansion projects. Last month, the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) issued tenders for the expansion of three major ports worth $14 million. The targeted ports include San Jose Port in the Province of Dinagat Islands, Roxas Port in Oriental Mindoro and Guinsiliban Port in Camiguin."

        "content": "\nNavantia UK announced plans to invest in Harland & Wolff’s facilities to strengthen Britain’s defense, maritime, and clean energy industrial capabilities after the Spanish parent company completed the acquisition of the four UK shipyards including the historic Belfast, Northern Ireland facility. Government and industry officials as well as the union representing the workers at the Appledore facility welcomed the acquisition calling it a new chapter for the company and UK shipbuilding.\n“Today marks the beginning of our shared journey. We are not just combining two companies; we are building a formidable team,” said Navantia’s Chairman, Ricardo Domínguez, as management conducted a visit to the Belfast shipyard and will be touring Appledore, Methil, and Arnish in the coming days.\nRiverstone Capital which had financed the Harland & Wolff Group reported the sale of the four yards was finalized for a cash consideration of £69.9 million ($86.8 million). In addition to the purchase price, Navantia UK agreed to waive £23 million ($28.6 million) of debt that had been provided between October 2024 and the closing to maintain the operations of the four yards. The bankruptcy administrators are expected to make an initial distribution of approximately £44 million ($55 million) to Riverstone Credit Partners and affiliated funds, with future distributions estimated to total around £26 million ($32 million) over the next few months. There was no word if monies would be available to the individual creditors of the Harland & Wolff Group and its shipyards.\nSeparately, Rothschild & Co is soliciting interest for the acquisition of Harland & Wolff's Islandmagee Gas Storage project, which is expected to significantly increase the UK's gas storage capacity once operational. The project was part of InfraStrata, which acquired Harland & Wolff in 2019 and later transformed into the Harland & Wolff Group.\nSpeaking to the workforce at the Belfast shipyard, Navantia’s Domínguez announced that the new owners would resume and expand the investment and recapitalization plan for Harland & Wolff, which is central to the Fleet Solid Support program for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary but had been paused in recent months. Investments into the shipyard facilities had been underway before the bankruptcy to support the FSS program, which calls for Navantia in Spain to build the hulls with integration and delivery taking place at Harland & Wolff’s Belfast shipyard.\nThe investment across the four sites will fund cutting-edge facilities, technology, and training, underpinned by a comprehensive business plan to integrate these facilities into the UK’s industrial and defense ecosystem, reported Navantia. The Financial Times reports the Spanish company has committed up to £100 million ($125 million) in investments to support the building program and to revitalize the four yards. Navantia says it looks to align the yards with the UK’s strategic priorities for national security and energy transition.\nAs part of the deal with the government for the rescue of the four yards, Navantia has reportedly committed to maintaining 1,000 jobs at the four yards. In addition, the company said the FSS program would provide 800 related jobs at suppliers across the UK.\nThe rescue marks the second time in less than a decade that the Belfast yard was been saved during administration. Appledore which also dates back to the 1850s ceased operations in 2019. It was acquired in 2020 by InfraStrata as part of its plans to build out the capabilities of Harland & Wolff."

        "content": "Spanish shipbuilder Navantia Group’s UK subsidiary completed the acquisition of the four shipyards and the offshore operations of the UK’s financially troubled Harland & Wolff Group. It was a strategic deal supported by the UK government and ensured the project to build three support ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.\nThe UK government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer was heavily involved reporting it worked closely with Navantia UK and agreed on an amendment to the existing Fleet Solid Ship Program contract on commercial terms, which made the minimum changes necessary to ensure Navantia could still deliver on the contract and build all three navy ships. The support for the sale came after the government last summer decided not to provide loan guarantees for Harland & Wolff to refinance its operations.\nIn announcing that all the necessary regulatory approvals had been received, Navantia also thanked the UK government for its support during the negotiations. The company is committed to protecting more than 1,000 jobs while making investments in the operations.\n“The completion of this acquisition marks a significant milestone for Navantia UK and demonstrates our long-term commitment to UK industry,” said Ricardo Domínguez, Chairman of Navantia. “By combining Harland & Wolff’s proud heritage and facilities with Navantia’s global expertise in defense, maritime, and renewable energy, we are creating an exceptional platform for growth.”\nNavatia acquired the facilities of Harland & Wolff’s historic shipyard as well as the facilities of Appledore in Devon, and the smaller fabrication yards Methil and Arnish both in Scotland. The yard in Belfast and Appledore will both participate in the Royal Fleet shipbuilding program building components and outfitting the three vessels which will also be built by Navantia at the Puerto Real facility in Cadiz, Spain.\nHarland & Wolff’s parent company went into administration last fall when the UK government refused to support the refinancing. Initially, the shipyards continued to operate but in mid-January, the company said it determined it was no longer possible to run the yards and they would also proceed into administration. It was reported as a step in the sale process making it possible for Navantia to buy the assets without taking on all the debts of Harland & Wolff.\nThe deal and the asset sale raised questions in the UK Parliament and concerns that suppliers would not be paid. GMB Union which represents workers at the yards today however released a message on social media saying closing the deal meant workers could relax with job security. However, the union noted that without more work the wards would continue to struggle.\nThe prior management group had acquired the storied Belfast yard from administration in 2019 and mapped a strategy to expand the business focusing on shipbuilding, repair, and opportunities in structures for the offshore energy market. They acquired the long-idle Appledore yard and the yards in Scotland and had begun to win assignments including its first new builds in 20 years. However, it also required extensive investments to modernize the facilities.\nNavantia looks to use its extensive depth in the maritime industry both with naval construction and repairs to expand Harland & Wolff’s operations."

While much of the focus in the industry is on the need for more and larger CO2 carriers to meet the anticipated needs of the carbon capture and storage industry, this project focused on a specialized LCO2 carrier tailored to the coastal market in Japan.\nMitsubishi has been actively promoting the development of LCO2 carriers and the establishment of CCS value chains. In a project working with Nihon Shipyard Co., it is jointly pursuing the development of anocean-going liquified CO2 carrierwhile working with NYK they developed concepts for a vessel that could transport both CO2 and ammonia. Another project that also involves Nippon Gas Line looks to develop the value chain including moving the captured CO2 to Malaysia for storage under the seabed.\nDemand for LCO2 carriers is expected to grow in tandem with CCS (carbon dioxide capture and storage) projects involving marine transport of CO2 captured in Japan to storage sites. Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Nippon Gas Line worked jointly on a study exploring the need to transport CO2 captured at smaller sites in the Seto Inland Sea area and transport it to overseas storage sites.\nMitsubishi Shipbuilding in late 2023 completed the construction of a small-scaledemonstration LCO2 carrierwith a cargo tank capacity of 1,450 cubic meters. The project sponsored by the Japanese government was to develop expertise in the sector and was followed by a program to establish standard specifications and designs for LCO2 carriers along with a focus on the steps to establish a construction supply chain.\nMitsubishi Shipbuilding and Nippon Gas Line have now completed a concept study for a low-pressure type coastal LCO2 carrier for the needs of emitters in the Seto Inland Sea area. ClassNK (Nippon Kaiji Kyokai) reviewed the designs and awarded Approval in Principle for the carrier to serve in coastal transport. The study explored domestic storage sites or acting as a feeder operation for overseas shipping.\nThe companies expect the AiP certification to support the efforts to develop opportunities for highly versatile small-sized LCO2 carriers to consolidate CO2 collection in Japan for transfer through overseas shipping.\nPreviously, the companies have said the goal would be to start construction on LCO2 carriers by 2027. They anticipate beginning a commercial service by 2028."

        "content": "\nChinese officials today, January 15, marked the completion of the first phase of the construction of the country’s second domestically-built large cruise ship. The milestone is being hailed as another demonstration of the expanding prowess and capacity of the domestic shipbuilding industry.\nThe new cruise ship is being built for Adora Cruises, a Chinese company controlled by CSSC with Carnival Corporation as a minority investor, and the second time the CSSC yard has turned out a large ocean-going cruise ship. At 141,800 gross tons and 1,119 feet (341 meters) the new cruise which was namedAdora Flora Cityin October 2024, will be 57 feet (17.4 meters) longer than theAdora Magic City. Passenger capacity is being increased to 5,232 passengers.\n\"It took us less than nine months to complete the hull structure assembly, two months sooner than the first one,\" said Wang Qi, chairman of China State Shipbuilding Corp (CSSC) Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co. during the celebrating ceremony held on Wednesday morning at its builder Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co.\n\n\n\nDuring the presentation, it was highlighted that the speed of construction for the cruise ship is “on par with our European peers,” being achieved after “initially mastering the key technologies.” Cruise ships are more complex than containerships and other vessels built by the yards due to the intricacies of the hotel and its systems. The European shipyards involve numerous subcontractors and have well-developed supplier networks for all the details of a cruise ship project.\nCSSC initially partnered with Italy’s Fincantieri to develop its cruise ship construction capabilities. The design for the cruise ships is based on a class developed by Fincantieri and Carnival that has been deployed for Carnival Cruise Line and Costa Cruises. CSSC invested heavily to create new fabrication facilities unique to cruise ships.\nOne of the assertions reported to be included in thepending reportfrom the U.S. Trade Representative on the shipbuilding industry focuses on China’s co-opting technologies to build its domestic industry. The U.S. report will assert that China has engaged in forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft, and procurement policies to give its shipbuilders an advantage.\n\n\n\nThe new cruise ship, which will operate with the colloquial name ofAida Huacheng, is a refined version of the original design. In addition to the additional length, the passenger cabin design has been “optimized” with a new variety of suites and the addition of 19 staterooms for a total of 2,144. The size of the atrium lobby is being doubled and the public spaces, entertainment, and leisure areas have been “fully upgraded.”\nAmong the unique spaces being highlighted aboard the next cruise ship is the Sea Street Garden. It will be an open multi-function social space reportedly inspired by its namesake city, Guangzhou in southern City near Hong Kong. The city has the conversational identity of the Flower City. The Sea Street Garden will be a space for entertainment, leisure and healing activities, social interaction, and a coffee café. The space evolves based on the time of day.\nAdora launched cruises this year from Guangzhou aboard theAdora Mediterranea(formerlyCosta Mediterranea) in advance of the completion of theAdora Flora City.Adora Magic Cityremains homeported in Shanghai. During its first year of operation, the cruise ship reportedly completed 84 voyages and welcomed nearly 600,000 tourists.\nCSSC reported the new cruise ship is moving into the second phase of construction. It will focus on interior decoration, equipment installation, and commissioning. The construction schedule calls for the next milestone at the end of April with the first dock flotation test.Adora Flora Cityis expected to be delivered by the end of 2026."

        "content": "\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock has lost its appeal to reverse a Customs and Border Protection ruling that allows foreign rock-dumping vessels to compete more easily for U.S. offshore wind farm contracts. The U.S. 5th Circuit ruled that GLDD's suit was speculative, finding that the harm to GLDD's business interests had not yet occurred.\nCBP ruled in January 2021 that foreign-flagged vessels could not be used to dump U.S. rock onto the U.S. continental shelf: the rock originated at a U.S. point, and would be deposited at a U.S. point on the OCS. Two months later, after a request from the American Petroleum Institute, CBP reversed itself and ruled that foreign-flagged vessels could dump the first layer of scour protection rock on \"pristine\" seabed at a new U.S. windfarm, as the seabed is not a Jones Act-regulated U.S. point before the moment when a vessel installs rock on it. The second and subsequent layers must be placed by a Jones Act vessel, CBP ruled.\nU.S. coastwise shipping interests rely upon legal protection to exclude foreign operators, which have lower capital, labor and compliance costs and can usually underbid Jones Act-qualified shipping on a commercial basis. For national security reasons, U.S. coastwise shipping is protected from global price pressure by federal law. Customs and Border Protection is tasked with defining the limits of those protections through letter rulings, advisory interpretations of the Jones Act that lay out what does and does not constitute protected coastwise trade between U.S. points.\nGLDD has invested about $200 million in a new Jones Act rock placement vessel to serve offshore wind installations, the only one of its kind in the United States, and will be the first company ever to install U.S. rock at a U.S. OCS wind farm. Its outsize investment in U.S.-built tonnage is predicated on a long-term pipeline of scour protection contracts for U.S. wind farm projects. As the sole bidder with a legally qualified ship on order, GLDD secured three rock contracts by the end of 2023, and it expected more: at the time, the industry appeared to be picking up pace. In a federal lawsuit, GLDD argued that by partially opening the market to low-cost foreign bidders, CBP's ruling reduced its ability to compete successfully for future work.\nThe American Petroleum Institute intervened in the case as an appellee, and it argued that GLDD did not have standing to sue because it had not yet lost a bid to a foreign rock placement vessel operator, and had therefore not yet suffered any harm. The district court agreed and dismissed GLDD's suit as lacking standing, without considering the merits of the case. GLDD objected, since it had already spent millions on a new ship, and appealed the decision.\nOn appeal, the 5th Circuit confirmed the dismissal of GLDD's case. The circuit court ruled that GLDD had not shown that it would face future competition from foreign flag vessels when bidding for future Jones Act rock-placement work. The judges noted that the same work could be performed without considering the Jones Act, simply by shipping the rock from a foreign port, and decided that there was too little information to assess the prospects of foreign participation in a brand new trade: no firm has yet actually moved U.S. rock to a U.S. outer continental shelf wind farm.\n\"In sum, Great Lakes has not shown injury-in-fact merely because the [CBP] letter may foster future competition. We agree with CBP that this theory of competitor standing 'sweeps far too broadly,'\" the judges ruled."

The single-engine plane crashed on an ice floe, killing the pilot and all nine passengers aboard.\nCoast Guard search parties found the wreckage on Friday, and deployed two rescue swimmers to the surface of the ice by helicopter to investigate. They identified three victims in the wreckage; the other seven people aboard were not visible but were presumed dead because of the state of the aircraft. According to the Nome Volunteer Fire Department, the crash was not survivable. The remains of all ten victims were recovered by Monday.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) plans to conduct a further investigation, but accessing the wreckage is difficult. The ice is soft and unstable, and a winter storm is coming soon, part of the usual pattern of the Bering Sea's relentless weather. According to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy, the ice floe is drifting at a rate of about five miles a day.\nVictims of the crash included two school staffmembers and two technical staff who were in Unalakleet to service a water plant. Like many of Alaska's far-flung coastal settlements, the area is roadless and accessible only by air or sea.\nThe aircraft was a derivative of the Cessna 208, a commercially successful single-engine aircraft used around the world for passenger and cargo transport. About 3,000 examples have been delivered and have logged about 25 million flight hours, with about 277lost in serviceover the past 40 years."

        "content": "\nDominion Energy reports its offshore wind farm project remains on schedule and is making good progress. Known as Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, the 2.6 GW project will be the largest in the United States when it is completed at the end of 2026.\nOffshore work for the wind farm began in 2024 and the company says it has now approached the 50 percent mark with milestones in the installation. After completing the installation of 78 monopole foundations and four offshore substation foundations during the first season which ended in November 2024, Dominion highlights that the first 16 transition pieces are now in place. The completed project will have 176 wind turbines. The company continues to stage materials at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal with the next phase of monopole installations due to start in the spring.\nThe first three of the 4,300-ton offshore substations arrived in late January in Virginia. Among the next steps, Dominion reports that wind turbine tower and blade fabrication is now underway and nacelle fabrication is scheduled to begin later this quarter.\n\n\nSubstations arrived as materials are staged onshore in Virginia (Port of Virginia)\n\nWhile the project is making good progress on the installation, Dominion also revealed costs are up approximately nine percent from the November 2021 budget submitted to the Virginia State Corporation Commission. They noted that the increase, which is due to higher onshore network upgrade costs assigned by grid operator PJM, has driven the total budget to $10.7 billion up from the original estimate of $9.8 billion.\nThe company emphasized that the costs are controlled with robust cost-sharing mechanisms and an unused contingency that stands at $222 million. Dominion Energy last year sold a 50 percent stake in the project to investors Stonepeak which will cover half the costs up to $11.3 billion. Above that there is a cost-sharing mechanism. While costs are up, they also said it is only for the grid portion with other project costs including offshore having remained in line with the original budget. The company reports the project will cost the average customer 43 cents per month over the life of the project.\nAs part of the project, Dominion Energy is building the first U.S. wind turbine installation vessel at Seatrium’s shipyard in Texas. NamedCharybis, they report the vessel is now 96 percent complete. It has commenced sea trials. Its first project will be the installations for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind.\nThe company has been successful in managing the project to keep it on track and avoid some of the challenges that other projects are experiencing. It retrained DEME for the first phase of the installation using DEME’s large install vesselOrion.\nDominion’s long-term plan calls for expanding its offshore wind energy presence. In 2024, Dominion acquired an adjoining property from Avangrid which is said could provide an additional 800 MW of power. In August 2024, Dominion also won a lease from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for a site 35 nautical miles from the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The company has said the lease area could support between 2.1 gigawatts and 4.0 gigawatts of offshore wind energy generation according to BOEM’s preliminary estimates. These additional projects require planning and eventually permitting which would likely be delayed under the Trump administration’s energy policy."

Of this we estimate 320,000 liters of diesel fuel mix has been recovered from the ship’s diesel fuel tanks.\"\nThe team has pumped out the ship's larger and more accessible tanks, he said, and they are now making progress on the smaller remaining tanks. There are 54 in total that need to be pumped out, including fuel, lube oil and bilge water tanks.\n\"The amount of diesel fuel in the liquid recovered won’t be known until the liquid is processed, although the majority of the volume of liquid recovered so far is assessed to be diesel,\" Commodore Brown said. “In addition to the liquids from the diesel fuel tanks, the salvors have recovered around 18,000 liters of lubricating oil.\"\nThe end of the pollution-abatement process is approaching, and the governments of Samoa and New Zealand are in talks about next steps, which might include wreck removal or possible compensation for local fishermen. The residents of nearby villages were banned from fishing near the wreck site for weeks due to the risk of fuel contamination.\nThose villagers are making moves of their own. After calling for financial compensation from their government and from New Zealand, they reached out to the Chinese embassy in Apia for foreign aid assistance. \"We met with the Chinese ambassador to discuss our needs, and they are willing to assist us immediately due to the sinking of the boat in our district,\" a spokesperson told Radio New Zealand. \"We talked about the individual and family needs for daily living, including monetary assistance to help with their losses.\""

        "content": "The world's largest iceberg is slowing heading towards the island of South Georgia, where it may have serious affects on local wildlife.\nIceberg A23a is so big that it ihard to visualize: at 1.1 million acres in area, it is about 75 times larger than Manhattan (and shrinking). Fornow, it measures about 40 nautical miles by 32 nautical miles on a side, and it weighs about one trillion tonnes. Its sheer sides tower more than 1,300 feet above the water, and chunks regularly break off in the waves.\nThe berg's arrival has been a long time coming. A23a broke off of Antarctica's Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986, and began to drift off into the Weddell Sea (taking a Soviet research base with it). It ran aground almost immediately, and stayed anchored to the bottom until 2020, when it finally refloated and began to drift to the northwest. It took three years to reach the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, and finally reached the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in April 2024. This was expected to shuttle the iceberg northeast into the Atlantic, where it would melt in warmer waters.\nHowever, A23a stalled in the South Orkney Islands for much of 2024. Oceanographers say that it was likely caught in a Taylor Column - a rotating cylindrical current found above a rise on the bottom. It kicked loose from this spinning water trap late last year and drifted away towards South Georgia, which is now about 180 miles away.\nWhen it finally breaks up, the iceberg will pose a hazard to the area's sparse vessel traffic - primarily fishermen - and may block in the rugged beaches of South Georgia, home to King penguins and seals. The last megaberg that reached the island broke up in 2023, and its remains still make a mess of commercial navigation. Fishing vessels operating near South Georgia have to negotiate a shifting city of giant ice blocks to get to and from their fishing grounds. \"It is in bits from the size of several Wembley stadiums down to pieces the size of your desk,\" Andrew Newman of fishing company Argos Froyanes told BBC.\nThe ice can also make it harder for penguins and seals to access the water from their breeding grounds on shore. Mark Belchier, director of fisheries and environment for the government of South Georgia, told CNN that any impact on wildlife from beach obstructions would be \"highly localized and transient.\""

The companies highlighted the complementary nature of their operations saying the combination expands the customer base and reach they can provide.\nWallenius SOL, based in Sweden, calls itself one of the pioneers in the RoRo sector. Today it provides regularly scheduled liner traffic between northern Scandinavia, the European Continent, and the United Kingdom. Its website highlights five vessels.\nThe company Wallenius SOL was launched in April 2019 as a 50-50 joint venture with Svenska Orient Linien (SOL) to expand its reach in Northern Europe. Dating back to 1911, SOL’s operations include tramp and liner shipping with LoLo ships between Scandinavia and the Baltics to the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as worldwide project cargoes and defense logistics.\nThe group acquires Mann reporting that it will combine the RoRo operation and use the brand of Mann Lines Logistics to further expand the logistic services for the joint business. Mann operates a 12,784 dwt RoRo built in 2017,M L Freyja, which it noted with 11,000 square meters of capacity exceeds its previous carrying capacities. The vessel has a modern hull and engine design which gives it much improved efficiency and environmental benefits. The company also provides logistics and forwarding services.\nMann is also scheduled to begin a long-term charter in 2025 of a second slightly larger RoRo currently building in Spain at Cantiere Navale Visentini. The new vessel will have a loading capacity of 3,000 lane meters plus around 200 cars on two car decks.\n“This acquisition, will among other things, result in a larger fleet and an expanded port network stretching from the Baltic countries to North West Europe,” says Elvir Dzanic, CEO of Wallenius SOL. “The integration of services will enhance our expertise, broaden our offerings, and foster thriving partnerships. With Mann Lines Logistics’ knowledge and years of experience operating container services in Northern Europe, we are well-equipped to deliver even greater value to the industries and communities we serve.”\nIn addition to the complimentary routes in the Baltic and North West Europe, the companies said it would extend its service range to Ireland, Spain, and beyond. It will add about 200 customers to Wallenius SOL.\nIt is the second step this year announced by Wallenius SOL to expand its operations. At the beginning of the year, the company launched an expanded route with the charter of the container vessel, Peyton Lynn C, with a capacity of 860 TEU. It expanded its LoLo service to include the Port of Tornio, Port of Pite, and Port of Rotterdam. It reported it would provide enhanced network connectivity in the Bay of Bothnia and strengthen access to deep-sea routes via Rotterdam alongside Antwerp."

Like theDali, she is also sailing under the flag of Singapore and managed by Synergy Marine under charter to Maersk. She has a capacity of 9,971 TEU. The vessel previously drew attention when U.S. officials boarded it in Baltimore in September 2024 to conduct an inspection due to it being a sister ship to theDali.\nThe vessel'smain engine failedwhile it was in the Pacific traveling to China after having departed Chile on December 27. The tug company Pacific International reports that its Marshall Islands Towing and Salvage Company deployed a tug on January 22 which took aboard four technicians in Kosrae, in the Federated States of Micronesia, before proceeding to the stricken vessel. TheMaersk Saltorowas reported to be adrift approximately 550 miles west of Pohnpei, also in Micronesia.\nTemporary repairs have been completed according to reports in the Chilean media and the vessel was able to get back underway on February 5. The schedule is now showing the ship will reach the Nansha New Port in China on February 17 depending on weather conditions during the remainder of the voyage. It will be a month behind schedule and then continuing to Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Ningbo. It is unclear when or where permanent repairs will be completed.\nA spokesperson for Maersk confirmed to the Chilean media that they were monitoring the situation and in contact with the vessel’s owners. They said the ship and crew as well as its cargo were in no danger and the owners assured them the refrigerated containers were continuing to operate during the breakdown.\nThe breakdown has drawn extensive attention in Chile as the vessel was part of a seasonal service known as the Cherry Express. Growers are concerned because the vessel was loaded with 1,353 refrigerated containers of cherries shipped to China to coincide with the Lunar New Year’s celebrations. The worry is that the long transit times will affect the quality of the shipment and decrease its value in addition to the impact of the late arrival.\nPrices of cherries are already reported to be depressed this year. They are one of Chile’s largest exports with the media saying 120 million boxes were sent to China. Reportedly 25 containerships were part of the seasonal service with more than 17,000 containers of cherries shipped from Chile’s port of San Antonio."

        "content": "\nTrailer theft is commonplace in America, and homeowners and contractors go to great lengths to keep thieves away from their toy-haulers and cargo trailers. But the Port of LA's police department recently busted a much larger and more organized trailer theft scheme: the department uncovered a ring of local thieves who were making off with dozens of chassis from container terminals and reselling them as new, making off with millions of dollars in ill-gotten profits.\nA joint investigation by the LA Police Department and the LA Port Police revealed the existence of a large-scale trailer theft ring that had likely been working in the Port of LA since last year. Authorities believe that the criminals accessed container terminals on port grounds; stole empty chassis that were stored and awaiting use; and relocated them to a storage yard in Gardena. There, the gang allegedly removed all the identifying marks from the chassis, repainted them, put new VIN numbers and markings on them, and resold them to unwitting buyers as new chassis.\nIn a raid on the 14500 block of South Avalon Boulevard in Gardena, 10 miles north of the Port of LA, police found 24 stolen chassis with a value of about $600,000. Given the scale of the scheme and the value of each chassis, the police believe that the theft ring was earning millions of dollars in revenue.\nGardena resident Denis Fuentes, 25, was arrested at the storage lot and now faces potential charges of receiving stolen property. The investigation is still under way, and additional arrests are expected soon; the port police are gathering information and are interested in receiving any relevant tips from the public.\n“The Port of Los Angeles [is] the busiest port in the United States so stopping this theft was important for everyone involved,” said LA Port Police spokesperson Lt. Rosario Ferrara. “Our investigation into these activities continues to evolve, but we hope this arrest sends a message to other criminals targeting the Port complex.”"

The head of the Suez Canal Authority expressed an optimistic prediction of the end of the first quarter, while shipping companies such as Maersk had said the second half or even late 2025.\nAnalysts warn that much of the outlook depends on the second round of the peace talks due to start for Gaza. The first phase of the ceasefire has held with hostages held by Hamas and Palestinians detained by Israeli exchanged despite a general uneasiness before each exchange.\nThe Arab nations, however, were quick to denounce Donald Trump’s repeated statements that the United States would take ownership of Gaza and redevelop it as the “Riviera of the Middle East.” Trump repeated the comments to the media on Sunday, saying Palestinians would not be returned to Gaza but relocated to our countries, causing widespread concern of potential unrest and a collapse in the peace talks. Saudi Arabia has said there will be no peace without a Palestinian state. The Houthis threatened to renew their attacks if the ceasefire collapsed.\n“A week ago, there was a light at the end of the tunnel,” commented Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime and a well-known industry analyst, told The Financial Times. He said, “The likelihood of a return to the Red Sea is reduced.”\nSuez Canal Authority Chairman Osama Rabie, however, speaking on Egyptian TV, said he expected to continue to see a gradual return, reports Bloomberg. He said a level of normalcy could be reached by late March and a full recovery by mid-year. Bloomberg, however, reports no more than 32 ships a day are making the transit, half the record highs of 75 vessels. The Canal Authority has also taken steps to increase capacity, recently completing additional two-way traffic lanes in the southern reaches of the canal.\n“Such a development is clearly contingent upon a positive development in the current negotiations related to the ceasefire in Gaza,” said Jensen. He pointed out that this Red Sea crisis has reached 448 days, with so far, few vessels having returned.\nLast week, the Suez Canal Authority highlighted that a Liberian-registered tanker that was attacked last July made an uneventful transit of the Suez Canal, its first in more than eight months. They pointed to it as a sign of the gradual return that they are predicting.\nAttendees at a Lloyd’s oil industry conference, however, continue to take a wait-and-see attitude. Barbara Harrison, vice president of crude supply and trading at Chevron, was quoted as saying the industry was waiting to see which ship would be first.\nThe managing partner of Energy Outlook Advisors, Anas Alhajji, took to social media on Sunday, February 9, to announce that the first LNG-laden carrier in about a year was crossing the Red Sea. He reported theSalalah LNG(145,500 cbm) was carrying Omani LNG. Built in 2005 and registered in Panama, the vessel is operated by Oman’s state-owned Asyad Shipping Company.\nMedia reports are speculating the LNG carrier is going to Turkey. The vessel’s operators appeared to be still cautious as no destination was displayed on its AIS, and instead, it had a message saying “armed guards onboard.”"

        "content": "While saying that it believes U.S. retailers continued to frontload imports of key products for several months ahead of a potential dockworkers strike and tariff increases, the National Retail Federation data now points to a slowing of month-to-month container volumes at the top U.S. ports. The trade association lowered its near-term forecast in the Global Port Tracker for U.S. container import volumes while saying it believes retailers continue to engage in diversification efforts to adjust supply chains.\n“Unfortunately, it takes significant time to move supply chains, even if you can find available capacity,” said Jonathan Gold, Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy at the NRF. “Retailers have engaged in mitigation strategies to minimize the potential impact of tariffs, including frontloading of some products, but that can lead to increased challenges because of added warehousing and related costs.”\nThe Global Port Tracker lowered its forecast for December 2024’s volume by 100,000 TEU at the major U.S. ports projecting the final number will be at 2.14 million TEU. While that would still be more than 14 percent ahead of 2023, it is down nearly one percent from November 2024. Further, the trade group lowered its January 2025 forecast by 50,000 TEU projecting the total at 2.11 million TEU. While that is up nearly eight percent over 2024, it would be another consecutive monthly decline. February 2025 is also projected to be down to 1.96 million TEU because of Lunar New Year factor shutdowns in China.\nThe NRF notes that the total for 2024 however rivaled the peak of 25.8 million TEU in 2021. It expects the final tally for 2024 at 25.5 million TEU which would be nearly 15 percent ahead of 2023. Strong consumer demand and low unemployment in the final months of the Biden administration contributed to continued strong retail sales and demand.\nPort cargo “could be badly hit” if tariffs on overseas Asian and European nations increase prices and prompt consumers to buy less, said Ben Hackett, Founder of Hackett Associates. He notes that Trump’s now delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico would initially have minimal impact at ports because most imports from either country move by truck, rail, or pipeline. In the long term, tariffs on goods that receive final manufacturing in Canada or Mexico but originate elsewhere could prompt an increase in direct maritime imports to the U.S. predicts Hackett.\nThe NRF is forecasting that container imports will begin to show month-over-month growth (as well as year-over-year) in the spring as retailers stock up for summer sales. March is forecast at 2.14 million TEU, up 11.1 percent year-over-year; April at 2.18 million TEU, up 8.2 percent; and May at 2.19 million TEU, up 5.4 percent. The current forecast however shows the increases could be short-lived with June container imports forecast at 2.13 million TEU, down 0.6 percent year-over-year and reversing the month-over-month gains.\nRetailer imports are forecast at 12.71 million TEU for the first half of 2025. That would be a 3.6 percent increase over the first half of 2024."

HTS did not attack Russian forces, even though Russia had bombarded HTS and its allies for most of Syria's 13-year civil war, but the Islamist group did cancel Russia's 49-year operating lease on the commercial portion of the seaport.\nAs HTS advanced, Russian Navy's Mediterranean Flotilla left Tartus en masse and took up station off the coast.

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "While many critics continue to question the viability of offshore wind energy, the UK trade group RenewableUK is out with a new market analysis highlighting the “extraordinary speed” of growth for the sector. The report details that installed capacity grew by 15 percent in the past 12 months as leading countries accelerated installations and new countries also adopted the increasingly accepted source of renewable energy.\nThe report calls out several key firsts including that global capacity surpassed 80.9 GW, the first time it has been at that level coming from a base of 70.2 GW just a year earlier. Additional countries are also making process with the first projects including the introductory offshore wind projects in Indonesia, Chile, and Malta which were confirmed in 2024.\nRecently, Greece mapped out its first project while on the other side of the globe, Australia finalized additional zones and reported progress with its likely first projects to win regulatory approval. The United States officially commissioned its first commercial-scale offshore wind farm in 2024 while others are proceeding in the construction phase.\n“Our latest EnergyPulse Insights report shows that the global offshore wind market is continuing to grow at an extraordinary speed year after year, as more countries look to seize the industrial, economic, and environmental opportunities which the technology offers,” comments RenewableUK’s Chief Executive Dan McGrail.\nThe report however also shows a continued concentration among a few countries while others work to accelerate the next phase of growth. Two countries, China (adding 6.9 GW) and the Netherlands (adding 1.7 GW) accounted for 63 percent of the total capacity added in the offshore segment in 2024. Further, for the first time, a single country, China (41 GW installed) now accounts for more than half the industry’s current capacity.\nThe first offshore wind farm, Vindeby installed in Denmark, was commissioned in 1991. The UK entered the sector in 2003 and by 2008 had become the leader, a position it maintained till 2021. China took the lead in 2021 and two years later in 2023 was over 31 GW. The UK remains second but far behind with 14.7 GW installed and Germany is third at 8.5 GW.\nThe growth is set to continue predicts RenewableUK reporting that the number of projects in the global offshore wind pipeline has increased from 1,461 to 1,555 over the last twelve months. It notes that the number of countries involved in the sector is up from 41 to 44 as new markets continue to emerge.\nThe project pipeline they believe looks strong when considering offshore wind farms at all stages of development. The report reviews fully operational, under construction, consented, in the planning system, and early development projects.\nChina has the largest defined pipeline with 247 GW across 437 projects, while the UK remains in second place with 96 GW across 123 projects. The U.S. has significant potential according to the report with its 79 GW of defined projects placing it ahead of Germany which has 68 GW and Sweden which was reported with 55 GW. Sweden, however, recently blocked many of the projects due to concerns raised by the military for defense and of course, Donald Trump has taken steps since his inauguration to stop the progress in the U.S. industry.\nRenewableUK also used the report to highlight the opportunities in the UK. It is urging the UK government to maximize its investment in new offshore wind capacity. Wind energy became the UK’s largest source of electricity surpassing gas in 2024. In the upcoming Allocation round 7, 13 UK offshore wind projects with a total capacity of 7.3 GW are eligible. The government received 72 responses during the consultation round and is expected to launch the next auction in March.\nSupporting the growth are also developments in new technology. Media reports indicate Siemens Gamesahas received consent to proceed with the development of a prototype 21 MW offshore turbine that will rial the largest announced in China. RewnewableUK emphasizes a large potential saying the industry cold surpass 254 GW by the end of 2030 while expect the emerging floating offshore wind segment could have 3.9 GW installed by 2030."

        "content": "Efforts to develop the first LNG import terminal in South Africa are continuing to make progress with 2026 now targeted for a final investment decision. A terminal operator agreement was signed which provides for the design, development, construction, and operation of the terminal which would be located at the Port of Richards Bay on the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa.\nTransnet Pipelines, a division of the state-owned group and that operates nearly 2,000 miles of pipelines, has formed a joint venture with Vopak Terminal Durban, part of Royal Vopak, for the planned LNG terminal. Transnet National Ports Authority appointed the joint venture known as Zululand Energy Terminal in August 2024 to develop and operate the LNG terminal. It followed the first RFP which was awarded in January 2024.\nZululand has now executed a 25-year concession for land in Richards Bay to be used for the terminal. The company has full rights to the land designated for the terminal and reports it is a key step in the process.\nAccording to the companies, the LNG terminal is a pivotal development in South Africa’s efforts to ensure energy security as the country faces a looming “gas cliff” and the gradual decommissioning of coal-fired power stations. The terminal will support flexible power generation while fostering industrial growth in KwaZulu-Natal and beyond.\nThe project calls for the development of a floating storage unit with a capacity of 135,000 to 174,000 cbm which would be supported by an onshore regasification unit. In the second phase, they plan to replace the FSU with onshore storage.\nZululand Energy Terminal reports it is in an advanced stage of its capacity allocation process, with negotiations ongoing with a select group of potential customers. It initiated an RFP in September 2024 to identify key stakeholders critical to the project’s success. With the new agreements, it reports it can proceed with binding agreements with potential customers. A final investment decision is expected in 2026, contingent on customer commitments.\nRoyal Vopak has been active in South Africa since 1997. It owns and operates two terminals in the country and expects to leverage its expertise to develop this new project.\nTransnet in August 2024 also asked for expressions of interest from companies for a second project to support the LNG terminal. It plans to transition the existing Lilly Gas Pipeline which connects to Durban from transporting Methane Rich Gas to regasified LNG. Lilly currently transports approximately 500 cbm of MGR annually and has key offtake points along its route. The LNG project they report will benefit from the industries connected to the Lilly Pipeline.\nOfficials have said this LNG terminal project represents a significant milestone for South Africa. They highlight that it will provide the infrastructure necessary to meet growing energy demands, support the energy transition, and stimulate economic growth. South Africa will join a growing number of countries around the world working to develop LNG import capabilities."

        "content": "\nNorwegian oil major Equinor has announced a major cutback to its renewable-energy ambitions, and says that it plans to focus on maximizing shareholder value going forward.\n\"Equinor has high-graded the project portfolios in renewables and low-carbon solutions, and reduced cost and early-phase spend,\" the company said in its quarterly report. \"The portfolio is expected to deliver more than 10 percent life-cycle equity returns.\"\nThe company said that circumstances have changed since it last set its renewables targets - especially in the United States, where the political and economic winds have shifted against offshore wind development. Equinor said that these pressures have had an effect on its credit evaluation, leading it to reduce its investment target for renewables for 2030 by about 25 percent.\n\"The reduced investment program is in line with our commitment to ensure a capital structure that can support a solid investment grade credit rating,\" Equinor said.\nOn the oil and gas side, Equinor expects production to increase by 10 percent  to 2.2 MMboed by 2030, thanks to strong performance at its core Norwegian continental shelf operations. Equinor plans satellite field development and increased recovery from existing assets to help support long-term production at low cost.\nEquinor posted operating income of $8 billion and a net profit of $2 billion in the fourth quarter. It continues to invest in share buybacks, including a $5 billion buyback program for 2025 alone. \"Equinor is well positioned for further growth and competitive shareholder returns. We expect to deliver industry-leading return on average capital employed, above 15% all the way to 2030,\" said CEO Anders Opedal.\nEquinor has been in retreat from renewables investments for some time. Last August it closed its offshore wind operations in Vietnam, Portugal and Spain, citing inflation and supply chain delays. In September, it dropped out of a proposed blue hydrogen pipeline project that would have supplied power plants in Germany, citing lack of demand for the natural gas-based product.\nIt has, however, invested in growing its position in offshore-wind leader Orsted. Last year, it announced that it has acquired a cumulative $2.5 billion stake in the Danish company, just shy of 10 percent.\n“Equinor has a long-term perspective and will be a supportive owner in Ørsted,” said Anders Opedal, CEO of Equinor, in announcing the stock position. “This is a counter-cyclical investment in a leading developer, and a premium portfolio of operating offshore wind assets. The exposure to producing assets complements Equinor’s operated offshore wind portfolio of large projects under development.”"

        "content": "\nThe Port of Luanda in Angola is set to become a battleground of competition for two giant Arab companies after AD Ports officially commenced operations at the port under a long-term concession. AD Ports, the Abu Dhabi-based operator, announced that it has begun the long-term management and development of a major multipurpose terminal and associated logistics business at the port.\nThe company ventured into Angola in April last year after signing agreements with local firms Unicargas and Multiparques that saw it acquire an 81 percent stake to operate the terminal and a 90 percent shareholding in another logistics business. The company managed to secure a 20-year concession granting it the rights to operate the Noatum Ports Luanda terminal, with an option for a 10-year extension.\nAD Ports operations of this terminal set the ground for competition with Dubai-headquartered DP World for cargo business at the port. Since 2021, DP World has been running another multipurpose terminal under a 20-year concession and is investing $190 million to rehabilitate the existing infrastructure and acquire new equipment to improve efficiency.\nThe two giant operators will now be competing for a bigger share of business at the port, which handles about 76 percent of Angola’s container and general cargo volumes. It also provides maritime access to landlocked neighbors, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia.\nAD Ports hopes that its intended investments amounting to $250 million over the next two years in modernizing the terminal and expanding the logistic facility will be instrumental in attracting business. Over the lifespan of the concession, the company is committing to invest $380 million.\nKey investments will go towards upgrading the terminal to a general cargo, container, and roll-on-roll-off (RoRo) terminal, making it the only one with 16 meters (52.5 feet) of depth. This will ensure the terminal is able to handle Super Post Panamax vessels of up to 14,000 TEU. The terminal area spanning 192,000 square meters will also be re-engineered to support high-density and efficient container handling and will be equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and modern IT systems.\nAD Ports also plans to install new container handling equipment to boost container capacity from 25,000 TEU to 350,000 TEU and Ro-Ro volumes to over 40,000 vehicles. The company has already ordered three STS cranes and eight hybrid Rubber Tyred Gantry cranes for the terminal.\n“With the planned upgrade of Luanda’s multipurpose port terminal, and establishment of an integrated logistics and freight forwarding business, AD Ports is positioned to capture the growth in Angola’s container volumes, which are forecast to rise on average by 3.3 percent annually over the next decade,” said Mohamed Eidha Al Menhali, Regional CEO of AD Ports Group.\nThe start of operations in Angola by AD Ports is part of its Africa expansion strategy. Over the past three years, the company has announced more than $800 million in planned investments in the maritime and shipping, ports, and logistics sectors in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Tanzania, and Angola."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAt a press conference on Friday, January 31, at the now closed FSG Shipyard (Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft) the provisional insolvency administrators announced their rescue plan for the group’s two shipyard groups. They have reached terms for the two divisions to be sold independently of each other but also reported that investor Lars Windhorst continues to oppose the bankruptcy of the shipyard group.\n“We have managed to find two renowned strategic investors for FSG and Nobiskrug within the extremely tight time frame of just seven weeks,” said lawyer Christoph Morgen who is the provisional insolvency administrator for FSG. He also oversaw the previous insolvency of the company and the sale of the former MW Werften. According to Morgen, the best outcome has been reached for FSG ensuring the yard will resume work.\nThe group wasforced into bankruptcyin December 2024 by insurance administrators with reports employees had not been paid for weeks. There are also reports of a long list of creditors for the shipyards with many suppliers not having been paid in months. Windhorst had controlled the yards since 2000.\nUnder the terms of the provisional agreement, the Heinrich R?nner Group from Bremerhaven will acquire the FSG shipyard. The yard has been building Ro/Ro ferries and currently has an incomplete ferry in the yard for Australia’s Searoad. The Australian company is reported to support the deal and has already entered into a contract with R?nner for the completion of the ferry.\nR?nner is active in shipbuilding as well as steel construction. The company acquired the Lloyd Werft shipyard in Bremerhaven in 2022 during the insolvency proceedings for Genting Hong Kong and MV Werften.\nThe fate of the Nobiskrug operation is less clear. Lawyer Hendrick Gittermann is the provision insolvency administrator for the yards which specialize in luxury yacht construction. He reported that a notarized offer had been received from the Lürssen group, another of Germany’s large yacht shipbuilding groups. He reported that under the terms of the agreement, Lürssen would acquire Nobiskrug. Initially, it appears work and employees will be transferred to the neighboring Lürssen-Kr?ger shipyard.\nDuring the press conference, it was highlighted that neither of the shipyards can immediately resume work due to permitting and other considerations. Morgen said the deal would signal the start of investments by the acquirers to restore the operations.\nEmployees of the bankrupt companies have agreed to the formation of a transfer company. It is a German system that provides for 80 percent of their historic wages along with retraining. The transfer company will run for four months with 310 employees from FSG and 140 from Nobiskrug. The intent is for them to transfer back to the shipyards.\nMorgen reported however that late last night he and the judge overseeing the insolvency received a communication from Lars Windhorst. He reportedly offered to make available €50 million ($52 million) in a trust and would resume his role as managing director of FSG Group and the two shipyard groups.\nThe administrators said they viewed this as a delaying tactic noting that the insolvency had progressed and could not be stopped. They plan to present the plan to the court on February 1 and begin the insolvency process. Once the court rules, Morgen and Gittermann will have sole authority over the shipyards. They said as early as next week they plan to accept the offers from R?nner and Lürssen.\nGovernment officials hailed the agreements as a good outcome that would preserve jobs and the shipbuilding industry. Prime Minister Daniel Günther of the Schleswig-Holstein state and representatives of the union IG Metall joined in the press conference expressing their support for the deal.\nFSG however continues to face a lack of orders to ensure its long-term future. R?nner reported it is already in discussions with Searoad for a second ferry. They said the future emphasis would be on new ship construction contracts but they could also look to diversify such as with the construction of components for offshore wind power.\nThe two shipyard groups are among the oldest operating in Germany. Flensburger Schiffbau Gesellschaft traces its roots to 1872 while Norbiskrug traces its origins to 1895 and was officially incorporated in 1905. It built commercial ships before taking its first yacht contract in 2000. Today it is recognized as one of the leading builders of luxury yachts."

The 24 crewmembers abandoned ship onto the pier, and the vessel's stern settled until it made contact with the bottom, Morspas said.\nNo leaks of oil have been reported, and the cargo tanks are all believed to be intact. The vessel has been boomed off as a precautionary measure.\nThe next step for the salvors is to lighter off theKoala'scargo of 130,000 tonnes of mazut, a Russian grade of heavy fuel oil. Mazut is so thick that it must be heated in order to pump it, but the tanker's boiler is in the engine room, and Morspas confirms that the engine room is now filled with seawater.\nMorspas is working on alternative means of heating the cargo with steam so that it can be pumped off, and special pumps have been delivered from the port of Murmansk for the purpose of removing the thick, sludgy oil."

        "content": "Despite continued global uncertainties, Maersk is forecasting the container market will grow by a healthy four percent in 2025 and that the company will remain at pace with the market. The company gave a positive outlook for 2025 after highlighting that 2024 was the third-best financial performance in its history.\nStarting 2024, Maersk had issued a cautious note citing the factors disrupting the market and a collapse in rates that overtook the market in the latter part of 2023. Faced with the problems in the Red Sea, the prospects of dramatically higher costs, and a potential slowdown in the global economy, Maersk like its peers forecast a difficult year. Instead, the company highlights all three of its business segments performed well benefitting from a significant increase in freight rates, strong volume demand, and cost discipline.\nReporting financial results for 2024 today, Maersk dramatically outperformed analyst forecasts with earnings (EBIT) up 65 percent to $6.5 billion. Revenues from the ocean shipping business were over $37 billion for the year while total revenues across all the business were nearly $55 billion. Despite longer steaming distances for the routes going around Africa and increased fuel costs, it was able to stabilize operating costs and benefit from the higher freight rates.\n“Our ability to navigate shifting circumstances and ensure steady supply chains for our customers was put to the test throughout 2024,” noted Vincent Clerc, CEO of A.P. Moller – Maersk. “We successfully capitalized on increased demand while enhancing productivity and rigorously managing costs — all of which contributed to our strong financial performance.”\nSpeaking with reporters, Clerc downplayed the focus on tariffs saying more of the outlook depends on how consumers react and demand. For the industry, he cites the continued imbalance in supply and demand as new, larger vessels continue to be delivered but he said the potential remains to largely offset the supply-side drivers with strong market demand.\nThe Red Sea and its impact on the market continues to be one of the largest uncertainties according to Maersk, which like all the major carriers, continues to divert around Africa. On the optimistic side, Clerc said they might see a mid-year return but noted that with increased capacity, rates were likely to decline and drive Maersk to the low end of its outlook. However, if the return to the Red Sea continues to be deferred till the end of the year, Maersk believes the market remains strong and it will be driven to the high end of its forecast.\nBased on the uncertainties and the “considerable macroeconomic” issues, Maersk however foresees strong declines in profits in 2025. In the worst scenario, EBITDA could be at $6 billion which would be half 2024 levels. In the strongest case, the forecast calls for EBITDA of $9 billion which would still be below 2023 levels.\nInvestors were encouraged by the performance and did not show strong concern about the outlook. At one point during the day, they drove the stock price up by 10 percent and it settled up more than six percent on the day. Maersk is seen by many as an indicator not only for the industry but also for the broader economy and trade.\nManagement emphasized its ability to adapt to the market in what will be a challenging year. While the company remains committed to its strategy, it is also taking a large risk in its shipping operations as it abandons the alliance with MSC Mediterranean Shipping and begins a challenging transition to a new approach with an overhauled route system. Most of the first half of the year will be spent transitioning to the new Gemini Cooperation with Hapag-Lloyd which uses a hub and feeder system on its key routes. The goal is to drive schedule reliability with a goal of 90 percent on time believing it will differentiate the service and support higher freight rates due to the reliability of the service."

Details are limited currently as the incident is being investigated.\nEUNAVFOR Atalanta reports it was informed of the suspected attack on Sunday, February 9, and that it is coordinating with maritime security partners in the area. The incident is currently being investigated to confirm the circumstances.\nThe unnamed fishing vessel is reported to be flagged in Yemen. The attack took place off Eyl, on the northern coast of the semi-autonomous Puntland region of Somalia.\nAtalanta had highlighted that there were five years of stability till another local dhow, theAl-Meraj 1, washijackedin November 2023 in a possible local fishing dispute. Atalanta reported at the end of 2024 that it had documented 44 attacks in the subsequent 13 months till the end of 2024, including ones that were not successful in seizing vessels. It, however, noted that there were an unknown number of unreported/unconfirmed incidents involving dhows and smaller vessels. They calculated that as many as 19 dhows had been hijacked and were concerned the dhows could be used as motherships for attacks on merchant shipping.\nAfter activity resumed, they warned all vessels to increase safety protocols, and Atalanta’s forces were both patrolling and conducting friendly approaches with vessels in the region. Between June and December 2024, while there were three suspicious approaches, there were no incidents till December 2024, when a Chinese fishing vessel was taken while in Somali coastal waters.\nIt was classified as anarmed robberyas the vessel remained in coastal waters off Somalia with speculation that it could also be a local fishing dispute. At the time, they said, “The fishing vessel is under control of the alleged pirates, some of whom are carrying AK-47s and machine guns.” The Chinese government reported the vessel wasfreedin mid-January."

        "content": "Regulators for New Jersey’s offshore wind energy sector announced today that they will not be proceeding with an award for the fourth round wind solicitation due to “uncertainty driven by federal actions and permitting.” It makes the latest setback for the state which has seen multiple projects delayed and withdrawn despite a strong commitment by the state’s governor to renewable energy.\nThe New Jersey Board of Public Utilities reported it will not be proceeding with an award but that it is committed to working with Governor Phil Murphy to “build a successful offshore wind industry in New Jersey.” It reported that two of the three bidders in this round withdrew and that only the Atlantic Shores project proceeded to submit a best and final offer.\nLast week, Shell reported it would bepausingits involvement in the Atlantic Shores project saying it did not meet the company’s financial criteria. Previously in 2024 Shell also sold its portion of a New England wind farm project as it says it is reevaluating its participation in the sector.\nShell is a 50-50 joint venture partner with EDF Renewables in Atlantic Shores. The project calls for a two-stage project that would provide 2.8 MW of energy to New Jersey with up to nearly 200 turbines. It would be about 9 miles off the New Jersey shore near Atlantic City and Sea Girt. The project gained approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) in October 2024 for its construction and operations plan,\n“A number of reasons led to this decision, notably Shell backing out as an equity partner in the Atlantic Shores project and backing away from the American clean energy market, as well as uncertainty driven by federal actions and permitting. The Board concluded that an award in New Jersey's fourth offshore wind solicitation, despite the manifold benefits the industry offers to the state, would not be a responsible decision at this time,” said Christine Guhl-Sadovy, President, New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.\nThe state’s fourth solicitation called for 1.2 to 4 gigawatts of offshore wind generation capacity. The application window closed on July 10, 2024. Reports indicate the Corio-Total-Rise joint venture Attentive Energy and RWE-National Grid venture Community Offshore Wind also submitted initially but later withdrew from the process.\nGovernor Murphy had also announced in May 2024 that the state would be accelerating its schedule for future offshore wind solicitations. The fifth round he reported would be brought forward to the second quarter of 2025. It was previously scheduled for the third quarter of 2026.\nNew Jersey has struggled to get its offshore wind industry going. Ørsted had the two most advanced projects, Ocean Wind, but canceled them in 2023. The state awarded additional projects in January 2024 with 1,342 MW to Attentive Wind Two and 2,400 MW to Leading Light Wind. Problems with securing a turbine supplier however prompted Leading Light Wind totwice delayits application with the NJBPU. In December 2024, it asked for a delay till May 2025.\nThe New Jersey projects have faced strong local opposition. Donald Trump supported the efforts using New Jersey to highlight his opposition to offshore wind energy. Last week he posted on social media that he hoped the Atlantic Shores project would be “dead and gone.” The new Trump administration has imposed a moratorium on new leases in federal waters and is expected to delay the review of pending permit applications.\nAtlantic Shores issued a brief statement last week on January 30 saying it was still committed to New Jersey and delivering the state’s first offshore wind project.\nBased on these developments, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority reported today it is accelerating strategic review of options and alternatives for the New Jersey Wind Port. The state was planning the development of a large port facility to support the construction operations for offshore wind. The port facility was to be located in Salem, New Jersey."

        "content": "\nThe project to deploy the first wind-powered Ro-Ro as part of an innovative program for sustainable shipping moved a step closer to reality. Turkish shipbuilder RMK Marine reported today, January 29, that the hull of the Neoliner Origin has been floated for the first time.\nThe vessel was imagined by a French team that seeks to build a commercial vessel that is primarily powered by wind. When the Neoliner Origin enters service later this year it will operate up to 80 percent of the time primarily on wind power. The vessel has a backup diesel motor which will also be used for maneuvering in port.\nNeoline and RMK agreed to the project in 2023. Construction began in November 2023 and the assembly in February 2024. The company previously said it was targeting July 2025 for the commercial maiden voyage. It will sail from Saint-Nazaire, France to Baltimore, Maryland with planned stops in the French territory Saint-Pierre and Miquelon and Halifax, Canada.\nIn recent updates, the company reported that the 88 blocks that make up the vessel were in place and the garage ramp was being installed. The foundations of the SolidSail system were also in place. The diesel engine, gearbox, and reversible shaft generator were also completed with only the rigging to still be installed. The sail system and rigging have been completed by Chantiers de L’Atlantique and at last report was being transported to the shipyard in Turkey.\n\n\nNeoliner Origin will mostly use its sail for propulsion power (Neoline)\n\nThe Neoliner Origin will be 446 feet (136 meters) in length with nearly 3,000 square meters of sail. The vessel will use two Solidsail carbon masts developed and built by Chantiers de l’Atlantique with each mast standing nearly 250 feet (76 meters) and the ability to tilt for clearance and navigation in port. Other unique elements include retractable anti-drift plans and an ultra-efficient weather routing system. Wind will be the primary propulsion for the vessel but it will have an auxiliary engine used while maneuvering or in emergencies.\nThe vessel will have a loading capacity of 1,200 linear meters with a 2.8-meter width or a capacity of 265 TEU. The maximum weight will be 5,300 tons of cargo. The company highlights the design permits the ship to transport different types of cargo. There will also be accommodations for 12 passengers.\nNeoline’s plan called for two demonstration vessels to begin the commercial service. With two vessels, Neoline plans to offer a sailing every two weeks. The vessels are projected to have a speed of 11 knots providing an 8-day crossing time across the Atlantic. It will take an additional four days to reach Baltimore.\nIt has reported interest from a range of French industrial companies, including companies such as Renault Group, Groupe Beneteau, Manitou Group, Michelin, Jas Hennessy & Co, Clarins, Longchamp, Rémy Cointreau, and La Fournée Dorée."

        "content": "\nJapan’s NYK Line will be expanding its cruise ship operations as part of a new agreement with Oriental Land Co., the operator of the Disney theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort. The companies entered into a partnership agreement for the operation of a Disney-themed cruise ship to be launched in Japan.\nOriental Land reported in July 2024 that it planned tobuild a cruise shipwith the Walt Disney Corporation for the Japanese market that would be operated as part of the Disney Cruise Line. The company said it would invest up to $2.2 billion for the development of the Japanese cruise operation. The cruise ship was ordered from Germany’s Meyer Werft as the fourth member of the Disney Wish class (144,000 gross tons). The ship will be tailored to the Japanese market and run shorter duration cruises from Tokyo.\nUnder the terms of the new agreement, Oriental Land and the NYK Group will work together toward Oriental Land’s goal of providing family entertainment cruise experiences. They look to combine the OLC Group’s expertise in offering immersive settings and excellent hospitality, which has been developed through its well-established theme park and hotel operations, and the NYK Group’s cruise operations and shipping experience. Oriental Land, which opened the first Disney theme park in Tokyo in 1983, will use its experience along with Disney while NYK will provide the ship operation and management experience.\nThe new Disney cruise ship is a further expansion of NYK’s cruise operations which are soon to include two Japanese cruise ships. NYK has been operating Asuka Cruises currently with theAsuka II(formerCrystal Harmony) and this summer will add a new cruise shipAsuka III. The new cruise ship was recentlyfloated outat the Meyer Werft yard in Papenburg, Germany, and is currently completing outfitting. Historically, NYK operated a single cruise ship marketed only in Japan.\nDisney Cruise Line has announced an aggressive expansion plan to grow its fleet. The company started cruise operations in 1998 with the first of two cruise ships built by Fincantieri. It expanded with two cruise ships built by Meter Werft and in 2022 started its next phase of growth with theDisney Wish, the first of three 4,000-passenger LNG-fueled cruise ships also being built by Meyer Werft. The second cruise ship,Disney Treasure, entered service in December 2024 and the third,Disney Destiny, is due for delivery in 2025. The company said in its earning report that theDisney Treasurewas “off to a spectacular start.” They reported strong bookings for the sixth cruise ship of the fleet.\nThe success of the cruise line prompted Disney in August 2024 to announce an order for four more cruise ships all to be built by Meyer Werft. The company recently detailed that it will add a fourth ship in the Wish class and then will launch a new class of smaller cruise ships with three ships each approximately 100,000 gross tons and with accommodations for approximately 3,000 passengers. They will be delivered in 2029, 2030, and 2031.\nDisney Cruise Line is also launching operations this year from Singapore. The company is completing the construction of the former Global Dream acquired incomplete after the bankruptcy of MV Werften and Genting Hong Kong. The ship is being completed as theDisney Adventure(208,000 gross tons) for year-round short cruises from Singapore.\nThe Japanese Disney-branded cruise ship is expected to begin operations by 2029. In addition, the Disney Cruise Line will have 12 cruise ships by 2031."

        "content": "Alfa Laval which has been working to expand its solutions to aid the maritime, offshore, and other heavy industries with the challenges of decarbonization is adding anti-fouling solutions to its offerings. The company based in Sweden has signed an agreement to acquire NRG Marine and its Sonihull Ultrasonic Antifouling solutions.\nThe acquisition is part of Alfa Laval’s strategy to provide customers with environmentally friendly solutions that can contribute to improving operations and addressing goals for net zero operations and decarbonization. Alfa Laval is adding applications that contribute to improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and extending the lifecycle of assets for the maritime sector as well as offshore oil and gas operations.\nBiofouling is becoming an increasing concern both due to its operational impact as well as the growing focus on environmental considerations. Key regions such regions such as Australia and New Zealand have increased their biofouling regulations creating concerns for ships operating in the region. Several cruise ships drew attention when they were turned away from ports primarily in New Zealand due to biohazards that were identified on their hulls. It resulted in delays and costly impromptu efforts to clean the underwater surfaces.\nThe International Maritime Organization is also discussing the issues and the risks of spreading invasive species while operators are also seeking solutions to save fuel and operating costs. Similarly, the oil and gas sector continues to seek safe applications to prevent and clean growth from its stationary underwater surfaces.\nNRG Marine reports it set out in 2006 to develop an environmentally friendly anti-fouling technology against a backdrop of increasingly stringent legislation governing the use of poisonous biocides in marine coatings. Its offering is a proactive technology that utilizes ultrasonic microscopic bubbles that implode, creating agitation that disrupts the surface environment. The system operates continuously and is a non-invasive method that passively cleans the surface.\nUltrasonic anti-fouling technology they report is emerging as a promising alternative to other methods. It does not require harsh chemicals or removing the ship from the water to clean the hull. The companies highlight it is a sustainable technology that is cost-effective for the operators and can be installed on any ship with no requirements for through-hull fittings.\n“The inclusion of ultrasonic anti-fouling technology into our portfolio is another addition to our decarbonization toolbox,” said Sameer Kalra, the President Marine Division of Alfa Laval. “By addressing the critical problem of biofouling with this advanced technique, we will enable our customers to meet both business and environmental objectives.”\nAlfa Laval, which traces its origins to the 1880s, is well-known in the marine sector for its pumps, as well as its systems for fuel, oil, water, and other applications. It has been expanding its product lines with solutions including ballast water treatment, air lubrication, heat transfer, and exhaust gas as well as its participation in Oceanbird, a wind-assisted propulsion technology. The company expects to close the acquisition of NRG Marine in the second quarter of 2025."

With these steps in place, the contract will be presented in the next two weeks to the rank-and-file followed by a vote scheduled for Tuesday, February 25.\nSpeaking in front of the union’s Wage Scale Committee and more than 200 delegates, ILA President Harold Daggett said, “I believe it is the greatest ILA contract, and the greatest contract negotiated by a labor organization.”\nThe ILA delegates after the presentations unanimously approved the tentative agreement that is in the form of a Memorandum of Settlement between USMX and the ILA and supplements and amends the current Master Contract. That cleared the way for a ratification vote by the ILA rank-and-file members.\nUSMX separately reports that its membership unanimously approved the Master Contract at its membership meeting last month.\nTerms of the contract have not yet been announced and in particular the agreement about automation and semi-automation at the terminals. Wages issued reported settled with a better than 60 percent increase as well as terms for benefits.\nThe terminal operators were pushing for productivity improvements noting that the ports lack space for expansion and need to keep pace with increased volumes and demand. Reports said they have proposed to keep the existing language which forms a committee to review any proposed new systems or automation while calling for systems the ILA described as semi-automation.\nThe ILA was adamant that it would never accept any automation or semi-automation. The leadership called for a rollback on previous agreements.\n“This was the hardest and most complicated contract to bargain possibly in the history of the ILA,” said Daggett. “With the changes we’ve seen across our industry, we knew what this contract meant for securing the future.”\nThe ILA struck for three days in October while the Biden administration pressured the employers to make wage concessions. In December, President-elect Donald Trump came out strongly supporting the ILA and its position against automation.\nA final agreement on the contract terms was announced on January 8, a week ahead of the deadline and after several breakdowns and contentious allegations from both sides. If approved, the new agreement and all its benefits, are retroactive to October 1, 2024. The new contract would be in effect until September 30, 2030."

        "content": "The new governing power in Syria, Islamist group Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham, has renegotiated CMA CGM's container terminal lease at the port of Latakia and will allow the French liner to continue to operate the facility under modified terms.\nCMA CGM signed a contract to run Latakia’s container terminal back in 2009, under the regime of then-President Bashar Al-Assad. The initial lease was for a period of ten years, renewable for five years upon mutual agreement. Upon expiration of the contract in 2019, CMA CGM renewed it until 2024, despite the intense international pressure on Syria over the ongoing civil war. In 2024, CMA CGM was invited by the Assad regime to renew once more, this time for a far longer term of 30 years.\nAssad's Ministry of Transport favored allowing CMA CGM to renew the contract, and noted at the time that CMA CGM did not withdraw its investment when sanctions and economic collapse hit Syria. By contrast, Philippine operator ICTSI backed out of its long-term lease at the Tartus Container Terminal in 2013, after the start of the Syrian civil war. After ICTSI's departure, the Tartus lease was transferred to a Russian operator (since revoked by HTS).\nAccording to Reuters, HTS' ports authority has decided to keep CMA CGM on at Latakia, with changes. The authority announced Wednesday that it had reached terms on a revised contract for the French liner's participation at Latakia. The changes are said to include a revised lease duration and revised revenue split between the operator and the government.\nThe European Union is moving gradually to lift sanctions on the Syrian economy, allowing EU shippers to resume regular cross-Mediterranean trade with Latakia and Tartus for the first time in a decade. The prospects of economic renewal in a peaceful Syria may be attractive for business interests and for CMA CGM; Karam Shaar Advisory, a consultancy specializing in the Syrian economy, noted that CMA CGM founder Jacques Saade's family had ties to Latakia, potentially giving the firm an additional reason to stay."

The new ship namedMein Schiff Relaxmarks the first time the line has worked with Fincantieri after a long-term partnership with the shipyard in Turku, Finland.\nAt 161,000 gross tons,Mein Schiff Relaxis the largest for the German brand and the first of the company’s ships to operate on LNG. It was built as a dual-fuel ship immediately capable of operating on LNG or Marine Gas Oil and it will be able to transition to alternatives including bio- or e-LNG when it becomes available in the market. Last year, TUI also introduced the first methanol-ready cruise ship,Mein Schiff 7, which was built at Meyer Turku and with the addition of some pending components is expected to commence operations with methanol.\nFincantieri received the order for the two ships from TUI in July 2018 with the steel cutting for the first ship commencing in June 2022. The ship was floated out from the yard in Monfalcone, Italy in November 2023 and began its first sea trials last October. The first trials focused on the performance of the vessel and especially maneuverability. In December, it received its first LNG load and at the end of the month commenced sea trials operating on LNG.Mein Schiff Relaxis the second cruise ship delivered by Fincantieri fueled with LNG.\nThe Mein Schiff operation has been one of the fast-growing taking advantage of the strength of the cruise market in German-speaking countries. It was launched as a rival to Carnival Corporation’s successful AIDA brand with TUI’s first ship, acquired from Celebrity Cruises, sailing on its first cruise in May 2009. Today the brand has eight ships including Relax, with the oldest having been built just a decade ago.\n“Eleven years ago, we took delivery of our first newly built ship,” says Wybcke Meier, CEO of TUI Cruises. “With theMein Schiff Relax, we are now opening a whole new chapter in the field of premium cruises.”\nThe new ship is 1,070 feet (326 meters) in length with 1,945 passenger cabins and accommodations for 3,984 passengers and 1,535 crew. In addition to being the largest ship of the fleet, it has innovations for relaxation, 14 restaurants including more variety and a new Asian restaurant, and redefined spa and wellness areas. The ship features the cruise line’s first two-deck “freedom suites,” as well as introducing inside, outside, and balcony cabins for solo travelers.\nIn addition to the dual-fuel configuration,Mein Schiff Relaxfeatures new catalytic converters meeting Euro 6 standards, a generative turbine using residual heat from the diesel generators, and a shore power connection for ports. It also has a highly efficient waste treatment system capable of transforming organic materials into recyclable components through a thermal process.\nThe cruise ship enters service at the beginning of March and will sail for the first year around the Canary Islands before moving to Germany in mid-2026. TUI has planned an innovative christening ceremony for the new ship on April 9 in Malaga. She will meet up with fleet matesMein Schiff 5andMein Schiff 7. In addition to a celebrity performance, the three cruise ships will share the event with a gala dinner and cocktail aboard each ship and special culinary dishes from the restaurants on the new ship being served aboard all three ships.\nMein Schiff continues its rapid growth after introducingMein Schiff 7in June 2024. The next introduction,Mein Schiff Flowwill take place in Spain in August 2026."

According to the companies, launching the pilot testing is an important milestone in the project which began in 2021 and conducted its first tests in 2022.\n“Onboard carbon capture combined with existing cleaning technology is a significant shortcut to decarbonization of the world’s deep-sea fleet. This stands out as one of the more promising solutions for future vessels,” says Edvin Endresen, CEO of Solvang.\nOver the past few months, the 2019-built LPG tankerClipper Erishas been in dry dock for a full retrofit. The vessel which is 18,000 dwt arrived in November at the Seatrium Admiralty yard in Singapore and the companies report the team was at the yard on January 16 marking the completion of the installation project.\nSeatrium was contracted to install a seven-megawatt capacity carbon capture system from Wärtsilä. The capture system uses amine scrubber technology to pull about 70 percent of the CO2 out of the exhaust gas from the main engine. The CO2 stream will be chilled, liquefied, and stored on board the vessel for later offloading. Part of the project added large tanks visible on the deck of the vessel. Seatrium carried out engineering, procurement, upgrading of electrical and automation systems, and integration of the carbon capture and compression/storage system.\n\n\nThe retrofit adding the carbon tanks is taking place in Singapore (Solvang)\n\n“The introduction of carbon capture and storage capabilities on board the Clipper Eris is a major leap forward for maritime sustainability,” says Roger Holm, President of Wärtsilä Marine. “It represents a system change that has been made possible by close collaboration between our companies.”\nTheClipper Erisis the first vessel to be outfitted with this version of the technology and the pilot is scheduled to run for a year. The Norwegian shipping company received funding from the Norwegian State, through Enova, in 2023, making it possible to start the pilot project.\nFor OCCS to be a success on a larger scale, Solvang notes that more shipping companies and industry stakeholders must see the benefits and join in. Solvang CEO Edvin Endresen points to challenges with infrastructure and global regulations that need to be addressed for OCCS technology to succeed in the shipping industry.\n“CO2 can be recycled and used in land-based industries, but the global infrastructure for discharge for shipping needs to be developed fast. In addition, IMO must implement global regulations with benefits and penalty schemes for achieving the set goals. Predictability is necessary for the industry to invest in solutions for reducing CO2 emissions,” says Endresen.\nSolvang hopes this technology becomes a milestone for the world’s trading fleet on route to zero emissions. The company highlights that it has seven new vessels under construction, all designed and ready for installation of OCCS technology."

        "content": "\nAfter a series of four subsea cable damage incidents involving suspected anchor-dragging in little more than a year, NATO members in the Baltic suspect that Russian \"hybrid\" sabotage operations could be to blame. But investigators can add at least one more recent incident to the list: in January 2022, a Turkish ship may have dragged anchor under way and severed a subsea power cable in the Kattegat, between Sweden and Denmark. On January 20, 2022, the Konti-Skan 2 cable - a decades-old HVDC link between the Swedish and Danish grids - went out of service when it \"suffered a fault due to external impact.\" Swedish utility Svenska Kraftnät found evidence of an anchor-drag track on the bottom, and it appeared to line up with the AIS trackline of the product tankerSelin D.The vessel slowed down for nine minutes in the same region and same timeframe as the cable break, according to Kraftnät.\nThe utility filed suit against the owners of theSelin D, alleging that the master of the vessel \"caused the damage through gross negligence and with the knowledge that such damage would likely occur.\" The owner's lawyers assert that theSelin Ddid not cause the damage, or - if proven otherwise in court - did not cause any alleged damage intentionally.\nKraftnät's lawsuit seeks nearly $6 million in compensation. The case was filed in late 2023, but was little-known to the public until this week, when Dagens Nyheter covered thestory.\nSelin Dis a 2003-built product tanker with a checkered inspection history. It has since been resold to an Italian operator, and has been renamedIevoli Star.As for the Konti-Skan 2 cable, it will soon be replaced with a new modern HVDC link. The existing Konti-Skan 1 and 2 are expected to age out of service by the 2030s, and the new cable will have nearly 50 percent more power transmission capacity.\nSubsea cables do get severed in accidental anchor-drag and trawling incidents every year, but the rapid-fire cluster of cases in the Baltic is unusual. One vessel, the Russia-linked \"shadow fleet\" tankerEagle S,has been detained by Finnish police on suspicion of severing multiple cables on Christmas Day; nine members of the tanker's crew are under a travel ban and could face criminal charges."

        "content": "\nWork is underway to build what is being billed as the most sustainable cruise ship. Known as Captain Arctic, it is designed to present a new level of luxury expedition in the Arctic.\nGoltens highlighted the keel laying and its role in the development of the new ship. The ceremony took place on November 22 marking the start of the construction of the 70-meter (230-foot) hull which Goltens notes is also a first for the UAE.\nThe concept for the ship was developed by Sophie Galvagnon who has worked for nearly 20 years in the commercial shipping industry. She notes for a decade she has led expeditions into the Arctic but the trips have become “disconnected from the traditional ways.” Expedition cruising started with a focus on the destination but in recent years the cruise industry has focused on luxury amenities aboard the ships and add-ons such as submarines and helicopters.\nGalvagnon reports she and the team spent the past two years designing the innovative ship, convincing the market of the opportunity, and funding the project. They launched a French company, Selar, which they believe will present a new approach to sustainable tourism.\nThe Captain Arctic represents the company says a new vision in luxury cruise expeditions. The vessel has accommodations for just 36 passengers and will carry a crew of 24. There will be no set itineraries and schedules but instead, it will be a unique adventure offering chances to encounter polar bears, navigate through ice, and kayak among grounding icebergs.\n\n\n\nThe ship will be powered by five 35-meter-high (115-foot) retractable solar sails. Built to endure the harshest weather, they will be made of aluminum and fitted with 2,000 square meters of solar panels. The ship will have shaft generators and batteries to store power. The heating onboard will be from a pellet boiler that uses recycled wooden waste pellets. The ship will have an engine, using biofuel made from vegetable oil, but seeks to operate almost exclusively on the sails and solar power.\n“Beyond tourism, our first ship will support science through zero emission logistics and remove over five tons of plastic annually,” Galvagnon writes on social media. She says the ship will produce 90 percent less emissions.\nThe project is a partnership between Goltens and Chantier Naval de l'Ocean Indien (CNOI), based in Port Louis, Mauritius. Bureau Veritas is the class society for the vessel. Selar on its website shows the first trip in November 2026 with the Captain Arctic sailing from Troms?, Norway."

        "content": "\nThe first demonstration of the new Trump administration’s efforts to derail the offshore wind energy sector emerged as the Department of Interior began reversing steps taken in the last days of the Biden administration. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management canceled meetings for the review of an offshore wind project while the Department of the Interior highlighted that it was taking “steps to streamline processes that will enhance efficiency and innovation.”\nBOEM announced it was canceling the virtual public meetings scheduled by the Biden administration to begin comments and review of the Construction and Operations Plan submitted by Vineyard Mid-Atlantic. The first meeting had been scheduled for February 6, followed by sessions on February 11 and 19 for comments on the plan. It, however, noted that written comments could still be submitted before the March 3 deadline.\nThe prior administration on January 14 launched the review process for the wind farm that would be developed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and be located approximately 20 miles offshore New York and 36 miles offshore New Jersey. The lease was awarded in 2022 as part of the auction for the New York Bight and the construction plan called for 2 GW of electricity from up to 117 wind turbines, enough to power more than 700,000 homes.\nThe Department of the Interior and BOEM said in announcing the cancellation that it is implementing President Trump’smemorandumtemporarily halting offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. The memorandum also pauses new or renewed approvals, rights-of-way, permits, leases, or loans for offshore wind projects pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices.\nThe new Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, however during his first day in the position on February 3, signed measures to “immediately identify all emergency and legal authorities available to facilitate the identification, permitting, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, distribution, exporting and generation of domestic energy resources and critical minerals,” and to “expedite the authorization” of key projects. Burgum said there would be an emphasis on deregulation and unlocking resources in Alaska following Trump’s directions.\nDespite the new policies and move away from offshore wind energy, two projects highlighted that they are continuing to move forward. Equinor today, February 5, announced its year-end financial results and detailed its outlook including a continued commitment to the Empire Wind project. It completed the financing for the 800 MW project at the end of 2024 and highlights a low cost of entry as well as the utilization of project financing which along with future tax credits will cover the remaining CAPEX for Empire Wind. At the right time, it will also bring in a partner for the project which is due to be completed by 2027.\nThe commitment to Empire Wind comes as the company reported it is “high-grading its portfolio, reducing the investment outlook for renewables and low carbon solutions, and improving cost across the organization” as part of an effort to improve returns and free cash flow generation. Equinor said it was proceeding with Empire Wind, “a project in a challenging market with returns under pressure and uncertainty,” while reiterating that it will continue to deliver above 10 percent equity return on its current and renewable assets in operations.\nSimilarly, Dominion Energy highlighted its continued commitment and progress for its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. It reported yesterday that the installation has reached the halfway mark and that the offshore work remains on budget and on time. Due for completion at the end of 2026, the project with 176 wind turbines and a capacity of 2.6 GW, is slated to be the largest offshore wind farm in the United States.\nDominion holds rights for two other offshore wind projects in the mid-Atlantic region while Equinor has another one in New England and one in the mid-Atlantic. Those are listed as longer-term prospects, and likely to be delayed by the new Trump policies."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The NTSB report on a 2023 bridge strike says the captain of a tow vessel and barge company managers’ ineffective voyage planning and failure to conduct required checks caused a towed crane to strike the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan. They failed to confirm the air draft and bridge clearance, and the result was $665,000 in damages to the crane as well as $145,000 in damage to the underside of the bridge.\nThe towing vesselNickelena(103 feet) was regularly employed to move barges transporting construction equipment to sites around the Great Lakes. In May 2023, they were hired to tow a barge transporting a 160-foot-long boom crane and 5-foot “rooster” sheave on a deck barge from Escanaba to a construction project at Sault Ste. Marine, Michigan. It was a standard assignment, including the fact they would have to transit under the Mackinac Bridge, a roadway suspension bridge that connects the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan.\nThe crane was secured on the barge on May 6, and the tow commenced. After leaving the port, the captain ordered the tow line increased to 500 feet, and they proceeded. He left the bridge to rest but planned to return before 0200 when they were due to pass under the roadway bridge. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration determined there was no traffic and minimal wind effect at 0200, and the NTSB reports the tow was moving at 8 knots within the marked channel.\nThe first contact with the bridge was with the stiffening truss below the roadway, at the top of the truss’s bottom chord (about 155 feet above the water). The report indicates given the configuration of the crane, the wires securing the crane boom would have hit first, and then when they parted, the boom would have contacted the top of the chord. As the barge continued forward, the boom would have been pushed backward, and its angle and height above the water would have increased, leading to damage higher up on the bridge. At some point, the boom contacted the upper diagonal truss, about 183 feet above the water, before folding back and collapsing on the barge.\nThe engineer aboard the tow vessel was on deck while there was a crewmember at the helm. They did not report hearing the contact, but said when they looked aft, they noticed they could not see the crane’s boom.\nThe investigation showed that the captain and the managers of the barge company did not attempt to verify bridge clearance and instead accepted the word of the managers supervising the loading of the crane, who told the captain, “Everything’s secured, ready to go.”\nThe NTSB determined the managers made a visual evaluation that the angle of the crane boom was between 50 and 60 degrees, and the boom was 140 feet. The Load Moment Indicator on the crane was not working, so they relied on their judgment. They decided against lowering the boom to decrease the angle because they thought it would reduce the stability of the barge.\nTowing vessel operators are required to have a towing safety management system (TSMS), and voyage planning would have been part of the process. The company operating the vessel, Basic Towing, told investigators they had a TSMS, but the NTSB says no documentation was found that a navigation assessment was conducted and no attempt by the captain to verify the tow was safe for the intended route.\nThe water under the bridge was higher than average, with clearance at about 153 feet instead of the normal 160 feet. However, it did not matter because the analysis showed the boom was at approximately 62 degrees, which equated to a height of 162.3 feet. The report says the boom needed to be at about 55 degrees to pass under the bridge at the center of the channel. The visual evaluation also underestimated the length of the boom by 20 feet. The NTSB reports the boom was 10 feet too high for clearance.\nThe erroneous estimates provided by the managers set off the chain of events. However, the captain, who was responsible for ensuring the safety of the transit, did not confirm the boom height, nor was there an attempt to verify the bridge’s vertical clearance."

        "content": "Oil major Shell is continuing to reduce its involvement in renewable energy and offshore wind including effectively ending its involvement with the U.S. offshore wind energy sector. Buried within today’s year-end 2024 financial report is a note that results include impairment charges of more than $1 billion “mainly relating to renewable generation assets in North America.”\nThe company has been moving away from its previous push into renewables as part of a strategy that CEO Wael Sawan described as “simplification” which is helping to deliver over $3 billion in cost cuts since 2022. Commented on renewable energy the company said it was “high grading its portfolio.”\nThe bulk of the $1.085 billion impairment charge is being taken in the fourth quarter ($996 million) and relates to the company’s decision to “pause” its involvement in a joint venture to develop New Jersey’s Atlantic Shores offshore wind project. Shell New Energies US and EDF-RE Offshore Development (a subsidiary of EDF Renewables) won U.S. federal approval in October 2024 for the construction plan for a two-stage project that would provide 2.8 MW of energy to New Jersey with up to nearly 200 turbines. The project was bid into New Jersey’s fourth round of wind solicitations.\n“We just don’t see that it fits both our capabilities nor the returns that we would like,” Shell’s Chief Financial Officer Sinead Gorman said in a call with reporters reports Bloomberg. “So we took the decision to effectively write that off and pause our involvement.”\nWhen the construction plan was approved it was highlighted the project would be the first offshore wind project in New Jersey. The lease dates to 2015 when it was awarded to US Wind and later transferred in 2018 to EDF and later into the joint venture with Shell. The project, which would be about 9 miles off the New Jersey shores near Atlantic City and Sea Girt, faced strong local opposition and was used by Donald Trump to highlight his disapproval of offshore wind.\nWhile opponents of the project hoped today's announcement would mark the end of the effort, Atlantic Shores issued a statement saying it intends to continue progressing New Jersey’s first offshore wind project and its portfolio in compliance with its obligations to local, state and federal partners under existing leases and relevant permits. Trump wrote online last week he hoped the project would be “dead and gone.” EDF did not comment, but Atlantic Shores wrote in its statement, \"Business plans, projects, portfolio projections and scopes evolve over time – and as expected for large, capital-intensive infrastructure projects like ours, our shareholders have always prepared long-term strategies that contemplate multiple scenarios that enable Atlantic Shores to reach its full potential.\"\nShell in March 2024 also announced it hadsold its 50 percent positionin SouthCoast Wind Energy to joint venture partner Ocean Winds North America as part of the realignment of its renewables portfolio. Shell had entered into the joint venture in 2018 for the project which was then known as Mayflower Wind. Ocean Winds has continued to pursue the project and BOEM recently approved the construction plan. It calls for an approximate capacity of 2.4 GW in a lease area about 30 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and 23 miles south of Nantucket, Massachusetts.  The project however has faced delays as it is still negotiating its power purchase agreements with Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\nShell's continued move away from renewable energy came as the company reported a 16 percent decline in profits for 2024. While raising its dividend, the company said operations were performing well but cited lower margins for LNG, lower oil and gas prices, lower demand, and weaker margins for its refinery operations. Earnings were $23.72 billion down from $28.25 billion in 2023 and the $1 billion impairment in renewables was part of a larger net impairment charge of $2.2 billion expected in the fourth quarter."

The project will be jointly developed by Ørsted in partnership with Poland’s largest power group, the state-controlled PGE.\n“With today’s announcement, we’re ready to build Baltica 2, a flagship project for offshore wind in Poland,” said Rasmus Errboe, Deputy CEO and Chief Commercial Officer for Ørsted. “We’re satisfied with the value creation of the project, which has an attractive risk-reward profile.”\nBaltica 2 will be located approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) off the Polish coast near Ustka, which is located west of Gdansk in central Poland. The project which will consist of 107 Siemens Gamesa 14 MW turbines, will have a capacity of 1.5 GW and is one of two planned by the partnership.\nThe companies highlighted that Poland’s energy policy singles out offshore wind to be developed until 2040 to be a key technology to make Poland a low-emission economy. Poland has committed to 5.9 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 11 GW by 2040.\n“The Baltica 2 offshore wind farm, the largest renewable energy project currently under development in the Baltic Sea, will diversify Poland’s energy production, enhance energy security, and provide cleaner and more affordable energy,” said Dariusz Marzec, CEO of PGE.\nHelping to support the financial case for the development, Baltica 2 has a 25-year inflation-protected contract for difference (CfD) in place with the Polish state. The initial price was set in 2021 and is being adjusted to inflation. The price per MWh will be annually adjusted to inflation. After the CfD ends, Baltica 2 will receive the market price for electricity or enter new power purchase agreements.\nAnnouncing that they had taken the final investment decision, the companies reported all major component and vessel contracts had been signed. The wind farm has obtained all permits and has signed a grid connection contract with the Polish transmission system operator PSE.\nA broad team of contractors has been aligned to implement the construction. It will be installed by Cadeler and Fred. Olsen Windcarrier, while Van Oord will be installing foundations and offshore substations."

One of the victims was a well-respected skipper with five decades of experience.\nAt about 2200 hours on Thursday night, the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax received an EPIRB signal from the 18-meter fishing vesselFortune Pride,located about 10 nautical miles southeast of her homeport of Sambro, Nova Scotia. The center mobilized two rescue vessels to the scene, along with a Cormorant SAR helicopter and a Hercules search plane. Conditions were difficult, including 12-foot swells, fog and rain.\nOne rescue vessel found three survivors on Thursday night, including one who was unconscious. They were evacuated to a hospital, and one later passed away.\nThe next morning, a helicopter aircrew found an additional crewmember in a life raft. The man was unresponsive when rescued and was later pronounced dead.\nOn Saturday, the owner of theFortune Pridereleased the names of the deceased: skipper John Allen Baker, a well-known and respected name in Atlantic Canada's fishing industry; and deckhand Phil MacInnis. The two other crewmembers have been released from the hospital and are in good physical health.\nAt the time of the capsizing,Fortune Pridewas reportedly carrying about 20 tonnes of silver hake and was standing by offshore. The owner's last contact with Baker was about an hour and a half before the sinking, and at the time, the skipper reported no issues; he was waiting for daylight to make the transit into port.\nCanada's Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the casualty. The owner has stressed that the vessel was in good material condition prior to the capsizing. \"It was a good, seaworthy, steel boat. That boat has been at sea for a long time,\" owner Jose Teixeira told the Canadian Press.\nBaker was a local legend in Nova Scotia's fisheries. He had five decades of experience on all types of fishing vessels, and his services as a skipper were in demand. He had survived a previous sinking in 2013: While he was serving as skipper aboard the fishing vesselGentle Lady,a heavy load of sea cucumber shifted in heavy swells. The crew fought to correct it, but the boat took on a port list, flooded and capsized. Baker and his crew abandoned ship into a liferaft and were adrift at sea for six hours before a Good Samaritan rescued them.\nAccording to local legend, Baker later recovered the wallet he had left inGentle Lady'swheelhouse in the rush to abandon ship. Four years later, it came up from the bottom while he was dragging for clams on another vessel."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Royal Caribbean Group which operates 66 ocean-going cruise ships announced today, January 28, that it will be entering the fast-growing river cruise segment through its upper premium brand Celebrity Cruises. The company was attracted to the river segment which it sees as highly fragmented by its strong growth rates, high return on invested capital, and profitability.\nCEO Jason Liberty told investors the expansion into river cruising was an exciting opportunity for guests and the company’s shareholders. Referencing the segment as a “complimentary high margin, high ROIC business,” he said it fits nicely within the portfolio. He noted that about half of their customers have experienced or intend to vacation on a river cruise presenting strong opportunities for cross-selling to customers not only of Celebrity Cruises but its other brands, Silversea Cruises, and Royal Caribbean International.\n“We see river cruising as an exciting growth opportunity that aligns with our strategy of turning the vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations, expanding our ecosystem of vacation offerings, and broadening our reach into adjacent lines of businesses,” said Liberty during the corporation’s earnings conference call today.\nWhile Celebrity becomes the first of the major brands to expand into river cruising, it is not a new strategy. Crystal Cruises under Genting Hong Kong’s ownership entered European river cruising. Viking started as a river cruise company and a decade ago expanded into ocean cruising and more recently expedition cruising. Analyst C. Patrick Scholes of Truist Securities noted today that Viking has “basically owned” the river cruise sector. Viking currently has 82 river cruise vessels mostly deployed in Europe and has plans to reach 93 river cruise ships by 2027.\nScholes said Truist’s initial take was that it would not be head-to-head competition between Viking and Celebrity. Viking, he notes is considered a luxury brand offering an inclusive product while Celebrity will likely have a different price point marketing to the broader, contemporary cruise segment. Liberty mentioned to investors the opportunities for add-on sales noting that river cruise passengers “spend a disproportionate amount of their time and money on travel.”\nFew details were provided on Celebrity Cruises’ plans for its new river operation. They said it would be launching in Europe in 2027 but CEO Jason Liberty referred to river cruising as a global segment. Ask by analysts, he said there were opportunities in many parts of the world.\nCelebrity reported an initial order of 10 “transformative” ships that it says would be innovative and elevate the river cruise experience. Speaking to the company’s customers in a video, Celebrity Cruises’ CEO Laura Hodges Bethge alluded to expansive views with large glass windows, innovative open deck spaces, and elevated design features. Royal Caribbean also referenced sustainable technologies, reimagined onboard and shore experiences “that raises the bar for river cruising.”\nReports indicate the initial order for the 10 river cruise ships went to the Netherlands’ TeamCo. The shipyard’s website shows 16 river cruise ships delivered over the past decade and most recently in 2024 to Amadeus. The size of river cruise ships varies based on the limitations of the rivers but the ships traditionally accommodate 150 to 200 passengers. Scholes estimates each ship will cost Celebrity $30 million for a total shipbuilding commitment announced today of $300 million.\nOn the investor conference call, Royal Caribbean Group said its plan is for delivery of “a couple of ships in 2027,” and then about four a year.\n“Our ambitions go far beyond that,” Liberty told investors. He said they were “very intentful,” in calling it an “initial order,” saying that river cruising “is not a hobby for us.” Based on shipyard capacity to build four vessels a year, Liberty said it was not likely that they would be waiting till 2027 to order more river cruise vessels.\nThe expansion in river cruising comes just days after Celebrity announced it had ordered a sixth large cruise ship of its Edge class from Chantiers de l’Atlantique. This year it will be introducing theCelebrity Xcel. Royal Caribbean International last year also ordered an Oasis class cruise ship from France and an additional Icon class cruise ship in Finland as well as options for up to two more ships. The group noted its newbuild pipeline currently includes a total of eight ships on order."

        "content": "\nThe Port of Brisbane, Australia is celebrating its decision to invest in a real cruise terminal after passenger movements at the Brisbane International Cruise Terminal (BICT) crossed the two million mark, a development that comes just two and half years after its opening.\nBICT, which was constructed at a cost of US$110 million, achieved the two-millionth-passenger milestone on Saturday after P&O Cruises Australia’sPacific Encountercalled at the port.\nThe call could be the last that the 2,600-vessel makes at its Brisbane homeport under thePacific Encountername. This is because the ship is set to be rebranded intoCarnival Encounterafter Carnival Corporation announced it was ending the P&O Cruises Australia brand in March 2025.\n“Carnival’s long-term partnership with the world-class BICT has helped in the success of Queensland’s growing cruise industry. As Carnival Cruise Line prepares for an exciting expansion in March, whenPacific Encounterjoins the CCL fleet asCarnival Encounter,we can’t wait to continue to deliver our guests unforgettable holidays from Brisbane, all year round,” said Peter Little, Carnival Corporation Country Manager.\nThe hitting of the two million passenger mark is a significant achievement for BICT, which was opened in June 2022 and is touted as a strategic asset in Queensland’s cruise tourism industry. The decision to build the terminal was approved in 2017, with construction completed in 2020. Its commercial opening was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nPrior to its construction, cruise ships longer than 270 meters had to call at the Port of Brisbane’s cargo terminals. This caused most cruise lines to bypass the city altogether, taking with them significant economic benefits. It is estimated that every time a vessel calls in Brisbane, it contributes around US$620,000 to the economy. Over the next decade, cruising is projected to contribute around US$700 million to the Queensland economy. During the 2024/25 season alone, the port expects to welcome over 150 cruise calls from 13 different cruise lines.\n“Achieving two million passenger movements through our world-class terminal highlights the integral role of BICT to Queensland’s cruise tourism industry,” said Neil Stephens, Port of Brisbane CEO."

The announcement includes metal imports from Mexico and Canada, the largest foreign suppliers for the American steel market.\nU.S. steelmakers stand to benefit from the announcement. Independent economists say tariffs will allow U.S. producers to raise prices, strengthening American steelmakers' balance sheets. The tariffs Trump imposed in his first term increased prices by nine percent and raised American steelmakers' earnings by $2.4 billion in 2018 alone,accordingto the Peterson Institute for International Economics. American steel consumers' costs increased by an estimated $5.6 billion during the same period, the institute estimated.\nShares in America's biggest steel producer, Nucor, have risen by 10 percent over the last month following news of tough tariff policies, and the company is supportive of Trump's approach. \"Nucor applauds the first steps taken by President Trump in his America first trade agenda,\" Nucor President Leon J. Topalian said in a statement last week. \"We look forward to working with President Trump to enforce our trade laws and strengthen American manufacturing!\"\nTrump's Sunday announcement was greeted with disapproval in Canada, which has the most to lose from higher import prices in the U.S. market. \"This is the next four years. Shifting goalposts and constant chaos, putting our economy at risk,\" responded Ontario Premier Doug Ford in a statement.\nOverall, more than $80 billion worth of steel and iron imports and nearly $30 billion worth of aluminum imports will be affected. If the metals tariffs are not reversed in negotiations, as occurred earlier this month with blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico, American shipbuilders will be among the steel users most affected by an increased cost of materials. The U.S. shipbuilding industry's biggest customer by value - the U.S. Navy - will likely see future newbuild and repair costs rise if tariffs take hold, according to defense analysts.\n\"Costs [for shipbuilding] are going to go even higher,\" said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the pro-business think tank American Enterprise Institute, speaking to Navy Times last month. \"Delays will get even longer. Nothing good is going to come from this for shipbuilding; it can only make a bad situation worse.\"\nTariffs are part of Trump's plans for a revival at U.S. Steel, the second-largest producer in the United States and a onetime icon of American industry. On Friday, Trump said he would block plans by Japanese giant Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel, as the Biden administration did in January. However, he said he would \"mediate and arbitrate\" a lesser investment by the Japanese firm. \"Tariffs are going to make [U.S. Steel] very successful. And I think it has good management,\" Trump said.\nSources close to U.S. Steel and Nippon Steeltoldthe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that executives at both firms were surprised by Trump's plans.\nThere may be additional tariffs coming soon: On Sunday, Trump briefly previewed a plan to impose reciprocal tariffs when other nations place duties on U.S. goods. \"It won't affect everybody, because there are some where we have similar tariffs, but the ones that are taking advantage of the United States, we're going to have a reciprocity,\" he said."

        "content": "An inadequate anchoring operation and failure to use available charts to identify depths and a charted rock led to the loss of a cargo vessel operating in the U.S. Virgin Islands reports the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The bureau issued a report highlighting a series of errors during a storm that contributed to the total constructive loss of a small cargo vessel valued at $1.5 million and aheroic actionby the U.S. Coast Guard to rescue 12 people from the stranded ship.\nThe cargo vesselBonnie G(780 gross tons), built in 1981, stranded on the rocks off St. Thomas in the USVI on October 4, 2023, while it was waiting out bad weather which had prevented it from docking. The ship, which had been built as an offshore supply vessel for the Gulf of Mexico oil platforms, had been converted in 2020 to cargo operations. It was sailing between San Juan, St. Thomas, St. Croix, and other local islands in the Caribbean. It was 172 feet long and registered in Vanuatu.\nThe cargo ship loaded in St. Croix with six passenger vehicles, an industrial truck, a trailer, scissor lift, a refrigerated container with fruits and vegetables, and other cargo ranging from beer and whiskey to medical supplies and books. It departed St. Croix with 12 people aboard at 1550 for an anticipated 7.5-hour trip to St. Thomas.\nThe captain told NTSB that he was aware that there was a tropical storm to the north and consulted weather reports. There was a small craft advisory and a forecast of winds 10-15 knots with gusts to 25 knots and seas up to 9 feet. The captain determined the weather was “acceptable” and decided to get underway.\nWhen they reached Red Point on St. Thomas around midnight, the weather had deteriorated and the port advised that a barge had broken away from its mooring and was partially blocking the dock for theBonnie G. The captain decided to anchor to wait out the storm. He told the investigators he through the area was maybe 23 to 26 feet deep, so he ordered 135 feet of chain and set a watch and alarms before leaving the bridge.\nAn able-bodied seafarer was on watch and at 0120 the captain returned to bridge after hearing a nose. Saying that everything appeared “normal” the captain left the bridge, but at 0300 the AB alerted the captain the vessel was drifting. The AB was ordered to heave the anchor as the captain planned to get underway, but the AB reported back the anchor chain had parted. Minutes later moving at 0.8 knots theBonnie Gran aground on a rock.\nUnable to get the vessel free, the captain told the USCG that they needed to abandon ship. The USCG crew reported conditions were a sustained 24 knot wind, gusting to 33 knots, and seas 4 to 8 feet with less than 1 mile of visibility. They were able to recover the people from theBonnie G.\nTheBonnie Gremained on the rocks and was latersalvagedby DonJon-SMIT. It had flooded and had extensive damage leading to it being declared a loss.\nNTSB cites a series of errors. They believe the captain made an erroneous assessment of the water depth which was actually 68 feet where he attempted to anchor not the 23 to 26 he assumed. He did not check charts available in the vessel and “an inadequate scope of chain” was deployed when anchoring. NTSB believes that led to the anchor chain parting.\n“When anchoring a vessel, a length of anchor chain that is five to seven times the water depth (scope, or ratio of anchor chain to water depth) should be used; even more anchor chain should be used in adverse weather,” the report said.\nGetting underway, NTSB reports the captain also did not use the available onboard navigational chart to identify a rock nearby, and when maneuvering after the anchor chain failed, he inadvertently steered directly onto the rock and grounded the vessel. As a result, the hull was breached just forward of the engine room.\nThe chief engineer told NTSB he was in the engine room and saw the flooding and became fearful. NTSB reports the forward watertight door in the engine room of theBonnie Gwas open and not secured before the crew abandoned the vessel. Investigators determined that had the watertight door been shut as required, it is likely that progressive flooding of the engine room and aft spaces would not have occurred, limiting vessel damage.\nNTSB concludes the report warning when anchoring, mariners should review navigational charts and other sources to become familiar with nearby hazards. The heavy weather conditions increased the risk and the potential of having to get underway on short notice."

        "content": "\nHapag-Lloyd released preliminary financial results for 2024 coming in at the top of the profitability forecasts the company had already revised upward in October 2024. As the first of the major carriers to release results it also gives a glimpse into the financial strength of the sector despite what was seen as a very challenging year.\nThe preliminary figures show an anticipated quadrupling of earnings in the fourth quarter from a nearly breakeven level in 2023 to a profit of $1.4 billion in the December quarter of 2024. For the full year, the company is anticipating a slight year-over-year increase in profitability to $5 billion (EBITDA). Revenues for the full year are projected to be up more than 8 percent to $20.7 billion.\n“The increases can primarily be attributed to higher transport volumes combined with a stable average freight rate, which stood at $1,492/TEU and thereby remained at the prior-year level (2023: $1,500/TEU),” said Hapag in its release. It reported that revenues rose, “particularly owing to stronger demand for container transports. Transport volumes increased by roughly 5 percent, to 12.5 million TEU – despite the rerouting of ships via the Cape of Good Hope due to the security situation in the Red Sea and the associated longer voyage times.”\nIn October 2024, Hapag reported that based on recent higher-than-expected demand and improved freight rates – and despite increased transport expenses – it was increasing its forecast for the year to EBITDA in the range of $4.6 to $5.0 billion. It however had warned, “Given the highly volatile development of freight rates and persistent major geopolitical challenges, this forecast remains subject to uncertainty.”\nThe company said it would announce its 2024 results on March 20. At the same time, it will comment on the outlook for the year ahead and release its projections.\nAnalysts have speculated that the industry could face strong challenges in 2025 as freight rates are already under pressure and potentially could collapse when the Red Sea routes are restored. Excess capacity that was helping to offset the longer transit times around Africa would flood back into the market with the Red Sea routes restored while there are also fears about fundamental changes in trade patterns if Donald Trump proceeds with his threats to impose tariffs.\nInvestors, however, today drove the price of Hapag-Lloyd’s shares up by nearly 1.5 percent while others such as Maersk and NYK were up nearly 2 percent. Share prices for the container segment were under pressure for all of 2024 as investors heard repeated cautions from industry executives over the volatility in the sector."

        "content": "\nAnother of the last survivors from the second generation of the modern cruise ship era and a pioneer for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line has quietly slipped away on her final voyage. Introduced in 1982 as theSong of America(37,500 gross tons), she was one of the largest cruise ships in the world and an innovator that would see 40 years of service first in the American market, later in Europe, and finally in the Greek Islands.\nShe had been retired in 2023 by her last owner, Greece’s Celesytal Cruises which had operated her for 11 years with her final name ofCelestyal Olympia. She was sold in early 2024 to a flag of convenience company which renamed herBella Fortunaand shortly after she departed for an anchorage off the UAE flying the flag of Liberia. It is often a way stop on a one-way trip to be recycled while getting the ships outside the European Union and the restrictions on licensed scrappers.\nAs of the first of the year, the cruise ship’s name was shortened toFortuand her flag moved to Comoros. She departed the UAE on January 22 with her status listed in the databases as “to be broken up.” She is bound it appears to beaches of India’s infamous Alang.\nWhen she was introduced in 1982, Royal Caribbean boasted that she was state-of-the-art. In the first preview brochure for consumers released in 1981, they wrote, “Every innovative maritime feature, every one of ‘tomorrow’s’ cruise concepts, will be part ofSong of Americatoday.” The company had gone into business a decade earlier the brainchild of an American entrepreneur Edwin Stephan with investments from Norway’s Wilhelmsen and I. M. Skaugen, and later Gotaas-Larsen. Thefirst shipswere 18,500 gross tons and embodied Stephan’s vision of “propelled hotels.”\n\n\nRoyal Caribbean first two generations: Nordic Prince (left) after the 1980 stretch and Song of America (right) (Allan Jordan photo)\n\nRoyal Caribbean was growing rapidly like all the cruise lines in the 1970s but had fallen behind Carnival Cruise Lines which converted a liner into the 38,000 gross tonFestivaleand Norwegian Caribbean Lines which converted the superlinerFrance, the longest passenger ship in the world, into the 70,000 gross ton ssNorway. First to increase capacity, Royal Caribbean stretched two of its ships but instead of rebuilding its third smaller ship, turned to the famed Wartsila shipyard in Finland to build what becameSong of America.\nThe new ship was 705 feet in length with accommodations for 1,400 passengers and 500 crew. Externally she was sleek and advanced designs including taking the cantilevered lounge on the ship’s funnel by making it larger, with an interior entrance and elevator, and wrapped fully around the funnel. She used the design concept of “vertical separation” that places the public spaces and lounges aft and cabins mostly forward. She also innovated with a half (tween) deck of cabins in front of the extra-height main lounges. Passenger cabins however were still the small, standardized box Stephan had envisioned to encourage passengers to spend their time on deck or in the bars and lounges. (There was no casino in 1982, only a handful of slot machines placed in a discreet hallway.)\nKeeping with a Royal Caribbean style her public spaces were all named from Broadway shows. The lounges were Can Can, Oklahoma, and Guys and Dolls, while the dining room was Madame Butterfly. She took over the “milk run” as the weekly cruises from Miami to Nassau, San Juan, and St. Thomas were known and was an instant success due to her comforts.Song of Americawas part of the second generation of modern cruise ships all of which were around 40,000 gross tons and had accommodations for 1,000 or more passengers. They were larger than the first generation introduced in the late 1960s and provided a stepping stone to larger and finally the mega cruise ships of today.\nThe ship was christened by renowned American opera singer Beverly Sills, and on her maiden voyage the passenger list included former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalyn. Just six years later,Song of Americawould be eclipsed by Royal Caribbean’s new 70,000 gross tonSovereign of the Seas, but she remained a workhorse for the company. She was also among the company’s first ships to homeport beyond Miami.\n\n\nRemarkably unchanged she spent her last decade in the Greek islands as Celestyal Olympia (Celestyal Cruises)\n\nSong of Americaleft Royal Caribbean after just 17 years. She went to a UK operator and was renamedSun Bird. She helped to build the UK market before being sold to the Cypriot firm Louis Cruises. Instead, she would sail on charter to another British firm Thomson Holidays as theThomson Destiny. As part of the TUI family, Thomson evolved into Marella Cruises but before the transition seeking to modernize the fleet the now 30-year-old cruise ship was returned to her owners. She became theLouis Olympiaand laterCelestyal Olympiawhen the company was rebranded. She cruised the Greek Islands in the summer and spent winters in layup.\nRemarkably unchanged since her introduction in 1982, she was finally retired late in 2023. She had outlived most of the second and even the third generation of modern purpose-built cruise ships. With her goes the link to the heady days of growth, but before cruise ships had water slides and water parks or any of the modern amusements. Passengers lounged in the sun by day, saw a floor show or a movie in the evening, and enjoyed their time at sea. She was a pioneer and then a throwback to the simpler, earlier days of cruising.\nPost script: The former MV Song of America beached in Alang, India on February 1, 2025."

In a newly released audit, the GAO finds issues with record keeping, alignment with national security considerations, and efforts to ensure the competencies needed to address cybersecurity risks.\nAware of cyber dangers and the continuing concerns raised in Congress and elsewhere about Chinese-made cargo cranes, the Biden administration in 2024 directed the Coast Guard to take steps to enhance cybersecurity and reporting especially from ports. USCG released in January 2025updated rulesfor cybersecurity in the marine transportation system.\nThe FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act included a provision for the GAO to review cybersecurity risks to the maritime transport system, including vessels and facilities. GAO reports it analyzed data on cybersecurity risks, statutes and regulations, and the Coast Guard documentation and inspection data from 2019 through June 2024. Based on its findings, the GAO is making five recommendations to be addressed by the USCG command.\nThe report highlights that owners and operators of U.S. maritime facilities and vessels rely on systems that are connected to internal and external networks and that they face heightened cybersecurity risks. They note that ports have been affected by cyber incidents and that the potential impacts of future incidents could be severe.\n“The Coast Guard provided guidance for and inspects facilities and vessels that are subject to cybersecurity-related requirements,” they write in the report. “But it can’t readily access complete information on these inspection results – which can make oversight harder.”\nThe GAO found that the Coast Guard cannot readily access complete information on inspection results specific to cybersecurity from its system of records. They recommend updating the system to provide ready access to complete information on all cybersecurity-related deficiencies. GAO says this would provide better oversight and position the service to prevent cyberattacks.\nThey also concluded the USCG cyber strategy did not fully address all the key characteristics needed for an effective national strategy. Other issues included not fully addressing leading practices to ensure its cyber workforce has the competencies needed to address risks. They write that the USCG has not fully assessed and addressed competency gaps for its cyber workforce.\nTheGAO reportdetails its five recommendations to address these issues within USCG. They also note that the Department of Homeland Security, of which USCG has been a part since 2003, concurred with GAO's cybersecurity recommendations."

        "content": "\nAn industry collaboration known as the Safetytech Accelerate reports its latest round of supported feasibility studies has shown strong potential to cut fugitive methane emissions in the maritime industry. They report after the successful studies efforts are now underway to advance these research projects to on-ship trials as soon as possible.\nFugitive emissions happen across the LNG supply chain ranging from loading to engine delivery. While short-lived they represent another source of harmful unburnt methane entering the environment in addition to the more widely discussed methane slip where unburnt methane enters the exhaust during the combustion problem.\nThe Safetytech Accelerator launched its flagship Methane Abatement Maritime Innovation Initiative (MAMII) in September 2022 bringing together industry leaders, technology innovators, and maritime stakeholders with a focus on measuring and mitigating methane emissions in the maritime sector and also seeks to promote the adoption of solutions to reduce and eliminate methane emissions. This latest effort involved industry leaders Chevron, Carnival Corporation, Shell, and Seapeak as well as three technology supplies.\nThe group reports that identifying, quantifying, and mitigating fugitive emissions is another element of the effort. It says that it is another essential element to achieve industry-wide decarbonization goals.\nThree companies and their technologies were the focus of the completed technology feasibility studies. Xplorobot which provides handheld devices and an AI-powered platform to detect and measure fugitive emissions studied the warm side of the gas fuel line evaluating the efficacy of the technology in detecting and quantifying methane emissions. For this technology, the next step is to deploy the kit in the field to further validate and optimize the technology.\nA second study explored acoustic cameras from Sorama evaluating the viability for monitoring on LNG carriers. Strategically placed and handheld cameras detect the emissions by visualizing sound and vibration fields in 3D. A six-month pilot scoped the use of four fixed cameras aboard. They believe it demonstrated a capability to quickly identify the source of emissions and would provide a cost-effective option for ship operators.\nFramergy studied its technology which would be used to store and purify methane to significantly reduce emissions during planned and unplanned venting events. The methane would be captured and stored at a lower pressure than conventional methods using the company’s filtering membrane made of a metal-organic framework material. Captured methane has the possibility of reuse or sale.\nThe Safetytech Accelerator reports the three studies show the potential to detect, measure, and mitigate methane emissions on LNG-powered ships. While methane slip – the unburnt release of methane during combustion – remains the largest source of methane emissions, they believe this work adds another critical element to the overall effort addressing methane emissions. The group is also supporting efforts to reduce emissions from engine exhausts.\nThe Anchor Partners for the MAMII effort total more than 20 leading shipping and energy companies. Beyond the four companies that participated in these studies, others working with the effort include MSC, Lloyd’s Register, GTT, NYK, Mitsui O.S.K., CMA CGM, and others."

        "content": "\nEU nations are working out new ways to interdict the Russian \"shadow fleet\" of aging tankers in the Baltic, four diplomatic sources have informed Politico. The effort includes new legislation that would codify protocols into law.\nEU members have grown concerned about the risks posed by the anonymously-owned, questionably-insured Aframaxes and Suezmaxes that serve Russian oil terminals in the Baltic Sea. These vessels lift oil that is priced above the G7 \"cap\" on tanker services, and are flagged, owned, insured and classed using non-Western service providers. Many have extensive lists of inspection deficiencies, and many more are near (or past) the standard 20-year retirement age of a crude oil tanker.\nIn addition, four separate anchor-drag incidents severed subsea cables between NATO nations in the Baltic over the last year, and one involved a shadow fleet tanker. The damage has raised concerns that Russian intelligence agencies may be paying vessel crews to carry out intentional, hard-to-prove \"hybrid\" attacks on subsea infrastructure.\nOfficials told Politico that EU nations are assembling the legal framework for a more forceful response after incidents like these. The objective would be to seize the offending vessel quickly; the legal rationale could be environmental protection or counter-piracy operations, the diplomats said. If necessary, national laws could be enacted to justify action against poorly-insured vessels - though any direct interference with ships outside the 12-nautical-mile line would have to contend with UNCLOS' provisions for freedom of navigation in international waters.\n\"We cannot block all the sea, but we can control more,\" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told Politico. \"There are lots of opportunities.\"\nCovert options are also possible. On Sunday, the aging tankerKoalawas preparing to depart the Russian port of Ust-Luga when she suffered a series of engine room explosions. Three separate blasts were reported as the vessel was preparing to depart, according to the security services-linked account Baza. According to the regional governor of Leningrad, the explosions were a \"man-made incident,\" and the tanker remains afloat and securely moored at the pier.\nMultiple Russian sources reported Monday that three holes have been found inKoala'shull near the engine room, thanks to a mini-ROV inspection of the exterior. Russian security services believe that the tanker may have been mined, Baza reports. No explosives have been found aboard, but security services are inspecting the interior of the vessel with K9 teams and a thorough ROV survey continues.\n"

The payments were made through a Swiss contractor - a former employee who only did business with Trafigura and was known as \"Mr. Non-Compliant,\" prosecutors said.\nOver the course of the Angolan chartering and bunkering contracts, the arrangement netted Trafigura $144 million in profits - a return of nearly 3,000 percent on the $5 million bribe.\nTrafigura denied wrongdoing, but prosecutors showed the court an extensive collection of memos and emails detailing the network of shell companies used to route the payments. Ultimately the court found Trafigura guilty and sentenced the firm to pay about $150 million in fines and compensation - nullifying its profit from the contracts.\nFormer COO Mike Wainwright was also convicted of orchestrating the corrupt scheme, and was sentenced to 32 months in prison (including at least 12 months before probation). He plans to appeal, and that process will place the sentence on hold.\n\"The court found Mr. Wainwright guilty based on general assumptions and disregarded key evidence that shows he was not involved in any bribery scheme,\" Wainwright's lawyer said in a statement.\nThe Angolan official and one other individual were also found guilty, but were not named due to Swiss privacy rules."

(Outgoing HII Newport News President Jennifer Boykin emphasized that HII had not bought W International as a legal entity - just its plant and equipment.)\n500 employees were invited to stay on under HII's management at the newly-renamed plant, now known as Newport News Shipbuilding - Charleston Operations. 99 percent of them accepted the offer, HII said in a statement Monday.\nHII now plans to grow the site and use it to build modules for its own submarine construction pipeline. As the plant gets rolling, HII plans to create hundreds of additional jobs in the area.\n\"HII is committed to going where the labor is to increase shipbuilding capacity,\" HII President and CEO Chris Kastner said in a statement. \"This lets us efficiently add trained talent and state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities to the urgent job of building ships, making it a unique opportunity to immediately accelerate throughput at Newport News Shipbuilding.\""

        "content": "\nFincantieri and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings have completed a strategic cruise ship newbuild order that will add four of the largest cruise ships in the industry to Norwegian Cruise Lines. A letter of Intent for the ships was first announced in April 2024 with Reuters reporting today the finalized order is being valued at approximately $9.34 billion for the vessels to deliver between 2030 and 2036.\nNorwegian’s CEO Harry Sommer explained the order as a long-term growth strategy for the brand and reserving critical construction slots. He said it would be a new class of cruise ship that expands on the company’s strategies while also setting new standards for innovation, luxury, and sustainability. It was part of a larger corporate strategy that also ordered two ships for the company’s ultra-luxury Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand and two additional vessels for the premium brand Oceania Cruises.\nThe four cruise ships for the company’s namesake contemporary segment brand have increased approximately 20 percent in size from the original announcement and will rival the largest cruise ships ever built in Italy and by Fincantieri. The four ships for Norwegian Cruise Line are now reported to be approximately 226,000 gross tons with 5,100 lower berths and a total occupancy including crew of over 8,300 people.\nNorwegian has lagged behind the other major cruise brands (Royal Caribbean International, Carnival Cruise Line, and MSC Cruises) in the size of ships. Norwegian’s current largest cruise ship is theNorwegian Encoredelivered from Meyer Werft in 2019 at 169,000 gross tons and a capacity of just under 4,000 passengers. Norwegian’s largest capacity cruise ship is theNorwegian Escape(4,200 passengers) introduced in 2015, but the brand adjusted its strategy to focus on a more spacious design.\nThe new contract expands the relationship with Fincantieri which is also building the innovativeNorwegian Primaclass which started as a smaller, more luxurious large ship design with accommodations for 3,100 passengers each on theNorwegian Prima(2022) andNorwegian Viva(2023). Norwegian expanded the third and fourth ships of the class,Norwegian Aqua(2025) and Norwegian Luna (2026), by 10 percent to 156,300 gross tons and 3,500 passengers. The fifth and sixth vessels of the class due in 2027 and 2028 will be further increased by 10 percent in size and built to be methanol-ready for future fuel.\nFincantieri said of today’s order its value “is considered very important.” The Italian shipbuilder recovered its cruise ship construction position after the pandemic and as of July 2024 had 27 cruise ship construction orders including yachts, luxury, and large vessels. It was part of a 96-ship backlog for the group valued as of July 2024 at over €41 billion ($42.7 billion) counting soft backlog (i.e. provisional orders).\nThe new cruise ships for Norwegian will be built at the company’s yard in Monfalcone, Italy with the first ship due in 2030. The sister ships will follow at two-year intervals in 2032, 2034, and 2036.\nNorwegian’s new vessels will rival an order placed by Carnival Corporation with Fincantieri in July 2024 for three 230,000 gross ton cruise ships for Carnival Cruise Line. Those ships were reported each at 230,000 gross tons with over 3,000 passenger cabins and a capacity of approximately 8,000 passengers. Carnival’s first ship is due in 2029 followed by deliveries in 2031 and 2033. The Industry’s largest cruise ship, however, will be the Star of the Seas due to enter service for Royal Caribbean International this summer at approximately 250,000 gross tons and 5,600 passengers (double occupancy).\nCurrently, the largest cruise ship built in Italy, by Fincantieri, is theSun Princessfor Carnival Corporation’s Princess Cruises. Delivered in 2024, the ship is 177,882 gross tons with accommodations for approximately 4,300 passengers. She will be joined by a sister shipStar Princessin October 2025.\nWith Norwegian finalizing its order, each of the four large cruise brands has placed significant additional large ship orders over the past 12 months. Analysts note that the industry has been capacity constrained since the restart after the pandemic, with demand outpacing the addition of new berths. The investments in new ships are seen as a further demonstration of the corporation’s confidence in the future growth of the cruise industry."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "As the offshore wind energy sector continues to evolve, operators especially in the maintenance and operations phase are faced with the challenges of lowering costs and increasing efficiency.  Norway’s Ulstein has developed a new hybrid design for a smaller service vessel that they believe fills a critical gap in the market and reduces costs for the operations of the wind farms.\nWhile the world needs more renewable energy sources, costs continue to be a significant challenge for offshore wind. To achieve financial viability, developers have been looking to larger projects, but Ulstein focused on an approach with could lower CAPEX by 50 percent, operating costs, and contribute to making smaller, closer-to-shore wind farms more economical for the developers.\nCurrently, they point out the walk-to-work sector relies mostly on the larger Service Operation Vessels (SOV) which can stay onsite for an extended period and typically accommodate up to 100 people. Day projects are supported by the crew transfer vessels.\n\n\nSmaller SOV fills a gap in the market and offers 50 percent lower CAPEX and OPEX (Ulstein)\n\nUlstein’s proposal for the SX250 is a vessel that can bridge the gap between CTVs and the current large SOVs. Its smaller vessel would measure approximately 47 meters (154 feet) and provide accommodations for 32 to 40 individuals. It would have a top operating speed of 10 knots and use the designer’s Twin X-Stern to enhance seakeeping capabilities.\nAccording to the company, the vessel would be suited for sea conditions up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) and best for small to mid-sized wind farms located in areas with calm or moderate sea states. These could be closer or shore or in shallow waters.\nAnother concept is for the smaller SOVs to work in unison with the larger vessels. According to Ulstein, two of three of the SX250 could be managing smaller jobs at the wind farm while the traditional, larger SOV focuses on the larger tasks.\nThe new vessel concept Ulstein says relies on existing off-the-shelf hardware and technology to ensure effective walk-to-work operations while reducing CAPEX and OPEX. The vessel can be customized with different arrangements and topside equipment and depending on the operational needs, various setups such as a gangway system, a daughter craft, deck storage, or a work or observation ROV.\nFilling the perceived gap in the market Ulstein says provides a unique opportunity to lower CAPEX and OPEX by up to 50 percent versus the current vessels. As a smaller vessel, it also contributed toward the push toward sustainable operations and presents a unique new solution to support the broader building out of the offshore wind sector.\n"

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nLast week, Taiwan reported peak wind production levels with presence of a strong northeast monsoon off its coast. The state-owned utility company Taipower said that wind power generation started to rise on Thursday, surpassing 3.1 GW by early hours of Friday morning. This record output accounted to 10 percent of the total electricity generation in Taiwan.\nThe peak production is a positive outcome as Taiwan doubles-down on investments in the offshore wind sector. In January, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MoEA) issued an updated plan for the renewable energy, targeting to install 8.2 GW of solar and offshore wind by the end of 2026. This will see renewable energy account for 20 percent of electricity generation by 2026.\nIn addition, Taipower reported on the steady growth in Taiwan’s wind power generation. The output has rose from around 3 billion kilowatt-hours in 2022 reaching nearly 10 billion kWh last year. These levels of wind power are helping Taiwan meet peak electricity demand during the evening hours while solar power provides a stable output during the day.\nOne of Taiwan’s largest offshore wind farms, the Yunlin project, entered operation last week. The Yunlin wind farm is now producing clean energy at its design capacity of 640 MW. It is located in the Taiwan Strait, between 5 and 11 miles off the west coast of Taiwan, and comprises 80 wind turbines connected to two onshore substations in Yunlin County. The development and operation of the wind farm is led by a consortium comprising Skyborn Renewables, TotalEnergies, EGCO Group and Sojitz Corp.\n“We are pleased with the completion of the Yunlin offshore wind farm. This project realized with our partners will help Taiwan reach its 2025 target of 5.7 GW of offshore wind power,” said Olivier Jouny, Senior Vice President Renewables at TotalEnergies."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nExcitement over the impending departure of the famed ocean liner ssUnited Stateswas building last week before a further delay appeared prolonging her stay in Philadelphia. The new owners of the liner, Florida's Okaloosa County, have been trying for months to start the final voyage of the now 75-year-old liner as she heads toward a new chapter as the largest artificial reef.\nOn Wednesday, February 5, Okaloosa County announced that after months of delay, it had finally received all the necessary approvals for a large ship dead tow as defined by the U.S. Coast Guard. At high tide around 0600 on Thursday, February 6, the plan was to yank the 53,000 gross ton liner from Pier 82 where she has been docked since July 1986 after the vessel returned from having been stripped of her interior fittings in Turkey and Ukraine.\nThe ssUnited Statesdespite having been out of service since 1969 remains fabled in the annals of shipping history. Design by American’s renowned naval architect William Francis Gibbs, she entered service in 1952. On her maiden voyage, she shattered the Atlantic speed record for a passenger liner with an average speed of over 35 knots and 72 years later remains the fastest passenger liner to have ever crossed the Atlantic. The liner is rumored to have touched 40 knots during her “top secret” speed trials.\nThe non-profit SS United States Conservancy, which acquired the ship in 2011 and sold her to Okaloosa County in October last year for $1 million, wrote in an announcement, “After completing comprehensive due diligence involving extensive testing and reporting to local, state, and federal agencies, Okaloosa County has now received final approval from the U.S. Coast Guard to begin moving the ssUnited States.”\nThe delays had centered on concerns from the U.S. Coast Guard to ensure a proper dead ship tow plan was in place for the nearly 1,000-foot liner. The review included safety precautions and planning for the tow as well as questions regarding the stability, appropriate amount of ballast, and the structural integrity of the vessel.\nThe first step of the complicated tow plan calls for a lateral move from the north side of Pier 82 to the south side of Pier 80. That would ensure she was floating freely, and final preparations would be completed for the next phase which starts her final trip with her next stop in Mobile, Alabama.\n\n\nThe liner's first move will be lateral from Pier 82 to Pier 80 before being moved into the Delaware River (Allan Jordan photo)\n\nThe departure from Philadelphia was scheduled for February 8, which in an odd quirk of fate is 75 years to the day from when her keel was laid in the dry dock at New Port News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. Tugboats were to maneuver the ssUnited Statesfrom Pier 80 into the Delaware River at approximately 0330. She was due to proceed downriver during low tide at approximately 0430. Complicating the maneuver are the roadway bridges passing over the river (Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322), and the Delaware Memorial Bridge (I-295) along her route. The Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) has determined it will suspend traffic on the bridges as the liner passes underneath. On at least one of the bridges, the liner’s funnels and mast only have a few feet of clearance to the underside of the bridge. Near the mouth of the Delaware River, she will be secured to an ocean-going lead tug for the trip to Alabama.\nFirst, it was announced that the lateral move was delayed to the second high tide of the day at approximately 2020 on Thursday, February 6. Then, during a last-minute meeting with the U.S. Coast Guard and others, further questions arose related to the towing of the vessel.\n“Plans to move the ssUnited Statesfrom Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Mobile, Alabama, have been delayed due to follow-up details requested by the U.S. Coast Guard to ensure a proper tow from Pier 82 to Pier 80. Because of the delay of the pier transition, the departure tow out of Philadelphia originally planned for February 8 has been delayed. A new date has not been set for departure,” the Conservancy announced in a follow-up posting on social media.\nThe Conservancy added that it understands the frustrations brought about by the continuous delays of the vessel’s voyage and called for more patience. The delay is indefinite with no target date announced for the next attempt to move the liner.\nOkaloosa County has estimated it will be a two-week journey for the liner to reach Mobile, Alabama. Upon arrival, the vessel will undergo an extensive remediation removing oil from her fuel tanks and other contaminants. Her iconic profile will be lost as her two massive funnels and her radar mast are to be dismantled and all the windows removed. There are also plans for unspecified modifications to ensure that when the vessel is deployed, it will land upright underwater. The preparation processes are anticipated to take about 12 months.\nOkaloosa County highlights that the exact location along the Gulf Coast where the ssUnited Stateswill be deployed as an artificial reef has not been set. It is expected to be about 20 nautical miles south of the Destin-Fort Walton Beach area.\n“As the world’s largest artificial reef, the story of the ssUnited Stateswill be told to thousands of divers from around the world as they explore her unique design and features. She will also benefit her surrounding ecosystem and become home to countless marine species that will thrive from the presence of her structure,” said Okaloosa County.\nThe County added that due to her size and the depth, the vessel will be home to a wide variety of marine life from iconic reef fish such as red snapper to pelagic species of fish like wahoo. The County is also helping the Conservancy with plans to establish an on-shore visitor’s center and museum dedicated to the liner and American design."

NamedAsuka III, she is part of a wave of expansion for the Japanese cruise market.\nThe new NYK cruise ship left the building hall on Saturday, January 18, and is now alongside the fitting-out berth. Coming out of the hall, the 52,250 gross ton cruise ship paused so that its funnel could be placed aboard. As is typical, the ship which is approximately 755 feet (230 meters) in length is also at maximum height in the hall and requires the additional clearance outside the hall for the funnel to be fitted.\n\n\nFunnel placed after the cruise ship is floated out (Meyer Werft)\n\nThe cruise ship, which is powered by LNG, was ordered in March 2021 making her the first large cruise ship ordered after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Steel cutting began in September 2023. The first block which weighed 345 tonnes and was 80 feet (24.6 meters) long was placed in the dry dock in December 2023 to begin assembly of the new cruise ship.\nNYK has a long heritage in passenger shipping and has maintained cruise operations for the Japanese market with a series of newly built cruise ships. The firstAsuka(built in 1991) was sold and replaced with the currentAsuka II(built in 1990) which was originally operated by NYK’s American cruise company Crystal Cruises. She was transferred to Japan in 2006.\nThe new cruise ship is also unique in that it is not being built in Japan, unlike her predecessors. NYK opted to tap the expertise of Meyer with cruise ships, but the yard notes the vessel is being uniquely outfitted for the Japanese market. It has 385 passenger cabins and will accommodate approximately 740 passengers with a crew of 470. Among these elements tailored to the Japanese market is a spa that includes a Japanese-style open-air bath. The ship also features large, luxury suites, and will offer a variety of dining and entertainment options.\n\n\nRendering of the completed Asuka III (NYK)\n\nTheAsuka IIIis expected to make her conveyance to the North Sea in the spring. Delivery is currently scheduled for the summer with the ship operating a delivery cruise from Germany to Japan. She will be homeported in Yokohama.\nNYK is expanding its cruise offering maintaining the olderAsuka IIwhich also operates from Yokohama. She will continue to offer mostly shorter cruises in Japan whileAsuka IIIwill operate longer cruises, including NYK’s world cruise.\n\n\nMitsui doubled its cruise fleet with the purchase of a ship from Carnival Corp.'s Seabourn Cruises (MOL)\n\nMitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) is also expanding its offering in the cruise market as it seeks to diversify its operations. Built in 1990, MOL operates Nippon Maru (22,500 gross tons) in the Japanese cruise market.\nIn September 2024, it took delivery of theSeabourn Odysseyfrom Carnival Corporation’s Seabourn Cruises. In service since 2009, the ship was rechristenedMitsui Ocean Fuji(32,500 gross tons) and started service in December 2024 launching a new luxury cruise brand Mitsui Ocean Cruises that also plans to market internationally.

        "content": "\nHanwha Group through its shipbuilding and power systems divisions is partnering with energy technology company Baker Hughes to develop a new generation of small-size ammonia gas turbine engines. By using the proven design of gas turbines, the companies believe it will be possible to develop a new engine that can unlock the benefits of ammonia to provide carbon-free emissions in new applications including shipping.\nBaker Hughes offers a broad line of gas turbines ranging from 5.7MW to 130MW which it highlights cover virtually every application across the oil and gas value chain, and in other industries. Power plants, LNG, and pipeline transmission, the company reports have widely adopted its gas turbine products and now it looks to develop the new small-size ammonia turbine which will be suitable for marine applications as well as for onshore and offshore applications and electric generation and mechanical drive. Gas turbines were explored for several ships including cruise ships starting about 20 years ago, but many cruise lines moved away from them saying they are costly to operate.\nUnder the new partnership, Baker Hughes will work with the shipbuilding group Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Power Systems. They look to combine expertise for a new small-size turbine for ammonia applications that will leverage Baker Hughes’ small-size gas turbine technology and Hanwha’s ammonia combustion system.\nHanwha reports it has already tested successfully a proof-of-concept of the combustor, with 100 percent ammonia as the fuel gas, and Baker Hughes completed its initial turbine feasibility studies in 2024. The two companies target to complete the full engine test with ammonia by the end of 2027, after which the turbine (~16MW power range) will be commercially available for orders.\n\"This collaborative development of a low-carbon ammonia gas turbine will be a significant turning point in the global shipbuilding and shipping industry, accelerating the transition to eco-friendly fuel propulsion for ships,\" said Son Young-chang, vice president and head of Hanwha Ocean's Product Strategy Technology Institute.\nThe ammonia gas turbine to be developed through this collaboration will be based upon the proven, small-size turbine technology of Baker Hughes, and a newly-developed ammonia combustion system created by PSM, a US-based Hanwha subsidiary. The gas turbine will be capable of 100 percent ammonia combustion, and dual fuel operation with a natural gas and ammonia blend.\n“It is expected to be a game-changing technology for large ship owners, enabling a completely carbon-free mode of propulsion,” predicts Hanwha. The shipbuilding group looks to incorporate the ammonia gas turbine into its designs for LNG gas carriers and containerships which it expects to have available by 2028. Hanwha Power Systems and Hanwha Ocean obtained in September 2023 approval in principle from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) to apply ammonia gas turbines to LNG carriers.\nBaker Hughes reports that it is currently exploring how its small-size gas turbines can accelerate the transition from diesel motors to turbines powered by ammonia and hydrogen. In January 2024, the company announced the completion of the successful testing of the world’s first 100 percent hydrogen turbine, which is now commercially available and with orders under execution."

Expansion of the port’s facilities is proceeding with the soft opening of MSC Cruises’ new terminal at the eastern end of Dodge Island further expanding capacity and preparing the port for the entry into service of the next mega cruise ship.\nThe port handled a total of 10 cruise ships on Saturday, February 8. It was the first time the port had docked that number of cruise ships in one day and it ranged from the world’s largest cruise ship,Icon of the Seas, to multiple vessels from Norwegian Cruise Line, Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International, and other lines including Oceania Cruises, Virgin Voyages, and Holland America Line.\nAccording to the port they were expecting close to 68,000 passengers. The 10 cruise ships (Carnival Magic,Carnival Sunrise,Zaandam,MSC Seascape,Norwegian Escape,Norwegian Gem,Sirena,Icon of the Seas,Independence of the Seas, andScarlet Lady) have a double occupancy capacity of approximately 32,000 passengers and a total capacity of approximately 38,000 passengers (excluding crew). The port counts embarking and disembarking passengers separately for the total number of people passing through its facilities in a single day.\nIt comes as PortMiami roared back into first place in the cruise industry handling 8,233,056 passengers in FY2024. Miami has been the largest homeport for years but briefly was eclipsed by Port Canaveral, Florida during the restart from the pandemic.\nPreviously, PortMiami had handled eight cruise ships in a day and set a passenger record at approximately 67,500 people in a day. A December 2023 day that had the potential to see 70,000 passengers was disrupted by bad weather. However, the port’s expansion continues.\n“PortMiami is the departure choice for all major cruise lines,” said Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. “It is no surprise PortMiami and the cruise industry continue to break records.”\n\n\nMSC Seascape was the first cruise ship to use the new $360 million Terminal AA (MSC Cruises)\n\nTheMSC Seascapebecame the first cruise ship to dock at the new Terminal AA this weekend with the official opening for the terminal scheduled for next month. Ceremonies are set for March 6, but the 4,500-passenger cruise ship kicked off the operation this weekend.\nMSC Cruises built the terminal in cooperation with PortMiami and it included removing land and creating a new seawall to make the channel wide enough to accommodate the 135-foot-wide cruise ship at the berth. MSC first announced plans for the terminal in 2018 as part of its growth plans for the North American cruise market. Fincantieri Infrastructure, the land-side construction arm of the Italian group, began construction of the terminal in March 2022 which was reported to be costing approximately 350 million euros ($360 million).\n\n\nPortMiami removed land from the island to widen the channel to accommodate cruise ships at the new terminal (MSC Cruises)\n\nWhen completed Terminal AA will have access to three berths, including handlingMSC World America, the new 215,860 gross ton cruise ship with accommodations for over 6,700 passengers due to enter service in April 2025. The terminal was designed to handle up to 36,000 passengers a day. It has been billed as the largest cruise terminal in the United States.\nPortMiami is also undertaking upgrades to its existing terminals to support growth. Terminal F was already rebuilt and the next step class for the overhaul and rebuilding of Terminal G for Royal Caribbean Group, including the ability to handle a 7,000 passenger Icon-class cruise ship. The revamped Terminal G is due to be available in 2027."

        "content": "\nOfficials in Shanghai are hailing a new record throughput for the port in January 2025 while saying that the ports are a “barometer” of foreign trade. It comes after a record volume at the port in 2024 and is the fourth monthly volume record set in the past 40 months as Shanghai continues to be the world’s busiest container port.\nThe Shanghai International Prot Group reported today, February 5, that the container port complex exceeded a monthly throughput of more than 5 million TEU. It is also the first time the port has handled more than 5 million boxes in a month. The previous monthly record was set last July (2024) when the port complex exceeded 4.8 million TEUs, with prior records in January 2022 and August 2021. The port complex set an all-time single-day high handling 172,080 TEUs during the day and night on July 21, 2024.\nPort officials called it an auspicious start for the new year following on a record-setting level in 2024. Last year, the port had a throughput of 51.5 million TEU. It was the fifteenth year in a row that Shanghai had the highest container port throughput and is only rivaled by other Chinese port complexes as well as Singapore which exceeded 40 million TEU in 2024, making it the largest container port outside China.\n“The performance of Shanghai Port in the first month of the new year reflects the active foreign trade and strong resilience of the country's economy,” SIP Group said in its announcement. “Looking ahead, Shanghai Port will continue to make efforts in digitalization, intelligence, and greening, continuously improve port operation efficiency and service quality.”\nPort officials said their efforts would consolidate its leading position as an international hub port, and contribute to the creation of a Chinese-style modern port. They highlight a new model for handling empty containers and inland container hubs along with efforts to promote coastal cabotage, and cross-border e-commerce while empowering and focusing on the construction of the Shanghai International Shipping Center to continue the growth.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department today, February 5, reported that the U.S. trade deficit continued to surge driven by all-time high imports. December 2024’s trade deficit was reported at $98.4 billion, up approximately 25 percent, and the second-largest trade deficit on record topping the previous peak in March 2015. Imports drove the gap reaching approximately $365 billion up 3.5 percent for the month while exports declined nearly 3 percent to $266.5 billion.\nAnalysts point to the strength of the U.S. economy and consumer spending in the Biden economy as well as the rush to bring goods onshore ahead of Trump’s promises of increased tariffs. The expectation is that January 2025 figures will show a similar record-high import level and trade gap. Trump imposed a 10 percent tariff increase on China as of February 4 with the threat of 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico delayed till next month and potential tariffs on goods from the European Union."

        "content": "The boom in containership construction and the transition to alternative fuels continues with South Korea’s HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering reporting its first order of 2025. The shipbuilder which is part of HD Hyundai booked an order valued at approximately $2.58 billion which is being widely linked to French shipping giant CMA CGM Group.\nReports from South Korea reported a letter of intent was in place and the industry was broadly reporting the order as a follow-on move by CMA CGM which continues to be at the forefront of the move to LNG dual-fuel vessels. KSOE provided few details other than the order is for 12 “mega” containerships which will be delivered by December 2028.\nMedia reports indicate the vessels will each have a capacity of 15,500 TEU with deliveries commencing in late 2027. It follows CMA CGM’s order in the second quarter of 2024 order for a dozen 15,000 TEU liquefied natural gas vessels from Hyundai Heavy Industries.\nCMA CGM, which is currently ranked third with a capacity of over 3.8 million TEU, has been investing in the energy transition as part of a fleet modernization and expansion program. As of the third quarter of 2024, the group highlighted more than 40 operational alternative fuel vessels and a total investment of $18 billion for 131 vessels by 2028 that will be capable of running on low-carbon energy, including biomethane, biomethanol, and synthetic fuels.\nThe new order represents a strong start for HD KSOE which announced a target of $18.05 billion for orders in 2025, which while a 34 percent increase over the 2024 target projects a decline in total orders versus those booked in 2024. The group reported orders valued at over $20 billion in 2024. This first order of the year represents 14 percent of the group’s target for 2025.\nThe order continues the strong buildout for LNG-powered vessels and specifically containerships. DNV’s Alternative Fuel Insight database shows a total of 641 LNG-fueled vessels with 142 containerships in service. It reports LNG represents 10 percent of the current order flow and based on orders, the LNG-fueled fleet will double to 1,273 vessels by 2030.\nSpeaking at the Davos Forum in Switzerland this week, Executive Vice President of HD Hyundai Chung Ki-sun pointed to the continuing efforts in shipbuilding to lead the transition to alternative fuels. The group is focusing on a digital transformation outlining its blueprint for the future of the shipyards. HD Hyundai is partnered with big data company Palantir Technologies and highlighted a strategy for a 30 percent improvement in productivity and a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nGerman LNG terminal operator Deutsche ReGas has terminated a charter agreement for a full-size FSRU that it brought in last year, when Germany was working hard to bring on extra capacity to replace Russian gas volumes. In a statement, the company said that it was losing money on the arrangement and blamed Deutsche Energy Terminals (DET), a state-owned company set up to organize LNG imports and ensure the security of the nation's energy supply.\nThe cancellation affects the Energos Power, a 174,000 cubic meter FSRU that started operations at the port of Mukran in February 2024. The Energos Power is the larger of the two FSRUs in the Deutsche Ostsee LNG import complex at Mukran; together, the two FSRUs have a receiving capacity of more than 13 billion cubic meters a year. It is the only privately-financed FSRU terminal in the country.\nAccording to ReGas, DET has been auctioning the services of its regulated import terminals at prices below a government-approved minimum cost-covering level, creating \"distortions\" in the gas marketplace and pricing out ReGas' private operation. ReGas has previously warned that its operations could be undercut by the state entity.\n\"DET's ruinous pricing policy since December 2024 is one of several reasons for terminating the sub-charter contract. Deutsche ReGas regrets having to take this step,\" said Ingo Wagner, managing partner of Deutsche Re-Gas. \"We continue to be in close contact with the federal government on this matter. In the event of a supply bottleneck, ReGas believes that an immediate solution can be found at any time.\"\nGermany's LNG terminals are underutilized, and Wagner told reporters last month that ReGas has faced \"unequal competition\" from DET since December. ReGas says that because of state subsidies, DET can market its services below cost.\nFor its part, DET says that it complies with all regulatory requirements and has been successful in marketing its import services. DET's utilization rate was higher than ReGas' rate in 2024, and DET sold all 50 available slots to 17 different companies in its December and February auction rounds. The average price in the December auction was about 10 cents per mmBTU, and the average in the February auction was about 30 cents per MMBtu.\n\"Our offer was well received by the traders and all the slots we offered were marketed. At the same time, we are looking ahead as the currently declining storage levels must be replenished in good time during the year,\" said Dr. Peter Röttgen, Managing Director of DET, in a statement last week.\nThe FSRUs are part of a strategy to replace Russian gas, but according to the Financial Times, Germany's government favors an agreement to restart pipeline gas imports from Russia if a peace deal is reached in Ukraine. If actualized, the sole surviving pipeline of the Nord Stream 2 project would be reactivated - reducing gas prices and undercutting the competitiveness of German FSRUs. The far-right Alternative fur Deutscheland (AfD) party, which is leading in the polls in the run-up to Germany's March election, has vowed to restart Nord Stream."

The list of companies selected to buy and operate tonnage for QatarEnergy includes China Merchants Group, Shandong Marine Group, China LNG Shipping, Mitsui OSK, COSCO, Shandong Marine Energy, MISC Berhad, K-Line and Hyundai Glovis.\nThe new QatarEnergy LNG tankers, a mix of QC-Max and Q-Flex LNG vessels, are being built in China and South Korea. 43 of the vessels will be chartered-in by affiliate QatarEnergy Trading, to transport the portion of Qatar’s gas exports that are not covered by long-term supply contracts. This will reinforce its aspirations to become a leading global LNG trader.\nThe largest shipowner in the newbuild program isNakilat, formally titled the Qatar Gas Transport Company Limited (QPSC). Nakilat is a publically-quoted company headquartered in Doha, whose shareholdings are dominated by the Qatari state and members of the royal family, but which also includes a broad spectrum of Qatari institutional as well as private shareholders. Qatari shareholders and pension funds hold about 40% of the company. With a targeted annual dividend yield of 5%, this means that a cross-section of Qatari society is benefitting from Nakilat and Qatari gas earnings, and which by sharing out wealth and prosperity also has a political stability dividend. It is a model being replicated in Oman, where Asyad plans to float an initial 20% of its shares via an IPO on the local Muscat Securities Market, with a block of shares reserved for Omani institutional and private investors.\nNakilat also operates the floating storage regasification unitFSRU Exquisite, stationed in a channel of the Indus River east of Karachi.  It also owns the specialist Erhama Bin Jaber Al Jalahma Shipyard at Ras Laffan, and is tied into Milaha, the Qatari logistics company, via a shareholding."

        "content": "The rivalry between China and South Korea’s shipbuilders continues to heat up. While there is growing concern due to China’s apparent domination of the market, South Korea’s shipbuilders achieved strong results in 2024 and continue to carve out the high-end market.\nAfter posting a dismal new order performance in December booking only six percent of new orders versus 82 percent by the Chinese shipbuilders, South Korea’s industry rebounded to the leadership position in January 2025. It is the first time in several months South Korea received the largest percentage of new orders and it also demonstrated the success of the industry’s focus on higher-value projects and ships.\nAccording to data from Clarkson Research the South Korean industry booked 62 percent of the global orders in January based on tonnage. It received orders for 900,000 CGT (compensated gross tons). That compared with the Chinese yards which received just 19 percent of the tonnage ordered or 270,000 CGT.\nSouth Korea’s orders were led by 12 LNG carriers booked at HD Korean Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering as well as an LNG carrier order for Samsung Heavy Industries. In addition to being higher-value orders, they are also large vessels. South Korea’s orders were for 13 vessels compared to 21 smaller, lower-value vessels ordered from Chinese shipbuilders in January.\nChina continues to still dominate the overall orderbook with a backlog of 91.51 million CGT or 58 percent of the vessels (by tonnage) on order. South Korea has 24 percent of the orders (by tonnage) or a total of just over 37 million CGT. Veson released a market analysis this week with its VesselsValue data highlighting that Chinese shipowners committed to $123 billion in newbuild orders in 2024. The orders were mostly for tankers followed by bulkers and then containerships. Chinese yards have just begun to break into the international market for LNG and other gas carriers.\nSouth Korea’s companies have a positive outlook for 2025 with HD KSOE reporting it increased its forecast by 30 percent versus its 2024 target. It however represents a decline from the actual orders booked in 2024. Samsung Heavy Industries has not yet reported 2024 results and its forecast but commented that its outlook is slightly higher than last year. Hanwha Ocean has commented that it anticipates stable growth in 2025.\nThe positive outlook among the South Korean shipbuilders was in part driven by the strong financial performance recorded in 2024. Ship prices were approaching two-decade highs further contributing to the profitability of the sector.\nHD Hyundai Heavy Industry reported an overall nearly 50 percent increase in operating profit with a better than 10 percent increase in consolidated revenues for 2024. Specifically, within shipbuilding, HD Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering (KSOE) saw profits jump 400 percent to a profit of more than $960 million. Sales were up 20 percent to $17.5 billion.\nHanwha Ocean continued the turnaround from the former Daewoo Shipbuilding (DSME) achieving its first profitable year since 2020. It reported sales of nearly $7.5 billion with an operating profit of $166 million.\nThe return to profitability was not limited to South Korea’s largest shipbuilders. Mid-sized HJ Shipbuilding reported an annual profit of $6.3 million. This was achieved despite a nearly 13 percent decline in revenues.\nThe Korean shipbuilders are refining their business strategy. KSOE for example continues to increase its focus on green technologies and automation while also booking orders for LNG carriers. The company plans to make its first bid next month for a U.S. Navy-related repair contract and is targeting two to three contracts in 2025. Hanwha Ocean won the first two U.S. Navy contracts in 2024 for repairs to an MSC dry cargo and ammunition ship and then an oiler. Hanwha is targeting six USN MRO contracts for 2025 in addition to the construction of LNG carriers, submarines, and LNG dual-fuel containerships.\nHD Heavy Industries and Hanwha Ocean reportedly have reached a partnership agreement for the export of naval ships as they continue to seek more international work. The companies were also encouraged by building relationships with the U.S. Navy in 2024 which Donald Trump has signaled he supports. Trump has said the U.S. could use the capabilities of the South Korean shipbuilders as he pursues a buildout for the U.S. Navy."

The agents discovered five containers in one of the bulker's holds, filled with 76 tonnes of contraband cigarettes.\nThe agents also found two go-fast speedboats stowed aboard the ship, each fitted with four 300-horsepower outboards - a powerful arrangement typical of smuggling operations. The bulker was also carrying a tank of 10,000 liters of gasoline to supply the boats, which would not be necessary if the small launches were merely part of the cargo.\nCustoms agents suspect that theKokoohad been set up as a \"mother ship\" for running illegal cigarettes to shore using the speedboats. The scale and sophistication of the scheme suggests organized crime, according to the Australian Border Force, which helped with the sting.\nThe vessel's master was arrested and presented to the Noumea Criminal Court. In short order, the court sentenced him to a suspended prison sentence of 10 months, a fine of $350,000 and confiscation of the entire cigarette cargo, along with the speedboats. The value of the seized tobacco is estimated to be about $35 million on the legal market.\n\n\nImages courtesy ABF\nThe ABF believes that the cigarettes were intended for the Australian market, based on the brand markings on the packages.\nThe investigation began long before theKokoowas boarded. The ABF tracked and monitored it as it approached and loitered near the Australian coast, then informed authorities in New Caledonia when the bulker changed course. French armed forces and intelligence units in New Caledonia tracked the vessel in advance, and the port authority in Noumea facilitated the boarding."

The Premier Alliance replaces the former working arrangement known as The Alliance with the companies emphasizing their commitments as they prepare to proceed without former partner Hapag-Lloyd.\nThe agreement was originally filed for approval with the FMC on October 28, 2024. The FMC however quickly responded and reported on November 5, 2024, that it had requested additional information. The review process was delayed to collect the data which the FMC said was necessary for completing an economic analysis of the competitive effects of the agreement.\nThe FMC deemed the responses complete on December 26. The regulations then give the commission 45 days to review a newly filed agreement or the responses before the agreement automatically goes into effect. As with the review for the Gemini Alliance between Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd which faced a similar delay, the FMC said it lacked the ability to challenge the agreements, but that alliance agreements are subject to the strictest standards for ongoing monitoring by the commission.\nThe approval comes just days after Gemini launched and the first vessels transitioned to the new route system for Maersk and Hapag. The companies look to shake up the industry and their cooperation is reshaping working relations across the entire sector.\nThe new alliance covers issues such as vessel sharing, exchanging vessel slots, and the ability for the three companies to discuss and agree on issues such as the size, number, and operational characteristics of vessels operating under the agreement. The three companies said in September 2024 that they had determined to continue their working relationship and enhance it including a separate agreement with MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company.\nHMM, ONE, and Yang Ming have also reported they will be increasing service on key routes and adding new vessels to make up for lost capacity. HMM, for example, is returning with a trans-Atlantic route after having ended its prior service in 2018. ONE has also announced new services to the East Coast of South America and India.\nThe Alliance was launched in 2016 as one of the three working relationships in the industry. It started operations in April 2017. The companies reported it involved 260 ships, calls at 82 ports, and covered 31 different services on the major trade routes."

Following theOcean Giaint, is theOcean Gladiatorwhich was due to reach Lyttelton on February 8. Built in 2010, she is a 17,700 dwt general cargo ship also under an annual charter to MSC. She will also be offloading cargo and when she departs she will also be retrieving the causeway.\nMarie Morrow, MSC’s representative in Antarctica commented “Operating in the remote and challenging environment of Antarctica is unique to the ODF mission. Everyone involved has an important role to play and it is truly a joint mission. The ship operation takes teamwork and coordination from the ship’s crew, all elements of the Joint Task Force (United States Coast Guard, Army, Navy, Air National Guard), civilian contractors, and New Zealand Defense Force integrated into cargo operations.”\nOperation Deep Freeze as the mission is known is a joint service, on-going Defense Support to Civilian Authorities activity in support of the National Science Foundation (NSF), lead agency for the United States Antarctic Program. Mission support consists of active duty, Guard and Reserve personnel from the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Army, and Coast Guard as well as Department of Defense civilians and attached non-DOD civilians."

        "content": "Singapore’s introduction into operational service of its new Invincible class of submarines appears to be an extraordinary success, offering valuable lessons for its former colonial master - the United Kingdom, which is now grappling with crew retention issues and its own challenging submarine expansion program under the aegis of AUKUS.\nThe first two Type 218SG submarines of the Invincible-class, RSSInvincibleand RSSImpeccable, were commissioned into operational service on September 24, 2024 at Changi Naval Base.  In his commissioning speech, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong described the program as critical to Singapore’s survival and prosperity as a maritime nation, and one which also lacks strategic depth.\nThe boats were built by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems in Germany, but were heavily customized to meet Singapore’s particular needs.  The submarines are designed ergonomically to suit Singaporean national servicemen, both from a physical and tech-savvy perspective. The well-planned working environment will help attract and retain high-caliber crews, both male and female, drawn from a nation committed to its national service program. Sensors, navigation and weapons systems are optimized for operations in congested and shallow waters, as found in the Malacca Straits and the South China Sea.\nFuture Republic of Singapore Navy Invincible-class Type 218SG submarine RSS Invincible coming into Kiel, Germany - December 9, 2022#rssinvincibleSRC: webcampic.twitter.com/JNJEGZeGCH\nDiesel-powered, the Invincible submarines can travel at 10 knots surfaced, 15 knots underwater. With an air independent propulsion system for battery charging, the submarines can remain submerged for an estimated 45 days without snorkeling. Cruise endurance is unknown. With a total of ten 21- and 26-inch torpedo tubes, the submarines should be able to launch heavy torpedoes, anti-ship missiles and mines, and to deliver special force teams underwater through an airlock.\nThe submarines have been brought into service relatively quickly because the Singaporean Navy’s 7th Flotilla has built up a cadre of experienced crews through its previous operation of smaller Swedish Archer-class submarines, which will now begin to be retired from service.\nIn service, Singapore will face significant operational challenges.  As a small island state, deployed submarines underwater will provide a valuable hinterland; but conversely, the boats will be particularly vulnerable while in port, even if a protection-from-view shed has been built wharfside to hide their presence or absence.\nTwo further submarines in the class, RSS Illustrious and RSS Inimitable, are due in service by the end of 2025. The overall cost of the program has been estimated as $1.8 billion. A fifth boat may also have been ordered. Other nearby nations may well be tempted to replicate Singapore’s submarine development programme, but Singapore has a 25-year head start."

Four paying \"mission specialists\" and the operating company's CEO died in the implosion, making it the first fatal accident in five decades in a deep-diving manned submersible.\nThe Coast Guard believes that the craft's experimental carbon hull imploded rapidly, with little or no warning. A NOAA acoustic buoy captured the sound of the underwater blast from miles away - one of the first hints that the dive had ended in tragedy.\n\nAccording to evidence uncovered by an ongoing Marine Board of Investigation inquiry, the Titan accumulated a long list of safety issues in the years leading up to the casualty. The sub (and an earlier prototype hull) partially sank at the pier, ran out of battery power while submerged, lost its forward dome during a recovery, and failed to drop weights on multiple occasions.\nFormer Oceangate employees testified that co-founder and CEO Richard Stockton Rush III chose not to pursue classification or a Coast Guard Certificate of Inspection (COI) for the novel design, despite repeated warnings from third-party engineering consultants and his own staff. Rush was aware of the experimental nature of Oceangate's commercially-operated vessel: before the disaster that claimed his life, he told a conference audience that \"when you're outside the box, it's hard to tell how really far outside the box you are,\" adding that Oceangate was \"pretty far out there.\"\n\"These [conventional] research subs that are out there, they were never meant to make money. They were meant to get out there and do cool stuff,\" Rush told the audience. \"[Sub certification programs] are over the top in their rules and regulations.\"\n"

The damage \"strongly suggests that the explosions were caused by limpet mines,\" the consultancy said in a statement.\nAmbrey added that other vessels with \"a similar trading profile\" have also been damaged by explosions - a previously unreported detail of the challenges facing Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of sanctions-skirting tankers.\nKoalais a 22-year-old Suezmax tanker owned by a Turkish firm and managed by a company in Cyprus. At the time of the casualty, she was in Ust-Luga loading a cargo of mazut - a Russian grade of heavy fuel oil, which is not covered by the G7's calibrated sanctions on Russian energy exports.\nLimpet mines are just one of the challenges Russia faces in exporting its petroleum to global markets. According to Reuters, persistent Ukrainian attacks on refineries and the growing impact of U.S. sanctions on the \"shadow fleet\" have curtailed Russia's ability to process or ship out its oil production. An estimated 12-14 percent of Russian refining capacity is offline because of Ukrainian drone attacks, and about a third of all Russia-linked tankers have been blacklisted by EU and U.S. sanctions. Without the means to either use or move their oil, Russian energy firms may soon exhaust storage options and could begin shutting in production, three Russian oil executives told Reuters this week - the first time since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine that this measure has been considered. Oil revenue accounts for 30-50 percent of the Kremlin's budget, and it is essential for financing the Russian military.\nIndian refiners - Russia's biggest oil customers - are working hard to fill the gap by finding new, unsanctioned tankers and operating companies to enter the \"shadow fleet\" trade, according to Bloomberg. About 14 percent of India's monthly oil imports are riding on the effort; if replacement tankers can't be found by March, Indian refiners will have to make up the balance with more expensive oil from other suppliers, like Middle Eastern producers - leaving millions of barrels of Russian crude undelivered."

The UK government is a strong supporter of the carbon capture and storage approach and has been moving forward with licensing for potential projects.\nCarbon Catalyst, a UK company that was founded in 2020, reported working with its partners the first test commenced on February 10 at the Project Poseidon site. The operator for the project, Perenco UK, a large independent energy producer, is a partner in the project and undertook the injection tests. Wintershall Dea, a large German gas and oil producer, is also a partner having acquired a 10 percent working interest from Carbon Catalyst in late 2023.\nThe UK Government awarded Carbon Catalyst three Carbon Dioxide Appraisal and Storage Licenses in August 2023, as the company began to build its portfolio. It has one site, Poseidon which encompasses the Lehman gas fields which is located in the southern North Sea sector on the UK Continental Shelf. It includes depleted gas reservoirs and saline aquifers in which the captured CO2 would be injected. Lehman is connected via pipeline to the PUK Bacton Terminal in the East Anglia region of England. The pipelines will make it possible to receive the CO2 at the terminal from various sources and send it offshore for injection.\nLast August, the companies reported Petrodec’s Erda rig was positioned at the site and specially for the injection of CO2. They undertook the successful recompletion of the H27 well to be used for the tests.\nIt is anticipated that Poseidon will target an initial annual injection capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2, scaling up to an ultimate annual injection rate of 40 million tonnes. With a potential 1 billion tonnes storage capacity, Poseidon is set to become one of the largest Carbon Capture & Storage projects in Northwest Europe. Carbon Catalyst highlights that it is ideally positioned to serve Greater London and the Southeast of England.\nFollowing the injection test, the Poseidon Joint Venture will progress towards a Final Investment Decision (FID) which it anticipates in 2027. Tentatively, the first commercial CO2 injection for permanent storage could begin in 2029. Based on its size, it is projected the project could run for 40 years.\nCarbon Catalyst plans to build out a portfolio of projects across the North Sea. In addition to the Poseidon licenses, the company has rights to a site, Orion, located further to the north near the Humber region of England, one of its historic industrial zones. Orion would have a capacity of 126 mt and is targeted for 2031.\nDenmark completed the world’s first injection test in 2023 at the INEOS-led pilot Project Greensand also located in the North Sea. Norway’s project Northern Lights has also completed testing and building of its terminals. The Norwegian project recently received its first two CO2 transport vessels and is undertaking commissioning before it starts commercial CCS operations."

        "headline": "To Decarbonize Towage, Svitzer Thinks Like a Startup",
        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nTowage provider Svitzer is known for its global scale, but it's also making a name for itself in low-carbon towing. Together with customer Hoegh Autoliners, it recently rolled out its first very-low-carbon towing service, powered by carbon insetting from biofuel consumption across Svitzer's global fleet. To find out more about the ideas that power Svitzer's green transformation, TME spoke with head of decarbonization Gareth Prowse (left).\nTME: Could you tell us about your background and how you came to work in maritime decarbonization?\nI started with a marine biology degree and a PhD in organic pesticides and ecotoxicology. Following that, I ended up in the coatings industry doing environmental and human risk assessment for marine paint products, particularly anti-fouling solutions. As my career progressed and corporate social responsibility and sustainability became more important, I focused on how coatings can drive emissions reduction in vessels.\nThree years ago, I was fortunate enough to join Svitzer as head of decarbonization to set the strategy and direction of travel for our tug fleet. For years I was around the industry looking in, and it's been great to be inside the industry looking out for a change.\nWhat does it take to reduce emissions across a fleet of 450 tugs worldwide?\nSo I think it's a bit of a hackneyed statement these days, but it’s true that there's no silver bullet, no single solution that's really going to help you to achieve your goals when it comes to decarbonization. We need flexibility in our approach. We have to consider vessel age, equipment, operational profile, and regional limitations with respect to biofuel and shore power availability.\nOur strategy operates across three key themes: behavior, equipment, and fuel. Solutions range from slower transit speeds to shortening transit distances to using drop-in biofuels. Each region has different macroeconomic drivers and regulatory frameworks, which influence available solutions. For example, biofuels are widely available in Europe but less so in Australia, so we need different solutions for different regions.\nWhat's different about decarbonizing smaller vessels compared to large ships?\nThe scale is completely different. While large vessels might need hundreds or thousands of tons of fuel for a single bunkering, we might use just 40 tons of diesel every two weeks. With batteries and methanol, we might only need 100 tons of alternative fuel per year. This creates opportunities to work with suppliers who deal in smaller volumes that wouldn't be practical for large container ships.\nBut the challenges aren't necessarily easier - they're just different. We're caught in a gray area between large ship regulations and road transport solutions. For example, when people talk about ammonia as the future maritime fuel, that makes little sense for small vessels. We need solutions that fit our scale of operations and operational profiles. On top of that, scaling solutions across so many vessels is not without its challenges, and we don’t have a lot of space on board to accommodate some of the more cutting-edge options, like carbon capture systems.\nSpeaking of small-scaled solutions, can you tell us about the new Robert Allan / Svitzer TRAnsverse tug design?\nOur TRAnsverse tug design completely rethinks traditional tug operations, and will be way more efficient than the standard vessel that you can buy today. Instead of focusing on static bollard pull - the absolute power a tug can deliver when stationary - we've arranged the thrusters differently, with one at the front and one at the rear in combination with a unique tow connection, allowing the vessel to generate higher dynamic pulls while using less power. This makes the vessel more capable and more efficient than standard tug designs. Tow tank data, CFD modeling and time spent in the simulator, indicate that we get double-digit reductions in fuel consumption relative to the current fleet. We’re now seeing the same results from the real data generated by Svitzer Taurus, the first TRAnsverse vessel to go into operation.  Since the best liter of fuel is the liter you didn't use, we're super excited to see these operational results and really see what it can do.\nThis efficiency also makes it easier to implement battery power and other alternative fuel solutions where we may need to compromise on the energy density of the fuels we expect to use in the future. We're currently building a hybrid version, scheduled for service in Gothenburg in 2026. The vessel will be a fully electric platform, which will use battery power in combination with methanol range extenders to maximize the operational range of the vessel and ultimately the work it can carry out.\nWhat changes are you making across the existing fleet to boost efficiency?\nWe're seeing benefits from several approaches. We have five vessels using the SYDRIVE systems, where we can connect both thrusters to one engine through a gearbox system, optimizing fuel consumption. We've been working with battery-enabled vessels for around 10 years now, and as we renew those batteries, we're moving from traditional lithium-ion to newer chemistries like lithium iron phosphate (LFP), which offer better energy density and discharge rates. This allows us to go from 500kw per vessel to 1.3 MW per vessel. This should have a dramatic effect on fuel used during operation and will help us to sharpen how we operate vessels with batteries to maximize fuel efficiency.ds\nWe see significant opportunities for battery vessels across our fleet, but it is crucial that we that we can get access to shoreside charging infrastructure. We have built significant experience working with biofuels, both HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) and FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) at high blend levels (B80+) - that's a significant lever. And we can see methanol availability developing in the future. Essentially, it's about being ready to pull all of these levers in combination so we can make the most of them when they become available to us.\nThat said, we're not complacent about revisiting old challenges and old questions to see if we can do something different with available technologies, as well as the future stuff. We also need to make sure that it's sustainable in the way that we approach it, so we're always looking at the business case and which option is the lowest cost of abatement.\nCharging is often a challenge for battery-electric vessels - how do you work with ports to enable charging infrastructure?\nIt's early days, but we're finding that partnership models are key. Many ports want to support decarbonization but face financial and infrastructure constraints of their own. What we see in some of our locations is that the local grid is poor, or there isn't much of it at all. Sometimes just getting enough shore power to keep the lights on is challenging, because the financing to develop port infrastructure isn't there.\nPartnership models can help address the funding gap. We're seeing new companies emerge that will take on all the cost of installing shore-side equipment and then recover their costs through energy pricing, so everybody wins. That's one of the things that we've learned often - these things are not easy to solve on your own, but by talking with ports and figuring out what their pain points are, you can solve it together.\nThe challenge is that the tug sector is not as heavily regulated on emissions as larger vessels (over 5,000 gross tons), so there's less external pressure driving change. We're stuck in this gray area where the regulation doesn't drive the change, so investing comes with risk. Some of the solutions are expensive, and customers' willingness to pay for the cost difference is limited. This holds us back from progressing as fast as we may like, but we’re laying the groundwork for future opportunities when other stakeholders are ready to go.\nWhat role does crew behavior play in reducing emissions?\nOur \"Aim for 8\" program uses AIS tracking and machine learning to monitor vessel speeds and determine optimal speeds for different operations. While behavioral changes alone won't get us to our targets, they're crucial for change management. About 80% of our fuel is burned during the working phase, so we're particularly interested in optimizing operations during active towage. The program helps gamify fuel optimization and engages crews in finding solutions.\nThis engagement is especially important as we introduce new technologies like methanol-powered vessels and battery systems, which require new training and procedures. When crews understand why changes are necessary and see their role in the solution, they understand why we're asking them to do things differently.\nMore often than not, I find people are “on board” with decarbonization. They see it as important, and they want to drive the change. Mariners can be part of the solution. If you find a great idea and it works, we want to can scale that very quickly across 450 vessels - even if it isn’t all of them, we should be able to find enough to have an impact.\nWhat lessons have you learned that might help other operators?\nFirst, everyone needs to be aligned on looking for solutions and challenging existing practices. We use a pilot-scale-policy approach: test ideas on a small scale, and if they work, expand them. If it works on one tug, does it work on 10? If it works on 10, does it work on 20? And if it works everywhere, then you can just set it as a policy. This startup-style thinking helps us validate hypotheses about what works for our operations, customers, and ports.\nI think you really need to have that explorer mindset - you should never underestimate or ignore the fact that at the end of the day, you're in a competitive market and you have to serve customers. Focus on opportunities that reduce operational costs while providing environmental benefits. If you can eliminate the \"green premium,\" it's easier to make the business case for sustainability investments, so never lose sight of the return on investment - that CO2 reduction per dollar spent is really important."

        "content": "\nLack of proficiency in the steering gear operation and change of control modes due to ambiguous procedures caused a containership to strike a navigation beacon while departing the Port of Melbourne in May 2023. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) released its report saying it found an incomplete understanding of how the steering gear operated among the ship’s engineers and ambiguous language in the company’s fleetwide procedures.\nThe boxship CMA CGM Puccini (6,300 TEU) was transiting the Yarra River in Melbourne, Australia on May 25, 2023, when it hit a navigational beacon. The initial investigation showed erratic behavior by the ship leading the ATSB to investigate why the steering gear was not performing correctly. The 2004-built ship, registered in Malta went off its intended track towards the edge of the navigable channel causing it to strike the beacon. The pilot aboard and the crew reported the rudder was responding erratically to helm orders.\nInvestigators pieced together the cause of the erratic steering, determining that it was due to a hydraulic bypass valve being left open by the crew after an AMSA port state control inspection the day before the incident. This resulted in the steering system hydraulics being incorrectly configured for normal operation.\nIt was established that with the hydraulic bypass valve being left open, the steering operated sufficiently well with minimal load on the rudder to pass pre-departure visual inspection. However, when the hydrodynamic loads on the rudder increased, with increasing ship’s speed and rudder movements, the open bypass valve allowed leakage of hydraulic oil and system pressure around the pump leading to erratic response of the rudder.\n\n\nCMA CGM Puccini severely damaged the beacon while departing Melbourne, Australia (ATSB)\n\nATSB determined that several officers on board were not as proficient with steering gear operation and change of control modes as was required by regulations. The situation was complicated by the fact that the steering terminology used on board and within the CMA CGM fleet was not clearly and explicitly defined. For the giant shipping liner, the official fleet terminology was “steering gear failure” and did not recognize common industry terms such as “emergency” and “local steering.”\n“The ship’s responsible officers had an incomplete understanding of how the steering gear operated, and therefore incorrectly configured the steering system hydraulics,” said Angus Mitchell Chief Commissioner. The report notes they were unaware of the dangers and further AMSA told the investigators manipulation of the steering hydraulics was not required for the demonstration during the inspection.\nThe ATSB final report on the incident shows that in the early hours of May 25, CMA CGM Puccini sailed from Swanson Dock in Melbourne after route safety checks under the conduct of a pilot and initially with two tugs in attendance. During the turn to leave Swanson Dock, the master and chief mate noticed that the rudder response appeared sluggish, as if only one steering pump was running (both pumps were operating). Neither raised their observations with each other, or the pilot, and there were no alarms to indicate a pump had stopped or other abnormal conditions.\nBy 0436, the ship was moving along the channel in Yarra River after both tugs had been dismissed and a few minutes later passed under the Westgate bridge at a speed of 6.6 knots when the helmsman reported that the rudder was not responding to the wheel. With its speed increasing, the ship moved further off course and tracked toward the western edge of the dredged navigable Yarra River channel striking navigation beacon 32. At the time, the ship’s speed was 7.7 knots.\nThe two tugs were nearby and returned, and helped control the ship’s erratic movement. The ship was then moved to Webb Dock for inspection. The ship sustained minor paint damage but the beacon was significantly damaged.\n“Any loss of steering can imperil the safety of the ship, and life at sea,” said Mitchell. “Unclear or ambiguous operating instructions and terminology should be corrected as soon as they are identified.”\nCMA CGM has taken measures to address the ambiguity by revising the steering guidance across its fleet. The liner’s fleetwide “steering gear failure” procedure has been amended and titled to become the “emergency steering procedure.”\nPorts Victoria has also updated the harbor master’s directions for Melbourne to enhance towage requirements while transiting the Yarra River. This now includes advice for the crews of ships that experience a main engine or steering failure while transiting port waters.\nTop photo byBahnfrendof CMA CGM departing Fremantle in 2020 (CC BY-SA 4.0)"

        "content": "Less than a month into the new Trump administration the U.S. conducted what it calls a “freedom of navigation” exercise sending two U.S. Navy vessels through the politically sensitive Taiwan Strait. Chinese spokespersons reacted angrily in what they perceived as a show of force and a possible signal of the new Trump administration's stance toward China.\nChina continues to aggressively press its reunification claims for the island saying it would only wait so long. Chinese nationalists have controlled the island since 1949 and the declaration of the People’s Republic of China. They reject the demands of the communists saying the island is independent, and its fate is controlled by the people.\nThe U.S. frequently sends vessels or aircraft through the strait. Media reports suggest the U.S. conducted transits eight times in 2024, with the last vessel going through the strait in October and a plane overflying the strait in November.\n“The transit occurred through a corridor in the Taiwan Strait that is beyond any coastal state’s territorial seas,” said Navy Commander Matthew Comer, a spokesperson at the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific Command reporting this week’s transit.\nThe U.S. Navy did not provide extensive details. It simply said a guided-missile destroyer, USSRalph Johnson, and a Pathfinder-class survey ship, USNSBowditch, made the transit between February 10 and 12.Ralph Johnson, assigned to the 7th Fleet and Indo-Pacific Command, had made a similar transit in August 2024.\n“Two U.S. naval vessels sailed through the Taiwan Strait from north to south starting on the 10th. During this period, ROC Armed Forces maintained full control over the surrounding sea and airspace, with the situation remaining normal,” reported the Ministry of National Defense, ROC (Taiwan). It regularly monitors the activity and reports that 30 PLA aircraft, 7 PLAN vessels, and 1 official ship were detected around Taiwan.\n“The U.S. action sends the wrong signals and increases security risks,” said a spokesperson for the PLA. It noted that its forces are on constant high alert while saying its navy and air force were deployed to “monitor the whole process of the U.S. vessels’ passage and effectively managed the situation.”\nIt is the second regional activity by the U.S. this month. The U.S. Navy highlighted a planned exercise involving the Royal Australian Navy and the UK Royal Navy sailing with a U.S. ship in the South China Sea. It took place between February 6 and 7 involving the guided-missile destroyer USSBenfold, RAN Hobart-class guided-missile destroyer HMASHobart, and RN River-class offshore patrol vessels HMSSpey.\n“Regular military engagements between the defense forces in the Indo-Pacific will help maintain regional security and stability,” said Commodore Jonathan Ley, Joint Force Maritime Component Commander for Australia’s Headquarters Joint Operations Command.\nAccording to the statement issued on the exercise, the three ships practiced their ability to exchange data using their tactical datalink systems, while the maneuvering exercise trained the crews’ ability to sail alongside each other in various conditions, improving the self-defense and communication capabilities of the three countries.\nChina regularly monitors these exercises. It issued a statement this week highlighting its own exercise saying it participated in a multi-country event organized by Pakistan."

        "content": "Iran's defense ministry has released footage of what it claims to be the world's first submarine-launched loitering munition (suicide drone). A brief video run by state news shows a delivery device emerging from below the water, then blowing off its nosecone and ejecting a folding-wing drone into the air.\nThe Iranian Ministry of Defense has officially unveiled the “Hadid 110,” an Autonomous Unmanned Drone with low radar and acoustic signatures. It is capable of target identification using AI-powered image recognition and can be launched from an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).pic.twitter.com/yTgkxto2vl\nThe ministry said that - unlike most drones - this munition is autonomous. Once launched, it operates without a man in the loop or human remote control, and finds and destroys its target using AI. This eliminates the need for a radio link to a control station, reducing vulnerability to electronic countermeasures.\nFor Western operators, AI-controlled lethal munitions are a matter of ethical concern, but the U.S. and many other nations are moving ahead rapidly in developing the technology - led by Ukraine and Russia. Both militaries have thousands of hours of combat video feed from drone operators on the front line in Ukraine, and that footage is key for training AI models how to identify real military targets.\nIran has an active and well-developed drone program, and has previously used long-range loitering munitions to attack shipping. It has even converted a small boxship into a \"drone carrier\" specifically for this purpose. its proxy force in Yemen - the Houthi rebel group - has used hundreds of shore-launched drones to attack Western merchant vessels and warships in the Red Sea. If practical in real-world use, Iran's new submarine-launched drone could begin its flight from a position closer to the target vessel, reducing the time available to detect and defeat it.\nIran's ministry of defense claims that the new AI-driven drone can be launched from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), increasing stealth and lowering risk to Iranian personnel. The underwater delivery device portrayed in Wednesday's video bears visual similarity to Iran's small torpedo-shaped AUV, evidence of which has been captured by U.S. forces in the Houthi conflict."

        "content": "The crude oil tankerCordelia Moon(163,000 dwt) continues to have a string of bad luck. The vessel listed as owned by a company in the Seychelles and managed from India has been known to be in the Russian oil trade and that has put it in harm’s way more than once.\nThe tanker which was built in 2006 and is registered in Panama is now finding itself caught in the expanding reach of the U.S. sanctions imposed by the Biden administration against Russia. Bloomberg was first to report the tanker had arrived off India’s Vadinar Port on February 9 but was denied docking rights to unload. Four days later it is still sitting off India according to its AIS signal.\nThe vessel is laden with Russian oil loaded having departed Novorossiysk on January 10. According to the report on Bloomberg, there are approximately 1 million barrels aboard coming from one of the producers, Surgutneftegaz, which has been sanctioned by the United States.\nIndia has reportedly decided not to receive cargoes or ships that have been sanctioned. Bloomberg quotes India’s Oil Minister Pankaj Jain as saying the country had decided not to accept shipments from sanctioned companies if they were loaded after January 10. India had previously turned away Russian cargoes due to Western pressures and recently China’s Shandong Port Group also said it would not be accepting sanctioned tankers.\nBeing in the Russian oil trade has not been good for theCordelia Moon. The tanker was bound for Suez after having offloaded in India when the Houthis targeted the vessel on October 1. The tanker’s captain told the authorities that in the first wave of attacks, they spotted several splashes. The Houthis claimed a launch of eight missiles and one drone against the tanker. During the second attack, the vessel’s port ballast tank was punctured. The Houthis released spectacular images showing the moment of explosion on the ship’s hull.\nAfter completing repairs, the tanker was transiting the Bosphorus bound for Russia for its next cargo when it experienced engine troubles. The Bosporus was closed on December 26 by thedisabled ship. The Turkish authorities stepped in and towed it to an anchorage.\nIt is unclear what is going to happen with theCordelia Moon. The Indian Oil Minister told Bloomberg he was not aware of the case.\nToday, Reuters highlights that U.S. sanctions are beginning to have an increasing impact both on Russia and Iran. The sanctions they report are driving up costs. With fewer ships available Reuters says transport costs have risen for the oil. They report costs are being driven up for Indian and Chinese refineries which have been the largest customers for the oil."

        "content": "\nEUNAVFOR Atalanta reports that the Yemini-flagged fishing boatAl Najmawas released by pirates who had boarded the vessel earlier in the week. The crew of the fishing boat confirmed that the alleged pirates abandoned the vessel after stealing personal objects and two skiffs belonging to the dhow and as forces from the Atalanta operation approached the hijacked vessel.\n“The immediate presence of ATALANTA forces in the area, especially the helicopter, was decisive in the fishing vessel liberation,” writes EUNAVFOR Atalanta. It reports that naval and air assets were deployed in the area, conducted an intensive search, and succeeded in locating the dhow which had been reported as hijacked on February 9. The attack took place off Eyl, on the northern coast of the semi-autonomous Puntland region of Somalia.\nThey highlighted the involvement of a Japanese maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft in this operation along with the Combined Maritime Force. They also closely coordinated with the Somali forces and the Yemeni Coast Guard.\nTheAl Najmawas released when sailing very close to the Somali coast.  The incident is again being classified as an armed robbery at sea because the pirates kept the vessel in territorial waters. A similar case happened in December 2024 when a Chinese fishing vessel was also seized off Somalia.\n\n\n\nAfter the Yemeni vessel was released, the naval forces went aboard for a security check and to confirm the condition of the 12 individuals aboard the vessel. No one was reported injured during the incident.\nThe Atalanta boarding team also proceeded to collect all possible evidence of the incident, which is still under investigation. The operation in the past has been successful in apprehending some of the pirates and turning them over to the local authorities for prosecution. Last year, Atalanta apprehended six individuals during an incident. Since the operation began in 2009, it reports a total of 177 pirates have been transferred to competent authorities with 145 convicted.\nAfter the Yemeni dhow was freed, it reported a malfunction of its engine. The teams from Atalanta assisted the vessel.\nEUNAVOR Atalanta continues to warn vessels in the region to remain vigilant to any piracy-related events. The activity resumed in November 2023 after a long pause. Atalanta received reports of 23 incidents to the end of 2024. It, however, noted in previous reports that there were an unknown number of unreported/unconfirmed incidents involving dhows and smaller vessels."

        "content": "Spire Global reported it has filed a lawsuit against Kpler for a failure to close the acquisition of its maritime group while also warning shareholders of potential debt problems if the deal is not completed. The suit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a declaratory judgment that Kpler breached its obligation and to proceed with the closing of the acquisition.\nKpler, a data and analytics platform,agreed to acquireSpire Maritime, a provider of satellite-powered data for real-time global vessel tracking, from Spire Global with a cash payment based upon an enterprise value of $233.5 million plus an additional $7.5 million for a 12-month transition service and data provision agreement. At the time, Kpler said the acquisition would improve its satellite AIS offering, significantly enhancing real-time visibility and analytics for the maritime and commodity markets. It was the third acquisition for Kpler following the 2023 deals for FleetMon and MarineTraffic.\nSpire Maritime built its niche with real-time capabilities drawing from the proprietary satellites enhanced with analytics. Spire emphasizes that the deal does not include any part of the company’s satellite network or operations.\n“The company believes all the conditions to closing contained in the purchase agreement have been satisfied,” Spire Global reports. It asserts that the “buyer has failed to consummate the closing.” Spire says it believes the failure to close is not consistent with the terms of the agreement which did not give an option to delay closing once all the conditions had been met.\n“Buyer (Kpler) has cited various reasons for declining to close which the company (Spire Global) has rejected,” it writes in the filing. The case was filed on February 10 but Spire warns that there is no assurance that the transaction “will be consummated on the terms contemplated or at all.”\nSpire Global had told shareholders it would use the proceeds to repay its debt. The strategy calls for focusing on its satellite network, technology, and infrastructure that serves the aviation, weather, and space services sectors.\nBefore entering into the purchase agreement with Kpler, Spire Global had also entered into a forbearance agreement with Blue Torch Finance so that its lenders would not exercise rights and remedies with respect to certain events of default. The forbearance expired on December 24, 2024, with Spire warning that the leaders have the right to accelerate and declare its debt due and payable.\n“If the transactions do not close, the company will not have sufficient cash to repay the balance of the loans outstanding,” warns Spire Global. The finance agreement was due to mature on June 13, 2026.\nGiven the delay in the closing with Kpler, Spire Global tells investors it intends to seek additional equity or debt financing.\nThe company is also in discussions with the New York Stock Exchange after having failed to file its financial report for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Spire Global explains it is in the process of restating its financial results for the 2022 and 2023 years and this is delaying the financial reports. The NYSE set February 19 as the deadline but Spire Global warns working with its outside accountants it does not expect to finalize the restatements until the end of February or in early March. Spire is discussing an extension with the NYSE until March 31 for the filing for the June 30, 2024 quarter."

According to the group it was done to mark the approaching third anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to highlight the dangers of the shadow fleet.\nA team of fifteen activists from Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Poland, and Ukraine led the effort. It included at least one rigid high-speed boat which was successful in getting alongside the tanker while others displayed banners with now familiar messages such as “Oil Kills.” The team painted the word in large yellow letters on the side of the ship.\n\"We have painted \"RISK\" on the side of this tanker to draw attention to the huge environmental risk that all the old rusty Russian shadow tankers pose to nature and the marine environment. We cannot just sit and wait for an accident to happen that leaves our coasts and birds smeared in oil,\" said Danish Greenpeace activist Nicoline Hagen.\n\n\n\nThe targeted vessel is theProsperitya chemical tanker built in 2006 and operated for Russia’s Sovcomflot before the imposition of sanctions designed to disrupt the Russian oil trade. The tanker operated as theNS Prideand was one of the vessels reflated to Gabon at the start of 2024. In November 2024, it changed its identity and was registered in Barbados.\nGreenpeace highlights thatProsperitydeparted the Russian terminal in Primosk on February 8 they report loaded with 40,000 metric tons of Russian oil and is heading to Aliaga, Turkey. They contend it was one of four shadow tankers that transited Danish waters yesterday, February 12.\nThe tanker was included in the January 2025 listing of vessels by the United States. Greenpeace highlights its rightful owners are unknown while databases show ownership as a Seychelles-based company, Hellios Oceanway Limited. Greenpeace reports the ship is managed by Fornax Ship Management, based in the UAE, which was also sanctioned by the United States. Greenpeace also said theProsperityis sailing without internationally recognized P&I insurance covering oil spills.\n\n\n\n\"There have been many promises and slightly fewer actual actions from Denmark and the EU, and therefore the shadow fleet continues unabated to transport Russian oil to the world market through the narrow Danish waters. Each of the rusty oil tankers poses a potential risk of an oil disaster,\" said Greenpeace campaign manager Sune Scheller.\nGreenpeace is calling for the EU to increase its efforts against the shadow fleet. The group highlighted the EU has only placed 79 vessels on the sanctions list of which it says 52 are crude oil tankers."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe fire that destroyed the fishing vesselThree Girlsoff the coast of Maine in 2024 was likely caused by a spray of hydraulic oil, according to an investigation by the NTSB. The crew all abandoned ship and survived, in no small part because of timely and creative action by the vessel's master.\nOn August 11, theThree Girlswas under way in the Gulf of Maine on a routine trip, and had five crewmembers and a fishery observer aboard. At about 2050 hours, the crew was hauling in nets and running all hydraulic systems at full power when the captain smelled something burning. He checked the engine room and encountered thick smoke - so thick that he could not clearly see where the fire was coming from. He determined that the blaze was too serious to fight, and he ordered the crew to prepare to abandon ship.\nThe master went to the wheelhouse to make a mayday call. Though the smoke was chokingly thick, he managed to get the call out, and the Coast Guard launched response assets. Before leaving, the master also shut down the winch engine - but could not shut off the main engine or generator (which was still powering the vent fans for the engine room) because there were no remote shutoffs on board. The vessel also lacked ventilation louvers or remote shutoffs for the ventilation fans to cut off oxygen to the fire.\nTo prepare to abandon ship, the mate ran to the accommodations area to retrieve the vessel's immersion suits. He retrieved five suits before smoke and fire forced him out of the space, leaving the crew one suit short. The master instructed the rest of the crew to don the available suits, and he volunteered to abandon ship without wearing one.\nInstead, the crew inflated the life raft on deck, the master climbed in, and the crew pushed the raft down the trawler's stern ramp with the master in it - allowing him to stay dry. The rest of the crew followed down the ramp and into the water, then climbed into the life raft.\nAs a Coast Guard rescue helicopter approached, the master set off two  rocket flares to ensure that the raft was spotted quickly. He turned down an assist from a Good Samaritan fishing vessel, concerned that a transfer from the raft to the hard-hulled fishing boat would be risky for his crew in choppy conditions, and waited for a Coast Guard rescue boat from the cutterWilliam Chadwick.The cutter took all survivors aboard at 2314 hours, and no injuries were reported.\nThe fire burned through the night, destroying most of the engine room, accommodations and wheelhouse. The vessel stayed afloat, but the blaze was hot enough to warp the bulkheads and deckplates.Three Girlswas declared a total loss at a value of $1.3 million.\n\nCourtesy NTSB\nThe Coast Guard, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the NTSB inspected the boat after the fire. They found evidence that the blaze had been hottest near the hydraulic return oil filter housing, next to the winch engine. Based on the fire pattern, they believed that the likely cause was a spray of hydraulic oil from the filter housing, a hydraulic hose fitting or hose segment. A fine high-pressure hydraulic oil spray could have reached uninsulated parts of the winch engine's exhaust system, igniting and then burning through other nearby flammable materials. Most serious engine room fires begin with a spray of fuel or oil onto hot exhaust components.\n\"After an engine room fire ignites, it is imperative to remove the sources of available fuel and ventilation to the fire to prevent it from spreading,\" NTSB concluded. “Vessel designers, builders, owners, and operators are encouraged to install, regularly test, and have emergency drills that incorporate remote shutoffs for all machinery within these spaces to ensure the machinery can be remotely stopped from outside the space where it is situated. Additionally, to prevent the reintroduction of oxygen to the space, vessel designers and owners should ensure that the ventilation, both natural and forced draft, can be completely and remotely secured to all engine rooms.\""

The shipbuilding has been working on its project as one of several that believe the new generation of small nuclear reactors will be the solution to maritime decarbonization.\nInterest in nuclear-powered propulsion for merchant ships dates back to the 1950s when it was seen to hold great promise. The United States was the first country to successfully build and operate a demonstration cargo-passenger ship, NS Savannah, which provided many insights into the industry but also showed the practical challenges of nuclear propulsion. Japan and Germany also tested concepts but Russia currently is the only country operating nuclear-powered commercial shipping with its icebreakers and one containership run by the state.\n\"Nuclear-powered vessels can be a game-changer in the current shipbuilding market, where carbon neutrality is emerging,\" said Patrick Ryan, Chief Technology Officer of ABS. The classification society has conducted studies for the U.S. on the future of nuclear propulsion. Ryan said, \"ABS and HD KSOE will contribute to accelerating the commercialization of marine nuclear technology in the global shipbuilding market.\"\nKSOE had proposed concepts and in 2024 obtained Approval in Principle from ABS for a design model applying Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. It is one of several concepts the industry is looking at for the next generation of nuclear-powered merchant ships.\n\"HD KSOE is strengthening cooperation not only with major classification societies but also with international regulatory bodies to establish international regulations necessary for the commercialization of nuclear-powered vessels,\" said Park Sangmin, Head of HD KSOE's Green Energy Research Lab. \"Starting with the land-based SMR reactor manufacturing project, we aim to develop a marine nuclear business model by 2030.\"\nSince February last year, HD KSOE has been accelerating related technology development through joint research on next-generation SMRs with TerraPower. In December, the company secured an order to manufacture the main equipment for TerraPower's Natrium reactor, which is being constructed in Wyoming.\nIn the maritime sector, KSOE unveiled an advanced design for a 15,000 TEU containership using SMR technology. The new design model features enhanced economic efficiency and safety by incorporating actual equipment and safety design concepts KSOE reports.\nHD KSOE has also optimized the space previously occupied by large engine room equipment to accommodate additional containers, enhancing the economic efficiency of the design concept. The company has also applied a marine radiation shielding system using a double-tank method with stainless steel and a coolant based on light water to ensure safety. The shipbuilder announced that in collaboration with global energy technology company Baker Hughes, they have applied a supercritical carbon dioxide-based propulsion system, which would improve thermal efficiency by approximately five percent compared to existing steam-based propulsion systems.\nHD KSOE plans to establish a marine nuclear demonstration facility at its Future Technology Test Center in Yongin, South Korea to verify safety designs.\nThe company is committed to advancing the design concepts. HD Hyundai’s business strategy for the shipbuilding operation focuses on advanced technologies, green shipping, and automation. Using this approach it looks to maintain leadership in the high-value vessel segment of the shipbuilding market."

Work has also begun on the third cruise ship of the class, rumored to be namedLegend of the Seas, with the first blocks lowered into the dry dock in October 2024. The ship is due for delivery in 2026. Royal Caribbean also ordered a fourth vessel of the class for delivery in 2027 and took options to build a fifth and sixth Icon Class ship.\nThe yard is also building two new Turva class patrol vessels for the Finnish Border Guard. The first will be delivered in 2025 and the second in 2026.\nMeyer took ownership of the Turku shipyard in 2014 from STX Europe and the following year increased to 100 percent ownership. The yard trades its origins to 1737 and came to fame in the 1960s till 1990 as part of the Wärtsilä shipbuilder along with the facility in Helsinki. Historically, it built cruise ships including the first in the modern cruise industry for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, car-passenger ferries, and special vessels including icebreakers. It encountered financial difficulties in the 1990s. Meyer recently had to cede ownership of its yard in Germany as part of a rescue package from the German state.\n“We have implemented several measures to turn our operations profitable again,” said Tim Meyer, CEO of Meyer Turku. “We have developed our organization, streamlined our processes, implemented a new enterprise resource planning system, and launched a development program.” While the yard delivered theIcon of the Seasin November 2023 as the world’s largest cruise ship, reports indicate as the lead of the class the company lost money on the construction due to the complex nature of the project.\nEskola joined Wärtsilä in 1998 with a background in international projects and corporate finance. He advanced at the company becoming President of Wärtsilä Marine Solutions and as of November 1, 2015, CEO and President of the company. Eskola was replaced in the spring of 2021 by Håkan Agnevall but continued as a senior advisor to the board and executive team until retiring on June 30, 2021.\nTom Johnstone, Chairman of the Board of Wärtsilä Corporation, credited Eskola with developing Wärtsilä into a smart technology company for the marine and energy markets."

        "content": "\nThe government of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is taking steps that it sees as countering China’s expansionist move across the region. Australia is moving to increase its influence in the region to counter China and today China responded angrily after an incident in the air over the South China Sea where China says Australia “deliberately infringed upon China’s rights and interest.”\n“We urge Australia to abandon its fantasy of speculation and adventure, strictly restrain the actions of its frontline naval and air forces, and not be willing to be a follower and thug, stirring up trouble in the South China Sea and harming others and itself,” said Defense Ministry Spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang answers reporters' questions.\nThe exchange of words came after Australia yesterday expressed its concerns following what it called “an unsafe and unprofessional interaction,” between a Chinese plane and a Royal Australian Air Force maritime patrol aircraft. Australia contends for decades it has undertaken maritime surveillance activities in the region over the South China Sea, but on Tuesday, February 11 a Chinese aircraft encroached and released flares close to its aircraft.\n“Australia expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a safe and professional manner,” said the Australian Government Department of Defence. Other nations including the Philippines, which is dealing with its own assertions of Chinese expansionism, quickly responded also expressing concern over the incident.\nChina responded saying Australia “complained first and spread false narratives.” Zhang asserted that the Australian aircraft had “ignored the main road in the South Chian Sea,” and intruded into Chinese airspace.\n\n\nKimbe Port, West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea\n\nThe Albanese government has been working to reign in China to protect Australian interests. At the end of last week, it was announced that the government through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific would be providing loans to the Government of Papua New Guinea for a port infrastructure upgrade program. Speculation is that the step was taken to block attempts by China to lead the port upgrades. China has been currying favor and increasing influence through its port projects worldwide, including the operations of terminals at the Panama Canal which led to Donald Trump’s assertions China is now running the Panama Canal.\nAustralia is providing an A$95.7 million (US$61 million) loan which will support the upgrade of Kimbe Port in West New Britain Province. The port plays a critical role in trade handling 90 percent of the palm oil trade in the Province, which is one of the country’s largest exports. The work is scheduled to begin in early 2025 and conclude in 2026, and it will increase resilience against climate impacts and enhance freight services.\n“The project reinforces Australia’s commitment to supporting PNG’s economic growth and regional connectivity and will improve infrastructure reliability, strengthen supply chain efficiency, improve connectivity, and boost local economic opportunities,” said Australian officials announcing the project.\nThe Kimbe Port project is the first of five major upgrades Australia is supporting in Papua New Guinea, with Oro Bay, Daru, the Lae Tidal Basin, and Kavieng also set to benefit from improved port facilities. The project to upgrade ports across Papua New Guinea is expected to cost A$621.4 million (US$395 million)."

        "content": "\nThe move of cars and trucks through U.S. ports continues to grow and as of 2024, Georgia’s Brunswick terminal has become the largest for handling RoRo volumes in the United States. The Georgia Port Authority has been investing in the facilities after deciding to concentrate RoRo volumes in Brunswick while Savannah becomes devoted to container handling.\nDuring a State of the Port event on Wednesday, Georgia Ports President and CEO Griff Lynch highlighted the growth of the Colonel’s Island Terminal reporting it handled more than 2 million tons of Roll-on/Roll-off cargo in 2024. Brunswick achieved a record year, handling 901,912 units of autos and heavy equipment in 2024 with autos up 13.3 percent and heavy equipment up 160 percent. Brunswick also took the top spot in the nation at 600,000 tons for RoRo exports.\nThe operations in Georgia have been expanding rapidly in part due to the increased investment by car manufacturers in facilities in Georgia and the Southeast. The Port of Baltimore had long dominated the U.S. market for RoRo volumes. In 2023, Baltimore handled a record 765,019 tons up 42 percent. That consisted of approximately 847,000 cars and light trucks.\nBaltimore’s 2024 volume was of course impacted by the harbor being closed for weeks after the containershipDalidestroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge in late March. Georgia became the destination for vehicle carriers that were diverting from Baltimore. The Georgia Ports Authority handled 80,600 units of RoRo cargo in April 2024, an increase of more than 44 percent or 24,760 units versus April 2023. Approximately 9,000 import vehicles and 1,000 high/heavy equipment they reported had been diverted from the Port of Baltimore.\nAcross-the-board improvements in our shipping channel, berths, rail capacity, storage, and processing capacity will help ensure that as their volumes grow, our customers will continue to enjoy world-class service and make long-term gains in their business,” said GPA Board Chairman Kent Fountain.\nGPA highlights that $262 million in improvements at the Port of Brunswick were completed in 2024, adding new warehousing and processing space, as well as 122 acres of RoRo cargo storage. Construction has also started on a new railyard on Colonel’s Island, which will increase the port’s capacity to export vehicles arriving by rail.\nPhase I of the new railyard will increase the port’s annual rail capacity from approximately 150,000 autos to more than 340,000 by mid-2025. Phase II will bring annual rail capacity to 590,000 units, greater than three times the current capacity. More than 90 percent of vehicles moving by rail in Brunswick are U.S.-made exports.\nSeparately, construction on a fourth RoRo berth is in the planning stages and is expected to start in the summer of 2025. The new berth should be complete in 2027 and will more efficiently accommodate vessels carrying 10,800+ car equivalent units (CEU).\nPort officials highlight that one of the challenges they need to plan for is the increase in the size of the vessels and their capacity. Wallenius Wilhelmsen, which signed a 20-year agreement with the GPA in April 2024, reported in November that it was adjusting its orderbook. The company has a total of 14 Shaper class vessels on order, eight of which with a capacity of 11,700 CEU and six with a capacity of 9,300 CEU vessels.\nBrunswick the GPA highlights has become a center of excellence for RoRo. They highlight the future berth, processing and land, connectivity, and harbor modifications all designed to support growth in the sector."

        "content": "\nA Dutch project contributing to the development of autonomous navigation continues to make progress. By 2023 it had developed critical data and demonstrated its concepts with a Damen patrol boat, and now the vessel is being upgraded for the next round of testing in the summer of 2025.\nKnown as the Fieldlab Autonomous Sailing Technology (F.A.S.T.) project, it is working with a Damen Stan Patrol 900 patrol boat at its core, as it works to lay the foundation for groundbreaking developments in autonomous ship technology. The boat is 8.6 meters (28 feet in length) and has an operating speed of 15 knots and a top speed of 21 knots.\nThe organizers highlight the ability to increase efficient, sustainable operations while increasing safety through autonomous operations. Critically they also point to the potential to help alleviate crew shortages.\nCommenting on what makes the project unique, Eef Uittenbogaard, project manager at Alewijnse said,“It’s the combination of innovation, close collaboration with the client, and the speed at which we adapt. This is truly a ‘fast’ project. As a company, we are contributing to progressive, rapid developments that will benefit not only the maritime industry but also the world.”\nAlewijnse, a systems integrator that develops tailored electrical and automation solutions is one of the partners in the project. The project involves collaboration with Damen Naval, the Province of Zeeland, the Municipality of Vlissingen, the HZ University of Applied Sciences, TU Delft, and other companies. Together the companies report they will lay the groundwork for autonomous sailing using a remotely operated vessel at the testbed in the Port of Vlissingen.\n\n\nDuring a prior phase of the testing (Alewijnse)\n\nThe main test bed is the Damen Stan Patrol 900, a 1990-built polycat. The test vessel is currently undergoing a transformation, with its two diesel engines being replaced with slightly more powerful electric motors. The boat will also be equipped with cameras, sensors, radar, Lidar, GPS, and wind and speed measurement instruments. These sensors will replace the traditional eyes and ears of a helmsman.\n“As a co-creator, Alewijnse is excited to contribute to the electrical scope of the project,” said Uittenbogaard. “With our 135 years of expertise and experience, we can collaborate with Damen and provide the complete package, from engineering and panel construction to the efficient placement of electrical components for propulsion and energy supply.”\nAccording to the companies participating in the project, it is just the beginning, with more ambitious programs designed to apply the technology to much larger ships to follow."

Plans call for the liner to depart Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Monday, February 17, to be towed to Mobile, Alabama.\nAfter numerous delays, tugs and crews handled the nearly 1,000-foot liner timed to the midday high tide on the Delaware River. After having been at Pier 82 since 1996, the lines were released and tugs diagonalized her across the slipway moving the stern first and then the bow. She was resecured to Pier 80 on the north side of the slipway where she will remain until Monday, February 17. Reports are that there is a final planning meeting on Saturday to prepare for the momentous tow.\nMonday morning, tugboats will maneuver the ssUnited Statesout into the Delaware River channel and then proceed with the tow down river at low tide at approximately 11:18 a.m. (local time). The ship will pass under various roadway bridges, including the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322), and the Delaware Memorial Bridge (I-295) along her route. The Delaware River Port Authority has said it will be coordinating bridge closures as she passes underneath, but because it is a federal holiday road traffic is expected to be lighter than a normal workday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SS United States Conservancy which continues to work with the liner’s new owners, Okaloosa County, Florida, is following the move. They plan to livestream the tow under the Walt Whitman Bridge on theirFacebook page.\nFor the tow, she will be secure to a more powerful tug. According to the tow plan, it is the Vinik No. 6, a twin screw tug, rated at 5,700 horsepower. Okaloosa has said the tow plan will be adjusted utilizing real-time route planning, which will adjust the ship's course every six hours based on weather and currents. They plan to post a track of the ship's courseonline.\nThe tow is expected to require approximately 14 days. When she reaches Mobile, she will be docked at the Modern American Repair & Recycling Services facility where the remediation work will proceed. Lose paint, PCBs, and other contaminants need to be removed as well as the fuel in her tanks. All the windows and portholes are to be removed and her funnels and radar mast dismantled and handed to the Conservancy which will explore incorporating them into a visitor’s center and museum to be in the Destin-Fort Walton Beach area. The plan says it will require a year to prepare the liner for her reefing.\n\n\n\nIn a farewell gesture to Philadelphia, a group of volunteers went aboard yesterday afternoon and positioned lights on the ship. At dark, her bridge front was illuminated in green in honor of the Philadelphia Eagles football team that last weekend won the Superbowl. The city was hosting a victory celebration for the team today.\nA few loyal fans of the liner were at the fence line of the pier today to watch as she began her final trip. It comes 75 years after the keel was laid for the liner in the dry dock at Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company. In 1952, at an average speed of 36 knots, the ssUnited Statesbecame the last liner to capture the speed record for an Atlantic crossing. She remained in commercial passenger service, and in later years also did a few pleasure cruises, before being retired in 1969. She passed through a succession of owners between 1980 and 2024, with plans to resume her service or to convert her to a static attraction.\nAfter owning the ship since February 2011, the Conservancy relinquished ownership after becoming involved in a dispute with the operators of the pier. A court ordered the ship to vacate the pier. Unable to relocate the ship, the non-profit sold it to Okaloosa Country in October 2024 for $1 million as part of a $10 million plan to turn the famous ship into the world’s largest man-made reef."

Despite strong demand in the LNG carrier segment, the company believes there are stronger opportunities in the FLNG (floating liquefied natural gas) as it redirects all of its focus to that segment.\nThe sale price for the vessel which was built in 2003, is $24 million before transaction-related expenses and it is unencumbered.Golar Arctichas a capacity of 140,000 cbm and is a stream turbine vessel, a growing rarity in the industry. The vessel reportedly offloaded its last cargo in Taichung, Taiwan over a week ago and its AIS signal shows it is anchored off Malacca City, Malaysia awaiting orders. Golar reports the transaction is expected to close, and the vessel is to be handed over to its new owner, within Q1 2025.\nGolar, which started its life at Gotaas Larsen in 1946 was an early entrant into the LNG market after having made investments in other segments including an earlier investor in the cruise ship business. Gotaas Larsen in the 1960s acquired Eastern Steamship Lines, an early cruise pioneer from Miami, and was the third investor joining Wilhelmsen and Skaugen in Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines.\nGotaas-Larsen entered the LNG shipping market, ordering the LNG carrierHilliin 1970 and became Golar LNG in 2001. It then embarked on its first significant LNG carrier newbuilding program. Efforts to develop its first FLNG began a decade later in 2012 and by 2024 they reported the company was down to just two gas carriers.\n\n\nFuji LNG arriving in China to begin conversion into an FLNG (Morten Skjong)\n\n“The sale of theGolar Arcticmarks the conclusion of Golar’s planned exit from the LNG shipping segment, 50 years after taking delivery of our first LNG carrier in 1975. Over the last 50 years LNG shipping has been the foundation for Golar’s pioneering maritime LNG infrastructure advances, including FSRUs and FLNGs,” said Golar CEO Karl Fredrik Staubo.\nThe company’s other remaining LNG carrier,Fuji LNG(115,000 cbm) was acquired in 2023 with the intent to convert the ship. She discharged her final cargo as an LNG carrier in January 2025. Chief Technical Officer at Golar LNG, Morten Skjong, reports she will be the donor vessel for Golar LNG's third FLNG conversion (the Mk II FLNG). She arrived earlier today at Yantai CIMC Raffles Offshore to start the conversion. They expect she will be available starting in Q4 2027 becoming the company’s fourth FLNG.\n“Golar’s transition into a focused FLNG infrastructure company is now complete. We look forward to expanding our market-leading FLNG position,” said Karl Fredrik Staubo.\nIn January 2025, Golar LNG also reported it had entered into an agreement to sell its shares in Avenir LNG to Stolt-Nielsen Gas for approximately $40 million. Golar along with Stolt Nielsen and Höegh built Avenir LNG into one of the largest small-scale LNG shipping companies. Avenir has a fleet of five LNG bunker/supply ships with two more under construction. The sale was a further part of Golar LNG's refocusing to its FLNG business.\n\nTop photo byKees Tornof Golar Arctic in 2019 -CC BY-SA 2.0"

The company celebrating the naming of its newest containershipONE Sparkle(138,000 dwt) which it reports is the first owned and operated newbuild for the company.\n\"The naming of ONE Sparkle represents another important milestone for ONE,” said Jeremy Nixon, CEO. “This vessel is our first owned newbuilding, and it also showcases our commitment to sustainable shipping with its innovative design and alternative fuel capabilities. As we expand our owned fleet, these advanced vessels will play a crucial role in meeting our environmental targets while enhancing our service reliability.\"\nThe company was established in 2017 through the integration of the container operations of K-Line, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), and NYK Group. The first sailing was in 2018 and by its fifth anniversary, the company was highlighting had more than 165 services connecting 120 countries. Today, the fleet is up to 255 ships with a capacity of 1.97 million TEU placing ONE sixth on Alphaliner’s ranking of the largest carriers.\nNixon in 2022 mapped out the second stage of growth for the company reporting plans to invest $20 billion by 2030. He said the time had come for the company to begin placing its own orders for newbuilds and to own its ships. By 2030, Nixon said that they would contract for a total capacity of 1.2 million TEU, but approximately half of that would be replacements for existing capacity. AlphaLiner calculates the company currently has 47 vessels on order representing 610,558 TEU of capacity. In 2023, ONE also joined with the investment group as Seaspan was taken private. They operate OneSea Solutions as the ship management company which is jointly owned by ONE and Seaspan.\nONE Sparklewas part of an order for new ships being built by HD Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea and a parallel order placed with Nihon in Japan. Nixon said today during the naming for the new ship that it is part of a series of 20 large ammonia/methanol-ready vessels that will be built in Korea and Japan and scheduled for delivery in 2025 and 2026.\nONE Sparklehas a capacity of approximately 13,800 TEU and it is 1,00 feet (335 meters) in length. Among the advanced environmental features is the design enabling the future conversion to methanol or ammonia as its fuel. The hull design was also optimized for improved energy efficiency and it is outfitted with the latest energy-saving devices. Integrated smart technology will ensure optimal vessel performance. It also has the capability to employ shore power. The ship was classed by ABS and is registered in Singapore.\nThe new vessel is due to head out on its final sea trials in a week before her handover. Once delivered, ONE says the vessel will strengthen its competitive position in the service it is deployed to, and showcase the company’s commitment to sustainable shipping practices.\nThe company continues to grow its operations announcing new routes trans-Atlantic as well as Far East to South America and using ports such as Vietnam. It is also set to take a major role in the reformulated Premier Alliance that went effective this month. The cooperation between ONE, HMM, and Yang Ming is going it alone after Hapag-Lloyd withdrew to start its new cooperation with Maersk."

        "content": "\nSuccessful trials were conducted in December 2024 on a new system that uses industrial laser technology to remove rust, paint, and other coasts from the hull of a ship. The goal is to create a system that is more environmentally friendly and the project also highlights it has the potential for automation.\nMitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), MOL Drybulk, and Tsuneishi Shipbuilding cooperated for the test which was performed on one of MOL Drybulk’s bulkers while at the shipyard. Furukawa Electric is developing the system for rust and coating removal, leveraging the technology it cultivated in industrial lasers. MOL reports that by applying the metal processing technology developed by Furukawa for processes such as welding, cutting, and surface treatment, the goal is the optimization of irradiation conditions for rust and paint removal in the undercoating of ships.\nFurukawa Electric, with the cooperation of MOL and MOL Drybulk, has been developing since 2021 a rust and coating removal system for onboard maintenance, utilizing the surface treatment solution based on \"InfraLaser\" technology cultivated in industrial lasers. Additionally, since 2022, Furukawa Electric and Tsuneishi Shipbuilding have also been conducting demonstration experiments to apply the same system to ship repairs.\n\n\nClose up of the removal test as the companies also study automation of the task (MOL)\n\nDuring ship repairs, rust and coatings are removed for hull inspection and repainting. However, the current sandblasting method, which removes rust and coatings by blasting abrasive materials against the surface, scatters waste materials and paint as debris, necessitating recovery efforts. Due to increased environmental laws, many shipyards are also required to erect barriers or coverings to limit the area where the debris travels.\nBy replacing this with a laser-blasting method, the companies believe it will generate minimal waste, dust, and noise. They expect to reduce environmental impact and improve occupational health, especially in shipyards.\nHaving completed the successful field trial of the \"Infralaser\" rust and coating removal system the companies report they will accelerate the development of an innovative laser application system for ship repair that can replace the conventional sandblasting method for rust and paint removal and coatings.\nThey will also continue to study the automation of the system by taking advantage of the laser's zero reaction force, aiming to achieve labor savings and automate the ship maintenance and repair process."

        "content": "\nThe cruise market in India is continuing to grow drawing increased attention from multiple companies. Mostly it has been a port of call for cruise ships transiting the Indian Ocean, but it has also begun to develop a domestic cruise business.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has designated cruise tourism as a priority sector. Cordelia Cruises which is the sole firm active in the market currently says India’s cruise industry is poised to substantially boost both domestic and international tourism while generating significant employment opportunities for the nation’s youth. Having launched operations in 2021, the company reports it has carried over 530,000 passengers and is operating close to its full capacity.\nThe board of the parent company, Waterways Leisure Tourism, reports that it has decided to pursue expansion including fundraising efforts. The group is targeting a funding of Rs. 800 crores ($92 million) possibly through an initial public offer.\nCordelia was the latest effort to start a domestic Indian cruise line following a similar effort that started before the pandemic known as Jalesh Cruises. The firm did not survive the pause in operations during the pandemic and its sole ship theKarnika(ex.Pacific Jewel,Crown Princessbuilt in 1990) was sold for scrap. The assets of the company wereacquiredby Waterways.\nThe company operates a sole cruise ship, theEmpress(48,500 gross tons) with accommodations for 1,840 passengers. When the ship was introduced in 1990 as theNordic Empressshe was considered pioneering by incorporating mega-ship designs into a smaller vessel. She operated for Royal Caribbean International on short cruises later becoming theEmpress of the Seasand for a time operating for the company’s Spanish company Pullmantur as theEmpress. She was sold to lower costs during the pandemic.\nCordelia reports it will be in the market for two secondhand cruise ships each with a capacity of approximately 2,000 passengers.\n“We are in discussions with major cruise companies from the U.S. and Europe who are looking to divest ownership of their smaller ships with passenger capacities ranging between 2,000 to 2,500 guests per ship, as they transition to newer vessels with capacities of 5,000-7,000 guests,” said Jurgen Bailom, President & CEO of Cordelia Cruises.\nWhen asked if Cordelia has already closed a deal for the ship purchase, Bailom responded, “We have multiple offers from existing cruise lines as they upgrade their fleets with larger ships. Given the current market dynamics, it is an opportune time for us to expand our fleet.”\nResorts World Cruises which was started by Genting after Star Cruises and Dream Cruises collapsed, also reports it is planning to enter the Indian cruise market. Schedules were announced for theResorts World One(75,000 gross tons exSuperStar Virgo) to offer cruises from Mumbai between March and June 2025. The company highlighted that it would be tailoring its product to the Indian market with a variety of offerings and entertainment, thematic cruises, and authentic cuisines from around the world, including certified Indian vegetarian, Jain, and halal food. The launch however was deferred till 2026 due to a fleet redeployment as Resorts World Cruises adds its third cruise ship to the fleet this spring.\nOther cruise lines including Costa have occasionally based a ship for short periods in India working with local companies to market the cruises. With India’s emerging middle class and the efforts by Prime Minister Modi to expand India’s economy, cruising stands to benefit and is poised to realize the developing opportunities."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nWith Russia’s footprint in the Mediterranean facing uncertainty, the deal for a naval base in Sudan has reached a new milestone. Last week, Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) foreign minister Ali Youssef Ahmed al-Sharif was in Moscow, where he met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Although the negotiations for the base were not part of the meeting, Ali Sharif said there was no disagreement on the deal, assuming that the SAF can win or reach a stalemate in its two-year civil war against the breakaway Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n“There was a deal which was signed and there are no obstacles. We are in complete agreement,” said Sharif.\nRussia signed an agreement with the government of Sudan for the naval base under the regime of former dictator Omar al- Bashir, who was ousted in a coup by his former generals back in 2019, leading eventually to the SAF’s rule over most of the country. In 2021, SAF leaders said that the government would review the deal to align with the country’s interests.\nThe ongoing civil war in Sudan since 2023 has stalled progress on the base deal. A logistical base for Russia is Sudan - the first in Africa - could provide Moscow with desperately-needed access to a regional basing arrangement. Russia’s 50-year foothold in the Mediterranean at the port of Tartus, Syria, is endangered and may already be lost. The setbacks facing the Russian Mediterranean flotilla has likely sent Moscow on an overdrive for an alternative base. It remains to be seen if Eastern Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar or the government of Algeria might offer a base to the Russian Mediterranean fleet, or if such a basing arrangement could be a suitable replacement for Tartus.\nEither way, the willingness of Sudan to offer Russia a base is still good news for Moscow. As a logistics support point for the Russian navy, the Port of Sudan could easily accommodate four warships, including nuclear-powered ones. Some analysts believe that the base would restore Russia’s permanent presence in the Indian Ocean. Russia lost this privilege at the end of the Cold War: the Soviet-era naval base in Berbera, Somalia closed in 1997, and the Nokra base in Eritrea (then part of Ethiopia) closed in 1991.\nBut given its location, the Port of Sudan base would have serious limitations as an alternative launch pad for reconstituting Russia’s Mediterranean Flotilla.\n“The logistical constraints of negotiating Suez Canal, particularly in cases of requiring emergency maintenance, are significant. Operationally, canal transits also clearly signpost ship movements to adversaries,” argue naval experts Edward Black and Sidharth Kaushal."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "MAIB has published its final accident investigation report into the capsizing and foundering of stern trawlerNjord, which went down about 50 nautical miles north-east of Peterhead, Scotland in 2022. MAIB found that post-construction modifications had reduced the vessel's initial stability, and that a large haul of fish was enough to capsize the vessel.\nOn March 5, 2022, the 27-meterNjorddeparted Peterhead to fish in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, with a crew of eight on board. In the early hours of the following morning,Njordarrived at a position about 130 nautical miles north-east of Peterhead and put out its fishing net over a gas pipeline from the Sleipner A gas platform. The vessel towed its net along the pipeline until 1100, when the net was hauled in. The catch was the largest the crew had ever seen, the equivalent of roughly 30 tonnes of fish.\nNjordwas a 1992-built trawler with a setup not commonly found in high-seas fisheries. Her net reels were at the stern, but recovery of the catch occurred on the starboard bow. The cod end had to be hauled up over the starboard rail using a winch and lifting frame, and then the fish were fed into a hatch in the foredeck for processing.\nCourtesy MAIB\nThis time around, the catch was 30 times as abundant as usual. The crew towed the cod end around to the starboard side using a power block, then used a loop of line and a winch to haul up about one tonne of fish at a time into the hopper on the foredeck. After about ten lifts and ten tonnes in the hopper, theNjordhad a list of about 10-15 degrees. The crew went below to start processing the catch.\nWithin an hour, they had only processed and stowed about three tonnes of the fish, and the skipper wanted to move more quickly. He ordered them to haul up more of the catch and fill the hopper again. Two more lifts went well enough, but on the third lift, the vessel took on a heavy list from the weight of the fish hanging from the net reel and the winch on the bow.\nAs the list increased, theNjordbegan to downflood, and the situation changed very rapidly. Despite efforts to cut loose the net, theNjordslowly rolled over to starboard, and the crew escaped by climbing out onto the port side of the hull and walking up onto the upturned keel. For floatation, they had only one life ring for eight people, and no immersion suits. None of the life rafts popped to the surface; it is likely that they were all caught in the vessel's rigging and deck gear.\nThe vessel's EPIRB self-activated at about 1340, and the Norwegian Coast Guard launched a response. A SAR helicopter dispatched from the Johan Sverdrup oil platform arrived on scene at about 1416 and stood by as the OSVOlympic Challengerapproached to conduct a surface rescue. As theChallengerprepared to launch its fast rescue boat, theNjordsuddenly began to sink from beneath the survivors' feet. Within moments, all eight fishermen were in the water: six who were hanging on to one lifering, and two who were attempting to swim to stay afloat.\nThe SAR helicopter crew deployed their rescue swimmer to try to save the two men who had nothing to hang onto. The first fisherman to be hoisted up was retrieved alive, though he was briefly unconscious and had ingested water and diesel. The second was pulled up six minutes later. By the time the rescue swimmer got to him, he had sunk below the surface, and he was retrieved in an unresponsive state. Despite medical attention he did not recover.\nThe SAR helicopter recovered one more survivor from the life ring group, then headed for shore; theOlympic Challenger'sfast rescue boat saved the last five survivors.\nIn 2021, before the casualty voyage, theNjordhad been modified with the addition of two prawn net reels and an icemaker towards the stern, but no evaluation was made of the effect on stability. MAIB reconstructed the vessel's stability based on the best available figures, and found that the vessel may have failed the test on one of seven standard loading conditions (though the findings were not definitive).\nAdditionally, MAIB found that progressive flooding began rapidly through an unapproved and undocumented drain pipe that had been installed through a watertight bulkhead on the starboard side. Assuming that the valve on the drain had been left open, modeling suggested that the passageway probably began flooding through the drain at about 17 degrees of inclination, and a load of about 4 to 7.5 tonnes on the net would have been enough to start the process.\n\"It is likely thatNjordwould not have capsized had the valve on the drain been closed, as it should have been, while the vessel was at sea,\" MAIB concluded.\nThat reduced downflooding angle, combined with the extreme luck of a 30-tonne catch, may have been enough to sink the ship - and the crew may have been willing to overlook the danger signs, especially in flat-calm surface conditions.\n\"It is likely that the new experience of such a large catch led the crew to perceiveNjord’sheavy listing as normal under the circumstances. A large catch meant significant remuneration for all of the crew as share fishermen, and their delight might have influenced their judgment of and consideration towards safety,\" wrote MAIB. \"Had the net been cut away immediately, and the additional fish not been added to the hopper, the vessel might have been saved.\"\nMAIB noted that the crew were incredibly lucky that the EPIRB had floated free. The captain did not manage to get off a VHF distress call before the capsizing, and if the EPIRB had not activated itself and reached the surface, it is likely that the entire crew would have perished in the cold water."

The impact caused minor damage to the hull and several exterior structures, but the impact was comparatively limited.\n“While the ship is fully mission capable and the ship conducted flight operations following the collision, pulling into port for emergent repairs will enable the ship to continue deployment as scheduled,” said Capt. Dave Snowden,Harry S. Truman’scommanding officer.\nThe hull damage - all above the waterline - includes the exterior bulkheads of two storage rooms and a maintenance space. Externally, the impact damaged a line handling space, a part of the fantail, and the platform above a storage space. Luckily, the aircraft elevator located in the same area sustained no damage, and the command says that it is fully operational.\nForward-deployed maintenance units in Souda Bay are carrying out an assessment and repair process to fix the damage.\n“The Harry S.

This becomes the second port of call for FESCO in Malaysia.\nFESCO entered the Malaysian shipping scene almost six months ago, with a service at Port Klang connecting to the Vietnamese port of Ho Chi Minh City. The route is served once a week, with a transit time of three days between the ports.\nThe addition of Pasir Gudang will expand the geography of the FESCO Intra Asia Service (FIAS) between Malaysia and Vietnam, according to the company. The service is served by a 400 TEU containership from the FESCO fleet. The first departure from Pasir Gudang took place on February 8.\n“Pasir Gudang is one of the largest ports in Malaysia, which is literally next door to Singapore. Our team did a great job for FESCO to receive permission for cabotage transportation from the Malaysian authorities. On the very first voyage, we sent cargo not only from Pasir Gudang to Russia via our hub in Ho Chi Minh City, but also carried out domestic transportation between Malaysian ports,” said German Maslov, Vice President of FESCO’s Liner Logistics Division.\nMaslov added that FESCO is planning to expand FIAS to Thailand and also studying the possibility of adding a second vessel to the service. FESCO wants to develop FIAS as an Asian feeder line to deliver additional cargo volumes to Russia from markets such as Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India and Thailand.\nThe ramp-up of FESCO’s service in Southeast Asian countries follows the launch of a subsidiary enterprise, DBF Logistics Vietnam, back in December. Besides FIAS, the new company will ensure smooth operation of the FESCO Vietnam Direct Line, which connects Russia’s Far East Port of Vladivostok and Vietnam’s Haiphong and Ho Chi Minh City.\n“The container transportation market is actively developing between Russia and Vietnamese ports. We transported 25,700 TEU last year. Therefore, we essentially grew several times over in three years,” said FESCO’s Group President, Pyotr Ivanov.\nMeanwhile, as the West tightens economic sanctions against Russia, there is a noticeable drop in the amount of liquid cargo handled at Russian ports. Last week, the Russian Commercial Seaports Association reported that cargo handling in major ports fell by 1.6 percent year-on-year to 71.6 million tons in January. Liquid cargo transshipment fell 6.1 percent to 37.3 million tons, including 8.5 percent to 21.2 million tons of crude oil and 5.1 percent to 11.6 million tons of oil products. However, handling of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose 4.4 percent to 3.4 million tons."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The battle lines are being drawn for the next round of alternative fuel debate and the steps that will contribute to the IMO’s emission reduction goals. A group of NGOs, including the well-known T & E (European Federation for Transport and Environment), joined with major shipping lines including Hapag-Lloyd calling for the IMO to exclude biofuels from its list of green alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. They argue it would be unsustainable and could produce more harm than good.\nA study commissioned by T&E and conducted by Cerulogy reports that nearly a third of global shipping could run on biofuel in 2030 up from less than 1 percent today. They point out that while well intention in its original concept to reuse waste oil, the price advantage of biofuels could result in unsustainable demand.\nThe report concludes that waste biofuels will likely be able to cover just a small portion of shipping’s projected biofuel demand as their availability is limited. They highlight that major carriers including MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and CMA CGM have invested in the use of biofuels derived from used cooking oil and animal fats. However, with the supplies limited, they conclude that just 2.5 to 3 percent of shipping could run out of used cooking oil and animal fat biofuels by 2030.\nThe vast majority (60 percent) of biofuels they argue will have to come from palm and soy. This they theorize would put pressure on vegetable oil prices. They point to a doubling of the use of palm oil biofuels in the EU between 2010 and 2020 following the introduction of a law promoting biofuels in cars.\nCountries such as France, Norway, and the Netherlands, T&E notes, have already restricted or stopped using palm and soy biofuels domestically, while the EU itself has excluded the use of food crops from its flagship shipping fuels regulation (FuelEU). There was a large debate on the competition for food supplies if the oils were also to be used as biofuels.\n“As things stand the IMO risks doing more harm than good. Palm and soy biofuels are devastating for the climate and they take up vast amounts of land,” argues Constance Dijkstra, shipping manager at T&E. “Instead of creating new problems, the global shipping community must focus on green fuels made from hydrogen. Burning crops is never the answer.”\nThe report speculates that the fuel-intensive shipping industry would need vast amounts of farmland, possibly 34 million hectares in 2030 - the total area of Germany - to produce enough crops to meet the increased biofuel demand from the shipping industry. T&E argues this could have serious impacts on food supplies. Land that could be used for farming would need to be converted to growing biofuel crops while burning vegetable oil in ships will deprive supermarkets of a staple food item.\nThis poses a serious climate problem, warns T&E, as palm and soy are responsible for two to three times more carbon emissions than even the dirtiest shipping fuels today, once deforestation and land clearance are taken into account.\nThe release of the report coincides with the start of the Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG) in advance of the upcoming IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in April. The April session is a key step in designating the tactics the IMO will take to meet its goals for cutting shipping emissions."

        "content": "\nThe Trump administration has signed off on permitting approvals for two major oil and gas export projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast: the Texas GulfLink offshore oil loading terminal, and the Commonwealth LNG plant in Louisiana. Both projects had been awaiting approval for years under the Biden administration.\nTexas GulfLink (TGL) is one of several proposed deepwater oil loading terminals on the Gulf Coast, all designed to carry vast quantities of U.S. crude to buyers overseas, primarily in East Asia. America's Gulf Coast seaports are too shallow to accommodate fully laden VLCCs, so to load an export cargo in Texas, the world's biggest tankers have to take on several smaller parcels from smaller tankers via reverse lightering. This adds to the cost of VLCC export and reduces competitiveness on long-haul trades to Asia - though VLCCs aren't needed for transatlantic deliveries to Europe, the destination that currently dominates the Gulf export trade, according to competing firm Enterprise Products Partners.\nIf built, TGL would be located about 30 miles off the coast of Brazos County, Texas. Sponsor Sentinel Midstream says that it is the \"only proposed offshore crude oil export terminal whose design complies with all current safe maneuvering guidelines for VLCCs at a [single point mooring].\" Like Enterprise Products Partners' Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT), TGL would facilitate more oil sales to Asian buyers, supporting U.S. jobs in E&P.\n\"Today, we are unleashing the full power of American energy,\" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy in announcing the Maritime Administration's approval for the TGL project. \"With this approval, we are increasing our energy revenue and unlocking our vast oil resources—not just for domestic security, but to dominate the global market.\"\nThe approval does not necessarily mean that TGL will be constructed immediately. The commercial picture for VLCC loading has changed, according to Enterprise Products Partners CEO Jim Teague; SPOT, which is pursuing the same client base, may be suspended soon if it cannot secure more customer interest in a cooling market for Texas-to-Asia oil shipping.\nLast week, the Department of Energy approved a gas export license for the 9.5 mtpa Commonwealth LNG plant in Louisiana, the first project licensed under the new administration. The Biden White House had frozen approvals for new LNG plants pending a review of greenhouse gas impacts, but Trump revoked the freeze on his first day in office. Commonwealth has been waiting for its export license longer than any other project.\n\"Today's actions demonstrate that President Trump is prioritizing the American energy industry, and we are both pleased and grateful to have achieved these important regulatory objectives,\" said Commonwealth CEO Farhad Ahrabi in a statement."

After a strategic review of EUNAVFOR Aspides and its results, the council extended the mission till February 28, 2026, with an anticipated cost of over €17 million ($17.8 million).\nAspides was launched on February 8, 2024, as a defensive mission to protect shipping in the Red Sea, including the Bab al-Mandeb and the Gulf of Aden as well as a broader reach to the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, and the Strait of Hormuz. The EU set it up to protect shipping but did authorize it to return hostile fire compared to the U.S. operation which had a more offensive mandate to stop the Houthis’ actions.\nPatrols and protection missions commenced in February 2024 as well as supporting search and rescue and other operations. Aspides’ command reports that in its first year over 640 merchant ships were supported with over 370 receiving close protection escorts. Vessels are required to request assistance from the forces. Warships participating in the effort include French destroyers, the Italian destroyersCaio DuilioandFederico Martinengo, and the more recent addition of the Greek vessel Hydra. Other countries contributed staff to the effort which is under the command of Read Admiral Vasileios Gryparis of the Hellenic Navy.\nAs part of its defense of merchant shipping, Aspides reports it has destroyed four ballistic missiles, 18 UAVs, and 20 USV drones. A total of 50 seafarers were also rescued both from vessels damaged by the Houthis as well as from other marine incidents in the area. Aspides protected the salvage mission and the efforts to tow the burning takerSounionlast year.\nThe decision to extend the mission came despite the Houthis a month ago promising to participate in the Gaza ceasefire and no longer target international shipping. No hostilities have been reported since mid-January. The Houthis said they would continue to target ships associated with Israel and have threatened to resume the attacks if the ceasefire collapsed.\nThe Council also expanded the mission for Aspides to further ensure maritime situational awareness. It said that Aspides should be able to collect information on arms trafficking and shadow fleets. Aspides will be sharing this information with a range of international organizations to enhance coordinated law enforcement efforts.\n\n\nSome of the components seized by the Yemeni Coast Guard (US CENTCOM)\n\nU.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) reported last week that the legitimate government of Yemen and its Coast Guard was able to interdict a shipment of materials from Iran to the Houthis. The Yemen Coast Guard interdicted a dhow in the southern Red Sea that CENTCOM says was destined for Hodeidah port and reportedly originated in Iran.\nThe dhow had a 40-foot container containing qualitative military equipment, including cruise missiles' structures, jet engines used in cruise missiles and suicide drones, and reconnaissance drones, in addition to marine radars, a modern jamming system, and an advanced wireless communications system. It is the first interception reported by the Yemeni Coast Guard, but CENTCOM has reported several seizures in addition to its efforts to destroy stockpiles of weapons in Houthi warehouses."

A third vessel, CCGSAnn Harvey, was on SAR patrol in the area as well.\nAn MSC containership,MSC Carmenwas also showing from its AIS signal that it had approached the area of the grounding. MSC has not commented on the incident but the Canadian Coast Guard reports it has been cooperating and responsive. The hired salvage team was expected to access the area today.\nThe vessel is rated with a capacity of 2,478 TEU but claims consultant Dolphin Maritime & Aviation Services is reporting that there are approximately 400 boxes aboard currently. The Coast Guard was monitoring for environmental hazards but says so far there have been no signs of damage.\n\n\n\nWeather conditions in the area however were hampering efforts. There continued to be a wind warning for the region with speeds of up to 75 mph possible (120 km/h). The winds appeared to have calmed by later Monday, but the air temperature remains below freezing, and there are continuing snow showers. The weather was predicted to moderate midweek.\nTeams were reported to be evaluating the best approach to refloat the vessel and minimize dangers."

        "content": "\nCore Power, a startup that is working to develop opportunities in the maritime sector using a new generation of advanced nuclear technology, outlined its vision to develop floating nuclear power plants that can be levered into nuclear-powered merchant shipping. The company will develop a U.S.-anchored maritime program named Liberty in honor of the mass-produced World War II Liberty ships.\nLast month, Core Power announced it was partnering with Glosten todesigna floating nuclear power plant that could be installed at U.S. ports. Naval architects and marine engineers at Glosten are focusing on the barge operational concept, design, regulatory path, site location approvals, and identification of potential suppliers for fabrication and installation of the barges which could produce about 175GWh of power per year.\nCEO Mikal Bøe of Core Power provided more details on the vision during a presentation in Houston last week. The first part of the Liberty program he said will see the mass production of floating nuclear power plants (FNPPs). The expertise gained in rolling out FNPPs on a large scale he predicted will pave the way for the second part of the program, which involves developing nuclear propulsion for merchant ships.\n“The Liberty program will unlock a floating power market worth $2.6 trillion, and shipyard construction of nuclear will deliver on time and on budget,” said Bøe. The company expects to open the orderbook for the floating nuclear power plants in 2028 and reach full commercialization by the middle of the next decade.\nUsing well-established shipbuilding processes and leveraging an already-skilled workforce, he envisions a modular production line for the power barges. Mass production will be possible says Bøe because they will employ advanced nuclear technologies, such as molten salt reactors. He points out that the new technologies are inherently and passively safe meaning they do not require the larger facilities and exclusion zones.\nEmploying the floating concept will make it possible to move the barges to ports and coastal locations to supplement local power capacity. Larger-capacity generation units would be anchored further offshore. The central shipyard will carry out the commissioning, maintenance, refueling, and waste management, making it simpler to choose locations for the barges. They will not require extensive site preparations. Core Power will also support the creation of the necessary framework for licensing, insurance, and export control.\nLearning from the first phase, they will then focus on developing the supply chain and workforce. They look to leverage the program internationally which will support the growth of the applications. They also believe it will lay the groundwork for nuclear-powered commercial vessels.\nCore Power reported last November that it was working with Westinghouse, one of the pioneers in nuclear power. The companies are focusing on the reactors that would be placed aboard the barges.\nSeveral companies are looking at applications of the new smaller reactor technologies to provide easily positioned power stations. Samsung Heavy Industries in partnership with Seaborg, a Danish start-up pursuing next-generation nuclear technologies, is also developing floating nuclear power plant barges using Compact Molten Salt Reactor technology developed by Seaborg. This concept is also targeted at the opportunities to bring new power sources to remote areas and developing countries."

        "content": "\nA Chinese state-owned enterprise has taken over the ownership of Zhoushan Wison Offshore Engineering, the Wison Group unit that the Biden Administration sanctioned for supporting Russia's LNG export ambitions on the Arctic coast of Siberia.\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, Wison supplied power generation modules for Novatek's Arctic LNG 2 project, which is heavily sanctioned. The modules were to be installed on Arctic LNG 2's barge-based liquefaction trains. After the modules were completed at Wison's plant, the company allowed them to be shipped to the Arctic LNG 2 construction site via a series of complex transshipment operations, which appeared designed to obscure the movements of the large and expensive project cargo. Two of the vessels involved - Hunter Star and Nan Feng Zhi Xing - have been sanctioned before for chartering activity in Russian energy projects.\nAfter the Treasury announced that Zhoushan Wison would be sanctioned, parent company Wison New Energies pledged to avoid \"any new Russian business\" and said that it would sell its entire stake in its Zhoushan unit. It emphasized that Wison New Energies would not have any shareholding in the company after the sale.\nLess than one month after sanctions on the yard were announced, a new owner has emerged: the state-owned Nantong Economic and Technological Development Zone Holding Group, a subsidiary of Nantong's municipal government. It is a Class I state-owned enterprise, with access to preferential credit terms. (Nantong is a five-hour drive away from Zhoushan, on the other side of Shanghai, but is home to another Wison facility.) The shipyard has been renamed Zhoushan Tongzhou Offshore Engineering.\nThe sanctions designation was limited to the Zhoushan unit, and Wison is still in the offshore construction industry. It broke ground in early February on a new, unsanctioned shipyard complex called Wison New Energies Qidong Yard. This plant will compete in the same market as the sanctioned Zhoushan yard, and will be a \"strategic pillar\" for completing the same large-scale EPCIC contracts, like FLNGs, FPSOs and plant modules."

        "content": "Officials in Hong Kong are hailing the launch of bunkering operations to fuel LNG ships. It provides another competitive tool for the port which along with other major ports in the region including Singapore and Shanghai are offering LNG bunkering operations.\nKunlun Energy Co., controlled by PetroChina, reported the first official bunkering operation on February 14 taking place in the southern anchorage of Hong Kong’s Cheung Chau. The company’s bunker vessel was positioned alongside theZim Aquamarine(81,681 dwt) to load 2,200 tons of ultra-low temperature LNG. Using an advanced bunker system, the operation took about seven hours.\nThe 7,000 TEU vessel was recently delivered from the shipyard and is now in service between the Far East and the Mediterranean. The companies report the refueling in Hong Kong will meet the ship’s fuel requirements for the entire voyage.\nThe bunkering service will be offered with the company’s vessel. It is equipped with two independent \"C\"-type cargo tanks with a maximum capacity of 8,500 cubic meters, providing customers with one-stop customized services, including cold storage, degassing, and LNG bunkering.\nIn late January, a test bunkering was also carried out with a Zim vessel,Zim Amber, another ship of the same class. The service has now been officially inaugurated with Hong Kong port officials reporting the goal is to bunker 200,000 tons of green fuels annually by 2030. According to data provided by PetroChina, by the end of 2024, it had supplied approximately 15.8 billion cubic meters of gas to Hong Kong, with an annual supply of about 1.5 billion cubic meters. Adding ship bunkering is being called another important milestone.\nHong Kong joins as many as 100 bunkering ports worldwide with most major shipping ports now having capabilities to supply LNG. According to the trade group SEA-LNG, the bunkering infrastructure to support LNG as a marine fuel has developed rapidly. It can now be delivered to vessels in some 96 ports, including most of the main bunkering ports, with a further 55 ports in the process of facilitating LNG bunkering investments and operations.\nThe group highlights the dramatic growth in the LNG bunker fleet. DNV calculates there are 65 supply ships now in service. This compares with just six LNG bunker vessels in 2019. DNV reports that an additional 16 LNG bunker vessels are currently on order. Europe and Asia each have about a third of the LNG bunker fleet, with the Americas third at 17 percent.\nGlobally there are over 650 LNG-fueled vessels now in service. The size of the fleet is expected to double over the next eight years to 2033.\n"

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe Southampton Crown Court, UK, on Friday, February 14, sentenced the master of a North Sea cargo ship and the company operating the vessel for their involvement in causing a fatal accident in 2021. The master, who was reported to have been on his first voyage in command, pleaded guilty to failing to operate the vessel following the safety management plan while the shipping company was found guilty in a four-week trial for failing to operate its ships safely.\nThe trial stemmed from the December 13, 2021, incident when theScot Carrier, a 4,700 dwt general cargo ship, collided with a small, self-propeller Danish barge theKarin Høj. They were sailing in the busy shipping lane between Denmark and Sweden and the small barge capsized killing the two crewmembers aboard.\nSwedish authorities immediately said they suspected drunkenness and detained the Scot Carrier after the vessel initially left the scene of the collision. The ship’s second officer who was navigating the vessel was extradited to Denmark for trial. The British officer, Mark Wilkinson, pleaded guilty to charges ofnegligent manslaughterfor his role as helmsman. He was sentenced in 2022 to spend 18 months in a Danish prison.\n“This was an accident waiting to happen,” said Southampton Crown Court Judge Peter Henry during Friday’s sentencing. He criticized the “laissez-faire attitude” toward safety aboard the ship and the operator’s culture which included regularly not maintaining lookouts despite requirements.\nWilkinson was alone on the bridge of the vessel at 0325 when the collision occurred. The UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) had previouslydetailedthat the second officer was distracted and that the warning alarms on the navigation systems were turned off. He was said to have been chatting with a woman over the internet and made what became the fatal course correction without checking his surroundings.\nIn the new trial, additional details came out. The master Sam Farrow, age 33 of London, confirmed that he suspected the first officer was intoxicated and had relieved him of his watch that night. According to the reports, Farrow was also distracted making a phone call to his mother when he handed over the watch to Wilkinson. The court was told basic safety requirements were being routinely ignored, but they believed that he was aware the Wilkinson had also consumed alcohol before coming on watch. Wilkinson in his trial said he did not believe he was intoxicated.\nAccording to the court, Farrow did not take safety action despite being aware that Wilkinson was failing in his duties as officer-of-the watch and permitting consumption of alcohol on the ship. Farrow pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight months in jail, suspended for 12 months, and £25,000 ($31,550) in costs. Media reports indicate he will have to carry out 200 hours of unpaid community work and pay a victim surcharge, to avoid prison time.\n“The failure to provide lookouts was the undoubtedly the single biggest failure, but the failure properly to oversee and enforce bridge discipline amongst the crew introduced additional distractions from the safe operation of the vessel which aligned to create the hole in the model and led directly to the collision,” concluded Judge Henry.\nIntrada Ships Management which operates Scotline was found guilty of failing to operate a ship in a safe manner. The judge sentenced the company to a £180,000 fine ($227,000) and a further £500,000 ($630,000) in costs. Media reports said Intrada spent £1 million (nearly $1.3 million) on legal fees.\nThe issue of shipping companies not posting lookouts at night has been highlighted by the authorities regarding several incidents. In October 2023, another Scotline vessel managed by Intrada Ships Management,Scot Explorer, was involved in acollisionoff the Danish coast. The vessel hit an LPG carrier which was drifting while undertaking engine repairs. MAIB reported the master of theScot Explorerwas also alone on the bridge and distracted while the ship was on autopilot. Intrada was again cited for not maintaining proper watches with a lookout and committed to enhancing its safety protocols and training."

        "content": "China is conducting drills that simulate the reunification of Taiwan by force, according to the U.S. military's top officer in Asia. China's navy and air force routinely operate in the Taiwan Strait and on the eastern side of the island, often during periods of elevated tension; at a conference in Hawaii last week, Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. Sam Paparo suggested that these drills are rehearsals for the main event.\n\"[China's] aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan right now are not exercises, as they call them. They are rehearsals,\" Adm. Paparo said. \"They are rehearsals for the forced unification of Taiwan to the mainland.\"\nPaparo called for a radical acceleration of efforts to rearm, starting with \"procurement at the speed of combat, not at the speed of committees.\" He noted that ongoing conflicts in the Mideast and Ukraine have eaten into available stocks of munitions that will be needed in a the high-end fight with China, adding more pressure to find ways to rebuild America's arsenal. He predicted a major role for AI, and for 3D print-on-demand parts. \"It isn't future tech, it's current capability,\" he noted.\nOn the other side of the Pacific, as Paparo spoke, China's forces were on the move. From January 28 through February 12, China's Eastern Theater Command carried out combat patrols around Taiwan, deploying surface combatants, fighters and bombers. The drills overlapped with the transit of a U.S. Navy destroyer and an MSC auxiliary survey ship through the Taiwan Strait: From Feb. 10-12, the destroyer USSRalph Johnsonand the USNSBowditchmade their way south through the strait, completing the first U.S. Navy transit of the waterway since the beginning of the new administration. Taiwan Strait transits are intended to challenge China's claim to control over the full 80-mile width of the strait, most of which falls outside of the limits of China's territorial seas.\nThe Canadian warship HMCSOttawafollowed suit with a similar transit over the weekend. China objected strenuously, and the People's Liberation Army carried out a large-scale exercise with nine ships and more than 40 aircraft around Taiwan on Monday.\nTaiwan's defense ministry pushed back in a strongly-worded statement. \"The Taiwan Strait is absolutely not within the scope of China’s sovereignty,\" Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement. \"Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is not only a matter of concern for Taiwan, but also a common concern for free and democratic countries around the world.\"\nIn the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard sent a patrol to within 35 nautical miles of Palawan, outside of Philippine territorial seas but much closer to the nation's home islands than normal. An unusual three-ship CCG task force made the journey - at about the same time that Philippine diplomats were traveling to Munich for a high-level international security dialogue, including discussions of the tensions in the Spratly Islands.\n\"Usually, they [the China Coast Guard] go sort of one or maybe two at a time, so taking three ships is sending a particular message of strength,\" maritime security analyst Ray Powell told GMA.\nIn Munich last weekend, former Chinese vice foreign minister Fu Ying made clear that China would not allow continued Philippine control of Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal, two reefs located within the Philippine exclusive economic zone. For 25 years, the Philippine military has maintained a garrison on a decaying shipwreck on Second Thomas Shoal, and China has demanded that Manila must remove Philippine forces from Philippine waters.\n\"If the Philippines can take new rocks, how can you stop others? . . . That’s a red line no one should be allowed to cross,\" former vice foreign minister Fu said. \"How can you stop China from taking more? We’re capable, there’s no problem, but we are exercising constraint.\"\nIn a rebuttal, Philippine foreign secretary Enrique Manalo said that when China \"applies its own domestic laws to certain areas within our exclusive economic zone, then it really does create the kind of tension that we have been experiencing.\""

        "content": "\nMaersk and India’s Cochin Shipyard have entered into a memorandum of understanding to explore ship repair, maintenance, and shipbuilding in India. The Danish company becomes the first major carrier to plan regular maintenance activities in India which will be in support of the government’s goals to develop shipbuilding into one of India’s leading industries.\n“The first Maersk vessel repair at Cochin, planned already for 2025, will mark the beginning of what we envisage as a long-term collaborative relationship,” said Leonardo Sonzio, Head of Fleet Management & Technology for A.P. Moller – Maersk. The collaboration the companies reported will initially focus on vessels up to 7,000 TEU for afloat repairs and up to 4,000 TEU for dry-docking, with capabilities expected to expand over time.\nCochin Shipyard, which was incorporated in 1972 as a fully owned Government of India company, is India’s largest shipbuilder both for the navy and private projects. Last year, the company invested more than $100 million to open a new ship repair facility encompassing more than 42 acres in Cochin Port. Media reports indicate that the company is currently repairing four to five ships at a time in the yard while it also has orders for 65 newbuilds.\nLocated on the southwest coast of India, the yard is close to major shipping lanes and can offer advantages in technology and low-cost labor. The agreement with Maersk will explore ship repair, dry docking, and new building opportunities as well as sharing technical expertise. The companies plan to work together on joint training programs and skill development.\nIndia is reported to have 32 shipyards but a report cited inadequate policy support, limited private investment, and inefficiencies in the operations which are holding back the growth of the industry. The government however in 2024 outlined an aggressive plan to expand the shipbuilding industry.\nThe Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) is developing a new shipbuilding support program that will incentivize Indian shipyards to grow. Detailing the plan the ministry said the aim is to propel India into the top ranks of global shipbuilding nations, targeting a position among the top 10 by 2030 and the top five by 2047, from its current 22nd place. The government projected that the business could be worth $62 billion by 2047. It would also drive growth in related industries which would add $37 billion to the economy and create around 12 million jobs.\nMedia reports in India and South Korea noted recent activities designed to support the shipbuilding industry. The Indian government organized and led a delegation to meet with Korea’s shipbuilders. In a reciprocal visit, Hanwha Ocean is reported to have toured the shipbuilders including Swan Engineering, Cochin Shipyard, Hindustan Shipyard, and L&T Shipyard. Media reports in South Korea indicate that Hanwha Ocean is exploring an agreement with India’s shipbuilders.\nKorean shipbuilders are currently handicapped by a lack of capacity with all the building slots booked years in advance. The industry is also focused on rising costs and competition from Chinese shipyards.\nThe U.S. Navy and the UK’s Royal Navy have also sought to build relationships with the Indian shipbuilders as part of a complex series of political moves to strengthen ties with India. The U.S. Navy sent an MSC vessel for the first time in 2022 for an overhaul at an Indian shipyard and now three of India’s yards are approved to bid for projects. The Royal Navy also started in 2024 sending auxiliary ships to Indian shipyards."

It has a nameplate capacity of about 1.5 million barrels a day, equal to roughly two percent of the global seaborne-traded oil supply.CPC confirmed that seven explosives-laden drones attacked the Kropotkinskaya pumping station on Sunday night, the pipeline's largest station within Russia. The strike took the station out of service; while the line has not fully shut down, \"crude transportation through the Tengiz-Novorossiysk pipeline system is being maintained at reduced flow rates,\" CPC said.\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully struck two major Russian oil installations in Krasnodar Krai.Early in the evening, seven Ukrainian drones struck the Kropotkinskaya pumping station, the largest on the Caspian Pipeline, reportedly slashing total system capacity.pic.twitter.com/3IQPFXTO8W\nUkrainian drones cripple Russia’s largest Caspian Pipeline pumping station, Kropotkinskaya—cutting off oil transit to Novorossiysk. Some added color for the talks in Saudi Arabia.pic.twitter.com/vpHMl6TICm\nThe CPC was subject to frequent interference by Russian interests in the early months of the war, but up until last weekend, it had not been targeted by Ukraine. The pipeline is part-owned by Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and Eni - all tied to Ukraine's Western allies - and it carries Western-owned oil from Kazakhstan's prolific oil fields on the Caspian Sea.\nNearly 90 percent of the CPC's oil volume is Kazakh-origin, but an attack on the CPC would impact Russian energy revenue. Russian state oil company Transneft controls the pipeline and owns 31 percent of its shares, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in profits annually for the Russian state.\nThe attack could have an even bigger impact on Western oil companies. Chevron is counting on $4 billion in free cash flow from its Tengiz oilfield investments this year, and $5 billion in 2026, according to theICIJ. A pipeline slowdown or shutdown could temporarily crimp deliveries.\nChevron told Energy Intel in a statement that its Kazakh joint venture continues to produce oil and export it via the CPC pipeline \"uninterrupted.\"\nKazakhstan, which depends heavily on oil exports for foreign exchange revenue, has the biggest stake in CPC's performance. It is a neutral party in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and 80 percent of its oil exports are delivered via the CPC pipeline.\nFront month Brent and WTI futures ticked up by just under one percent after news of the pipeline slowdown."

        "content": "\nA German NGO has come up with an AI-assisted tool for finding ghost nets - the drifting, abandoned fishing gear that hoovers up sea life indiscriminately.\nAbout 50,000 tonnes of fishing gear end up in the ocean every year, accounting for nearly a third of all ocean plastic waste. The gear gradually decomposes into microplastic, which enters the marine food chain with unknown consequences for the ecosystem (and for consumers of seafood).\nBut long before they break down, abandoned nets ensnare turtles, fish, sharks and other creatures, reducing the health of marine fisheries and taking a toll on threatened species. To fight this long-term threat, WWF Germany has worked with Accenture and Microsoft AI to put together an AI-driven ghost net identification platform.\nThe process starts with sonar data, obtained by organizations of all kinds (oceanographic research groups, offshore energy companies, and government sources) and donated to the projcet. When this data is uploaded into the cloud-based AI identification platform - GhostNetZero - the system automatically scans the sonar data for the telltale signs of drifting ghost nets. Previously, the only way to do this was to search the data manually - a time-consuming process, if proven to work. WWF Germany has used manual sonar searches for its cleanup work in the past, and has removed more than 20 tonnes of abandoned nets from the bottom of the Baltic.\nBut to maximize the platform's impact, WWF Germany says that it is looking for new participants from industry. Any group with high resolution sonar data to share can help out. In return, partners get the right to use the group's partnership logo.\n\"The combination of sonar search and AI-supported detection enables a quantum leap: the seabed is mapped all over the world and there is a huge amount of data. If we can specifically check existing image data from heavily fished marine zones, this is a real game-changer,\" WWF Germany project manager Gabriele Dederer told Oceanographic Magazine."

        "content": "SC Ports and the Port of Charleston, South Carolina set a new record on Tuesday, February 18, receiving their largest capacity containership to date. The newOOCL Iris(16,868 TEU) while a smaller vessel by dimensions, surpassed the capacity record set four years ago highlighting the benefits of investments the state is making in its ports and advancements in container shipping.\nTheOOCL Iriswas recently delivered as the second of a class of 10 new NeoPanamax containerships Orient Overseas Container Liner (OOCL) is putting into service. The ship was named on December 3, 2024, at the Nantong COSCO KHI Ship Engineering Co. (NACKS) as the first of the class completed by this yard and the second overall as Dalian COSCO KHI Ship Engineering Co. (DACKS) is also building half the class.\nOOCL highlights it is their first new NeoPanamax class in more than a decade with the prior vessels entering service in 2013 and 2014. Starting in 2023, the company also added a class of ultra-large container vessels, the industry’s first 24,000 TEU ships.\nRepresenting the next generation of NeoPanamax containerships, OOCL Iris, along with NACKS-built sistersOOCL BauhiniaandOOCL Sunflower, not only comply with the latest environmental regulatory requirements, but also set new benchmarks in areas such as environmental design, energy efficiency, digital intelligence, safety, and onboard comfort by incorporating the latest technological innovations and intelligent solutions. These vessels feature an advanced energy efficiency system that provides recommendations for speed optimization and trim adjustments. The system monitors real-time fuel consumption and power usage of the main engine, generator, and boiler, offering valuable optimization suggestions. Additionally, the OOCL Iris has received three \"Smart Ship\" notations, as well as the Enviro-friendly notation (ENVIRO) and Sustainable notation (SUSTAIN-1) from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS).\nFor Charleston, it means the vessel which is 1,204 feet in length (367 meters) has a rated carry capacity of 16,868 TEU surpassing theCMA CGM Marco Polowhich at 16,020 set the previous record in May 2021. The CMA CGM vessel was the largest containership in the world when it was introduced in 2013 with an overall length of 1,299 feet (396 meters). Advancements in loading and stacking permit the new OOCL vessels to carry five percent more boxes (TEU) on a smaller-dimension vessel.\n\n#SCPortsproudly welcomed the OOCL Iris to the Wando Welch Terminal Tuesday, setting a new record for the largest vessel to call the Port of Charleston, at 16,828 TEUs.????:@mpeacock28pic.twitter.com/aew3hldVyS\n\nThe height of the new vessel made for some interesting images as it passed under Charleston’s Arthur Ravenel Jr. roadway bridge (Route 17). The bridge is listed with a clearance of 186 feet (57 meters).\nThe ship proceeded to Charleston’s Wando Welch Terminal as the last stop on its U.S. rotation. The port emphasizes its capital investments meaning a ship of this size has any time access regardless of tides. The berth now has a 54-foot depth and a 52-foot channel. TheOOCL Irishas a design draft of 47.6 feet (14.5 meters).\n“SC Ports’ strategic infrastructure investments allow us to continue welcoming the largest ships calling the U.S. East Coast,” said SC Ports President and CEO Barbara Melvin. “Charleston’s harbor depth and widened turning basins, taller ship-to-shore cranes and highly productive terminals and maritime community all work together to provide fluidity to our customers’ supply chains.”\nSC Ports highlights an investment of nearly $3 billion to modernize port infrastructure, expand cargo capacity, and build rail infrastructure. Last year, it reached an agreement with its unions after a standoff that had delayed the use of its expanded terminals.\nTheOOCL Irisand her soon-to-be-introduced sisterOOCL Sunflowerwill be taking advantage of the NeoPanamax sizing on a route from China and Far East ports to New York, Savannah, and Charleston. The first ship of the class,OOCL Bauhiniais on a different Pacific route calling at Long Beach, California in the U.S."

The man managed to stay afloat and reach a rock formation, and he clung to the cliffside as powerful waves washed over him from below, threatening to knock him back into the water.\nThe call center notified Coast Guard Sector San Juan of the urgent need for a helicopter evacuation, and the sector dispatched a Jayhawk rescue crew out of Air Station Borinquen. The aircrew quickly found the survivor and lowered away a rescue swimmer. Within seconds, despite the waves, the swimmer got a rescue sling around the survivor and hoisted him to safety.\nAfter the hoist, the aircrew flew the survivor to a local airport for transfer to an awaiting ambulance. He was taken to the Centro Medico Hospital in San Juan for evaluation.\n\"This rescue is a testament to the intentional and continuous training we conduct at Air Station Borinquen to intervene on someone’s worst day and bring them to safety,\" said Lt. Luke M. Dewhirst, the pilot and commander for the mission. \"I am incredibly proud of the safe and efficient work by the crew of 6038, as well as the expert coordination by our operations watchstander and personnel at Sector San Juan.\""

        "content": "\nThe Italian authorities have a mystery on their hands after discovering two underwater holes in the hull of a Greek-owned tanker offloading at the port of Savona. Investigators are exploring terrorism or sabotage but will not rule out mechanical failures or previous collision damage.\nThe Port Authority for Savona in Northern Italy issued a statement confirming what it called “anomalies in the unloading procedure.” The crude oil tankerSeajewel(108,888 dwt) arrived in the port on Friday, February 14 from Algeria and was directed to one of the oil terminal buoys to begin offloading. Built in 2009 and registered in Malta, the Aframax tanker has been operated by Greece’s Thenamaris since 2021.\nPort officials said the “anomalies” were observed overnight between Friday into Saturday and the supervisors as a precaution suspended the offloading operation. No spills or injuries were reported among the 23 crewmembers aboard, but they are seeking to verify the origin of the anomalies.\nAccording to media reports in Italy, the crew aboard the vessel heard two loud bangs. They reported an ingress of water and a survey of the hull revealed two damaged plates. The inner hull held and there was no leak.\nThe Savona Prosecutor’s Office became involved and they also brought in an elite team of divers to inspect the underside of the vessel. According to the reports, they confirmed three things. First, there is a hole about a meter in length in the hull. The hull plates are bent inwards indicating an external force, and they found dead fish in the area near the damage to the hull.\nItaly’s anti-terrorism unit has also become involved in the investigation. The prosecutor’s office is not providing further details and the shipping company also confirms an investigation is underway. They are not responding to questions if the divers found residue from explosives or how or when an explosive could have been attached to the hull.\nMedia reports quickly traded the tanker’s past activities with the RussianTankerTacker online site showing the vessel had made frequent stops at Russia’s Novorossiysk and traveling to Turkey. Ukraine’s news agency was quick to report the vessel had transported Russian oil on at least three occasions, in February, March, and May 2024.\nIt is the second incident in just a matter of days that has raised questions of sabotage or terrorism targeting tankers in the Russian oil trade. Just over a week ago, Russian authorities reported a Cyprus-owned tanker,Koala, had an engine room explosion while docked at Ust-Luga. Reports quickly began to question the theory it was an engine room incident and the maritime security consultancy Ambrey Intelligence reported the tankerexperiencedthree blasts saying it was likely hit by limpet mines.\nAmbrey stated that other vessels with \"a similar trading profile\" have also been damaged by explosions. They said the common element in the incidents was vessels involved in the Russian oil trade.\nSecurity is being maintained around theSeajewel. Local media continues to post pictures of the divers working around the vessel."

        "content": "\nThe first wind turbine installation vessel, Charybdis for Dominion Energy, is nearly complete reports shipbuilder Seatrium. The company’s AmFELS shipyard in Brownsville, Texas released the first photos of the vessel as it undergoes trials.\n“Charybdis is 96 percent completed and complies with U.S. Jones Act regulations, allowing it to operate seamlessly in U.S. waters for domestic offshore wind projects,” writes Seastrium. “One of the largest WTIVs of its kind globally, theCharybdisis designed to handle current and next-generation wind turbines up to 12 megawatts or larger.”\nDominion Energy had reported recently that the vessel was undergoing its trials as it moves toward commissioning. Seatrium reports that it recently completed jacking trial and main crane load testing. The vessel’s sea trials have also begun.\nWith a length of 472 feet, width of 184 feet, and depth of 38 feet, it is equipped with a 426-foot crane capable of lifting up to 2,200 tonnes. It will accommodate up to 119 people.\n\n\nCharybdis is reportedly 96 percent complete and on schedule to deploy later in 2025 at Dominion's Virginia offshore wind farm (Seatrium)\n\nWork began in December 2020 on the ship and it waslaunchedin April 2024. It was originally reported that the target for delivery was late 2023, but it has fallen back with the companies now saying it remains on schedule for delivery in 2025. Later this year it is expected to begin work at Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project where it will continue to work through the completion of the wind farm expected by the end of 2026.\nAs the first of its kind in the U.S. and with domestic shipbuilding to meet the requirements of the Jones Act, the cost of the vessel has skyrocketed. Original estimates placed the cost at between $500 and $500 million but the company later adjusted it to an estimate of $625 million. In August 2024, the company told investors the latest estimated costs, including financing, was $715 million.\nDespite the cost increases for the vessel and the project, Dominion Energy continues to espouse the value of offshore wind and the construction it will make to operations. The company says the overall project for the offshore work remains on budget, although it recently increased costs related to the transmission lines. It said theinstallationwas past the 50 percent mark offshore and on schedule.\nOther than a few currently permitted projects, the U.S. offshore wind energy market is expected to stall during the Trump second term. The vessel as the first U.S. vessel will be well-positioned for domestic installation projects and it is likely to enter the international market where large install vessels also remain in short supply."

EUNAVFOR Atalanta reports it was informed of the suspect incident that took place on February 17, and it is investigating.\nFew details have been provided so far on this latest attack other than it took place off Garmaal, which Atalanta reports is near Eyl, where past attacks took place. It is along the northern coast of Puntland a semi-autonomous region in Somalia and notorious for piracy.\nThe suspect vessel is reported to be a Yemini-flagged dhow. Atalanta is working with the Yemeni Coast Guard and the Puntland Maritime Police Force as well as the international Combined Maritime Forces.\nThis incident comes ten days after another pirate attack on the Yemeni-flagged dhow,Al Najma. The vessel which had 12 crewmembers aboard was seized near Ely on February 9. The EU naval forces began a search to locate the vessel and when they approached the dhow thepirates fledafter robbing the crew. It was liberated on February 13.\nAfter the two recent incidents, Operation Atalanta is strongly recommending merchant and other vulnerable vessels register on the Maritime Security Centre Indian Ocean (MSCIO) website and its Voluntary Registration Scheme (VRS). Atalanta says this will provide the most effective monitoring and response by ATALANTA forces and their partners in countering maritime security threats.\nYesterday, it also highlighted its ongoing efforts through what it calls “Friendly Approaches.” Atalanta teams engage directly with fishing men at sea, providing guidance on security measures, understanding their challenges, and reinforcing trust in the waterways.\nAtalanta’s data shows a pattern of attacks, and in 2024 the wave began in January and continued through the first quarter. Last year, there were five incidents reported in January versus this year when it was quiet between November when a Chinese commercial fishing boat was seized and last week when the Yemeni dhow was seized.\n"

        "content": "\nOver the past year, Vietnam has accelerated its land reclamation program in the Spratly Islands, building out acreage and enlarging its military bases at a faster pace than any other claimant. At its largest facility on Barque Canada Reef, it has dug out a ship channel large enough to accommodate the largest existing destroyers and cruisers, according to a new paper released by China's Ministry of Natural Resources.\nThe paper, published in the latest edition of the Chinese-language Journal of Tropical Oceanography, describes a method to combine free data from American and European satellites to precisely chart out the depth of the channel - without the need for on-site surveying or permission from the base's operator. NASA'sICESat-2 satellitehas laser sensing capabilities that can reach down to 30 meters below the surface, enabling depth detection with high precision. When combined with high-resolution optical imaging from the EU's Sentinel satellite constellation, this laser data enables unauthorized charting of sensitive installations like Vietnam's newly-built naval base.\nAccording to the ministry's measurements, the channel has enough depth to accommodate warships up to the size of the PLA Navy's Type 055 destroyers, which draw about 22 feet of water. This is significantly less than would be needed for the equivalent U.S. Navy vessels, the Ticonderoga-class and the Arleigh Burke-class, which both require more than 30 feet of depth.\nThe paper also assessed the scale and speed of the land reclamation campaign. Vietnam appears to have added nearly 500 acres to Barque Canada Reef in just two years, and the harbor was added just last year. Coauthor Fu Dongyang wrote that the changes \"have profoundly reshaped [the reef's] topography,\" but there is still room to grow. The shoal has about 16,000 acres of natural coral flats that could be converted to support strategic military uses, as China has done with the reef flats at nearby Mischief Reef, Fiery Cross Reef and Subi Reef.\nVietnam has been clear about the purpose of the expansion. The Spratly Islands are contested by Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia, with the largest share located within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). China claims ownership over the entirety of the archipelago under its \"nine-dash line\" policy, and has the most extensive military presence.\nFor Vietnam, the bases provide a security perimeter far from home. “We will resort to every means possible to make sure we can defend and safeguard our legitimate interests in the [South China Sea],\" Vietnamese foreign policy director Le Dinh Tinh told the Washington Post last year."

Several cable harnesses were severed, and an investigation is under way into a suspected sabotage attack, according toSpiegel. The Rostock prosecutor's office has confirmed that it is investigating the case.\nLate last year, an unknown saboteur dumped dozens of kilos of metal filings into the oil sumps of the main engines aboard the brand new corvetteEmden,according to multiple German media outlets. The contamination was detected and cleaned out, but if it had not been spotted, it would have quickly destroyed the engines.\nLast week, German Navy Vice Adm. Jan Christian Kaack told the press that \"more than one unit\" had been sabotaged, without going into specifics. Troublingly, he added that German naval bases have reported a pattern of attempted security perimeter breaches, both from the shoreside and from the waterside. He added that uniformed German Navy personnel have been approached in public while en route from base to their homes.\n\"The growing threat from Russia is more urgent at the beginning of 2025 than it was two years ago,\" Kaack told reporters, without specifying whether the suspected security threats within Germany were Russian.\nThe suspected attacks are just part of abroader patternof sabotage targeting Europe's security forces and its infrastructure. In early 2024, three German-Russian dual nationals were arrested on suspicion of planning an attack on the U.S. military base at Grafenwohr, a training facility for Ukrainian servicemembers. The main suspect, identified as Dieter S., stands accused of plotting an extensive series of arson and explosive attacks within Germany, with targets including rail lines and a manufacturing plant.\nSome NATO security forces also suspect - but have been unable to prove - that the four back-to-back subseacable breaksin the Baltic over the past year are an intentional act of sabotage, potentially linked to Russian intelligence.\nTop image:German Navy frigate Emden (F266) at Blohm+Voss, 2023 (Dkvtig / CC BY SA 4.0)"

It follows the news yesterday, February 17, that Maersk has entered into anagreementwith Cochin Shipyard first for repairs of smaller vessels of the fleet and targeting shipbuilding.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month spoke of the value of the planned investments into the sector and expected boosts to the economy. He has called for a mega cluster to focus on shipbuilding to take the country to a top 10 shipbuilding by the end of the decade and a top 5 by 2047. Modi said the business could be worth $62 billion by 2047.\nThe new budget for the country includes a Maritime Development Fund to provide financial assistance and level the costs for India’s shipbuilders to make the industry more competitive. They also provided a concept to leverage India’s well-established ship recycling operations primarily at Alang to attract newbuild business. The budget calls for a credit for shipowners that recycle vessels in India that would be applied to the cost of newbuilds at the Indian shipyards. A 10-year extension till 2025 was also provided on the duty charged on raw materials, components, and parts used in the manufacture of ships.\n\n\nModi and Macron received a presentation from Saadé at CMA CGM's Fleet Center (PM Modi)\n\nDuring his visit to Europe, Modi met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the CMA CGM Group headquarters in Marseille. He also discussed issues with group Chairman and CEO Rodolphe Saadé. CMA CGM highlighted its 34 years of operations in India and Saadé made a presentation and provided a tour of the group’s fleet center.\nIndia media is reporting that Saadé told Modi that CMA CGM was committed to sending a “study team” to look at the shipbuilding capabilities and repair opportunities. They also reportedly agreed to explore registering some ships in India.\nThe Indian media outlet ET Infra is reporting Christine Cabau Woehrel, Executive Vice-President for Assets and Operations, CMA CGM Group, will visit India this week to explore potential opportunities for shipbuilding and repairs in the country. It is also quoting sources that CMA CGM will sign a similar memorandum of understanding to the one Maersk announced yesterday. CMA CGM and Cochin will according to the report announce plans for ship repairs and newbuilding following Maersk’s lead.\n\n\nToft meeting with India's Minister of Commerce and Industry (Piyush Goyal on X)\n\nIndia’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, posted messages on X this week showing a meeting with Soren Toft, Chief Executive of MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company. He wrote that they had a productive meeting discussing the vast growth potential in India’s shipping and logistics sector, focusing on investments in inland container terminals, shipbuilding, maintenance, and container manufacturing. He said the talks centered around “deep-sea vessel partnerships and policy reforms to enhance the nation’s global maritime competitiveness while fostering growth, innovation and self-reliance in the sector.”\nThe state-owned Cochin Shipyard is seen as the first beneficiary of the new interest because it is the only yard with a 300-meter dry dock according to ET Infra. However, it notes that Swan Defense and Heavy Industries is also expected to meet with CMA CGM. Another yard, L&T Shipbuilding (Larsen & Toubro) also broke into the international market in the past few years, first winning maintenance contracts for U.S. Navy support ships and recently from the UK Royal Fleet Auxiliary.\nIndian shipbuilders have built smaller, specialized ships for Europeans. Maersk is set to start the next level with its agreement which calls for wet dock repairs for ships up to 7,000 TEU and dry dock for ships up to 4,000 TEU. Maersk said plans were underway for the first project to start in 2025."

China claims the area as its own under its historically-based \"nine-dash line\" policy; the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague has ruled that these claims are invalid under international law, and that the Philippines is entitled to the standard 200-nautical-mile EEZ, as measured by distance from Philippine shores. China has dismissed the ruling and has pressed its claim through the use of force, deploying the China Coast Guard to interfere with Philippine navigation and fishing interests in the area.\nLast week, the China Coast Guard sent a patrol to within 35 nautical miles of Palawan, outside of Philippine territorial seas but much closer to the nation's home islands than normal. An unusual three-ship CCG task force made the voyage. \"Usually, they [the China Coast Guard] go sort of one or maybe two at a time, so taking three ships is sending a particular message of strength,\" maritime security analyst Ray Powell told GMA."

We are committed to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin,\" said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a statement.\nFor the first time, the EU has placed restrictions on Russian seaports that are used for evading the G7 price cap on Russian oil. Kozmino, the terminal responsible for exporting the ESPO blend to Pacific buyers, has consistently violated the cap since it was imposed; Primorsk, Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk also routinely export Urals grade crude at prices over the limit.\nAdditional measures include a phased ban on Russian aluminum imports, along with new sanctions on specific Russian officials and banks.\n\"We keep supporting Ukraine and we keep sanctioning the Russian aggressor, because this is the right thing to do, preserving international rules and order,\" one EU diplomat told the FT.\nSeparately, European officials have leaked an early outline of a Franco-British plan to deploy a small peacekeeping force to Ukraine after a possible end of hostilities. The plan would comprise about 30,000 servicemembers, primarily for defending Ukraine's airspace and its sea lines of communication. The scheme would not put Western troops near the front line, where they could come into contact with Russian forces.\nThe position broadcast by the U.S. government focused on the commercial opportunities of a rapprochement with Moscow. In a statement Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said that it was negotiating with Russia to establish \"future co-operation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities,\" along with a Ukrainian peace deal that Russia and the U.S. will determine."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe ICS has issued a warning about the rising number of commercially-managed, previously-unknown flag administrations that are taking off in popularity in the sanctions-evasion market. These budget flags are among the lowest-performing options available in terms of fleet quality, but they offer the light regulatory touch and rock-bottom affordability that a small minority of shipowners seek out.\nThe newly-emerging flags of choice for the sanctions-busting fleet include Cambodia, Eswatini, Gabon and Guinea-Bissau, ICS understands. Gabon is well-known as a host of the Russia-serving \"shadow fleet,\" and has grown by leaps and bounds since the start of U.S. sanctions on Russia's oil exports. The new arrivals give unscrupulous owners extra options for \"flag-hopping,\" the practice of frequently changing registries to evade enforcement. All are low performers on ICS' annual ranking of flag state performance, found alongside well-known names on the Paris MOU Black List.\nFlagging arrangements of this type are associated with questionable safety enforcement. One of these states - the landlocked kingdom of Eswatini (Swaziland) - isn't even an IMO member state. Last year, authorities in the UAEbannedall Eswatini-flagged ships from their ports over safety concerns, and the IMO has designated the privately-run flag administration as \"fraudulent.\"\n\"Eswatini’s emergence as a flag state presents a distinct concern as it is not a member of the UN IMO and is therefore not a signatory of its international maritime Conventions. ICS strongly encourages Eswatini and other new flag States to prioritize IMO membership and the ratification and implementation of IMO Conventions to demonstrate their commitment to global maritime governance and the responsible operation of those ships registered with their fleets,\" said ICS Secretary General Guy Platten.\nPlatten noted that shipping's success depends upon following global rules, and recommended that owners check ICS' flag state performance tables when deciding which nation to choose to regulate their ships. \"It is vital that flag states adhere to their obligations to enforce the highest global safety standards,\" he said."

        "content": "Rescue teams from the UK assisted by the French, Dutch, and Belgians responded to a second fire aboard the Grimaldi conroGrande Brasilelate on Tuesday after a previous fire had been reported under control. According to a spokesperson for Grimaldi Deep Sea, the vessel’s operator, the 28-member crew was removed from the vessel for their safety while salvage teams are joining the effort.\nThe first reports of afire aboardthe vessel which was sailing from Antwerp, Belgium to Le Havre, France were issued at approximately 0935 (local time) on Tuesday, February 18. The UK’s Coastguard dispatched lifeboats from the RNLI in Ramsgate and Dover. After using the vessel’s fire suppression system, the first fire was reported extinguished and the lifeboats were released.\nThe vessel which was built in 2000 and is registered in Malta was reportedly repositioned approximately 12 nautical miles off Ramsgate in southeast UK. A salvage tugMultratug 35was standing by the vessel along with the French Coast Guard’s rescue vesselAbeille Normandie.\n“At approximately 1625 hours (LT) the crew informed the authorities that a second fire had broken out on another deck of the vessel,” said the Grimaldi spokesperson. At approximately 2000 it was determined that the crew should leave the vessel and they boarded the vessel’s lifeboat. They were transferred to one of the assisting tugs and later taken to shore by the Ramsgate lifeboat according to HM Coast Guard. No injuries were reported to the crew.\n\n\nThermal image appears to show the fire spreading in the RoRo cargo area while boundary cooling is underway (Kustwacht)\n\nGrimaldi reports the situation continues to evolve. Currently, `tugs are providing boundary cooling to contain and limit the fire. The Belgian Coast Guard and Netherlands Coast Guard are also monitoring the situation. The Dutch report thatMultratug 36andKamarahave also arrived on scene. Smit Salvage has been retained by Grimaldi and was expected to reach the vessel as of midday Wednesday.\nImages supplied by the Netherlands Coast Guard show the fire burning in the RoRo cargo area of the vessel. The dangers of transporting vehicles, and specifically older, second-hand vehicles has been the topic of frequent discussions by insurers and other authorities. Eclectic vehicles are also considered to be a high danger in transport. In 2019, Grimaldi experienced fire on two of its vessels,Grande AmericaandGrande Europa, leading to calls for increased fire safety. These fires lead to new regulations about handling hazardous materials. A fire also broke out on a third Grimaldi vessel in 2021 while it was loading in Port Newark, New Jersey and that incident killed two local firefighters who had boarded the ship. The investigation is focusing on a \"pusher\" car used to position vehicles being loaded on theGrande Costa D’Avorio.\nThe vessel is loaded with a mix of rolling cargo (cars, vans, trucks), containers, and cargo destined for various West Africa ports. Grimaldi reports at this time the cause of the fire remains unknown but it will conduct a full investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\n"

The authorities believe that the Helen Mary may have committed multiple offenses, and she was diverted to the port of Cork for an enhanced inspection. Local outlet the Irish Examiner reports that one element of focus includes the ship's pilot ladder, a frequently-misused piece of safety critical equipment.\nLocal police in Cork were alerted Monday to the possibility of charges against the vessel's master. He was detained under Ireland's Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, according to the Gardai, and an investigation is under way.\nThe Helen Mary has come under scrutiny before. In 2020, environmental activists with Greenpeace boarded the trawler off the coast of Scotland in an attempt to force it to cease operations in UK marine protected areas, which is legal under British law. The year before, it was detained in a Scottish port for a fisheries-protection investigation.\nGreenpeace has called for tighter restrictions on the operations of factory trawlers, which harvest much larger quantities of fish than other vessel classes."

Currently finishing construction at Chantiers de l’Atlantique in France, the new ship recently completed its second and final sea trials before delivery.\nThe new mega cruise ship underwent deep-water intensive systems tests during a final sea trial in the Atlantic Ocean announced MSC Cruises. The sea trials checked the performance of the ship’s engines, maneuverability, fuel consumption, safety systems, speed, and stopping distances. The ship will now receive her final finishing touches at the shipyard in Saint Nazaire, France before being officially delivered to the cruise line on March 27.\nAt 216,638 gross tons, theMSC World Americais almost a quarter larger than the cruise ships the company has been deploying in the American market. It is part of an effort to expand the brand’s presence in the United States which has also seen MSC open new homeports in Port Canaveral, Florida, and Galveston, Texas, and plans to send a cruise ship to Alaska.\nShe is the second ship of the class following theMSC World Europawhich was introduced at the end of 2022. Last year, MSC also exercised options for two more ships of the class, with MSC World Asia due to enter service in 2026 cruising in the Western Mediterranean. A fourth ship as yet unnamed is due to enter service in 2027.\n\n\n\nMSC World Americais scheduled to be named in Miami, Florida on April 9 and enter service that weekend sailing to the Caribbean. MSC will be the second company to have a cruise ship of over 200,000 gross tons in the U.S. market following Royal Caribbean International. Both Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line last year also ordered ships of this size to add to their fleets late in this decade and the next decade.\nThe addition marks a key step for MSC Cruises which has been building cruise ships for just 20 years and began in the 1990s with a series of small, secondhand cruise ships.MSC World Americawill be the 23rd cruise ship for the company which today rivals the three traditional brand leaders (Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, and Royal Caribbean International) in size and scope of operations.\n\n\n\nMSC highlights that theMSC World Americais being tailored to the U.S. market with re-imagined venues and concepts. She has seven onboard districts including bars, restaurants, entertainment, and leisure facilities. She will feature 18 bars and lounges, 19 dining venues, including four main restaurants and two buffets, as well as six specialty restaurants. The ship introduces a new Greek restaurant, a branded Eataly restaurant, a sports bar, and a comedy-karaoke club.\nMeasuring 1,093 feet (333 meters) in length, MSC constructed what is being billed as the largest cruise terminal in North America located in Miami to serve as her homeport. The ship has 22 decks and 2,614 passenger cabins. She will accommodate 6,762 passengers and have a crew of 2,138.\nThe ship incorporates the advanced technologies seen in the cruise sector, including being LNG dual-fueled. She has shore power connections and an advanced wastewater treatment plant.\nHer arrival coincides with one of the strongest cycles in the cruise industry with many brands reporting record booking positions and strong pricing. PortMiami which last year set a new record of nearly 7.3 million passengers, looks forward to the arrival of the MSC World America which will continue to the continued growth of the port."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nA partnership of companies from Norway has ordered a pioneering short-sea cargo ship that will advance the industry’s ability to provide zero-emissions operations. The cargo ship, which will be 7,800 dwt, is designed to transport timber from Norway to Europe and will be the first to operate on ammonia and electricity.\nThe order was placed by Skarv Shipping, a joint venture between Pear Group and Greig Edge, which was launched to initiate and develop sustainable short-sea shipping in northern Europe. The ship will be built by China’s Huanghai Shipbuilding and is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2027.\nDetails were not provided on the power system but the companies believe this will be one of the world's first four-stroke ammonia-powered vessels. It will measure 354 feet (108 meters) with a hold capacity of 10,200 cubic meters.\nThe ship is designed to sail most efficiently at low speeds, which they report helps ensure economically viable operations despite the higher cost of ammonia compared to traditional fuels. A 160-cubic ammonia tank, mixed with MGO (Marine Gas Oil) as pilot fuel, will provide enough fuel for a 14-day round trip from Norway to the continent.\n\n\n\n“The design and operation of the vessel consider the risks associated with using ammonia as fuel. Safety will be a primary focus and will be developed in close cooperation with class, manufacturers of green technology, and LMG Marin as ship designer. The ship will be outfitted with highly advanced safety systems, alongside operational safety procedures and crew training,” says Jan Øivind Svardal, CEO of Skarv Shipping.\nThey also highlight that the new ship will be equipped with a battery and it will have shore power access.\nLMG Marin developed the concept design for the vessel and the contract for its construction was negotiated with NorBroker Shipping & Trading, a partner of Viken AT Market. Once the vessel is completed, Arriva Shipping will take the ship on a long-term charter and manage the commercial ship operation for Viken AT Market.\nViken reports it ships approximately one million tons of Norwegian timber to the European continent each year. It uses conventional diesel-powered ships, although the partners have been working to launch a new generation of more efficient ships.\nThe ammonia-powered vessel is said to follow on and be an updated version of other recent orders placed by Skarv Shipping for the commercial operations for Peak CSL Group.\nArriva Shipping has entered into an agreement with the Chinese shipyard Jiangsu SOHO Marine Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. to construct a new dry cargo vessel with a cargo capacity of 8,000 deadweight tons and will employ a 2 MW battery hybrid system. The company launched its first hybrid vessel, Nor Viking, in 2022."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nSince its founding in 2010, NYSE-listed product tanker specialist Ardmore Shipping has carved out a place for itself as an innovative owner and operator, willing to try out new technology and reap rewards from higher efficiency. A focus on long-term value and a strong balance sheet has paid off, according to Ardmore. To find out more about its secret to success, TME spoke with Ardmore's recently appointed CEO, longtime tanker executive Gernot Ruppelt.\nTME: Can you tell us a bit about your career and how you came to Ardmore?Ruppelt:I found the maritime business partially by choice, partially by coincidence, and decided to build a life around it. I've been in the maritime industry my entire career, committed to this exciting, very international line of work. I've worked across the globe in five different countries, across three continents - Europe, Asia, and US. I've been with Ardmore since 2013, and as Chief Commercial Officer I led the commercial strategy and developed our trading capabilities, now operating in Europe, Singapore, and Houston.Before Ardmore, I spent five years in New York as a tanker broker with Poten & Partners. During that time, I was engaged in various project-based businesses, including chemical tankers. I was transacting with Ardmore Shipping when the company was in its early stages, still in startup mode. I recognized then that this was a unique company, with founder and former CEO Anthony Gurnee being very different from anybody I had dealt with.My career started at Maersk when I joined their management fast-track program. I worked for Maersk in Germany, where I'm from, then Singapore and Denmark, and ultimately the US.Can you tell us a little bit more about Ardmore? There have been some big changes, including your recent promotion.I officially became CEO in the middle of September 2024. By then, we had gone through a long-established and well-staged transition process that was initiated by the board in 2020 and kicked into high gear about a year ago.\nLooking at Ardmore as a business, we have always found ways to evolve over the past 15 years of our existence: expanding the fleet, the public listing in 2013, and really evolving our commercial strategy from a simple, high-quality time charter portfolio to a fully-fledged global trading platform.We have continuity in terms of strategy and our values, and at the same time we always look to develop and improve. Take as one example the joint venture we have with Anglo Eastern - Anglo Ardmore Ship Management - and many other ways to keep innovating as an organization.\nOur company emphasizes internal progression, and we've created this dynamic culture where Ardmore is truly a career escalator.  People are encouraged to step up when opportunities arise. We also have a great, fully independent board with real diversity in terms of industry background and specialization.Can you tell me about current market conditions and what you expect over the next three to five years?Some of the biggest impacts on our industry - whether it was COVID, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or more recently, the situation in the Red Sea - were caused by black swan events, and therefore by definition impossible to predict in advance. Today, a great deal of uncertainty remains. But here's what we do know: The product tanker fleet is getting really old. Newbuild ordering activity has picked up recently, but when you compare the number of ships on order to the number that are about to age out of service, the ratio is roughly one to four. That's going to have a positive impact on markets.We'll continue to see oil consumption and demand for oil products play an important role in the energy mix moving forward. There is also increased focus on a whole range of emerging transition fuels, such as biofuels, and the feedstocks to generate those new fuels and various different blending components.Shipyards are extremely busy in East Asia and newbuild prices have gotten higher. Do you think it's going to be more difficult for owners to introduce new tonnage into the market?If you wanted to order a ship today, you'd be looking at a 2028 delivery. As far as Ardmore is concerned, we are in no rush to execute ship acquisitions, while we always monitor the market for opportunities. In the meantime, we continue to execute on our well-established capital allocation policy: we've paid down debt significantly, lowering our break-even point. We've returned capital to shareholders and reinvested in the business in very meaningful ways.Last year, we sold our oldest ship and bought a 2017-built one, picking up incremental fuel efficiency and more cargo versatility. We've also reinvested in efficiency upgrades on existing ships, some providing 30-40 percent returns on investment or more.AI and digital tools are increasingly important for competitiveness. How are you seeing these tools helping your operations today?It's huge. Last year, we completed the rollout of an AI-supported voyage optimization system called DeepSea AI. This goes beyond just optimization of waypoints - it helps make trade-off decisions between marginal cost-saving opportunities and marginal revenue opportunities in real time. While concepts like profit optimization aren't new, the level of granularity now allows us to factor in ambient conditions and fuel costs to create much more dynamic control all throughout the voyage.We're also embracing AI integration in our onshore corporate processes. You don't have to be a technology firm to be good at technology adoption. Some products are available off the shelf, some virtually free, and with the right culture and mentality, you can find nearly limitless ways to innovate through technology adoption.Regarding decarbonization, what kind of strategies are you pursuing?Our mantra around decarbonization is finding opportunities to integrate performance with progress, rather than choosing between financial performance or decarbonization. We've worked with Value Maritime on CO2 capture-ready scrubbers, which provides interesting optionality for closed-loop operation  and carbon capture.We're engaged with customers around potential long-term projects for alternative fuels, though we're not at the point of making purely speculative investments. For now, we're focused on increasing fuel efficiency and making ships more sustainable and cargo versatile to ensure performance and optionality in the long run.What are you seeing with geopolitical uncertainties on the horizon?There are two layers to consider for product tanker demand. The bottom layer is consumption and overall oil demand, combined with how long these products have to travel.  The second layer is arbitrage, which can be driven short-term by events, weather or other factors. Geopolitical disruption is one facet, but there are other long-term trends - like refinery dislocation and a changing product demand slate - that are disconnected from geopolitical drivers.When trades get reorganized, it creates a need for flexibility and optionality, which is good for product tankers. As long as these trade shifts and arbitrage swings continue, it continues to bode well for tanker markets.Do you have any closing thoughts?We're really pleased with the company we've built over the last 15 years. We have a team and culture that's excited and ready for what the future holds for Ardmore, and we look forward to continuing to develop the business in the years to come."

        "content": "\nAfter many months of delays, the famed ocean liner s.s.United Statesdeparted her Philadelphia berth at midday on Wednesday, February 19. It is the first step on her final journey to becoming the world’s largest artificial reef sunk off the coast of Florida, and it drew wide attention from onlookers.\nThe ocean liner which still holds the title from 1952 of the fastest large passenger ship to cross the Atlantic had become a fixture on the Delaware River. She docked in an industrial part of the Port of Philadelphia in 1998. She was returning from Turkey and Ukraine where her interiors had been stripped to prepare for a possible new career as a cruise ship which never proceeded. For the past decade, the non-profit S.S. United States Conservancy sought to repurpose the vessel but in the end, was forced to sell the ship after losing a court fight with its landlord that controlled the Philadelphia pier.\nLast week, the vessel was shifted north across the slipway to the adjoining pier to begin the final preparations for the tow, which was later delayed by 48 hours due to weather concerns. High wind warnings delayed the departure one final time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt midday today, tugs positioned along the liner, pulled her out of the slip, and turned her south in the Delaware River. She paused off Pier 80 while the Vinik tug that will be taking her to Mobile, Alabama attached to the anchor chain hanging from the prow.\nThe trip downriver began at around 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, with two tugs on each side and one more on the stern to guide the vessel. The first obstacle was the Walt Whitman Bridge and she reached it just before low tide when the clearance under the bridge would be greatest. Road traffic on the bridge was temporarily stopped for her to pass underneath but images showed the roadway lined with vehicles from the roadway authority and personnel out watching the spectacle as the liner with its two massive funnels transited downriver and under the bridge. Reports were that she would have less than 10 feet beneath the roadway. When she arrived nearly 30 years ago, a radar antenna and a small signal light mast were removed for clearance under the bridge.\nSmall groups of loyal supporters of the liner and curious onlookers gathered at points along the river in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey enduring freezing air temperatures to see the unique sight of the graceful liner underway. Despite being rust streaked, peeling paint, and missing elements such as her lifeboats, she still had a majestic profile far different from the images of today’s cruise ships.\n\n\n\nReports are that it will take 24 hours for the tow to reach the mouth of the Delaware and enter the Atlantic Ocean. The trip to Mobile, Alabama is projected to take about two weeks and the new owners, Florida’s Okaloosa Country, arranged livestream tracking online to follow her path.\nOnce she reaches Mobile, the process for decontamination will continue removing PCBs, asbestos, and other harmful materials. Her fuel tanks need to be emptied of what remains from 1969 when she was last under steam in operation. The funnels, radar mast, and windows all are to be removed before the hull is reefed and the loose paint and decking materials are removed.\n\n\n\nTo many, it seems an ignominious ending to one of the most famous ocean liners. Setting the record at an average of greater than 35 knots, and rumored to be able to achieve speeds of 40 knots, she remains the fastest ocean liner ever built. At nearly 1,000 feet in length, she was sized to be able to transit the Panama Canal and had added military considerations so that she could have converted to a troopship in time of war. Her designer insisted there would be no wood in the passenger areas to make her fireproof and used only lightweight materials to reduce her weight to ensure her speed. She carried former and future U.S. president and many dignitaries, businessmen, military and government personnel, as well as regular travelers and even some immigrants during her career which numbered nearly 800 Atlantic crossings and a handful of cruises.\nCompetition from the jet airplane and government cost-cutting doomed the liner and in 1969 after just 17 years of commercial service her owners, United States Lines, laid up the ship. A symbol of the nation, many expected the government would relent and she would return to service. Instead, the Maritime Administration acquired her in 1973 and later sold her to a real estate developer.\nA succession of owners proposed plans to reactivate the ship, or later to convert her to a static attraction. Okaloosa County acquired her for $1 million in October 2024 and expects to invest up to $10 million in the project to reef the liner, which is expected to take place in 2026."

The teams are trying to develop a salvage plan as concerns are rising as “ripples” have been spotted on the hull of the 680-foot (207-meter) containership.\nA spokesperson for the Canadian Coast Guard said they are trying to determine if the deformation on the hull came from the grounding or if the vessel is moving on the rocky shoreline. Salvage crews were able to board the ship on Monday, but yesterday, February 18, they encountered 3-meter (10-foot) seas and 30-knot winds. The Coast Guard reports two attempts were made to get aboard but called off due to safety concerns.\nThe owners of the vessel are reportedly working with the Coast Guard and are also looking to bring in additional salvage resources. The Telegram newspaper in Newfoundland reports the owners have retained an offshore service vessel Avalon Seas to assist in the salvage and are also considering hiring a larger, salvage tug.\n\n\n\nNo attempt will be made to pull the vessel off the rocks however until they have been able to complete survey the hull. They want to inspect the ship internally and are also hoping to have divers check the hull if the seas permit. One hope is that the cove where the ship is could become choked with ice that might help to shield the waters from some of the weather.\nThe Coast Guard has not yet determined how much fuel oil is aboard theMSC Baltic III. On Monday, the icebreaker CCGSAnn Harveyarrived on scene and was able to launch its Fast Rescue Craft for a visual assessment. They have also conducted aerial surveys and reported no pollution at this time.\nWorking with MSC, the Coast Guard reports they have determined there are approximately 470 containers aboard but over half are empties. The remainder are loaded with material including food, lumber, and paper supplies. There was no indication of hazardous cargo.\nAnother Canadian Coast Guard vessel, CCGSJean Goodwillhas been delayed due to ongoing work to maintain shipping lanes. As soon as operationally possible, she will also transit to the area off Newfoundland.\nAmong the options the Coast Guard reported will be considered is possibly removing some of the containers or pumping the fuel from the vessel. One concern is if it would be possible to get another vessel alongside. The Coast Guard said it was also considering pumping the fuel to the shore.\nTheMSC Baltic IIIremains wedged up on the rocky shoreline which continues to raise concerns. Bruce English of the Coast Guard told The Telegram the vessel is a big ship, and she is in a bad spot."

The ceremony took place in Yangzhou, China, and fell on the ninth anniversary of the reorganization of COSCO Shipping into its current form as the sprawling state-controlled entity.\nChinese officials celebrated the achievements of the vessel reporting that COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry identified 163 research topics to address in developing a large methanol-fueled vessel. They report receiving 31 invention patents related to the methanol energy technology for the vessels.\nDesign for the vessel was executed by COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry in Yangzhou to overcome difficulties such as methanol special coating and overall jacking of the upper structure. They report established a methanol system test and methanol filling management system.\nThe series of ships are being equipped with the first domestic WinGD methanol dual-fuel main engine, methanol dual-fuel generator, and Alfa Laval's first methanol dual-fuel boiler. They also equipped a methanol fuel barge and supply system. Intelligent systems were fitted to optimize energy consumption and create energy-saving metrics. The vessels are reported to achieve excellent energy utilization ratios.\n\n\nMethanol bunkering systems were developed for the new vessels (COSCO Shipping)\n\nChina Martine Fuel Jiangsu Company worked with COSCO Shipping to develop the bunkering systems for the vessel including for terminal tank trucks. The processes were certified by China Classification Society and the first refueling of the new vessel took place on December 26 at the shipyard.\nThe first vessel was namedCOSCO Shipping Yangpuand it is completing outfitting. It will also become the first methanol-fueled containership deployed on a transpacific route. It has a large methanol storage system that will enable it to complete a one-way voyage between the Far East and the West Coast of the United States in “pure methanol mode.”\nEach of the vessels of the class has a capacity of 16,136 TEUs on par with Maersk’s methanol class launched with the Ane Maersk (16,000 TEU) which was introduced in January 2024. TheCOSCO Shipping Yangpuhas an overall length of 366 meters (1,200 feet) and a beam of 51 meters (167 feet).\n\n\nSecond ship of the class was floated in December 2024 from the COSCO Heavy Industries shipyard (COSCO Shipping)\n\nConstruction on the first vessel began in April 2024. In December 2024, COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry floated out the second vessel of the class,COSCO Shipping Carnation.\nCOSCO placed an order of four methanol-dual fuel 16,000 TEU container ships in 2023 after an initial order in 2022 for 12 methanol ships each with a capacity of 24,000 TEU which will be deployed for COSCO and OOCL.

        "content": "The IMO's planned global fuel standard for low-carbon energy will not be enough to underwrite the growth of the most ambitious \"green corridors,\" the designated A-to-B routes intended as incubators for decarbonized propulsion, according to a new study from UMAS, Global Maritime Forum and UCL. Even when combined with regional programs like the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), \"compliance-driven green shipping corridors are unlikely to form\" because of the high cost of new e-fuels - unless supported with some amount of subsidy.\nMore than 60 different green corridor partnerships have been announced to date, by UMAS' tally, some more advanced in planning than others. Since green fuels will be far more expensive, and will need new support infrastructure, the details of each corridor - and how it is affected by changing regulations - are needed to evaluate the business case. UMAS examined specific vessel classes, cargoes and routes, estimating total cost of ownership for four different fuel choices for each one. The authors then estimated the cost gap between the least-expensive compliance option and the cost of running purely on e-fuels on a green shipping corridor. Over time, the cost difference adds up: In one example based on a 45,000 cubic meter gas carrier, the extra cost of participating in a 100-percent e-ammonia green corridor amounted to $72 million over four years.\nLess ambitious options exist and cost far less - for example, running on natural gas-based blue ammonia - but the price differential for a pure e-fuel operation is daunting without support. More complex policy arrangements - like pooling agreements that allow the greenest participants to sell \"overcompliance\" credits to other shipowners - could help incentivize green corridor development, but ultimately some amount of subsidy will likely be required, especially in the early years when IMO regulations are just beginning to phase in.\n\"The most important role Green Corridors can play is to coordinate and kick-start the value chain for tomorrow’s shipping fuels. Participants in corridors will need to be creative in how they leverage a range of regulations, but it’s clear from this work that the scale of their impact will depend on policymakers delivering targeted support for e-fuels,\" said Jesse Fahnestock, Director of Decarbonization at the Global Maritime Forum."

        "content": "\nLongtime Transocean CEO Jeremy Thigpen is transitioning into a new role as chairman of the company's board, the offshore drilling firm announced Tuesday.\nThigpen,50, has been at the helm of the world's biggest offshore rig company since 2015, and he guided the firm through the toughest years of the offshore market downturn. Transoceansurviveda debt restructuring in 2020 and went on to acquire two major rivals, Songa Offshore and Ocean Rig. Under Thigpen, Transocean overhauled and expanded its fleet and added the world's first 8th-generation, 20,000 PSI-capable drillship. It is now the largest provider of offshore drilling services by revenue and has the most technologically advanced fleet in the industry (though China's state-owned COSL leads by unit count.)\nAs part of a multiyear plan, Thigpen will step aside and be replaced in the CEO role by Keelan Adamson, the company's current president and COO. The transition will take place over the course of the next few months.\n\"Throughout his three decades with Transocean, where his experience has taken him from the drill floor to the executive level, Keelan has helped to shape the foundation of the company and position Transocean for sustained success as the industry’s market leader,\" said Transocean board chairman Chad Deaton.\nAn aeronautical engineer by training, Adamson joined Transocean in 1995 and held rig management roles throughout the company's global operations. He was promoted to run the North American region, then headed up a variety of VP-level roles at headquarters before taking over as SVP of Operations in 2017. He has been at the helm as COO since 2018, adding the title of president in 2022.\nThigpen will continue in his current role as CEO until the handover is completed, and will then (subject to shareholder approval) take over as chairman of Transocean's board. Deaton will continue on as the board's lead independent director.\n\"Transocean is a resilient and strong organization, made stronger by leaders like Keelan whom I have had the pleasure of working closely with for the past decade. Keelan is the right person to lead Transocean as we build upon the company’s position as the leader in offshore drilling,\" said Thigpen in a statement."

The frigate arrived separately, transiting the Torres Strait and passing off the coast of the Northern Territories before meeting up with Weishanhu.\nAccording to the FT, the Chinese task force approached about 150 nautical miles east of Sydney, within Australia's EEZ. It also spent time on the other side of the Tasman Sea, near New Zealand's shores, and Australia has been working closely with its neighbor to monitor the PLA Navy's movements.\n\"We have not been informed by the Chinese government why this task group has been deployed into our region, and we have not been informed what its future plans are,\" New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins said.\nZunyiis a Type 055 cruiser, newly commissioned in 2023.

        "content": "\nUS Central Command has belatedly confirmed that on January 28, the US Coast Guard Sentinel Class cutter USCGCClarence Sutphin Jr.intercepted a dhow in the Arabian Sea and discovered a consignment of Iranian arms and explosives on board.\nThe consignment consisted of components for medium-range ballistic missiles and unmanned sea drones, plus military-grade communication and network equipment and anti-tank guided missile launcher assemblies.\nThe delay in releasing details of the seizure may have occurred because the US Coast Guard boarding party are also likely to have gathered material which after analysis proved that the consignment had been dispatched from Iran and was en route to Houthi forces in Yemen.\n\nArms, explosives and equipment seized by USCGC Clarence Sutphin Jr on January 28 (NAVCENT)\nThe seizure conforms to a well-established pattern, confirmed in annual United Nations Panel of Expert reports. Materiel destined for the Houthis is loaded onto nondescript dhows, manned by stateless crews, from warehouses controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force Unit 190 in Chah Bahar, Bandar Abbas and elsewhere. The material is transshipped to fishing vessels from the Yemeni coast, and is then smuggled over beaches and through to Houthi-controlled areas.\nIn the last year, however, some smuggling dhows have sailed directly into small fishing ports in Houthi-controlled areas of the Red Sea. The Unit 190 logistic plan is to assume that some loads will be intercepted and lost – but if consignments are spread across numerous vessels, enough materiel will get through.\nThe seizure indicates that Iran still has undiminished intent to keep the Houthis well-supplied, maintaining the dispersed threat that Iran orchestrates through its control of the Axis of Resistance. Hezbollah and Iranian-linked militias in Syria may be much diminished as part of this constellation, but the Houthis remain a potent contributor to the Iranian-controlled capability, and much valued because the Houthis disperse the threat. Stocks of missiles and drones expended before the ceasefire came into effect in the Red Sea, or destroyed by US, Israeli and UK air strikes, all need to be replenished.\nThe Iranian leadership is nervous about the intentions of the new Trump administration, as well as the threat to the Iranian nuclear program from Israel. Ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon have provided Israel additional space for maneuvering, and previous attacks on Iran have weakened its air defenses.\nIn a speech in Tabriz on the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei acknowledged the increased risk of attack and said that Iran’s ‘capability to counter hard threats is at an \"excellent level.\"  Almost all of Iran’s ballistic missile capability - which is spread across 25 underground complexes - remains intact, and would be capable of launching a much heavier attack than Iran’s Operation True Promise-2 launched against Israel on October 1, 2024. Senior IRGC leaders have echoed the threat of an Operation True Promise-3.\nIran is also building up that missile inventory. To meet the solid fuel needs for its production of ballistic missiles, Iran successfully landed 34 containers loaded with sodium perchlorate when the MVGolbondocked in Bandar Abbas last week. Sodium perchlorate is processed into ammonium perchlorate rocket fuel, demand for which Iran is unable to satisfy from domestic sources. A sister ship, MVJairani, planned to have a similar load on board and is still on its way back from Shanghai."

        "content": "Swedish authorities confirmed this morning, February 21, that they have launched an investigation into newly discovered damage on another undersea Baltic transmission cable. News of the investigation came as the European Commission’s Executive Committee mapped out new steps to protect critical infrastructure including calling for enforcing sanctions against the shadow fleet.\nFew details have been provided on the latest incident other than a brief statement from the Swedish Police saying they were investigating “a suspected cable break in the Baltic Sea within the Swedish economic zone. The preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage was initiated so that the police can have access to the tools needed to clarify what happened and whether it is a new or old injury.”\nThe Swedish Coast Guard confirmed that its patrol boatKBV 003is on its way to east of Gotland. According to the media reports, the cable runs past Gotland and through the Swedish zone while connecting Finland to Germany.\nSeparately, Cinia Communications, the Finish state majority-owned company, issued a brief statement reporting, “Some disturbance has been detected on the C-Lion1 submarine cable between Finland and Germany.” This would be the third incident involving the same cable which was damaged in November and December 2024. Cinia, however, is reporting today “The disturbance does not affect the functionality of telecommunications connections running in the cable and the data traffic continues flowing normally.” The company however has submitted a request for investigation to Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).\n“No realm of life is free from threats or hostile behavior today,” said Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission reporting the planned actions by the EC High Representatives. “Today we are taking steps to protect cables, detect and anticipate threats more quickly, and repair damage as fast as possible. We should mobilize all our strengths, military and civil capacities to ensure surveillance and attribute attacks quicker, sanctioning those responsible of sabotage. Would-be perpetrators must also be deterred.”\nThe Joint Communication issued after the meeting in Helsinki maps out specific actions that they said will be progressively rolled out in 2025 and 2026. This comes in addition to the current efforts by member states and NATO to increase monitoring in the Baltic. The High Representative body said the steps being introduced are a range of measures to bolster the resilience of this critical infrastructure, address prevention, detection, response, recovery, and deterrence.\nForcing on the deterrence aspect, the plan calls for “Enforcing sanctions and diplomatic measures against hostile actors and the ‘shadow fleet', making full use of the Hybrid Toolbox to address hybrid campaigns.”\nPrevention will include stepping up security requirements and risk assessments on submarine cables while the body is calling for funding the development of new and smart cables, allowing for redundancies and enhancing resilience. They want to enhance threat-monitoring capabilities and improve the efficiency of response and recovery efforts.\nBy the end of 2025, the Commission and the High Representative are expected to present, amongst other actions, the mapping of existing and planned submarine cable infrastructures, a Coordinated Risk Assessment on submarine cables, a Cable Security Toolbox of mitigating measures, and a priority list of Cable Projects of European Interest."

        "content": "Russian authorities are denying media reports that another one of the decrepit fleet of ancient cargo ships operating on the Sea of Azov is in distress. The media is saying the vessel was taking on water while the authorities insist the vessel was in port and repaired.\nThe general cargo ship Pavel Grabovsky, built in 1979, loaded a cargo of 3,000 tons of corn and departed Rostov-on-Don bound for Turkey.  After passing the city of Azov, the vessel reportedly encountered ice and was damaged on February 16 without issuing a distress call.\nThe media indicated the vessel struck ice and the crew was attempting to control the flooding with its pumps. However, at some point during the week, the crew realized they were not able to control the flooding and asked for permission to return to Azov.\nThe reports vary from here with the media saying the ship had too deep a draft and due to water levels was unable to reach the port and went aground. The icebreakers Kapiran Demidov and Kapitan Chudinnov were reported to be making their way to assist the vessel.\n\n\n\nTASS issued an official report denying the media accounts and saying the vessel had reached Azov and repairs were made. They however are admitting the vessel went aground but said it was due to weather conditions as the cargo ship was departing Azov to resume its trip to Turkey. Citing the Ministry of Transport, TASS indicates that when the weather improves and sea levels rise, the vessel will be removed from the roadstead and the owner will make further repairs.\nThe vessel is registered in Panama and 3,100 dwt. Equasis indicates it has been under the management of a Turkish company since 2013. The Pavel Grabovsky had a similar incident in 2013 when it had to be rescued after stranding. At the time, it was registered in Sierra Leone. There was a crew of 14 aboard and they had loaded a cargo of wheat. The ship went aground in the port of Azov.\nRecords show the vessel was inspected at the end of January 2025 in Georgia. The report lists eight deficiencies but no detention order was issued. The issues ranged from problems with the life saving equipment to piping, electrical, safety of the pilot ladders, and documentation.\nAfter two incidents at the end of 2024 involving Russian sea-river tankers near the Kerch Strait at the exit from the Sea of Azov, the Russian Ministry of Transport reportedly issued aninspection orderfor all the old vessels operating in the region. Officials indicated as many as 500 shipping companies and their vessels would be subject to the inspections as part of an effort to improve the image of shipping and the response to the oil spill from one of the tankers lost in December."

        "author": "Tony Munoz",
        "content": "The NTSB has released its investigative report on the deadly blaze aboard the aging boxshipStride, which sustained an engine room fire at Port of Houston early last year. The fire was caused by the installation of the wrong kind of valve, which led to an overflow of fuel into the engine room.\nOn January 8, 2024,Stridewas alongside at the Barbours Cut Marine Terminal and taking on bunkers. The chief engineer and third engineer were in the engine room to monitor the transfer, and they began the bunkering sequence by lining up valves to put diesel into the port and starboard diesel oil tanks simultaneously. Transfer began at 0305 at a slow speed, then - at the chief's request - ramped up to maximum pressure and flow rate.\nAll was normal until 0325, when the wiper - who was on the 3rd deck of the engine room - saw diesel dripping down from the upper levels. He ran to the engine control room and alerted the chief and the third engineer, who began yelling on the radio. The tankerman on the bunker barge and the captain on the bunkering tug both heard \"excited chatter\" on VHF, and the tug master ordered the tankerman to shut down transfer immediately. The tankerman shut down the pump right away and valved off the discharge. At about this point, the crewmember stationed atStride'sbunker manifold said the pressure gauge spiked to about 30 PSI, up from zero earlier in the evolution.\nMinutes later, at about 0330, a fire and explosion occurred in the engine room, sending flames up to six feet out of the open engine room hatch. The captain heard the blast and ran to the bridge to shut down all emergency stops, including the ventilation fans, the boiler and the oil pumps, and he sounded the general alarm.\nOn the captain's orders, the crew sealed the hatch and the ventilation ducts to the engine room, with three crewmembers still inside. The crew ran out fire hoses and began boundary cooling on the outside of the engine room.\nAt 0336, the chief engineer reported by radio that he, the wiper and the third engineer were still trapped. Two minutes later, a fire team suited up and attempted to enter the engine room through a scuttle, but could not because of heavy smoke. They tried again at 0345 through an entrance on the upper deck, but were repelled by the fire. At 0350, one member of the fire team made it inside, but could not locate the missing crewmembers before he had to retreat.\nShoreside fire teams began arriving at 0343, along with a fireboat, which provided boundary cooling. A local fire department leader recommended discharging CO2 in the engine room, but the master refused, since he still had people inside.\nAt 0415, the fire team finally managed to reach the engine control room. The blaze was out, but the space was filled with thick smoke. They found the victims; only the wiper was still breathing, and paramedics pronounced the chief engineer and third engineer dead on scene.\nAt the fire department's request, the engine room was sealed and filled with CO2 for 24 hours to ensure that the blaze was out.\nAfter the fire, diesel fuel was found on all decks of the engine room, dripping out of the funnel casing and coating the interior of the funnel. It was pooled in large quantities around the base of the main engine. The fire damage throughout the engine room was so extensive that the 27-year-old ship was declared a constructive total loss and scrapped.\nInvestigators found that the starboard side diesel tank had overfilled, and the pressure pushed fuel through the vent pipe, eight decks up into the funnel. The fuel then flooded out of cracks in a badly-repaired cutout section of the vent and dripped back down the funnel casing. (Class found that three of the owner's other vessels had the same cutout in the vent.)\nWeeks prior, theStride'soffgoing chief engineer had ordered the wrong valve as a replacement for the angle stop valve on the port side diesel tank. The new valve was a one-way check valve, not a stop valve, and it was installed in an orientation that prevented any diesel from going into the tank - even when the valve was nominally open.\nWhen the oncoming chief engineer lined up the valves to fill both port and starboard tanks at the same time, he was actually filling only the starboard tank, since no fuel could get past the check valve on the port side. The starboard tank rapidly overfilled, then sent the excess diesel up the vent pipe, causing the casualty.\n\"Vessel drawings contain piping symbols for equipment such as valve types, sizes, and functions. Owners, operators, and crews should carefully note all components of a vessel’s drawings and diagrams to ensure that proper spare or replacement parts are ordered to maintain functionality,\" noted NTSB. \"Crews should ensure adequate personnel are available to take frequent soundings, establish fuel tank filling rates, and communicate to the person in charge, so tanks are monitored and do not overflow.\""

According to multiple media reports, the investigation is looking at terrorism as details also emerged on two other incidents with tankers in recent weeks in the Mediterranean.\nThe anti-terrorism unit of Genoa’s Public Prosecutor’s Office has reportedly become involved in the incident that damaged the Greek-ownedSeajewel(108,888 dwt) overnight between February 14 and 15. The Port Authority of Savona, Italy confirmed earlier this week that offloading operations had been suspended afteranomalies were observedwithout specifying what happened.\nThe chief prosecutor told Reuters they have taken the data from the vessel’s “black box” as part of an investigation into possible terrorist activities. The report indicates divers found a 28 x 47-inch hole in the hull of the tanker. Previously the report said the plates were driven inward indicating external force. They also cited the presence of dead fish in the area.\nThe vessel’s owner Thenamaris of Greece confirmed that the crew was safe while also mentioning that there were third-party individuals involved in the offloading. They said the Greek authorities were also investigating and in the same statement said the investigation involved a second tanker,Seacharm(112,000 dwt) which had been damaged in January while sailing to Turkey.\nThat caused widespread speculation fueled by a report by Lloyd’s List that detailed yet another previously unreported incident involving a tanker. The reports indicate the product tankerGrace Ferrum(50,000 dwt) was damaged while at anchor in Libyan waters and remains at the port weeks later.\nBloomberg points out that both of the Thenamaris tankers in the past had called at Russia’s Novorossiysk port and previously transported Russian oil. They state that it appears neither tanker was violating sanctions carrying Russian oil this year when they were damaged. TheGrace Ferrumhad called at Ust-Luga in the Baltic. Russian authorities also asserted that another tanker,Koala, wasattacked causing the explosionwhile it was in the port of Ust-Luga.\nThe four incidents all occurring in 2025 have prompted media speculation that vessels in the Russian oil trade are being targeted. Italian and Greek investigators will be looking into these allegations as they seek the cause of the damage to the Thenamaris tankers.\nAdding to the speculation are also the allegations that the Russian cargo ship Ursa Major operating as a military sealift ship was attacked causing it to sink in December 2024. The operator of the vesselasserted it was an attackthat sunk the vessel while the Russian fleet off Syria also came under pressure with reports of at least one fire aboard a ship being used as part of the Syrian evacuation.\nOfficials have said it is far too early to link these incidents. They could be a coincidence or possibly someone is targeting shipping supporting Russia."

        "content": "\nHMM, which itself was the subject of takeover talks a year ago, is poised to consolidate the South Korean shipping industry. According to a report in Business Korea and other media outlets, HMM has been selected as the preferred bidder to acquire control of SK Shipping, Korea’s leader in energy shipping. The deal aligns with HMM’s declared strategy to expand beyond its primary operations in container shipping.\nSK Shipping was started in 1982 and remained a part of the SK Conglomerate until being acquired in 2018 by investment group Hahn & Co. Since then, the company has been reshaped shedding old ships and building its position in crude oil, LNG, LPG, bulk shipping, and bunkering.\nHahn has been exploring selling the crude oil tankers and then in October 2024 was reported to have retained Morgan Stanley to shop the company. Hahn paid approximately $1 billion for a stake that today is nearly 80 percent of SK Shipping with the media reports saying Hahn is seeking $2.8 billion for control of the company. The former parent, SK Group, retains approximately 16 percent ownership.\nHMM is reported to be starting due diligence after being selected as the preferred bidder. The media reports suggest a deal would be completed by as early as April.\nIn addition to discussions on the valuation, one challenge the media reports highlight is a non-compete agreement that still covers the LNG business for HMM. During the restructuring of the former Hyundai Merchant Marine, the company in 2014 sold its LNG carrier business to an investment firm and entered into a non-compete agreement in place till 2029. HMM recently explored reacquiring its LNG business but the investment firm in late 2024 delayed the sale of the unit for two more years.\nSpeculation is that HMM might proceed without the dozen LNG carriers owned by SK Shipping. HMM is expected to make an offer of $1.4 billion for the 22 crude oil tankers, 14 LPG carriers, 10 bulk carriers, and seven bunker ships. It would expand and diversify HMM’s tanker and non-container operations.\nThe sale of HMM by the state-controlled banks was canceled in 2024 when the banks failed to come to terms with Harim Group and private equity fund JKL Partners which had been selected as the preferred bidder. HMM has emphasized a growth strategy continuing after it reported its third-highest-ever sales in 2024 topping performance during the peak of the pandemic-related surge in shipping.\nHMM is currently ranked eighth in container shipping with a total capacity of just over 900,000 TEU. To increase profitability the company said it will be introducing 12 new 13,000 TEU containerships deploying them on routes to the Americas and opening a new route to Mexico. The company has an orderbook for nine additional containerships with 9,000 EU capacity and methanol or LNG fueled. HMM is also poised to enter ownership in the car carrier sector ordering ships that will operate under long-term charters to Hyundai-Glovis."

Austin-based Saronic is planning the most ambitious infrastructure venture in autonomous navigation in the West, and it hopes to bypass shipyard labor constraints through advanced automation.\nSaronic's primary client is the U.S. Navy, and to date, Saronic's vessel classes have been at the small end. It has models measuring up to 24 feet in length, and produces them in-house. Small unmanned vessels have inherent limitations with range and weather, but have proven their battlefield value with Ukrainian forces in the Black Sea.\nSaronic has plans to build a \"larger\" autonomous vessel class, and though it has not published specifics, its promotional illustrations indicate vessels in the crewboat size range - a familiar format from the \"Ghost Fleet Overlord\" USV program. Compared to the Navy's own design-build programs for manned warships, Saronic is moving very quickly: All three of its small models went from concept to in-water prototypes in just six months, and it has grown into a 300-person company with nearly $1 billion raised in less than three years.\n\"We're going to take those same principles of mission-centric design, of affordability and scalability and the most advanced software in the world and we're going to move that into autonomous ships and autonomous shipbuilding for the Navy,\" CEO Dino Mavrookas told Defense One. He pledged billions of dollars in investment and a program to restore U.S. shipbuilding at a scale \"we have not seen since WWII.\"\nSaronic is still looking for a location for its future \"Port Alpha\" yard, but it plans to have a real facility on acreage within five years. That future yard will look different, according to the firm. Saronic's management team is not from the shipbuilding sector, and it plans to \"rethink the mechanics of shipbuilding from the foundation up, leveraging insights from the last decade of domestic manufacturing improvements.\" The objective is to remove inefficiencies through a production-line approach, saving money and improving quality.\n\"We're looking at a new class of vessels with a new way of building them, unburdened by what some of the constraints the current shipbuilding industrial base are hindered by,\" Saronic co-founder Rob Lehman told reporters."

        "content": "The former chief executive at New Zealand’s Ports of Auckland (POAL) has been slapped with a fine of $110,000 (NZ$190,000) for the death of a stevedore in 2020. It is the first time that a company's top leader has been convicted and sentenced for breaching safety duties in New Zealand.\nThe sentencing stems from an August 2020 incident in which stevedore Pala’amo (Amo) Kalati was crushed by a container at the port. The containership Constantinos P was docked in Auckland discharging containers at the Fergusson Container Terminal. Kalati, 31, and a colleague were working as lashers securing the containers to be lifted off the vessel. A lift went terribly wrong when two boxes were to be hoisted but a third was still partially attached. As they were hoisted, the third container fell loose, crashing down and killing Kalati.\nFollowing his death, Maritime NZ filed two alternative charges, one against Ports of Auckland and the other against Tony Gibson, who served as CEO between 2011 and 2021. The charges were for a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.\nGibson's conviction and his subsequent sentencing mark the first time an officer of a large company has been convicted of a breach of their duties for safety in New Zealand. “Gibson had the knowledge, influence, resources and opportunity to address safety gaps and ensure that appropriate systems were in place at the port, but failed to do so,” said Kirstie Hewlett, Maritime NZ Director. She added that during Gibson’s tenure, Auckland was convicted of several offenses under health and safety legislation, with some resulting in fatalities and serious injuries.\nMaritime NZ highlighted that the case should serve as a strong reminder to the top leadership of large companies that they need to understand the risks at their businesses and put in place controls and systems that ensure workplace safety.\nPorts of Auckland was also charged and sentenced in the case, and was ordered to pay a fine of $320,000 (NZ$561,000).\nAs New Zealand’s largest container facility, Auckland handles about 850,000 TEU annually, equal to about 25 percent of the country’s containerized freight volume."

The two companies announced today the plans to launch Seascale Energy. By combining strengths, the two companies said they aim to set a new standard for marine fuel procurement by delivering considerable cost efficiencies, transparency, and access to sustainable fuel innovations.\nExpected to launch in mid-2025, Seascale Energy will initially represent 7.5 million metric tons in bunkering volume placing it solidly among the ten largest bunker providers. It will be jointly owned and managed under a dual-CEO structure with officers ranging from Singapore to Geneva, Copenhagen, and Houston.\n“Our vision is to lead the energy transition in shipping, unlocking value for our stakeholders while addressing industry challenges around transparency, quality, and decarbonization,” said Jan Dieleman, President of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business. “Together, we are shaping a more sustainable future for marine fuel procurement.”\nCargill best known as an agricultural company and trader also operates a large shipping division. In 2021, the company launched Pure Marine Fuels as a partnership with Maersk Tankers. The two companies said they purchased over 4 million tons of bunkers annually. In a 2023 interview with S&P, Cargill highlighted its growing position in biofuels. For its shipping operations, Cargill working with Lauritzen ordered what are likely to become the first methanol-fueled bulkers due to introduction this year and next.\nHafnia leads the Bunker Alliance which has over 20 participants from the shipping industry. It reports that the alliance, with a yearly volume of over 3.5 million metric tons, purchases fuel for over 1000 vessels. It ranks among the top 10 bunkering companies in the world.\nBy consolidating bunker purchasing volumes, Seascale Energy reports it will secure even more competitive pricing and terms while providing tailored procurement solutions to meet its customers’ diverse needs. It will also offer an expanded global port network, giving customers a consistent, high-quality fuel supply worldwide.\n“As one of the largest services of its kind, led by two large-scale fuel users, we are committed to improving efficiency and addressing industry challenges to benefit our stakeholders across the maritime sector,” said Hafnia CEO Mikael Skov.\nThe joint venture reports it will offer shipowners and charterers improved transparency and scale, enabling them to secure competitive deals and benchmark performance. Tailored procurement services will reduce internal costs, freeing resources for customers to focus on their core operations."

TheAgogo FPSOwill be handed over by the end of the month, more than a month ahead of schedule setting a record for conversion speed, and will depart for Angola where it will operate for at least the next 15 years.\nThe Malaysian company was awarded the contract for the FPSO by Azule Energy a joint venture between BP and Eni in February 2023. Azule Energy has a 15-year charter with an option for five additional years in a deal valued at approximately $5.3 billion.\n\n\nFPSO named at the COSCO Shanghai shipyard on February 20 (Yinson)\n\nThe basis for the project is a VLCC crude oil tanker built in 2009. The 321,300 dwt vessel registered in Singapore launched a conversion that took a total of 24 months, including seven months of integration work carried out in Shanghai at the COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry yard. COSCO highlights the previous fastest conversion was 27 months for the YinsonMaria Quiteria FPSOdelivered in April 2024. The new FPSO measures approximately 1,093 feet (333 meters) in length.\nThey are highlighting the advanced technologies aboard the vessel being deployed for the first time in the sector. The vessel uses an absorbent system to clean the post production gas emissions combined with a carbon storage system. It is billed as the first carbon capture and storage system of its kind deployed on an offshore FPSO.\nBy capturing carbon dioxide from the flue gas after the combustion of the ship's gas turbines, it significantly reduces FPSO greenhouse gas emissions. According to the shipowner, the installation of this device can reduce carbon emissions by about 27%, which based on the expected rate of crude oil production will equate to an estimated CO2 emissions reduction of about 230,000 tons per year. The Agogo FPSO has a production rate of 120,000 barrels per day.\n\nChina recently completed the construction of the world's first floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The vessel is scheduled for delivery by the end of February.https://t.co/OyXok02B3Npic.twitter.com/h7ZU85HOb4\n\nTheAgogo FPSOfeatures additional cutting-edge carbon reduction technologies. These include a closed flare system, hydrocarbon blanketing, combined cycle technology, automated process controls, and an all-electric drive systems.\nThe Agogo field, which was discovered in 2019, is positioned approximately 100 miles from the coast of Angola. It is in the Atlantic near the northern border of Angola at a depth of approximately 1,700 meters. The field started production in 2020 and the new FPSO will become the third on the field."

        "content": "The collation of four of America’s most powerful unions issued a letter calling on Donald Trump to finish the process started under the Biden Administration to sanction China for its efforts to dominate shipbuilding, the maritime and logistics sectors. Trump has stated his concern for the shipbuilding industry while in Congress efforts continue on the proposed SHIPS for America Act, which the sponsors say is the first unified effort to rebuild the U.S. merchant marine and shipbuilding.\nThe presidents of the United Steelworkers International, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, jointly signed the letter dated February 19. In it, they are, “urging your administration to enforce strong penalties against China for its unfair trade practices, particularly in shipbuilding, maritime, and logistics sectors.”\nThe five unions filed aformal complaintin March 2024 under the U.S. Trade Act and were successful in getting the Trade Representative’s Office to launch a formal investigation. The Biden Administration came out in favor of the action and carried it through to aformal report and recommendationsissued in its closing days.\nThe letter cites the report and its finding that the “Chinese Community Party advanced a systematic array of unfair trade practices and economic policies designed to dominate and control the maritime, shipbuilding, and logistics sectors.” They highlight the findings that China distributed over $100 billion in unfair support for its shipbuilding industry. They point out that China received 71 percent of the shipbuilding orders in 2024 producing over 1,000 ships last year. They report the U.S. produced fewer than 10 ocean-going commercial ships in 2024 and has fewer than 80 in service. China by comparison they report has more than 5,500 flagged ocean-going merchant vessels.\n“We urge you to take responsible action to impose tough penalties against vessels built according to the plans, policies, and actions of the Chinese Communist Party and to adopt complementary policies that rebuild America’s shipbuilding capacity and workforce,” the unions write in their letter to the president. They pointed out last year when they launched this initiative, they called for actions to deter the purchase of Chinese-built ships from entering U.S. ports.\nThe U.S. Trade Representative made recommendations calling for action. The Biden Administration agreed that responsive action was necessary but left it to the new administration to formulate the steps as part of its broader tariff program against China.\nTrump has recently made comments in interviews about the lack of U.S. shipbuilding capabilities. He has said the U.S. might call on Allies such as South Korea to bolster its shipbuilding programs.\nChina has repeatedly criticized the investigation calling it short-sighted, lacking facts, and shifting blame for the decline of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. They point to the U.S.’s decline in shipbuilding since the 1940s and 1950s and the lack of investment to modernize and employ new technologies. The investigation they said was part of the China fear program led by the U.S.\nThe call to involve President Trump comes as Senator Mark Kelly and Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon visited the Philly Shipyard recently acquired by South Korea’s Hanwha Group. While touring the facilities and the training ship State of Maine which is outfitting at the yard, Kelly highlighted the importance of strengthening the U.S. maritime industry through the bipartisanSHIPS for America Act. He said it aims to rebuild the U.S. shipyard base and expand efforts to recruit, train, and retain skilled mariners and shipyard workers."

        "content": "\nFollowing a union complaint about unfair Chinese competition in shipping and shipbuilding, the Trump administration's trade representative has proposed unprecedented access fees for Chinese-operated and Chinese-built ships - fees large enough to change the economics of container shipping in the U.S. market.\nChina's state-led shipbuilding sector dominates the global market for new tonnage, and China is the leading shipowning nation (by some metrics). Decades of preferential funding and government support have allowed Chinese shipyards to deliver useful tonnage at prices that other international competitors cannot match.\nThe USTR's action has been coming since at least last year. The White House's office of the  U.S. Trade Representative began looking at ways to deploy Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to counter China's shipping dominance strategy in 2024. The Act gives the president broad authority to take action against foreign nations that engage in unfair trade practices. It has been used extensively in the past to counter Chinese exporters' practice of selling goods below cost to gain market share.\n\"The U.S. Trade Representative determined that China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance is unreasonable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce, and thus is actionable,\" the USTR wrote in a Federal Register notice Friday.\nThe proposed fee structure is complex and steep, and the register notice contains several policy alternatives. All would be quite costly for the operator:\n- Each U.S. port call for any vessel operated by Chinese interests will be subject to a fee of either a) $1 million per ship for any size vessel, from tugboats up to VLCCs; or b) $1,000 per deadweight tonne - a far lower price.\n- Each U.S. port call for each vessel built in China, but operated by non-Chinese interests, will be subject to a fee of up to $1 million, depending on the proportion of Chinese-built ships in that operator's fleet.\n- Operators who have newbuilds on order in China will face additional fees of up to $1 million per port call.\n- If an operator owns a U.S.-built vessel, each port call of that vessel in the U.S. could generate a refund in an amount of up to $1 million per entry. Specifics for minimum vessel size, cargo volume, voyage distance or port call duration were not provided.\nThe proposal also includes an ambitious proposal to require that an increasing percentage of U.S. exports be carried on U.S.-flagged tonnage. The schedule would ramp up fast with a one-percent U.S.flagged quota effective immediately, followed by three percent by 2027, five percent by 2028, and 15 percent by 2032. A parallel quota requiring exports on U.S.-built vessels would take effect beginning in 2028, ramping up to an ambitious five percent by 2032.\nThe USTR did not specify whether the percentage of U.S. export cargo would be measured by tonnage or by dollar value.\n"

George Wikoff, commander of US Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), has brought to a close International Maritime Exercise (IMX) 2025, completing the ninth iteration of this international naval exercise since it was first was held in 2012. This year, the main centers of exercise activity were in Aqaba (Jordan) and Bahrain, with some practical phases at sea.\nThe exercise started with senior naval staff academic discussions and brainstorming covering the naval planning process, maritime operations center procedures, and disaster response coordination.\nThe exercise then moved on to a Command Post Exercise over a distributed network, involving both naval command headquarters but also civilian maritime coordination centers such as the Seychelles’ Regional Coordination Operations Centre and Oman’s Maritime Security Centre. Scenarios were played out covering the Red Sea, the Arabian Gulf, and the Gulf of Aden and Oman. The exercise was directed by Commodore Rashid Mahmood Sheikh from Pakistan, who in a press release reported that international participation had brought different perspectives on how to deal with similar incidents at sea.\n\n\nDivers leap from a Sea Dragon helicopter for floating mine response operations during International Maritime Exercise (IMX) 2025\n\nAn operational phase at sea or afloat focused on mine and countermeasures; visit, board, search and seizure procedures; unmanned systems and artificial intelligence integration; explosive ordnance disposal; vessel and harbor defense; search and rescue; and the coordination of responses to mass casualty events.\nNAVCENT reported that more than 5,000 personnel from more than 35 nations and international organizations had taken part in the different phases of the exercise. However, NAVCENT did not publish a list of participating countries, leaving your correspondent to identify participants from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Djibouti, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Yemen and the UK.

Teams reported that they were not surprised by finding oily water in the engine room and seawater in the cargo holds, but they have also confirmed that concerning deformations have been identified midship on the hull.\nWeather continued to present challenges with the teams on Friday, February 21, encountering winds that were still reaching over 60 mph in the cove where the ship was aground. Despite that, they were able to get aboard the ship on Thursday and again on Friday and also put an ROV into the water to survey the hull.\nThe survey showed that 75 percent of the hull is resting on the bottom which they viewed as good news. Also, the stern is aground with the bow remaining afloat. The heavier stern being aground is reducing some of the pressures on the hull. Bruce English of the Canadian Coast Guard told The Telegram newspaper on Friday that the ship is now firmly aground also reducing pressures. In the first days, he said they had observed the stern areas moving in the waves, but now he told the paper “Nothing is moving. The vessel is stable where it is right now.”\nEfforts are underway to sound the vessel’s tanks to determine the amount of fuel and lubricants aboard. The ship had been at sea since departing Montreal on February 5, before it went aground.

The offshore service vesselAvalon Sea, which had initially been brought in possibly to assist in towing the containership, however, has been released. English told the newspaper that nothing would be happening quickly and with the fuel and damage to the hull, there is no immediate plan to pull the vessel off the shore.\n\n\nThe heavier stern section is aground reducing some stress on the hull (Canadian Coast Guard)\n\nEnglish said the first step will likely be removing the fuel and other polluting materials loaded aboard theMSC Baltic III. Previously, they had said they would consider removing containers. The ship has approximately 470 containers aboard, but according to the Coast Guard, over half of which are empty.\nThe Coast Guard said while it understands the interest it is encouraging people to stay clear of the area. They also imposed a safety zone and a no-fly zone for drones around the vessel. English said after getting the 20 crew off the vessel safely, the concern now is not to endanger anyone else as they continue to explore salvage options.\n"

        "content": "\nFrance’s Michelin Group confirmed the recent awarding of its first commercial contract for its innovative inflatable wind sail for shipping. The first installation will be on a new patrol boat for France.\nThe new vessel will be built by the Socarenam shipyards with designed by French naval architecture firm. Mauric. The contract for the design and shipbuilding was awarded in December 2024 by the Directorate General for Maritime Affairs, Fisheries and Aquaculture (DGAMPA) which is responsible for maritime surveillance on the French Atlantic coast. The tender was launched in January 2024.\nWith a length of 54 meters (177 feet), the offshore patrol vessel is designed for extended 12-day missions. Capabilities for extended missions and energy efficiency were key to the design. The vessel will employ a diesel-electric hybrid system with wind-assisted propulsion. It is designed to provide the vessel with a maximum speed of 17 knots and a range exceeding 3,600 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 12 knots.\nMichelin was selected to provide the wind propulsion deploying its WISAMO (Wing Sail Mobility) project. The wingsail will have a surface area of 170 square meters (1,829 square feet). Michelin reports a fuel consumption reduction of approximately 15 percent is expected through optimizations of the design and the vessel’s operational profile.\nThe WISAMO concept consists of a telescopic, inflatable wingsail. It includes an intuitive, automated control system and a simplified interface that greatly reduces the challenges of vessel integration. The system is based on three key components, including a self-supporting telescopic mast that is fully retractable and a durable lightweight fabric envelope that is inflated at low pressure to form a symmetrical wingsail profile. A fully automated control system manages all sail functions (hoisting, lowering, adjusting, maneuvering, reefing, and protective stowage according to environmental conditions), eliminating the need for additional crew workload.\nMauric reports the vessel's design with a steel hull and an aluminum superstructure places paramount importance on seakeeping and crew comfort. It will carry a crew of 20 and the design integrates an anti-roll stabilization combining active fins and passive free surface tank, to ensure optimal operability in all sea states.\nConstruction will be carried out at Socarenam's shipyard in Boulogne-Sur-Mer, with delivery scheduled for the second half of 2027. When completed, it will replace the approximately 40-year-old patrol vesselIris. The new ship will be based in La Rochelle and operated along the Atlantic coast, particularly in the Bay of Biscay. Its mission is maritime surveillance and regulatory enforcement of fisheries, as well as navigation monitoring, maritime pollution control, environmental law enforcement, and search-and-rescue operations.\nMichelinefirst unveiledits wingsail concept in 2021 highlighting the opportunities to support maritime decarbonization. The sail concept received design approval from DNV and in 2023 the first trials were conducted in 2023 aboard the MN Pelican demonstrating the endurance of the system."

According to German outlets, someone appears to have tried to contaminate the drinking water system of the frigate Hessen.\nWDR, NDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung reported last week that an unknown perpetrator made an attempt to put a large quantity of waste oil into the Hessen's freshwater tanks. The frigate was moored at the German Navy's main base in Wilhelmshaven for repairs, and a contractor was hired to refill the vessel's tanks with clean water. The attempted contamination was prevented, and sources within the German Navy told media that they had ruled out the possibility of an accident.\nA police investigation is under way into the circumstances of the case, and Germany's Federal Office for Military Counterintelligence (BAMAD) has joined the effort.\nHessen is well-known from her time on patrol in the Red Sea last year, where she helped to defend merchant shipping from Houthi attacks. Beginning in February, Hessen took up station off Yemen as part of EU Operation Aspides, and was shooting down her first drones within days. During one of her earliest engagements, the crew misidentified an American drone as a Houthi munition and targeted it with two SM-2 missiles. Against the odds, both missed for \"technical reasons.\" The frigate returned to Germany in early May, having spent three months on deployment.\nThe apparent attempt to sabotage Hessen is the latest in a string of incidents affecting German warships in port. In 2024, a German Navy minehunter was damaged by unknown personnel while in shipyard in Rostock. Several cable harnesses were severed, according to Spiegel. In addition, an unknown saboteur dumped dozens of kilos of metal filings into the oil sumps of the main engines aboard the brand new corvette Emden, according to multiple German media outlets. The contamination was detected and cleaned out, and Emden has been successfully delivered."

Roger Marshall (R-KY) blasted her appointment as an example of diversity hiring, suggesting that her four decades in the Navy and her career in command of surface warfare units, carrier strike groups and fleet-level commands were not sufficient to make her a competitive candidate.\n\"President Biden nominated Adm. Franchetti not because she is qualified or competent to do the job but because of this administration’s obsession with diversity and inclusion,\" Sen. Marshall said at the time. \"[Former President Joe Biden] even disregarded the recommendation of his own Secretary of Defense for this position.\"\nThe Trump administration's pick for the next Secretary of the Navy, financier and art collectorJohn Phelan, has no prior experience in any defense field, whether in uniform, in government or in a defense contracting role. He was a prominent donor and fundraiser for the president's successful 2024 election campaign.\nUnexpected spending changes\nLast week, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued plans to cut existing military programs by eight percent ($50 billion) and redirect the funding to other White House priorities. These new areas of focus include border security measures and a new \"Iron Dome for America\" missile defense system, inspired by Israel's achievements in reducing the threat of midrange ballistic missile and drone strikes.\nDeputy Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses said Wednesday that programs targeted would begin with initiatives related to diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change. The savings \"could be used to fund [the president's] priorities, as well as to refocus the Department on its core mission of deterring and winning wars,\" he told media.\nIn a memo, Hegseth that 17 programs would be exempt from the cuts. The list protects the Virginia-class attack submarine program, but not the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, the Navy's costliest and most challenging acquisition program. The memo does protect modernization of nuclear weapons, which the Columbia-class will carry.\nThe Navy's chronically-underfunded shipbuilding program is protected for \"executable\" warship contracts only; the futures of long-term initiatives, like the DDG(X) next-generation destroyer or the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV) are less certain.\n\"The Secretary of Defense is injecting a colossal amount of confusion and churn and uncertainty into the budgeting process,\" Bryan McGrath, a defense and national security consultant and retired Navy commander, told Business Insider in an interview on Thursday.\nThe administration is also moving to fire thousands of probationary employees in the defense department. The contours of the dismissals are not yet known; the military has more than 900,000 civilian employees in the U.S. and around the world.\n\"It is not in the public interest to retain individuals whose contributions are not mission-critical,\" John Ullyot, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement last week."

        "content": "\nA unique project to design a large, high-speed next-generation ferry is coming to fruition with news that Sweden’s Gotlandsbolaget has ordered construction of the ferry developed working with Austal. The goal was to develop a vessel for climate-neutral trips and sustainable solutions that would be a pioneer in new technologies.\nAustal and Gotlandsbolagetannounced plansfor the development of the 130-meter (426-foot) multi-fuel high-speed vehicle passenger ferry design, with the flexibility to be able to operate on a variety of fuel types including hydrogen, in April 2023. Since then, Austal and Gotland Tech Development report they have engaged with technology providers from around the world to select preferred main equipment, and to define system arrangements. This has included the development of a unique propulsion system arrangement that repurposes engine exhaust to contribute to vessel propulsion and reduce emissions. In October 2024, the project gained approval in principle from DNV.\n\"Horizon X is an incredibly exciting project that is going to redefine commercial ferry capabilities, with a multi-fuel and hydrogen-capable combined cycle power plant and a class-leading, efficient hull design,” said Austal Chief Executive Officer Paddy Gregg.\n\n\n\nAccording to Austal, the design will feature a unique, highly efficient combined cycle propulsion system that includes both gas and steam turbines, a first for a high-speed craft. The gas turbines will be used in the drive train of Horizon X and they are designed to be powered by several types of alternative fuels, fossil-free. It will be a multi-fuel vessel and the design is prepared to convert to hydrogen when hydrogen production becomes commercially available.\nThe companies highlighted the multi-fuel capabilities will best prepare the vessel while there are still great uncertainties regarding which alternative fuels will be available to the maritime sector. To minimize energy requirements and achieve high efficiency, the companies highlight that a great deal of work has been done to develop energy-efficient hulls, minimize weight, optimize energy consumption on board, and streamline operations and flows throughout the ship.\n\"Shipping must change, and reducing the climate footprint of travel and transport to and from Gotland is of great importance for the island's development and attractiveness,” said Håkan Johansson, CEO of Gotlandsbolaget. “The construction of Horizon X is a crucial step in our journey towards climate-neutral crossings. At the same time, the ship will offer the same efficient crossing times as today, and a new and modern onboard experience.”\nThe ferry is designed to carry up to 1,500 passengers and 400 passenger cars at speeds up to 29 knots. It will be able to make the crossing between the Swedish mainland and Gotland in just over three hours. Plans call for it to operate during the peak summer travel season as well as in the spring and fall.\nAustal is valuing the construction contract at between A$265 and A$275 million (US$168 and US$175 million). The vessel will be built at the Austal Philippines shipyard with work commencing in 2026. The hull will be built in aluminum and where possible for the construction, green aluminum will be chosen, which means that approximately 60 percent of all aluminum on board is manufactured with renewable energy.\nAfter delivery in mid-2028, the ship will sail to Gotland. The company says the exact timing for its entry into service is yet to be determined, but that it will be on the route by the spring of 2029."

        "content": "The offshore wind energy sector has remained in flux since the inauguration of Donald Trump and his new administration which has paused the efforts of the Biden administration and seems poised to abandon future projects. This week, BP Renewables became the latest to stall one of its projects in the U.S. pipeline while others continue to show signs of retrenching and shifting to a longer-term focus.\nBP in a filing with the New York Public Service Commission withdrew its application for the transmission system associated with its Beacon Wind project which would provide a total of 2.4 GW in a two-phase development. The company had previously asked the PSC to delay consideration of its application for up to one year.\nThe first phase of Beacon Wind already has its power offtake agreement in place with New York State. They were expected to participate in a future solicitation for the second phase.\nThe company in a statement said the move is to provide it more time based on changes in the market and “a challenging regulatory environment.”  BP is reportedly planning to evaluate the project’s design and configuration. In addition to the changes in the federal government's stance on the sector, it is being noted that New York State has been considering its future approach, specifically how the projects are connected to the power grid.\nBeacon Wind was to bring its cables ashore and connect to a repurposed power station in Astoria, New York in Queens County. But observers noted that New York State said for its sixth-round solicitation scheduled for the first quarter of 2026, it would consider “generation-only projects.”\nBP took full ownership of Beacon Wind as part of its agreement with Equinor in 2024 to end its joint venture with each company pursuing one of the projects. Equinor took ownership of Empire Wind. The plan for Beacon Wind has gained its final environmental assessment from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and was believed close to the approval of its Construction & Operation Plan (COP) but it was not completed by the Biden administration.\nAt the same time, French giant EDF reported financial results today, February 21, with over $120 billion in revenues and $18 billion in income. However, detailing its results the company revealed a nearly $1 billion impairment charge ($944.4 million) related to the Atlantic Shores wind project in New Jersey. Reuters is quoting CEO Luc Remont as saying it is “in order to reflect the new American political landscape.”\nAtlantic Shore Projects 1 and 2 represent 2.8 GW which would be provided to New Jersey. The project received BOEM approval of its COP in October 2024, but it has yet to conclude agreements with the state. It was bid into the fourth-round solicitation, but New Jersey ended it without selecting a project. In January 2025, joint venture partner Shell announced it was withdrawing from the project as part of its efforts to reduce its focus on renewable energy. EDF has said it is still committed to the project but decided to depreciate the developments carried out for the project.\nA third development company, Vineyard Offshore, which is a U.S.-based affiliate of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is also reported to be laying off and eliminating a total of 50 jobs. The company emphasized to local reporters it was not at the project level.\nIt is in partnership with Avangrid for Vineyard Wind 1 which is under construction but delayed due to the failure of blades and the need to test and replace the turbine blades. The company independently was also pursuing Vineyard Wind 2, but in December withdrew from negotiations for its power offtake agreement with Massachusetts. The plan calls for splitting the generation with Connecticut, but that state decided not to proceed with wind power at this time. The company said it could not financially justify the project without the second power agreement and it would have to reconsider the plan. Vineyard Offshore also has the lease for Excelsior Wind which is an early-stage project that would provide power to New York State and has an early-stage development with the lease for a project in Humboldt County off the northern coast of California."

        "content": "\nLandlocked Hungary’s quest for access to the sea is nearing completion with the launch of construction of a new seaport in Trieste, Italy, 140 miles and two nations away from Hungary's border. Hungarian Deputy Foreign Minister Levente Magyar attended the groundbreaking ceremony last week in the company of the Italian Deputy Minister for Infrastructure, Edoardo Rixi.\nHungary announced the port project back in 2019 after the purchase of an 80-acre seafront site in Trieste. At the time, the transaction was valued at $32 million under a 60-year concession contract. The first phase of the port includes building a 250-meter quay wall, to be later expanded by about 400 meters, giving Hungary a total of 650 meters of coastline on the Adriatic Sea.\nAdria Port Zrt., a Hungarian state-owned company, is entrusted with developing the Trieste Port project. The $209 million facility is expected to be operational by 2028. It will have capacity for 78,000 TEU of cargo a year. A logistics center is also planned at the site to streamline the movement of goods. Trieste is a strategic location for a Hungarian seaport, given its proximity and reliable rail and road connection to Hungary.\n“Hungary exports cargo worth around $155 billion every year, with majority of them leaving Europe by sea. If the country does not have its own sea exit and seaport capacity, it will always be at the mercy of others. We would like to change this situation, because Hungary, as the 34th largest exporter in the world, must have channels to connect to global supply chains,” said Levente Magyar.\nHungary lost its sea access in 1920 after conceding defeat in the World War I. This led to the signing of the Trianon Treaty, which saw Hungary lose two-thirds of its former territory, including a vast coastline.\nIn the recent past, Hungary has intensified cooperation with its coastal neighbors for maritime access. Last month, Hungarian Minister for National Economy Márton Nagy met Bulgarian President Rumen Radev for economic talks. This saw the signing of cooperation agreements in the transport sector. The partnership will lead to the creation of a simplified logistics and transport corridor linking Hungarian businesses with Bulgarian ports and free zones in the Black Sea. The Hungarian government has said that Bulgaria is a critical partner for its energy security, providing a transit route for Russian, Turkish and Azerbaijani natural gas supplies by pipeline."

        "content": "\nThe planned investment by AD Ports Group in Turkey’s Alsancak Port in Izmir has fallen apart after failed negotiations. The Turkish government this week confirmed that it has ended talks with the UAE company over the operation of the port.\nThe negotiations have been ongoing for almost two years. AD Ports was expected to buy a stake in the port in the western province of Izmir. The port has been operational since 1959, and according to the Invest in Izmir initiative, the port is today the country’s seventh largest in terms of container volume and thirteenth in terms of cargo tonnage.\n“We have pursued long negotiations with the investor from the Gulf, but no agreement has been achieved,” Turkish Transportation Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu told Bloomberg. “The aim was to get a partner to expand Alsancak port.” No further update was given on why the negotiations collapsed.\nThis becomes the second attempt to privatize Alsancak Port without success. In 2007, a group of investors including Hutchison Port Holdings submitted a $1.28 billion bid for the port. The deal was later blocked by a court leading the investors to withdraw.\nSince 2017, Alsancak has been owned by Turkey’s sovereign wealth fund TWF. It is currently operated by the national railway company TCDD.\nFaced with capacity challenges, the port has recorded a drop in cargo traffic. In container handling, the drop has come from a high of 390,300 TEUs in 2022 to 261,900 last year.\nThe negotiations were part of a wider effort by the government to attract additional foreign investment. Turkey opened its market to UAE investments, looking to raise capital for its critical sectors. In 2023, Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan inked deals worth $51 billion during a state visit to the UAE. The deals touched sectors such as energy, natural resources development, and defense. Trade relations between Turkey and UAE continue to develop, exceeding $50 billion in 2024, an increase of 11 percent year on year, according to data by the Turkish-Arab Economic Forum.\nAD Ports' entry would have added to the massive investment by the DP World in the Turkish port sector. One of the largest container ports, Yarimca Terminal (Port of Izmit), on the Sea of Marmara east of Istanbul, is controlled by DP World. The terminal has an annual capacity of 1.15 million TEUs. Last year, the operator expanded into the neighboring Evyapport terminal in Izmit, through a merger with Evyap Group.\nAlsancak offers a strategic advantage in its position. It does not require a transit of the Dardanelles. It is seen as a port with potential because of its location and easy access to the Mediterranean.\n"

        "content": "\nA team of Spanish scientists have revealed alarming evidence of methane leaks in Antarctica. The researchers are exploring the vast quantities of methane stored in the Antarctic seabed. The study, carried on board the Spanish research vesselSarmiento de Gamboa, focused on the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula. These Antarctic edges are one of the most rapidly warming parts of the planet.\n“We have estimated that in this area there are some 24 gigatons of carbon accumulated in methane hydrates, an amount equivalent to what all humanity emits in two years,” said geologist Rogers Urgeles, who together with Ricardo León led the expedition.\nFor decades now, polar scientists have been studying methane hydrates - a mixture of water and methane gas trapped under high pressure - in the frozen continents. The methane hydrates are as a result of decomposition of organic matter buried for over 20,000 years beneath the polar seas; most of this research has focused on the Arctic.\nThe first active leak of methane from the Antarctic sea floor was confirmed by researchers in 2020. While additional data is needed to understand the methane seepage, there have been reports showing global warming could be a factor. However, the first leak was confirmed near the Ross Sea, a region which is yet to significantly warm. But tracking of these methane leaks is critical for climate models, which currently do not account for it. Methane in the atmosphere is considered roughly 20 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas.\nThe new study by the Spanish scientists further confirms the presence of huge methane hydrate reserves in the Antarctic Peninsula. Ongoing geological and climate-driven processes have made the reserves destabilize, causing seepage of methane. León and Urgeles reported observing columns of methane in the ocean up to 700 meters long and 70 meters wide. The gas could be bubbling up from the subsoil, often through mud volcanoes hundreds of meters above the seabed, the scientists told the Spanish Newspaper El Pais. The observed methane columns dissolve at about 150 meters from the ocean surface. The researchers recommend long-term monitoring to track methane release trends in the Antarctic, as well as the amount that escapes into the atmosphere."

The EUNAVFOR operation Atalanta that monitors security in the region however is warning after two events in recent weeks that “similar organized piracy incidents might take place again in the area.”\nThis latest incident was reported to the authorities on February 17. It was believed that armed pirates boarded the Yemeni dhowSaytuun-2.  It was hijacked off Garmaal, on the northern coast of Puntland, a semi-autonomous region within Somalia. Atlanta classified it as an armed robbery because the vessel was staying within coastal waters.\nThe vessel was being monitored while the EUNAVFOR was also coordinating with its security partners, including the Yemeni Coast Guard and the Puntland Maritime Police Force as well as the international Combined Maritime Forces. They reported that there were five crewmembers aboard and the vessel was traveling to the south after it was hijacked. They believed there were six pirates aboard.\nThe pirates fled the vessel on February 22. Teams from one of the warships involved in the international security effort contacted the fishing vessel yesterday, February 23 in what Atlanta termed a “friendly approach.” They gathered information from the crew that confirmed that armed pirates with ladders had taken control of the vessel. The crew was uninjured but said the pirates had taken some of their belongings before leaving the dhow.\nEarlier in February there was a similar incident involving another Yemeni-flagged dhow,Al Najma. The vessel with a crew of 12 aboard was boarded on February 9 near Ely, Somalia also in the Puntland region. The EU naval forces began a search to locate the vessel and were tracking the vessel when the pirates also abandoned the hijacked dhow. It was released on February 13 and again forces participating with Atalanta visited the vessel to confirm the safety of the crew.\n“These recent events within Somali territorial waters demonstrate an active and evolving threat in the region,” Atlanta warned in its weekly report. “Despite routine patrols performed by CMF, EUNAVFOR Atalanta, and other warships in these waters, pirates continue to demonstrate sophisticated operational capabilities.” Atalanta also warns of a “well-established coastal support infrastructure.” Atalanta concluded that the prates maintain the capabilities and intent to target vessels in the region.\nThis comes 17 years after the security operation was first created. Atalanta began its patrols in 2009 and reports its efforts have led to the conviction of 145 pirates. They have documented 139 vessels that have been held in the region but noted that there are also an unknown number of unreported/unconfirmed dhows and smaller vessels that have been seized.\nLast year, Atlanta reported a spike in activity in the first quarter which continued till May 2024. After that, there were a few suspicious approaches before a Chinese fishing vessel was seized in December and held until the end of the year. The two incidents with the Yemeni-flagged dhows occurred this month raising the new concerns about continued dangers in the region."

The deal valued at nearly $4.7 billion would combine the companies to create a global presence with a fleet of more than 60 construction vessels and 45,000 employees.\nThe companies highlighted that they have highly complementary geographical footprints, competencies and capabilities, vessel fleets, and technologies that will benefit the global client base. They believe a combination would also unlock annual synergies of approximately €300 million to be achieved in the third year after completion, with one-off costs to achieve such synergies of approximately €270 million. The combined company would have a current backlog of €43 billion and annual revenues of nearly €20 billion.\nExplaining the rationale for the combination, the companies told investors it would create a more comprehensive solution for customers, expand the expertise and experience base, and create a global and diversified operation. It would also lay the foundation for future innovation in the industry. The management of both Saipem and Subsea7 said they share the conviction that there is compelling logic in creating a global leader in energy services, particularly considering the growing size of clients’ projects.\nWhile recognizing the potential, analysts were quick to question the logistics of completing such a combination. They cited a difficult regulatory approval in part reflected by the companies’ projection that it would be mid-2026 before the deal could be completed.\nThe companies reported they have completed a memorandum of understanding for the combination which calls for a merger of equals. Each company would own 50 percent of the combined entity with the new company being known as Saipem 7. Current plans call for Alessandro Puliti, CEO of Saipem, to be appointed as CEO of the combined company while John Evans, CEO of Subsea 7, would be the CEO of the offshore business which will comprise all Subsea7 and Saipem’s Offshore Engineering & Construction activities.\nThe companies’ large shareholders are expressing their support for the combination. Siem Industries, the largest shareholder of Subsea7, would own approximately 12 percent of the new company, while Eni and CDP Equity, the largest shareholders of Saipem, would own approximately 10.6 percent and approximately 6.4 percent of the new company.\nThe companies independently developed as leaders in the offshore services industry tracing their origins to the 1950s and the start of modern offshore operations. Each has been involved in the consolidation and growth of the industry. The modern Subsea 7 emerged in the early 200s and reports it is the product of over 25 different legacy companies and businesses with Kristian Siem continuing to drive the company as its chairman. Saipem was also the product of mergers and served as the service supplier for Eni until 2015 when it reduced its holding setting the stage for the modern company.\nThe timeline for the deal calls for completing the merger agreement by mid-year. They will require extensive antitrust approvals and shareholder approval from each company."

The report indicated that an assessment team would conduct a full survey of damaged areas and develop a repair plan to be executed immediately.\nThe Navy quickly assembled an emergency team that included engineers, naval architects, and other personnel from the Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center and Norfolk Naval Shipyard. In an “all-hands” effort, the sailors worked together with a local industry partner, Theodoropoulos Group, to assess the damage, develop the plan, and complete repairs to restore weathertight integrity to the carrier.\nThe initial damage assessment reported the exterior wall of two storage rooms and a maintenance space had sustained breaches as well as external damage including a line handling space, the fantail, and the platform above one of the storage spaces. The aircraft elevator however was not damaged and remained fully operational.\nThe work was completed in just five days with the carrier group underway on February 23. A Navy spokesperson told Stars & Stripes the repairs included removing damaged pieces of metal and installing weatherproofing bulkheads.\n“Our ship remains operationally ready to complete deployment with mission and purpose on full display by the entire crew,” said Capt. Chris Hill, commanding officer of Harry S. Truman. “We are out here launching and recovering aircraft.”\nHill took over command of the carrier as interim commanding officer the Navy reported on February 20. Hill transferred from the USSDwight D. Eisenhowerwhich is currently undergoing scheduled maintenance at Norfolk Naval Shipyard after completing its nine-month deployment in July 2024. The captain had led the first phase of the U.S. mission in the Red Sea region to combat the Houthis after they started attacking merchant ships. Hill replaced Capt. Dave Snowden, commanding officer of USSHarry S. Trumanwho was relieved due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command after the collision.\nThe Navy emphasized that there was no impact onHarry S. Truman’s mission or schedule due to emergency repairs. Since deploying, they report the carrier's eight embarked aviation squadrons have flown over 5,500 stories. This includes two strikes into Houthi-controlled Yemen and a strike on ISIS-Somalia. The Houthis had been aggressively targeting the Truman in January before suspending their strikes after the Gaza ceasefire.\nTheHarry S. Trumanis deployed with the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USSGettysburg. The strike group also consists of three Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers, USSStout, USSThe Sullivans, and USSJason Dunham. The group deployed on September 23, first traveling to Northern Europe and then into the Mediterranean and Red Sea."

        "content": "\nAt least two recent explosions affecting tankers in the Mediterranean this year can be explained by limpet mine attacks, three security sources told Reuters this week.\nFive tankers have been damaged in suspicious incidents over the last two months, and all vessels were linked to a recent history of Russian port calls.\nOvernight on February 14, a blast damaged the Greek-ownedSeajeweloff Savona. Reports indicate that divers found a two-foot by four-foot hole with plates driven inward, indicating external forces were at work. Dead fish found near the blast site further suggested an explosion.\nOther recently-damaged tankers with Russian trading ties include theGrace Ferrum, Koala,andSeacharm.The Russian military cargo shipUrsa Majoralso went down in December near the Strait of Gibraltar after a series of engine room explosions, and the Russian operator claimed that it had been sabotaged.\nWithout specifying which particular incidents, three sources confirmed to Reuters that at least two blasts were likely caused by limpet mine attacks. One source said that the munitions used were Soviet BPM-type limpet mines, a time-delayed shaped charge with a magnetic casing that can be hand-placed by divers. The time-delay fuse can be set for durations as long as a month, according to open-source data, allowing the vessel to transit far from the point of placement before detonation.\nThe BPM has a small main charge of just seven pounds of tritonal, but placed directly on a ship's hull it is enough to be effective. When activated, it has an anti-removal plunger that detonates the mine if another diver tries to pull it off.\nLike all Soviet munitions, BPM mines were exported to third countries linked to Russian expansionism. The design has changed little over decades, they remain in production, and they continue to crop up in modern conflict zones - making attribution difficult."

        "content": "\nOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that the tariffs he has threatened to impose on all goods from Mexico and Canada will go into effect once a one-month negotiated pause expires.\n\"The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,\" he told reporters in a press conference with French President Emanuel Macron at the White House. \"We've been mistreated very badly by many countries, and that includes Canada and Mexico. . . . All we want is reciprocal, we want reciprocity. We want the same, so if somebody charges us, we charge them.\"\nEarly this month, Trump threatened to revise the tariff rates on Mexico and Canada upwards to 25 percent (except for Canadian energy, which would be subject to a 10 percent levy). After securing border-related concessions from both nations, Trump agreed to pause the tariff hike for a month for negotiations. If the tariffs do go into effect as he forecast, they will begin to affect cross-border trade on March 4.\nCanada is preparing to retaliate with its own tariffs on a list of $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. \"The threat of tariffs is a real one and may continue for a while. We need to be able to deal with the unpredictability of President Trump,\" said Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, speaking to reporters in London on Monday.\nIf fully implemented, an across-the-board tariff schedule of 25 percent for Canadian and Mexican goods would have significant economic effects. Economists predict that Mexico and Canada would likely enter a recession; U.S. GDP would be reduced by about 0.5 percent compared with business as usual; and inflation would increase in all three countries. Mexico, as the largest exporter of goods to the United States - larger than Canada or China - would be especially hard-hit."

A Thai consortium entered into a similar port development MOU with Myanmar's previous government, but the deal fell apart in 2021.\nThe zone would be 50,000 acres in size, providing room for industrial development. Reshetnikov told Russian media that \"oil refining is still the most complex element,\" and that this might not be actualized. \"There is a desire of the Myanmar side to have a refinery. Our companies are still studying the economics of such a project, it is very complicated from the point of view of economic feasibility,\" he said.\nThe project's success will require the junta to retain control of Myanmar, with assistance from Russian and Chinese arms suppliers. Since seizing power and overthrowing the elected government in 2021, Myanmar's military forces have been steadily losing ground to a loose coalition of rebels. According to the BBC, the junta had full control of just 20 percent of the country as of November, and rebel groups have been slowly advancing on several fronts."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "A decade after the European Union first adopted its ship recycling regulation to address concerns over environmental issues, it issued a new evaluation of the regulations highlighting shortcomings. Overall, it concludes the regulation is effective, but finds shipowners continue to “flag hop” incentivized by additional revenue from selling end-of-life ships.\nThe commission evaluated the framework ahead of the June 2025 entry into force of the Hong Kong Convention ratified by UN members in 2024 to provide a global framework for recycling and the treatment of environmental concerns. The EU was also reviewing the list of companies authorized under the regulation and released an update.\nWhile saying it believes the regulation has “largely achieved its objectives,” the report however warns that its “effectiveness has been significantly undermined through the practice of shipowners charging ship’s flag shortly before being recycled.” It also points to a continuing absence of hazardous materials inventories on ships in service which it says results in the quantities of inventories often being insufficient at the recycling stage.\nShipowners they concluded are still incentivized by additional revenue to send their vessels to South Asian yards despite none of the yards being recognized by the EU. Ships are transferred from the flags of EU member states to a non-EU flag shortly before being recycled. Middlemen often buy the vessels without disclosing intent and send them to Asia or sometimes briefly lay the ship up in an intermediary country before delivering it to the scrapyards.\nThere have been several high-profile cases but, in most instances, owners elude punishment while scrapping ships in Asia. In June 2024, Norwegian regulatorsimposedan approximately $750,000 fine for illegally exporting two ships to India for scrapping despite claims by then-owner Teekay that it sent the ship for further trading. As part of the evaluation, the EU reports it will focus on preventing circumvention efforts by clarifying standards and ensuring penalties for infringements.\nThe updated list for 2025 from the EU removes yards in Latvia, Lithuania, and Turkey from the recognized group. The list currently has 31 yards in Europe, 11 in Turkey, and one in the United States. Ships registered in an EU member state are required to use one of these yards for ship recycling. The EU emphasized the importance of the regulations saying European shipowners have 30 percent of the world’s tonnage.\nThe EU highlights the Hong Kong Convention sets out international ship recycling standards that are less stringent than the current EU Ship Recycling Regulation. It is assessing how the convention will be implemented and possibly improved towards stricter global standards. The EU reports its model has become a benchmark both within and outside the EU. It will look to further enhance the standards to ensure that environmental risks are reduced during the handling of end-of-life vessels."

        "content": "\nThe Vietnamese-owned bulkerDebihas finally been released by the courts in India after being held for 15 months. The vessel was first detained after cocaine was found hidden aboard the ship while it was in transit which later resulted in a dispute over port fees.\nIndia’s High Court in Orissa signed off on the release of the vessel (37,000 dwt and built in 2012) which is registered in Panama. The owners owed nearly $1 million in port fees to Orissa for the time the vessel was detained. For part of the time, it was in the anchorage and the remainder on berth. The crew had gone on strike last November when the ship moved to the dock to resupply a year after the ship was detained. The crew had refused to do any additional work until they were released.\nThe owners of the vessel and the Paradip International Cargo Terminal are reported to have reached an out-of-court settlement, the details of which were not released. The admiralty judge after reviewing the settlement agreed that there was no reason for the case to continue and said the ship was released. TheDebihowever as of today shows it remains at the port according to its AIS signal.\nThe vessel was traveling from Asia to Denmark to transport a cargo of steel plate when it made the port stop in Paradip, India. A dockworker noticed suspicious packages attached to the underside of one of the deck cranes and reported it to the authorities. The packages were found to contain 22 kg of cocaine which was seized on November 30, 2023. The street value of the cocaine was reported at over $25 million.\nIndian authorities searched the vessel and ordered the crew to bedetainedwhile they investigated the smuggling. The crew’s personal electronics were seized, but they remained in limbo. One crewmemberjumped overboardin a possible suicide attempt after a dispute on the ship which was blamed on the crew’s long detention. A junior engineer he was rescued and taken to a hospital while the remainder of the crew continued to wait. Finally, in December 2024, the court ordered the crew could begin to leave and 11 went home on December 23 while nine replacements took their positions. The others were expected to leave once their replacements arrived. The reports said of the 21 crewmembers, 17 were from Vietnam.\nThe port fees continued to accumulate while the vessel was detained in the port. The ship was officially arrested in February 2024 and in August the court had ordered it sold. The court last week ordered a refund of more than $27,000 in court fees to the terminal operator.\nInternational associations have increasingly highlighted cases such as theDebiwhere vessels and their crews are being routinely detained for smuggling charges or other infractions. Crewmembers have also been convicted on charges related to the discovery of narcotics aboard their ships without ever being directly linked to the smuggling operation. Unions are calling for fairer treatment and expedited processing of crews in these cases.\nIn the case of theDebi, the authorities repeatedly said they were investigating but no charges were ever filed against the crew. The cocaine was concealed out of sight and it was unclear if the crew was aware or if the ship was simply a courier in the case with the crew unaware that the drugs had been stashed aboard."

The fire is believed to have been extinguished and contained to a small section of the RoRo sector of the vessel and the crew escaped uninjured.\nThe authorities granted permission for salvage tugs to bring the ship to port during daylight hours. Four tugs from Dutch company Multraship, numbers 32, 33, 35, and 36, moved the dead ship into Antwerp where it was tied up at the Euroterminal. Boskalis’ Smit unit was hired to oversee the salvage of the vessel.\nImages online showed scorching from the fire on the vessel’s superstructure near the funnel. Blistering is visible on two or more decks but contained within an area of the ship. Grimaldi initially reported one fire on February 17 which its crew attempted to extinguish with the CO2 system. Lifeboats from the UK’s RNLI attended the vessel but were released only to be recalled later the same day when a second fire was discovered aboard the vessel. The Grimaldi crew abandoned ship into its lifeboat and were rescued by one of the tugs and transferred to the Ramsgate Lifeboat to be taken to shore.\n\n\n\nGrimaldi told the European press there were indications of what had caused the fire but would not speculate until the investigation was completed. The vessel frequently transports used cars and containers and was bound for West Africa.\nTwo of the Multraship tugs reached the vessel on February 18 and working with Boskalis’ tugKamarawere conducting cooling operations. The French rescue vesselAbeille Normandiewas also standing by monitoring the operation.\nSalvage crews were expected to board the vessel now that it has returned to port to ensure the fire has been extinguished. Then inspectors will begin searching for the origins.\nToday, February 24, there are unconfirmed reports of yet another fire on a different Grimaldi vessel. Lloyd’s is reporting that fire occurred on theGrande Congo(47,600 dwt) as the vessel was transiting to Norfolk, Virginia. This Conro is now docked in Norfolk having arrived from Spain.\nThe company has experienced several vessel fires in the past few years. In 2019, it had fires on two vessels that led to changes in the rules for handling hazardous cargo. Then in 2023, another of the company’s vessels in New Jersey when a fire started as cars were being loaded. Two local firefighters were killed after boarding the vessel. It burned for days damaging the RoRo section of the vessel.\nGrimaldi has indicated it will be fully cooperating with the authorities in the investigation into the fire on theGrande Brasile."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAs the IMO closes in on global regulations for shipping's carbon emissions, professional shipmanagement firms are concerned that the language could have unintended effects on third-party managers.\nAccording to industry organization InterManager, the current proposed text that will be reviewed at MEPC83 improperly accounts for the role of shipmanagement firms. About 20 percent of all merchant ships have a third-party ISM manager - not the owner, nor the commercial manager, but purely a technical manager. Since a third-party manager has no say in the commercial operations of the ship, nor in its construction or bunker fuel selection, it should not be held legally responsible for the ship's emissions, according to InterManager.\n\"In comparison to the charterer and shipowner, the ship manager has no material influence over the GHG intensity of a ship. Ship managers have no say regarding the type of engine powering the managed ship, nor whether sails, solar, fuel cells or other installations are installed on board. Such choices are decided exclusively by the shipowner,\" the association said in a statement.\nInterManager's proposed text would state that the entity responsible for compliance would be \"the registered owner of the ship.\" This would put the financial burden on the shipowner, not the manager; the shipmanager would still be tasked with collecting emissions data and reporting it properly, in accordance with regulations.\n\"We ship managers are fully committed to playing our part in shipping’s journey to net zero. However, when it comes to the GHG intensity of a ship, ship managers have no say whatsoever in any of the decisions that result in material impact; they are not even consulted. In shore terms, we are the facility managers, not the factory owners,\" said InterManager President Sebastian von Hardenberg. \"In taking our points into consideration, the IMO can develop a more practical and equitable framework.\"\nThe association's objections mirror a long debate around who should be responsible for compliance with the EU's greenhouse gas rules for shipping. The newly-imposed FuelEU Maritime regulation placescompliance responsibilityupon the ship's technical manager; if the technical manager is a third party, it must work out contractual arrangements with the shipowner and charterer to protect its financial interests.\nBy contrast, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme putsresponsibilityon the registered shipowner by default. If the ship is chartered out or managed by a third party, the shipowner must work out contractual arrangements for compliance costs with the charterer or technical manager."

Both programs emphasized they continue to aim at undermining Russia’s sources of income and those support the war effort while the UK also said it was designed to strengthen Ukraine’s position.\n“Lasting peace will only be achieved through strength. That is why we are focused on putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position,” said UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. “Every military supply line disrupted, every rouble blocked, and every enabler of Putin’s aggression exposed is a step towards a just and lasting peace.”\nThe UK is calling today’s announcement the largest sanctions package against Russia since 2022. A total of 107 sanctions were announced targeting military supply chains, revenues, and the enables supporting Russia’s efforts. It noted for the first time the sanctions are targeting foreign financial institutions supporting the war effort including sanctions against the Kyrgyzstan-based IJSC Keremet Bank and the inclusion of the North Korean Defense Minister and other North Korean generals.\nToday’s sanctions include another 40 shadow fleet ships carrying Russian oil. According to the UK, these vessels have collectively carried more than $5 billion worth of Russian oil and oil products in the last six months. The specifications bring the total number of oil tankers sanctioned by the UK to 133, which the UK calls the highest of any nation in Europe.\nOther inclusions in the new sanction package included producers and suppliers of machine tools, electronics, and dual-use goods for the Russian military, including microprocessors and goods coming from countries including states in Asia, Turkey, Thailand, India, and China. It includes companies that procure arms, deliver military-industrial goods, and individuals inside and out of the Russian government.\nThe European Council also reported the adoption of its 16th Russia sanctions package. Like the UK they are targeting energy, trade, transport, infrastructure, and financial services and also went beyond Russia with sanctions for Belarus, the regimes in Crimea and Sevastopol, and those controlling the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n“This new round of sanctions not only targets the Russian shadow fleet but those who support the operation of unsafe oil tankers, videogame controllers used to pilot drones, banks used to circumvent our sanctions, and propaganda outlets used to spout lies,” said Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission.\nThe EU package targets 74 additional vessels, with the EU highlighting its total number of listed vessels at 153. As part of the effort, the EU is also adding a new listing criterion, targeting those who support the operations of unsafe oil tankers. This includes targeting terminals and operations in the ports of Ust-Luga, Primorsk, and Novorossiysk.\nThis sanction package also includes export restrictions on 53 companies and 34 companies in countries other than Russia. The EU added elements to prevent circumvention of the sanctions and to stop disinformation it is also suspending the broadcasting activities of eight media which it believes are supporting and justifying Russia’s war.\nIn addition to demonstrating Europe’s support for Ukraine, today’s actions were also believed to be a sign to Donald Trump who has not included Europe as he pushes for peace with Russia. Yesterday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron reported they spoke by phone to demonstrate their commitment to Ukraine. Macron met with Donald Trump today, February 24, in Washington D.C. Starmer is also scheduled to meet with Trump on Thursday, February 27. European leaders are warning against appearing “weak” and not unified when speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTrump has discussed the sanctions while Russia highlighted that it wants the sanctions ended as part of any peace talks. The Biden Administration was aggressive in its efforts to sanction Russia, including designating 183 tankers in January 2025. Included in the latest effort was a broad effort including crude oil and product tankers and gas carriers associated with Sovcomflot as well as the shadow fleet."

The vessel which is believed to have Chinese ownership but is flying the flag of Togo was directed into port where it was boarded for investigation.\nTaiwan had reported in January that it was increasing itsoffshore surveillance and patrolsin response to a perceived threat from Communist China. The island nation experienced a cable outage in January 2025 which it said might have been caused by another ship related to China and in 2023 lost communications links to one of its small offshore islands after another cable was severed. The Navy started a new tracking system to identify suspicious vessels focusing they reported on ships flying a flag of convenience.\nThe Coast Guard had been deployed to investigate the vessel which is showing an identity ofHongtai 168after the monitoring system observed the vessel anchored since February 22 approximately six nautical miles off the fishing village of Jiangjun in southwest Taiwan on the Taiwan Strait. The Coast Guard reports a shore station had attempted to contact the vessel seven times since it anchored offshore but received no reply.\nToday, February 25, at just after 0300 local time the vessel was observed starting to move away from its anchorage in a northwest direction. At approximately the same time, the Coast Guard was asked to investigate after Chunghwa Telecom reported its main subsea cable to Penghu was apparently severed and it had switched to a backup to maintain communications.\n\n\nTaiwan Coast Guard boarded the vessel after it was directed into port (Coast Guard Administration)\n\nThe Coast Guard intercepted the vessel but was unable to board it due to high seas and a high freeboard. Two additional vessels were dispatched to assist and the Togo-flagged ship was directed into Anping Port where it arrived at midday and was boarded for further inspection.\nThe vessel appears to have been built in 2006 and previously reported ownership by Chinese interests. It is 1,800 dwt.\nTaiwanese officials are questioning the identity of the vessel. They reported there was a crew of eight Chinese nationals aboard who said the vessel wasHongtai 168. That name is painted on the hull as well but the AIS signal is broadcastingHongtai 58. Officials are calling the vessel a “makeshift ship,” but they believe it is backed by Chinese capital.\nThey noted that while there is an apparent break in the cable it is unclear if it was intentional sabotage or an accident. Further investigations are underway to clarify the circumstances."

        "content": "Deep ocean search company Ocean Infinity has rebooted the hunt for Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 that disappeared over the Indian Ocean 11 years ago.\nIn the early hours of March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur, headed north for Beijing. The plane then reversed course and made for the Indian Ocean, and at about 0214, it passed out of radar range as it headed west over the Strait of Malacca. MH370 never arrived at its destination, and all passengers and crew were presumed lost at sea. Pieces of the aircraft floated ashore in Tanzania, Reunion and South Africa, confirming that it had crashed, but a three-year seabed search failed to turn up any sign of the wreckage on the bottom.\nOcean Infinity has agreed to undertake a new search on unusual terms: a reported \"no-find, no-fee\" arrangement. If it finds the wreck site, it will receive $70 million; the details of the contract are still being finalized, even though deployment and operations have already begun, Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke told reporters on Tuesday.\nIt is a high-profile test for Ocean Infinity's new low-crew survey techniques. The company has deployed theArmada 7806,a Vard-built compact survey ship designed to perform ROV and AUV search operations with less overhead and lower fuel consumption than a conventional platform. The 78-meter hulls have two moonpools for underwater vehicle deployment, and can operate ROV missions with as little as 16 crewmembers on board.\nAIS data provided by Pole Star suggests that theArmada 7806finished her transit and arrived on station in the Indian Ocean on Monday. As of Tuesday, she was holding position and broadcasting her status as restricted in ability to maneuver, indicating AUV or ROV survey operations."

        "content": "\nFighting is continuing for a fourth day in Iran’s southeastern port city of Chabahar.\nChabahar is the principal port in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchistan province, which borders Pakistan’s Baluchistan. On both sides of the border, Baluchi separatists have mounted attacks on central government security forces, but attacks have intensified on the Iranian side of the border. Over the past six months, under the pretext of carrying out training exercises, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has mounted large-scale sweep operations across Sistan Baluchistan, and has suffered a steady flow of casualties.\nThe fighting in Chabahar broke out on February 22, when Jaish Al Adl separatists forced the evacuation of a government building responsible for the administration of rural affairs, then blew it up. Jaish Al Adl also attacked the Chabahar office of the Islamic Revolution Housing Foundation. A protracted gun battle was taking place in central Chabahar on the morning of February 25, widely shared on social media, as IRGC security forces attempted to surround a Jaish Al Adl position.\nIranian military and security forces raided a house in Chabahar, Sistan and Baluchestan, using RPGs and heavy gunfire as clashes continue.Halvash that covers the event in the southeastern province reports the area is fully surrounded, but details on casualties or the reason for…pic.twitter.com/cWykemERkR\nFor external observers of Iran, it is difficult to gauge when local fighting will spread to other restive areas and spark a wider insurrection. The Iranian Crown Prince in exile, interviewed on February 25, believes Iran is already “in a revolutionary, or at the very least, a pre-revolutionary fervor,\" he said. “It’s escalating every day.”\nBut more pertinently, the IRGC – as an acute internal observer of the scene –- evidently also believes this to be the case, mounting large-scale internal security exercises, focused on border areas with large minority populations. These ‘exercises’ are a mix of mobilization rehearsals, intimidatory shows of force and an opportunity to launch pre-emptive strikes on what are thought to be forces opposed to the Islamic regime. Besides Sistan Baluchistan, these ‘exercises’ have also covered the Kermanshah area of western Iran, the traditionally restive Arabic-speaking Khuzestan across the border from Basra, and Tehran itself. The IRGC’s primary role is not defense of the country, but protection of the Islamic Revolution and its leaders, and the areas where the IRGC has exercised are the first places to look for any further uprisings sparked by the activity in Chabahar.\nA particular area of concern for the IRGC appears to be the southern coastline abutting the Gulf of Oman, which has seen increased levels of both Iranian regular and IRGC naval activity.  Rear Admiral Shahram Irani, the regular Iranian Navy commander, told Press TV recently two of his five deployed flotillas were covering this southern flank from the Indian Ocean.\nThe unprecedented levels of IRGC activity have been accompanied by a series of statements from the IRGC’s senior leadership.  These statements reflect concern that the country may face further attacks from Israel, but also from the United States, aimed at neutralizing Iran’s covert nuclear weapons development program.  Such statements have threatened a True Promise-3 operation, a larger scale ballistic missile and drone attack than Operation True Promise-2 launched against Israel on October 1, 2024. The Iranians have also brandished their ability to mount drone attacks from ships, and have been resupplying their Houthis allies. On the political front, the Iranian leadership has intensified its courting of allies and sympathizers, seeking to enmesh them in its defense and security arrangements."

The crew could not counter the ice buildup fast enough to avoid a capsizing, and the vessel gradually listed to port and sank.\nThe risk of pollution is reportedly limited, as the vessel had a small quantity of diesel on board. The owner is deploying booms to contain any pollution, and is making plans to raise the wreck.\nThe Transport Prosecutor's Office for Novorossiysk has launched an investigation into the casualty, and is looking at whether there may have been any breaches of maritime regulations. Separately, the Investigative Committee of Russia's transport division has started the process of beginning its own investigation, according to Russian outlet PortNews.\nDamaged freighter still awaiting port of refuge\nAccording to Ukrainian sources, the aging freighterPavel Grabovskiyremains stuck near the port of Azov because local authorities refuse to provide a port of refuge.\nOn February 16, the 46-year-oldGrabovskiybegan taking on water through a hole in the hull while under way in the Sea of Azov. Tugboats were deployed to provide it with assistance, and Russian authorities assert that the situation is stable.\nPetro Andryushchenko, head of Ukraine's Center for the Study of Occupation, told Channel 24 that the freighter is still stuck at sea after more than a week.\n\"Apparently, the situation is much more serious, but they are trying not to disclose it, given the recent tanker accidents in the Black Sea. As of yesterday, the ship was in a roadstead near the port of Azov. Its repair in the open sea is much more difficult than in the port, but it was not allowed to dock,\" said Andryuschenko."

Japan’s NYK Group (Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha) working in partnership with Seatrium and its design company LMG Marine, is reporting a groundbreaking step in advancing the sector.\nThe group’s design for an ammonia-fueled ammonia bunkering vessel has passed the next key milestone in its development. ClassNK reviewed the design engineering developed by LMG and issued the next Approval-in-Principle for the project. The partners report the design will now be submitted to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore for evaluation. Singapore hosted thefirst ammonia bunkering operationsand certification program in early 2024 for the converted offshore support vessel developed by Fortescue.\nThe AiP certification validated the ammonia-fueled ammonia bunkering vessel design’s compliance with stringent safety, technical, and environmental standards. LMG Marin provided design capabilities, leading to a Hazard Identification Study (HAZID) for design validation. The comprehensive HAZID conducted was instrumental in ensuring optimal safety, performance, and operational reliability.\nThe partners report the vessel design incorporates the consortium's two key features to ensure safety and operational reliability. It uses ammonia fuel dual-fuel engines from IHI Power Systems and a bunkering boom by TB Global Technologies. The bunkering boom features a unique technology called the High Speed Ammonia Purging Emergency Release System (ERS), which enables a reliable and efficient disconnection between vessels in an emergency.\nNYK is already at the forefront of ammonia-fueled shipping. In 2024, it completed the conversion of its pioneering LNG-fueled tugboatSakigakeinto an ammonia-powered vessel. It completed one of the firstammonia bunkering operationwhich used truck-based delivery and the vessel is now demonstrating operations in Tokyo Bay.\nThe effort to develop an ammonia bunker vessel began several years ago. In September 2022, theproject receivedits first AiP certification based on a 3D model.\nNYK said the design for the bunker vessel is an essential contribution to developing the infrastructure needed for ammonia bunkering. The designs will be reviewed by the authorities in Singapore, which already is one of the world’s largest bunker ports, and seeks to be a hub for innovation."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The Verified Gross Mass (VGM) regulation that took effect in 2016 was supposed to cut down significantly on the risk of misdeclared weights in container shipping, which can cause stack collapses and dangerous stability issues. A recent incident involving a U.S.-flagged boxship shows the potential hazards that still exist if incorrect weights are entered in booking systems and if containers aren't reweighed before loading.\nIn early 2024, a booking agent for cargo departing California was preparing a reservation of 40 container slots for the February 3 sailing of the U.S.-flagged boxship President Eisenhower. One of the containers was flagged as overweight, so the agent split the booking into one heavy container and 39 other containers. The weight info for the new entry for 39 containers didn't automatically populate, so the agent typed in the cargo weight for all 39 boxes - as 2.5 tonnes. When including the weight of the empty container, this yielded a total loaded weight of about six tonnes for each container, and this number was recorded in the booking system. In actuality, the real total VGM reported by the shipper on the bill of lading was between 25-29 tonnes, nearly five times as heavy as what the agent put into the booking system.\nOn February 2, 2024, these containers were loaded aboard President Eisenhower at the Port of LA's Fenix Marine Services terminal. The majority of the boxes were stowed in the upper tiers of bay 42 on the port and starboard side, a few bays forward of the deckhouse. They were not reweighed at the terminal, nor did the STS cranes at the pier have the ability to weigh in motion during loading. The Eisenhower's chief mate performed stability calculations and draft measurements with the (incorrect) loading information supplied, and passed all routine presail checks. Early the next day, Eisenhower got under way for Oakland.\nOn the morning February 6, Eisenhower arrived off Oakland and shut down the main engine to drift while awaiting a berth. Wind and sea conditions gradually increased through the day, rising to 20-knot winds and 12-foot swells. The boxship was rolling up to 18 degrees in these conditions.\nAt about 2130 hours, the AB on duty saw \"smoke\" in the air on the port side. The third mate sent the AB forward to check on the cargo, and the AB found that a stack of containers was missing from the port side of bay 42. The smoke was suspended powder from collapsed containers: a total of 23 had gone over the side, and another 10 were damaged. The collapse caused an estimated $630,000 in cargo damage and $105,000 in damage to the vessel; luckily no one was hurt.\nLater analyses by the ship operator found that the improper loading configuration with the heavier-than-declared boxes would have produced excessive forces, large enough to break the lashings in bay 42. \"The vessel would not have sailed with that configuration, had it been known,\" the company told NTSB.\nThe booking agent has changed its computer system to automatically capture the VGM from the shipper's original booking, and it now requires individual verification of all VGMs under 10 tonnes."

It is the first time that the service has performed one of these tests in years.\nVideo released Tuesday shows that the service set off a substantial underwater explosion just off the starboard beam of the frigate FLFCourbet. Unlike the U.S. Navy, which conducts shock trials while the ship holds position, the Marine Nationale hadCourbetunder way at a slow bell when the explosion went off.\n#Expérimentation| La résistance de la FLF Courbet face à l’explosion d’une mine navale !????Cette expérimentation appelée \"essai de choc\" a été réalisée pour évaluer la résistance du bâtiment et des équipements à une explosion importante, dans un contexte de hausse des menaces.pic.twitter.com/bG4kWfwOUI\nThe Marine Nationale said that the purpose of the trial was to prepare the vessel and crew for operations \"in a context of increasing threats.\" The idea of the shock trial dates back to WWII, when the U.S. Navy found that near-miss explosions from naval mines could damage or disable mission-critical systems, taking the target vessel out of action - even if it managed to evade a direct hit.\nThe U.S. Navy uses a series of up to four \"shots\" for each trial, typically performed with the first-in-class vessel shortly after delivery. The maximum shock intensity occurs in the third shot, and is equal to two-thirds of the maximum shock design value of the ship. The test process is expensive, typically costing tens of millions for preparation, evaluation and post-shock repairs.\nIn the past, full-ship shock trials have revealed design flaws with components that previously passed rigorous testing standards. As an example, early testing of the Flight I Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USSJohn Paul Jonesled to significant shock-hardening revisions, which were tested seven years later aboard the Flight IIA USSWinston Churchill. ThoughChurchilldid worse overall on the test, many systems that had been revised performed much better than the first time - and the second test led to significant upgrades and QA checks on all Flight IIA hulls."

        "content": "\nThe wreck of a Dutch submarine that rescued survivors after an Australian minesweeper was sunk by Japanese warships during World War II has been discovered at a famous ship graveyard off the coast of the Australian city of Fremantle. About eight decades after it went missing, the wreck of HNLMSK XIhas been identified and is said to be lying in 40 meters of water off Rottnest Island, outside of the well-known Rottnest ship graveyard.\nThe wreck was discovered by a technical diving group called Wrecksploration on January 1. The Western Australian Museum (WAM) worked in conjunction with the Dutch Cultural Heritage Agency (RCE) to identify the boat using the group's 3D model of the site.K XIis said to be one of the most significant vessels to have been discarded in or near the graveyard, which is the final resting place for about 50 shipwrecks.\nK XIwas built in Fijenoord, Rotterdam between 1922 and 1924 for the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNN) and was deployed to patrol waters in the colonial Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia). Commissioned in 1925, the submarine was the first of three boats in the K XI class and one of 25 boats built for the submarine division of the RNN. At least 15 boats were deployed in the Netherlands East Indies.\nOn March 9, 1942,K XI'screw rescued 13 survivors from the 151 crew of the Royal Australian Navy’s minesweeping and convoy escort sloop HMAS Yarra (II) that had been sunk by Japanese warships. The 13 men had survived in rough waters for five days floating on life rafts and clinging to life through occasional spoonfuls of water and a few biscuits.\n\nFor more than three decades, WA Museum has been investigating the Rottnest graveyard, where it believedK XIwas resting. When divers discovered the wreck outside of the main dumping site, RCE agreed to finance the photogrammetry work, which was developed into a 3D model and submitted to the WA Museum for identification.\n“Over the decades, the use of archival sources, local knowledge, and remote sensing surveys has allowed the Museum to identify a number of significant sites in the graveyard. In this project, we compared archival records with the 3D model created by Wrecksploration to confirm that the wreck was theK XI,” said Corioli Souter, Head of Maritime Heritage at the WA Museum.\nDuring WWII, Fremantle Harbor was the largest submarine base in the Southern Hemisphere and was the second-most important Allied submarine base in the Pacific Theatre after Pearl Harbor, with U.S, British and Dutch submarines operating from Fremantle. A total of 11 Dutch submarines operated out of Fremantle during the time period.\nArcheologists say that the discovery of the wreck ofK XIprovides an insight into the behaviors and practices of ship dumping off Fremantle in the immediate post-WWII period. Apart fromK XI,six miniature Welman two-man submarines, eight submersible canoes, four aircraft, and other military equipment are believed to have been dumped at the graveyard.\nThe wreck ofK XIis protected by Australia’s laws as an important heritage site, meaning that divers can visit but cannot damage, disturb, or remove any part."

        "content": "The buyers' alliance established in 2023 to spur demand for decarbonization in shipping officially opened its second, larger tender for shipping services this time requiring the use of the e-fuel. It comes as the first contract which was awarded to Hapag-Lloyd for low-emission shipper services is set to kick off in 2025 and run into 2026.\nThe concept behind the initiative known as ZEMBA (Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance) and facilitated by the Aspen Institute builds demand by aggregating the shipping needs of members ranging from Ikea and Nike to Levi Straus and Electrolux. Over forty major manufacturing and consumer brands are currently members of the alliance. The group launched its first tender in 2024 saying the goal was to accelerate commercial deployment of clean energy powered shipping. By aggregating demand, they are enabling economies of scale and building lead-edge demand to encourage the shipping and fuel industries to pursue their initiatives.\nUnder the first tender, well-known brands including Amazon, Patagonia, Bauhaus, New Balance, Nike, REI, and others agreed to purchase over one billion TEU miles on the route between Singapore and Rotterdam in 2025 and 2026. Hapag as the winner of the tender agreed to provide an independently certified and exclusive waste-based biomethane service.\nThe second tender launched today and accepting proposals through the spring of 2025 shifts to a focus on e-fuels. ZEMBA reported in October 2024 that a survey of the industry found sufficient predicted supply of both e-methanol and e-methanol-capable vessels in the container segment to support ZEMBA’s focus on e-fuel deployment. They noted however that many producers remained at the pre-FID stage, casting doubt on whether those projects would begin production on projected timelines and, related, if e-fuel-capable dual fuel vessels would actually run on e-fuels without spurring demand.\nWith the second tender, ZEMBA intends to aggregate approximately 86 billion tonne nautical miles of demand for the emissions abatement associated with e-fuel-powered shipping to be deployed starting in 2027. This equates to 1.5 million TEU transported across the Pacific by e-fuels, assuming a benchmark distance of Shanghai to Los Angeles and projects enabling companies to abate approximately 500,000 metric tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, subject to final commercial details.\n“Getting e-fuel-powered shipping on the water for the first time through this collaborative forward procurement will be a huge technical and commercial innovation milestone for the sector,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, President and CEO of ZEMBA.\nA qualifying bid for ZEMBA’s tender will be a proposal from a containership carrier or consortium for e-fuel-powered shipping for three to five years, starting around 2027. All bids must demonstrate at least a 90 percent lifecycle emission reduction for the primary propulsion of the vessels compared to a high-emission fuel baseline.\nZEMBA will select the best proposal(s), and after vetting and commercial negotiation, members will enter bilateral contracts with the winner(s). For this tender, ZEMBA is open to the potential of multiple winners. Results of the second tender are expected to be announced by the end of 2025."

Seven executives were arrested Monday night, February 24, including the CEO of the oil company Pertamina, CEO of the shipping company Pertamina International Shipping, the director of one of the retail operating units of the company, and executives from other companies including a terminal operator.\nThe Deputy Attorney General for Special Crimes said the investigation had been launched in October 2024 and based on their finding they believe there had been a series of acts of corruption that harmed the state. They interviewed 96 witnesses, as well as experts, and extensively reviewed documents.\nThey detailed an elaborate plot that they said involved rejecting domestically supplied petroleum and reducing the capacity and readiness of domestic refinery capacity so that domestic petroleum production was not fully absorbed. Indonesian law requires that the company first source domestic supplies before importing petroleum for domestic needs. The charges contend the executives were rejecting domestic crude oil products saying they did not meet specifications, although they either did or could have been refined further.\nThe conspirators are alleged to have exported domestic oil labeled as not meeting standards. At the same time, they imported oil products for domestic use.\nThe charges further allege there was price manipulation and a criminal conspiracy to fix pricing. They imported oil to make up for the needs but reportedly brought it in at a lower quality than stated and blended it in the storage tanks.\nThe CEO of Pertamina International Shipping is alleged to be a conspirator in the corruption case. The AG’s office found that there was a markup on the shipping contracts. They allege the state paid a fee of 13 to 15 percent which was illegally generating profits from the transactions.\nAmong the individuals reported detained were Yoki Firnandi, CEO of Pertamina International Shipping, and Riva Siahaan, CEO of Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas company. A total of seven executives were taken into custody with media reports indicating they are facing up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Each could also be fined one billion rupiah, approximately $61,000.\nThe company issued a statement saying that it was ready to cooperate with the ongoing investigations. It called for the “presumption of innocence,” while saying it would respect the investigation.\n"

For the first time in a generation, they are seeing the liner at sea and despite years without maintenance, she is still casting her famous profile.\nThe nearly 1,000-foot liner encountered some difficult weather conditions off the Virginia coast over the weekend which forced the tug, Vinik 6, to “hove to” to wait out the worst of the weather conditions. The captain of the vessel, Mike Vinik is posting comments and doing media interviews describing the tow as the experience of a lifetime.\nVinik told Fox 10 TV News in Mobile that they had encountered 45 mph winds and 14-foot seas on Saturday. He said the liner had gone into the wind forcing them to slow the tow. The ship is attached with an anchor chain and approximately 1,800 feet astern of the tug. At one-point, Vinik said they however were nearly alongside with the liner having turned sideways to the tug.\n\n\n\nOnce the weather abated, Vinik reports there were making speeds of between six and seven knots and sometimes up to eight knots. The tow plan projected speeds of five to six knots. Vinik maneuvered the tow to avoid the strongest elements of the Gulf Stream to aid the tow, but reports as they got south the weather has consistently improved.\nAt one point they encountered a unique phenomenon, “sea smoke.” The air temperatures were in the 30s or 40s Fahrenheit while sea temperatures were 80 to 85 degrees as they entered the Gulf Stream region. The liner also had “escorts” of a sort, including a whale and great white shark.\n\n\n\nThe tow is progressing ahead of schedule with the ship offpassing central Floridamidday on Tuesday, February 25. Vinik said in his interview they would reach the Florida Straits late tonight or early tomorrow morning. Fox 10 is reporting the liner could reach Mobile on March 5.\nVinik reports that they will position the liner into Mobile and handoff to local tugs to dock the ship. Previous reports said it will be backed up the Mobile River to the remediation facility. Work will continue removing contaminants and residual oil to prepare for the reefing.\nFans of the famous liner, which still hold the title as the fastest to cross the Atlantic, are for now enjoying the final look at its profile. Once it arrives in Mobile, the funnels, radar mast, and cargo kingposts will all be removed. They also plan to remove all the windows and portholes before the hull is reefed near Destin, Florida in 2026."

        "content": "\nEfforts to continue to build out the engine options for shipowners seeking to align with the emerging trends for alternative fuels continued with WinGD highlighting the delivery of the most powerful methanol-fueled engine for ships. It is the largest yet built for methanol and part of the company's diversified future offering including LNG and ammonia-fueled engines.\nThe Swiss company which has been in the engine business since 1893 highlights that the new methanol engine is ready for delivery after passing factory and type approval tests. It launched the line with a ten-cylinder, 92-bore X-DF-M engine while reporting it is offering engines with bore sizes ranging from 52 to 96, in similar cylinder configurations and engine rating fields as its diesel-fueled engines. The methanol rollout proceeds ammonia-fueled engines which are still in the testing phase but expected as early as mid-year.\n“Production of sustainable, renewable fuels of all types continues to advance, but long-term availability and cost remain uncertain,” commented Dominik Schneiter, CEO of WinGD. As interest in methanol and regulatory clarity increases, we anticipate the X-DF-M platform will become a key contributor to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from global shipping.”\nThe milestone was marked by a delivery ceremony held at engine builder CMD in Shanghai and included a ceremony for the signing of the approval certificate by eight classification societies. According to WinGD, this assures that the engine can be built to WinGD’s design by all engine builders.\nThe first engine will be shipped to COSCO Heavy Industry’s shipyard and is slated for installation on a 16,000 TEU containership being built for COSCO Shipping. COSCO is expanding its methanol operations after having also recently celebrated the naming of China’s first large methanol-fueled containership earlier this month. WindGD reports the new engine will be installed on the fourth ship of a new class with the other three ships’ engines being converted after the first methanol engine is commissioned.\nWinGD reports it has 56 orders for X-DF-M engines on order across bore sizes ranging from 52 to 92, X-Engines. The addition of methanol capability to WinGD’s engine line-up further extends the decarbonization options available to deep-sea ship operators, which include the long-established X-DF LNG-fueled engine platform and a new ammonia-fueled X-DF-A platform which is currently in the testing phase.\nThe company was acquired in 2016 by China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). It continues to be one of the world’s leading engine manufacturers."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nIn a move that goes against the global trend to stop live export, Argentina announced that it is repealing a ban that has been in place since 1973. The Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Secretariat of the Ministry of Economy cited it as a move to support free trade and to grow Argentina’s export industry and role in world trade.\nJavier Gerardo Milei who became president of Argentina in 2023 has been seeking to grow the country’s role in global trade. The country, which is already one of the leaders in the global export of frozen and refrigerated meat, said the move will allow for greater competition within the livestock and meat sector, greater market freedom, and provide a significant source of foreign currency.\nThe ministry called the ban outdated and not reflecting the current focus on free development. It declared that there were no reasons to maintain the restriction while asserting that developing the live export trade would encourage the improvement of livestock breeds and add prestige to national production. It said the repeal was in keeping with a government policy to promote “an economic system based on free decisions, adopted in an area of free competition, with respect for private property and the constitutional principles of free circulation of goods, services, and labor.”\nThe move is likely to face strong opposition from global animal rights groups which have increased pressure on the trade and governments around the world. They argue it is inhumane treatment of the animals and unnecessary cruelty. After years of pressure, New Zealand banned live export in 2023 followed by moves in Great Britain. Australia has limited its trade and is scheduled to end the export of sheep in 2028.\nAnimal rights groups have also been successful in demanding changes to the vessels used for live export after documenting conditions aboard. Combined with the bans, the shipping industry is in decline. In January 2025, Wellard, which had been involved in live export for 46 years and once was described as Australia’s largest live export business, announced the sale of its last vessel and an end to live exports.\nDespite the pressure, the trade however has persisted. Experts report continuing demand from countries including Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Argentina, Peru, and Colombia. Argentina’s neighboring country Brazil has been conducting live export since 2010 with reports saying around 2.6 million live cattle were shipped. Advocates however are also pressing Brazil to end its live exports.\nFor Argentina, live export is seen as a new opportunity to expand on its record levels of exports of frozen, refrigerated, and processed beef. The Ministry reported today, February 26, that Argentina increased beef exports by 10 percent in 2024 reaching a total of 935,261 tons. It was the highest level since a record reached in 1924 of 918 thousand tons. The main destinations for Argentina’s beef in 2024 were the United States, as well as China, Mexico, Canada, and Malaysia. In total, Argentina ships to 53 international markets, which was up by 11 in 2024.\nThe Ministry says Argentina's beef exports reflect the combination of quality, market diversification, and the ability to adapt to international demands. They report the meat sector is emerging as a pillar of the country’s economic growth."

        "content": "\nIf implemented, the Trump administration's proposed million-dollar port fees for Chinese-built ships would increase costs for American shippers, according to analysts for Dutch banking group ING.\nThe White House's Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has proposed unprecedented access fees for Chinese-operated and Chinese-built ships, ranging up to $1.5 million per port call. The objective is to counter the support that China has provided to its yards and shipowners for decades; China now leads the world in shipbuilding and (by some measures) shipowning.\nIn a notice earlier this week, the USTR announced that it has determined that \"China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance is unreasonable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce.\" It laid out a series of possible million-dollar port call fees for Chinese vessel operators, other operators of Chinese-built ships, and operators with newbuilds on order at Chinese yards (China's orderbook accounts for more than half of all new tonnage). USTR is taking public comments on the proposal until late March, and the results will be forwarded to President Donald Trump for a decision.\nChinese-built tonnage accounts for 17 percent of all boxship port calls in the United States, and more on specific trade lanes. According to ING, the fees - if imposed as advertised - would exclude state-owned Chinese carrier COSCO from U.S. ports. All other large carriers are based in Europe or Asia, and would be subject to the proposal's \"Chinese-built\" port call fees. As China holds a particular dominance in the construction of container ships - accounting for 60 percent of the boxship orderbook - the fees will likely rise. As the fee structure is assessed based on the composition of each operator's entire global fleet, simply rerouting Chinese-built ships onto non-U.S. rotations would not be enough to evade the extra cost. \"These additional expenses would likely be passed on from the carrier to shippers and, ultimately, to importers and exporters,\" ING's analysts cautioned.\nThe USTR also proposed an ambitious quota requirement for up to 15 percent of U.S. exports to be shipped aboard U.S.-flagged ships by 2032 - including five percent aboard U.S.-built ships. ING expressed skepticism that U.S. yards have the capacity or the workforce resources to build large tonnage at that scale on a seven-year timeframe.\nShipping interests are famously adept at circumventing control measures, and one loophole appears to be available. Canada has ports that are not in the United States, and these would be exempt from any U.S. port fees. Many shippers already send large quantities of cargo from Asia to Prince Rupert and Vancouver, B.C., then have it moved into the U.S. heartland by intermodal rail. The fee would prompt U.S. shippers to shift more cargo to trans-Canadian routes, noted Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen in a social media message."

After the First World War and the Russian Revolution, the company transitioned in the 1920s to a fleet of ocean-going cargo ships and would remain active in bulkers while more recently adding RoRo, offshore, and port logistics. The last of the cargo ships were sold in the early 2020s.\nToday, LDA specializes in three segments, transportation and logistics of industrial equipment, mainly through dedicated RoRo vessels, maintenance of offshore wind farms, and installation and maintenance of submarine telecom and power cables. With a worldwide presence, LDA manages a fleet of 23 vessels. Building on a long-term partnership with Airbus the company recently ordered a new generation of wind-assisted propulsion RoRos and is developing new offshore service vessels.\nWith InfraVia as a shareholder, LDA says it would accelerate its ambitions to become a leading maritime infrastructure. InfraVia it highlights has the necessary expertise to support its growth ambitions and accelerate the group's digitalization and energy transition.The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025."

        "content": "\nThe membership of the International Longshoremen’s’ Association officially ratified the new 6-year contract on Tuesday, February 25, bringing to close one of the most contentious contract negotiations in decades. The ILA is calling the new contract the “gold standard” for dockworker unions globally while saying with the ratification there would be “labor peace” and that the ILA would be working in partnership with USMX to help all ILA ports grow and flourish.\n“It was a tough contract to negotiate,” said ILA President Harold Daggett who served as the union’s chief negotiator. Among the terms the union is highlighting is a 62 percent wage increase, accelerated wage raises for new ILA workers, container royalty funds for the ILA, and improved benefits including healthcare for members. Daggett in a message to members said the new contract was worth about $35 billion, nearly twice the previous agreement.\nThe terms are retroactive to October 1, 2024, when the prior contract expired. Wage increases had been deferred after terms were reached in October until the full contract was completed. The new contract covers approximately 35 ports from Maine to Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It runs till September 30, 2030.\nDaggett is publicly declaring a key win saying it is the greatest contract in ILA history. He reports it provides “full protections against automation,” without providing details on the contract terms. The ILA had firmly declared it would not accept automation or semi-automation for any port operations.\nIn December 2024, then President-elect Donald Trump met with the union leaders. He also issued a strong statement against port automation.\nThe Associated Press and Bloomberg, however, are reporting that a compromise was found allowing operators to implement technology as long as it does not impact jobs. Mathew Leech, CEO of Ports America, told Bloomberg that automation was separated from other efficiency-enhancing technology. AP reports there is “more leeway to introduce modernizing technology.”\nThe previous contract required technology proposals to be submitted to a committee that included union representatives for review. Ports such as the Port of New York New Jersey highlighted there was no automation in use at its terminals, a point that operators said was both a handicap and hindering growth and efficiency.\nBloomberg reports the operators also won concessions on issues related to a lack of labor reliability and absenteeism. Daggett in his message to members said that no-shows had to stop and said reliability was critical in their efforts to oppose automation.\nThe board of the ILA and the members of USMX which represents the terminal operators and shipping companies had previously approved the new contract. The ILA reports there will be a formal signing ceremony on March 11 for the new 6-year agreement."

It is the latest in a series of interdictions intended to cut off illegal migration and shut down illegal Indonesian fishing vessels in this far-flung region, where there are few settlements and limited government presence.\nAboriginal rangers spotted the foreign fishing vessels near Maningrida, a remote village with no connection to the national road network, and reported the presence to the ABF. On Sunday, ABF vessels located and intercepted the two Indonesian boats near Maningrida and Port Essington. They detained the fishermen, confiscated the catch of 1,200 kilos of sea cucumber, and seized the fishing equipment. The vessels were destroyed at sea, as allowed under Australian law.\n“ABF is dedicated to responding to every report of illegal foreign fishing in the Northern Territory,\" Commander Griffin said. “We are grateful to the Djelk Rangers for their diligent reporting of this sighting. The unique and detailed knowledge that Indigenous ranger groups and Traditional Owners and custodians possess . . . is invaluable in supporting our efforts to protect our borders.\"\nIn December, the agency launched a new operation to intercept foreign fishing vessels that operate on the long and empty stretch of roadless coastline. The new push has been bearing fruit: in the first month of operations, 12 vessels were interdicted, resulting in the seizure of six tonnes of illicit catch.\nIllegal fishing has been a problem for local Aboriginal groups for a long time, but the pace has recently increased, along with new evidence of human smuggling. In October, a group of up to 30 unauthorized migrants from four boats were reported in the Northern Territories - igniting a minor political furor in Australia, where maritime migration is rigorously discouraged."

The emergence of the fuel is a critical step toward meeting the requirements of the FuelEU Maritime regulations and demonstrates a pathway for the industry with alternative fuels.\nThe bunkering was a partnership between STX Group and Molgas which collaborated to source, liquify, and deliver the certified bio-LNG. It was the first time that Molgas delivered mass balanced bio-LNG bunker to a maritime customer in Norway.\nThe fuel was delivered to Furetank, a Swedish tanker shipping company that operates 40 vessels in European waters. A total of 200 tonnes of bio-LNG was loaded to theFure Viken(17,942 dwt) while the vessel was anchored outside Mongstad, Norway. The tanker, which is 492 feet (150 meters) in length was delivered in 2024 as part of a program to modernize Furetank’s fleet. The first of the vessels was introduced in 2018 and the company highlights with the last delivery scheduled for 2027, it will have renewed its entire fleet. The vessels are dual-fuel to use LNG or gasoil, equipped for shore power, and are designed with a battery hybrid solution and several innovative features that reduce fuel and energy consumption.\n“We see a growing demand and interest in Bio-LNG, as it is one of the few renewable fuel solutions currently available in shipping. For this operation, we collaborated to prove a mass-balanced biomethane delivery and certify the entire supply chain. This new option strengthens the competitiveness of biomethane as part of the green transition,” said Gunnar Helmen, Director Marine at Molgas Nordics.\nBio-LNG is a mass-balanced product where biomethane of certified origins is purchased and injected into the gas grid. A corresponding amount of gas is withdrawn from the grid and liquefied into maritime fuel.\nEnvironmental commodity trader STX Group said it sees this transaction as one of the first signs of a new fuel market being born.\nBio-LNG has been emerging in the past few years as an option for shipping companies. Trade group SEA-LNG reported in a 2023 market analysis that annual production of biomethane, from which bio-LNG is produced, was around 30 million tonnes or around 10 percent of shipping’s total annual energy demand. It is growing in availability at ports including Rotterdam and in Asia and in 2024, Hapag-Lloyd working with Titan Clean Fuels, reported one of the largest bunkering operations to date. Hapag-Lloyd’sBrussels Expressloaded 2,200 tonnes of the alternative fuel at the Port of Rotterdam.\nThe companies called bio-LNG an “efficient answer” to FuelEU Maritime, noting the regulation rewards those who blend in biofuels and penalizes those who do not blend. They also noted that the new regulation makes no distinction between mass-balanced and off-grid produced biomethane. The companies assert that this opens up a new path for shipping in the transition to renewable energy, surpassing some of the hurdles of lack in biomethane supply and delivery infrastructure.\nOne of the challenges remains the lack of investment to achieve a critical supply level for the maritime industry. The companies note that their goal is for this demonstration to demonstrate the opportunities while they are also calling for public policy to further support the development of the production capabilities for renewable fuels."

Winds were 13 knots, in excess of the standard docking procedure for the site, but the pilot had done this evolution in stronger winds and did not believe that the conditions would be problematic.\nBecause of the tight quarters and the presence of the rig, there was no tug positioned on theSaipem 7000'sport quarter. Despite the power of the crane ship's DP-3 thrusters and the assistance of six tugs, the wind was enough to push the vessel off course. Its stern swung to port as it was trying to enter its berth, and its port quarter struck the rig.\n\nCourtesy Dutch Safety Board\nA welder was working on scaffolding on the exterior of the drilling rig. When theSaipem 7000made contact, he was trapped between the vessel and the rig, and he fell into the water. Multiple dive searches were conducted, but his body was not recovered for another three weeks.\nThe board called for the Dutch pilots' association to systematically assess and improve procedures for navigating in the inner harbor.\n\"Pilots must prepare themselves well for the safe execution of complex activities such as docking a crane vessel. For example, they must continuously test assumptions among all those involved and speak out about possible risks. The Regional Pilotage Corporation Rotterdam-Rijnmond is responsible for ensuring that pilots indeed prepare in this way,\" said Dutch Safety Board member Erica Bakkum.\nThe board also called on the shipyard to lead a joint risk assessment process for complex evolutions, incorporating input from all parties involved. \"A more thorough approach is needed for complex operations that are carried out simultaneously. The shipyard must ensure that risks are clearly understood and managed,\" the board concluded.\nSaipem 7000is one of the world's largest crane ships, and can complete full installations of offshore developments, including topside placement and pipelay. It can lift up to 14,000 tonnes at a time with twin cranes, and it is DP3 enabled for propulsion and anchorless stationkeeping."

The new approach will increase O&G production to 2.5 million barrels a day by 2030.\nIts renewables business will be \"disciplined\" going forward, with a focus on biogas, biofuels and EV charging - not on costly offshore wind. BP has also announced a strategic review of its Castrol lubricants business.\n\"We are reducing and reallocating capital expenditure to our highest-returning businesses to drive growth, and relentlessly pursuing performance improvements and cost efficiency.

Known as the Smart Container Alliance, the group reports its goal is to unite industry leaders in a collective effort to enhance cargo traceability, fortify maritime trade, and support global enforcement agencies in the fight against criminal networks.\nAnnouncing the formal launch of the initiative they pointed to geopolitical instability and climate-related disruptions which they said are posing increasing risks to global trade. Cargo theft, smuggling, and drug cartels have become an increasing focus of the authorities around the globe. As a result, the Alliance says shipping companies must ensure the highest levels of security and efficiency.\nThe Smart Container Alliance is dedicated to advancing industry standards, advocating for policy change, and fostering collaboration between technology providers, shipowners, customs authorities, and international regulatory bodies, including the European Union and the World Customs Organization. The launch of the Alliance aligns with the broader industry commitment that calls for increased investment in customs operations, digital transformation, and enhanced public-private partnerships to address the growing complexity of global trade.\n“Smart Cargo and Container Telematics are the foundation for the 21st Century Supply Chain with revolutionary new solutions for our society, authorities, governments, and businesses to structurally reduce illicit trade, cargo contamination, cargo waste, theft and supply chain carbon footprint while simultaneously enhance product authentication, on-time delivery commitments, asset productivity and cargo integrity and quality,” said Charles Vincent, CEO of ARVIEM, a technology company focusing on real-time end-to-end cargo monitoring services, and one of the founders of the Alliance.\nAccording to the group, over the past four years, smart container technologies have played a crucial role in enabling customs authorities and shipping companies to detect and intercept illicit goods, leading to multiple successful drug seizures. The Alliance will leverage this experience to push for greater adoption and regulatory support.\nThe launch of the Smart Container Alliance comes at a pivotal moment, coinciding with the most ambitious reform of the EU Customs Union since its inception in 1968. Smart containers are set to play a key role in the shift towards a data-driven approach to customs checks, reinforcing security measures across European ports and beyond.\nThe Alliance will advocate for the economic and technological benefits of smart container solutions, championing concrete use cases that demonstrate their transformative potential. With its headquarters in Brussels, it will engage with policymakers, industry leaders, and enforcement agencies to support a harmonized approach to trade security. A key focus will be aligning efforts with the European Port Alliance to counter criminal infiltration and reinforce supply chain integrity.\nArviem, Globe Tracker, ORBCOMM, Hoopo, Traxens, and Nexxiot are the founding members of the Smart Container Alliance. The group is seeking other stakeholders to join as it looks to build the focus on technologies and the role it can play in the supply chain."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has ordered a container terminal in San Juan, Puerto Rico to stop handling ammonium nitrate - a dangerous cargo that can explode under the wrong conditions - until it installs proper firefighting equipment.\nThe Coast Guard has long had concerns about the Puerto Nuevo Terminal (PNT) facility's alleged lack of firefighting capability for handling dangerous goods, specifically including a requirement to have fire hydrants every 300 feet and a sufficient water supply to run them. Sector San Juan worked with the terminal's management to encourage them to bring their operations into compliance with Coast Guard regulations, and eventually handed PNT a hard deadline of October 8, 2024 to comply or lose its permit to handle dangerous cargoes. PNT did not, according to Sector San Juan, and its permit was revoked.\nAfter the revocation, PNT brought in temporary firefighting equipment as an interim solution, and Sector San Juan renewed the permit to allow cargo operations to resume - with restrictions. However, during a routine visit, Coast Guard inspectors found that PNT was violating the terms of those restrictions, resulting in a full suspension of the permit \"to ensure the safety and security of the port and surrounding waterways.\"\nIf PNT still doesn't comply, according to Sector San Juan, it now faces a fine of nearly $120,000 per day for violations - and the possibility of prosecution for a Class D felony, with fines of up to $500,000 for a company (and possible prison time for individuals).\nPuerto Nuevo Terminals (PNT) is a 50/50 joint venture between Luis Ayala Colon and Saltchuk-owned Puerto Rico Terminals. It is now one of only two container terminals in San Juan. The JV was approved by the Federal Maritime Commission in 2019; at the time, the FMC had serious concerns that the combination of the two terminals would reduce competition in Puerto Rico and increase prices for consumers, and though a majority voted for approval, the commission said that it would continue to monitor PNT closely."

        "content": "Yet another major U.S. offshore wind farm is being delayed with the executives citing the uncertainties created in the market since the election of Donald Trump. Portugal’s EDP Renewables reported as part of its earnings that it will be taking an impairment charge despite the fact its project off Massachusetts is fully permitted and while saying the company still believes in the project.\nThe lease for Southcoast Wind (originally known as Mayflower Wind) was awarded in December 2018 and the project is under development in a joint venture between EDP Renewables and Engie. The wind farm was selected in the tri-state solicitation in 2024 with Massachusetts and Rhode Island agreeing to split power from the 2.4 GW project. In one of its final acts, the Biden administration approved the construction plan for the wind farm on January 18, 2025.\nAs part of its year-end financial reports, EDPR said today, February 27, took an approximately $139 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2024 as it postponed the project. Final negotiations were underway with Massachusetts, while financing and the interconnects were in place, and the company said it had an “attractive” power purchase agreement.\nConstruction on the U.S. wind farm was expected to begin in 2025. The company had previously projected the wind farm which would be located 30 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and 20 miles south of Nantucket would be completed by 2030. The new timetable does not anticipate starting construction until 2029.\n“That’s a slightly worst case scenario,” Miguel Stilwell d’Andrade, chief executive of EDPR told analysts during the investment community conference call. He said the company was still working on the project getting it “ready to go,” but that it has “taken the more prudent approach,” anticipating a delay.\nThe company told the analysts that it does not intend to abandon the project but it is the “prudent approach given recent executive orders and permit reviews.” Further, it cited the slow pace of approvals in Europe noting that it would be reducing its pace of investments in renewable capacity in 2025 and 2026.\nThe joint venture company, Ocean Winds, also holds earlier stage leases in the United States for Bluepoint Wind in the New York Bight and Golden State Wind off California. The company is active in a total of eight countries and highlights that it continues to make progress on its projects in Europe and Asia. It was also granted a feasibility license by the Australian Government in 2024.\nEDP Renewables follows moves by several other developers adjusting their U.S. projects. France’s EDF reported last week that it was writing down its investment in the Atlantic Shores project planned for New Jersey. Shell had earlier said that it was exiting the project joint venture.\nBP also withdrew its application for the transmission system connections for its Beacon Wind project. Vineyard Offshore, which is a U.S.-based affiliate of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, also reported it would be reworking its plans for Vineyard Wind 2 after Connecticut failed to move forward with power agreements.\nOther U.S. projects currently under construction, including Vineyard Wind 1, Coastal Virginia, and Revolution Wind are proceeding. The uncertainties center around projects with permits and those currently under review by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Trump ordered that the projects be reviewed and imposed a moratorium on leases and reviews on his first day in office."

        "content": "\nTwelve days after the containershipMSC Baltic III(33,767 dwt) lost power and was driven ashore in Canada during a winter storm, the Canadian Coast Guard reports the vessel cannot be safely refloated. Weather continues to hamper the efforts of the Coast Guard and a private salvage team with the latest update reporting they are focusing on the fuel and other possible contaminants aboard.\nThe vessel was abandoned on February 15 after it was driven onto the rocky shoreline of western Newfoundland. A helicopter rescued the crew.\nSince the 679-foot (203-meter) vessel went ashore, winter storms have continued to impact the area. The Coast Guard says teams are frequently unable to get aboard the ship and the weather is hampering some of the water operations. They are monitoring the ship from shore and the air.\nAt the beginning of the week, they reported that divers have confirmed that there were significant breaches or holes in the hull below the waterline. The vessel has settled firmly to the seabed and so far, they have not found significant breaks about the waterline. However, pictures have shown some deformations in the hull and the possibility of a crack.\n\n\nA crack appears to be forming to the right in the photo and deformations had previously been seen midship (Canadian Coast Guard February 24 photo)\n\n“Given the vessel’s current condition, it cannot be safely refloated,” the Coast Guard writes in its updated issued late on February 27. “The initial focus will be on the removal of the fuel and cargo.”\nBased on the urgency of the situation, the Coast Guard says it is looking at alternatives including repairing an old road and all-terrain vehicle trail that could be used to reach the remote location. They told The Telegram newspaper that the road would need upgrades to handle heavy equipment and tractor trailers. The Coast Guard is also looking at building an access point from shore to the bow of the vessel the newspaper reports.\nThe surveys have confirmed that there are approximately 1.7 million liters of heavy fuel oil and marine gas on board. While no pollution has been observed, there are concerns over a potential breach. One of the steps being explored is pumping the fuel to shore because it may not be possible to get a salvage vessel alongside.\nMSC initially advised the Coast Guard that the vessel had approximately 470 containers aboard, over half of which were empty. The others are carrying items such as food, lumber, and paper supplies. In the latest updates, the Coast Guard said however eight containers with polymer beads (nurdles) have been marked as a priority for removal.\nThe Coast Guard says that there are materials aboard considered dangerous goods in shipping terms, such as the nurdles as well as flour and whiskey. Nothing aboard however is hazardous under normal conditions.\nThe biggest issue is the race against time to reduce the risks as the winter storms are likely to persist in the region and further batter the vessel."

Phelan testified on his views of the Navy's most urgent problems and fielded questions from committee members, providing detailed answers to questions about specific programs and describing the need to reform contracting processes.\nIf confirmed, Phelan would be the first Navy Secretary in recent memory without any professional experience in or with the military. It would also be the largest management role of his career: at the Navy, he would oversee a sprawling global enterprise with 340,000 active-duty servicemembers, 100,000 reservists, 220,000 civilian employees, over 50 base installations, and a supply chain of overstretched and over-budget contractors. (Forecast layoffs and cost-cutting at the Pentagon level may reduce the service's head count in the near term.)\nIn the hearing, Phelan pitched his outsider status as an asset. \"The Navy and the Marine Corps already possess extraordinary operational expertise within their ranks,\" he said. \"My role is to utilize that expertise and strengthen it, step outside the status quo and take decisive action with a results-oriented approach.\"\nPhelan acknowledged the serious challenges facing the Navy, including the hard fact that it risks losing dominance on the high seas. China's overwhelming advantage in shipbuilding and heavy investment in fleet modernization have made the PLA Navy the largest naval force by tonnage in the world. Its surface combatants are backed up by the world's largest merchant fleet and a growing inventory of antiship ballistic missiles.\n\"Every shipbuilding delay, every maintenance backlog and every inefficiency is an opening for our adversaries to challenge our dominance. We cannot allow that to happen,\" said Phelan. \"I would push for a more agile, accountable and flexible shipbuilding strategy by streamlining procurement, enhancing budget flexibility, strengthening partnerships with the defense industrial base, and holding contractors accountable for cost and schedule overruns.\"\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to approve Phelan's nomination in early March, followed by approval from the Republican-controlled Senate."

About $60-130 million worth of cherries were stuck on board the vessel, and some or all of them will have to be thrown away.\nMaersk Saltoro,a sister ship of theDali, was chartered to Maersk and was deployed on the seasonal \"Cherry Express\" run from Chile to China. Cherries sell well during China's Lunar New Year celebrations, and the special-purpose boxship rotation handled about 17,000 containers of Chilean fruit this year.\nUnfortunately, about 1,300 of those containers were aboardMaersk Saltoro. The boxship broke down in the Pacific in January, about 500 nautical miles off Pohnpei.\nMaersk Saltorodrifted for three weeks, and only resumed her transit after a team of technicians came out by tugboat to join her and make repairs. The breakdown delayed the arrival of the cherry cargo until after the lucrative Lunar New Year sales window: She arrived in port 28 days late, long after peak seasonal pricing had subsided.\nThe shipment's value now appears to be much reduced: Although the cargo stayed refrigerated throughout the voyage, a substantial share was in spoiled condition on arrival. Chinese customs initially rejected the entire shipment and ordered it destroyed or re-exported, but the Chilean Cherry Committee has been in talks with customs officials in order tooptimizethe quantity slated for disposal.\nChinese customs officials will inspect every container, and all those marked as inedible will be taken to a designated disposal site, according to FreshPlaza.\nMaersk Saltoropreviously drew attention last year when U.S. officials boarded it in Baltimore to conduct an inspection.

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe European Commission presented its new Clean Industry Deal as the next ambitious step in a decarbonization strategy. The plan follows on from the FuelEU initiative that aims to reduce carbon emissions saying it will accelerate decarbonization while providing support to secure the future of European industry.\nThe Commission said it is launching the ambitious new program to make the regulatory environment more efficient. Its goal is to reduce bureaucratic hurdles. The plan focuses mainly on two sectors which they said are closely linked and critical to success for the decarbonization efforts. One focus is on energy-intensive industries which the Commission recognizes face high energy costs, unfair global competition, and complex regulations that are harming competitiveness. The other focus is on advancing clean tech.\n“The demand for clean products has slowed down, and some investments have moved to other regions,” said Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. “We know that too many obstacles still stand in the way of our European companies from high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden. The Clean Industrial Deal is to cut the ties that still hold our companies back and make a clear business case for Europe.”\nOne of the key debates that shaped the FuelEI Maritime regulations and continue in Europe is the investment and availability of alternative, low-carbon fuels. Production lags and companies have remained slow to make costly investments. Experts have said the supply of the fuel and the competition among industries could be one of the key hurdles to reaching the goals to lower carbon emissions.\n“Affordable energy is the foundation of competitiveness,” the Commission said in rolling out its plan. It adopted an Action Plan on Affordable Energy to lower energy bills for industry, businesses, and households. According to the Commission, the new act will speed up the roll-out of clean energy as well as accelerate electrification. It will support the efforts to complete physical interconnects across the internal energy markets while encouraging more efficient use of energy and cutting the dependence on fossil fuels.\nThe Clean Industrial Deal the European Commission estimates will mobilize over €100 billion to support EU-made clean manufacturing and adopt a new framework for simpler and quicker state aid measures for the roll-out of renewable energy, industrial decarbonization, and manufacturing capacity of clean tech. It is aiming for €100 billion in funding for its Innovation Fund and a proposed Industrial Decarbonization Bank. Amended regulations they also estimate will attract up to €50 billion in private-public investment.\nThe maritime sector immediately came out in strong support of the plan. The European Sea Ports Organisation (ESPO) welcomed the plan saying it would provide critical support to ports that are vital to the efforts. The ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp-Bruges issued statements in strong support and calling for the immediate implementation of the proposals.\nThe European Shipowners (ECSA) also announced support saying timing was critical. It welcomed the inclusion of shipping in the focus sectors while emphasizing the need to de-risk investments in fuels for shipping. Danish Shipping also applauded the plans highlighting the focus on increasing and lowering the cost of renewable energy. It said the European Commission is “focusing on exactly the right areas.”\nThe presentation said the Clean Industrial Deal is a critical framework and provides the basis for tailoring action plans for specific sectors. The Commission reports it will present an Action Plan for the automotive industry in March and an Action Plan on steel and metals in spring. Other tailored actions are also planned."

        "content": "\nCostamare which calls itself one of the leading owners and providers of containerships and dry bulk vessels for charter announced a plan to split its operations into two publicly-traded companies. The move reverses a strategy launched just four years ago to take the long-time containership owner into the dry bulk segment.\nThe company has been in business for 51 years and focused recently on containerships. It currently has a fleet of 68 owned containerships with a total capacity of approximately 513,000 TEU. The ships sail for well-known carriers ranging from COSCO, Evergreen, and Yang Ming to Maersk, MSC, Hapag-Lloyd, and Zim. In its year-end 2024 financial report, the company highlighted contracts had been fixed for 96 percent of its containership capacity in 2025 and 69 percent in 2026.\nCostamare surprised the industry in June 2021 reporting it had decided to enter the dry bulk sector. At the time they called it a liquid sector with strong fundamentals that would provide enhanced return opportunities for shareholders. Management pointed to a low orderbook and demand that was being driven by increased infrastructure spending and commodity consumption.\nThe position in dry bulk was launched with the acquisition of 16 vessels in 2021. They ranged between 33,000 and 85,000 dwt, with an average age of 10 years.  Today, Costamare owns 38 dry bulk carriers with a total capacity of approximately three million dwt and has a total of 51 bulkers on its operating platform.\nThe company reported income of more than $290 million for 2024, but the markets for containerships and dry bulk have moved divergently. Last year, demand for containerships was very strong while analysts have questioned the prospects for segments of dry bulk. Bulkers operate on short-term charters with the company reporting in late 2024 and early 2025 that it executed over 50 charters.\nThe new strategy calls for a spin-off of the dry bulk business into a standalone company that will include the vessels and the operating platform. It will also trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The original company will retain the containerships and its Neptune Maritime Leasing operation.\n“The board believes the proposed separation will unlock the inherent value within the two companies, which have unique growth prospects and investment opportunities,” according to the announcement. In addition to creating two pure-play investment opportunities, the transaction they said would provide a simplified structure. Management they said would have an enhanced focus on the individual business and the companies would have improved financial flexibility.\nTerms of the spin-off have not yet been set and the transaction requires final approval from the board of directors. Costamare said the spin-off is expected to be completed as soon as practical within this calendar year."

        "content": "Panama’s Attorney General weighed in during the ongoing debate over Chinese control of the Panama Canal telling the country’s Supreme Court he has determined the contract with China’s Hutchison Port Holdings is unconstitutional. He is asking the Supreme Court to confirm the unconstitutionality of the contract as a step toward terminating the agreements.\nIt is the latest step by the government of Panama to address concerns raised by Donald Trump who has repeatedly asserted China is running the canal and that the United States would take it back. Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino has alternately taken steps to appease Trump while also telling the U.S. to stop spreading “lies and falsehoods.” Mulino had been scheduled to have a telephone call with Trump on February 7, but it was canceled by the U.S. due to “last-minute scheduling conflicts.”\nThe Panamanian news agency reported yesterday, February 26, that Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez had reviewed the concession contract between the Panamanian State and Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of Hutchison. The Chinese company has been active in Panama since 1997, two years before the final U.S. handover of the canal, and has a contract for the development, construction, administration, and management of port terminals. In 2021, Hutchison received a no-bid 25-year extension of its contract. The company operates terminals in Balboa and Cristobal, two of the country’s five ports.\nGómez concluded that the contract improperly agreed to transfer the rights of the Panamanian state. He said the contract affects public welfare and interest, thereby affecting free competition and demand.\nThe opinion was submitted to the court on February 19 in support of two suits filed challenging the 2021 contract which was awarded during the administration by a previous president of Panama. The suit says the company is also benefitting from tax breaks and other agreements.\nMulino took office in July 2024 promising to clean up the problems of the prior administrations. In January, Panamanian Comptroller General Anel Bolo Flores announced that they would be auditing the 2021 contract with Hutchison.\nThe government of Panama and the Panama Canal Commission which operates the canal met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early in February during his first trip since assuming the role. Rubio, accompanied by a delegation of representatives from the United States government, was received at the Miraflores locks by the Canal Administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, to observe operations. Vásquez said he expressed the ongoing commitment to ensure a safe, uninterrupted, and efficient operation.\nThe Panama Canal Authority said after the meeting it had conveyed to Secretary Rubio its intention to work with the U.S. Navy to optimize the transit priority of U.S. Navy vessels through the Panama Canal. The U.S. State Department issued an announcement saying Panama had agreed to free transit for the U.S. Navy but later was forced to walk back its statement.\nPanama took other steps after Trump’s repeated acquisitions. It filed a formal notice with China that it was withdrawing from the Belt and Road initiative. China responded saying the Trump administration is applying \"pressure and coercion\" on Panama."

The job actions and strikes began earlier this month and now a second union, Unite, reports that its members have also voted to start a series of actions in early March.\nThe strikes are unusual because Unite and the other union, Prospect, are not disputing their contracts or striking for higher wages. Both unions, however, are demanding that Serco consult with them as part of ongoing negotiations with the Royal Navy for a new service contract for Serco. The company is currently in talks with the UK’s Ministry of Defence about the renewal of its 10-year contract.\nSerco took over as the service provider for the Royal Navy at its bases at Devonport, Portsmouth, Faslane, Great Harbour Greenock, and Kyle of Lochalsh after the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service was privatized in 2008. Serco provides towage activities, bunkering and watering, tank cleaning, passenger services, trial work, munitions, and nuclear safety activities for the Royal Navy.\nBoth unions report that in the past their members were consulted during the contract negotiations. Unite highlights that it represents approximately 300 tugboat and marine services crews, which is about half of Serco Marine’s workforce. Many of the individuals transferred to Serco during the privatization with Unite reporting these people have between 20 and 45 years of experience.\nUnite contends the new contract is valued at £1.2 billion, but it believes the Royal Navy is seeking to reduce the contract by £250 million, which Unite says is putting 100 jobs at risk. The unions believe their members can provide critical insights into the operations. Unite, however, alleges the cuts could include reducing the number of tugs handling nuclear submarines from six to four, which it says would be a violation of nuclear safety legislation.\nPromise, which mainly provides services at Faslane, Portsmouth, and Devonport, began the strikes with a 24-hour stoppage on February 3. Since then, it has been taking actions short of a strike, which include adherence to work rules and a ban on overtime.\nUnite plans to join the strike with tug masters, boatmasters, and bargemasters stopping work for 24 hours on March 6. The following day, March 7, technical managers, workshop managers, senior engineers, junior engineers, tank cleaners, and technicians will strike for 24 hours. Then on March 10, all shore grades, office, workshop and shore staff, mates, able seaman, fuel supervisors, barge operatives, and pilot boat crews will stop work for 24 hours. Unite is also banning overtime and will adhere to work rules starting on March 6. Unite also said further actions would be scheduled if the dispute is not resolved.\nSeco told UK media that it has regular engagement with both of the unions and that it was disappointed by the decision to strike. They emphasized that this is currently no change in the services provided under the Royal Navy contract.\nThe Royal Navy and the Ministry of Defence told the media that it is an internal dispute between an employer and its unions. They contend that Royal Navy operations would not be impacted.\n"

Two marine firefighting and rescue vessels were dispatched and met the tanker and escorted it into Singapore’s anchorage. One crewmember only identified as a 29-year-old Indian national was reported to be injured and removed for medical treatment.\nThe police report they boarded the vessel while it was in the anchorage. They swept the vessel to confirm no perpetrations remained aboard. The crew was accounted for and there were no other injuries reported.\n\n\nMap highlighting the location of the threeincidents on February 28and the cluster of activity at the western side of the Singapore Strait (ReCAAP)\n\nThe incident involving the 182-meter (599-foot) tanker is the latest in the Singapore Strait, which is emerging as a hotspot for armed robberies primarily against bulk carriers and oil tankers. ReCAAP ISC, the monitoring operation for maritime security in the region, later issued an alert warning of the increased number of sea robbery incidents and expressing its renewed concerns. ReCAAP revealed that there had been two other boarding also in the Phillip Channel in the eastbound late of the Singapore Strait this morning between 0030 and 0700 local time.\nReCAAP details that the fist incident took place at 0300 aboard he Greek bulkerIfestos(95,790 dwt). The vessel registered in the Bahamas was underway traveling from Mozambique to China. Nearly an hour later, the general cargo shipDSM Rose(33,540 dwt) managed by a company in Lebanon was also boarded. It was traveling from India to Vietnam. ReCAAP reports engine spares were stolen from one of the ships and nothing was reported missing from the other two involved in today's incidents.\nData by the ReCAAP shows that since the beginning of the year, there have now been a total of 21 incidents counting the three from today. The number of incidents has more than tripled versus last year when just six were reported in the first two months. Most of the crimes have been occurring in the area around the western entrance to the Strait and the Malacca Strait.\nA majority of the incidents are opportunistic crimes according to ReCAAP committed by perpetrators adopting a “hit-and-run” approach, with cases of crew injury or interaction being minimal. In January, however, a bulker was boarded also while it was underway in the Singapore Strait. There were six perpetrators and they tied up at least one crewmember. The perpetrators are mostly stealing ship stores, scrap metal, and engine spares, but ReCAAP has highlighted this year an increase in the times when the boarders are carrying guns or gun-like objects and knives.\nReCAAP has repeated raised concerns about the increase in the number of incidents and is now warning that there is a possibility of yet further incidents. For all of 2024, there were a total of 107 incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in Asia. The data shows that 58 percent of the incidents were in or around the Singapore Strait.\nCountries in the region are increasing patrols and surveillance while ReCAAP is urging vigilance and responding promptly to incidents reported by ships. They have also called for strengthening the coordination and promoting information sharing on incidents and criminal groups involved to arrest the perpetrators. Ships are also being advised to intensify vigilance and maintain a lookout while transiting these areas."

        "content": "\nA jury in Piraeus, Greece found the captain and first officer of an interisland ferry guilty in a tragic 2023 case where a late arriving passenger was pushed to his death as a ferry departed port. The court rejected claims of a spontaneous action while prosecutors argued nothing was done to save the victim and the ferry kept sailing.\nThe incident in which a 36-year-old male passenger was pushed from the car ramp on the departing ferryBlue Horizoncausednational outragein Greece after videos began circulating on social media. The stern ramp on the ferry was still down, a violation of maritime protocols, and four crewmembers were standing there as Antonis Kargiotis came running up and jumped onto the ramp. He is in a scuffle with a crewmember as the ferry begins to move. In the video, the crewmember appeared topush Kargiotiswho fell into the harbor and was caught in the wake. He drowned while the crew and horrified passengers looked on.\nFamily members argued that Kargiotis could have purchased a ticket onboard, if he did not have one or that the crewmembers could have taken him into custody and turned him over to the Coast Guard or police. Prosecutors argued that in addition to deliberately pushing the passenger, the crew stood there and made no effort to aid the person in the water.\nCharges were brought against the captain of the Blue Horizon, the first officer who was on the ramp and pushed Kargiotis, as well as the second officer and a boatswain who were also at the stern as the vessel departed. The incident took place on September 5, 2023, as the ferry departed at 2100 from Piraeus for Heraklion, Crete. The vessel continued to sail and did not return to the port for approximately 40 minutes until the port authority and coast guard demanded its return to Piraeus.\nDefense attorneys for the captain argued there was no intent to cause death while also emphasizing gaps in port security as well as the role of the coast guard and port security. In the video, a person could be seen on the dock after the passenger falls into the water. Attorneys for the first officer argued it was a spontaneous response and there was no intent to cause harm, only to deny boarding to a late arriver. The defense had sought to have the charges changed from intent and manslaughter to negligence.\nThe jury convicted the first officer of manslaughter and the court handed down a sentence of 12.5 years in prison. The captain was convicted for allowing the ferry to depart after a fatal incident and covering up the crime. The captain was sentenced to 7 years and 5 months. The court noted that the sentences were reduced because of the individuals’ previous lawful conduct.\nLawyers argued for suspended sentences pending appeal. The court denied the request and ordered the captain and first officer sent to prison while their appeals are pending.\nThe second officer and boatswain were acquitted. They had been charged with complicity in the murder with possible intent, although the video shows one of them standing at the entrance of the garage. The other appeared to also come forward as the scuffle was transpiring."

        "content": "\nTranspetro the shipping arm of Brazil’s energy major Petrobras (Petróleo Brasileiro) announced ambitious growth plans for its LPG fleet and its entry into ammonia transport at an event that also highlighted support for Brazil’s shipbuilding industry. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Vice President Geraldo Alkmin, and the Minister of Mines and Energy, Alexandre Silveira, attended to demonstrate the government’s commitment to the maritime, shipbuilding, and energy sectors.\nTwo initiatives were announced during the Brazilian Naval and Offshore Industry Business Fair with the federal government saying it will foster new opportunities in the sector. Petrobras CEO Magda Chambriard said the new initiative was in line with the gradual increase in natural gas production while predicting it would boost job creation and expand participation of Brazilian industry in the maritime and offshore sectors.\n“We will consolidate Transpetro as the largest Brazilian shipowner in gas transportation, strengthening the company in a segment that is of great importance to the Petrobras System and all of Brazil,” announced Transpetro CEO Sérgio Bacci. He said it was part of the broader plan to renew and expand Transpetro’s fleet and provide less exposure to vessel charters.\nThe effort calls for increasing the number of vessels in the gas tanker fleet from six to 14 and increasing the transport capacity from 36,000 to 108,000 cubic meters. The companies launched a tender for eight new gas carriers split into two tenders. The first is for five vessels, with three vessels with a capacity of 7,000 cubic meters and two with a capacity of 14,000 cubic meters. These gas carriers will be pressurized and intended for the transport of LPG and derivatives. The second tender is for three semi-refrigerated vessels with a capacity of 10,000 cubic meters which would be the first for the company capable of transporting ammonia.\nThe design of the vessels calls for them to be 20 percent more efficient in fuel consumption which they said would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent. They also need to be able to operate in electrified ports. Companies have 90 days to submit their bids but they can only win one of the two tenders.\nThe tender calls for the first of the vessels to be delivered within 30 months after the contract is finalized. The others should be delivered at six-month intervals.\nPetrobras highlights it is a continuation of its newbuilding program which began in July 2024. In January, the company contracted for four new handy class tankers. At the end of last year, the company also contracted for 12 new support vessels (PSV) to transport equipment to its offshore locations. Petrobras plans to also hire 20 new vessels, including 10 for emergency support and response (OSRVs), eight for inspections (RSVs), and two for platform anchoring (AHTS). Petrobras is requiring 40 percent local contact in the construction of the OSVs to ensure the participation of Brazilian companies.\nThe company also said that it plans to decommission 10 platforms by 2029. They are now exploring the reuse of these units as they said it could reduce logistics costs, strengthen the supplier base, and promote sustainable business practices.\nThe new vessels are part of a group of 25 ships that Petrobras plans to add between 2025 and 2029. They noted that 16 have already been contracted. Transpetro reports in addition to the six gas carriers, it currently has 16 crude oil tankers, five product tankers, and nine shuttle tankers, making it the largest multimodal oil, derivative and biofuel logistics company in Latin America."

It coincides with a larger effort by the Indian government to make the country into a world-class shipbuilder.\nA delegation from the South Korean shipbuilder wasreportedby The Times of India to be touring the country’s facilities and talking with different domestic shipbuilders. The newspaper links the Koreans to L&T among other companies for a possible partnership. In addition, it reports that the South Koreans are spurring competition among the Indian states to attract the possible investments as it assesses potential sites for a shipbuilding facility.\nAccording to the newspaper, the visit by the delegation from Hyundai was in response to a visit by the Indians to South Korea in December. The paper reports India’s Ports and Shipping Ministry secretary T.K. Ramachandran led a delegation to meet with the three largest South Korean shipbuilders. They expressed the government’s interest in collaboration opportunities.\nIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared plans to establish India on the international stage for shipbuilding. The government has said it will be a critical industry for the future while also citing the benefits of reducing international expenses while boosting foreign trade and increasing earnings from the international economies. India, the government declared, will rank among the top 10 shipbuilders by 2030 and the top five by 2047.\nHD Hyundai which is the largest in South Korea continues to face strong competition from the Chinese shipbuilders. The South Koreans reported strong profitability in 2024 despite rising costs and capacity limits which see order slots full till at least 2026 or beyond. Hyundai attempted foreign partnerships in the past, including in the Philippines, without success.\nThe company is mapping its long-term strategy focusing on automation and green technology orders. For its shipyard, it looks to dramatically increase productivity. The company in 2021 launched its plan for the shipyard of the future and cites its use of the latest technologies including AI and digital twins as it seeks to increase productivity and safety.\nThis week its partner in the shipyard of the future, Palantir Technologiesreleased a videoin South Korea highlighting the efforts to create an automated shipyard. Hyundai is quoted as saying it will increase productivity by 30 percent in shipbuilding while also cutting production time for new ships by 30 percent. The goal is to complete the Future of Shipyard project by 2030."

The cruise was traveling between Grand Cayman and Cozumel, Mexico on Wednesday, February 26, when the rescue took place.\nAccording to the reports, the ship was cruising when the bridge crew spotted a small boat on the horizon and decided to investigate. They had to alter course and according to the reports as they got closer the bridge crew thought it saw at least 10 people packed in a small boat that seemed to be adrift. They also thought they could see the people on the small boat bailing water.\nAs the cruise ship got closer to the boat, passengers reported seeing the people in the small boat waving a white flag. Many of the more than 2,000 passengers on the charter cruise operated by Vacaya, an LGBTQ+ travel group, lined the rails to watch the drama unfold.\nTheBrilliance of the Seascrew launched one of its launches to investigate and determined the people required immediate aid. The cruise ship’s tender rescued 11 people who were later determined to be Cubans who had been at sea for one to two days.\n\n\n\nThe cruise ship reports the individuals were dehydrated, malnourished, and exhausted. They were brought aboard and given medical attention and food while passengers offered to donate clothing and other supplies for the aid of the people who had been rescued.\nWorking with the U.S. Coast Guard and the Mexican authorities, it was determined the cruise ship would disembark the survivors on Thursday when it arrived in Mexico on its regularly scheduled port call. For many aboard, it was the first time they had witnessed a rescue. The cruise is on its way back to its homeport in New Orleans with the passengers sharing pictures and videos on social media of the rescue."

The Military Sealift Command highlights the critical nature of the mission which has been conducted annually for the past 70 years since 1955 when the resupply mission was established.\nThe cargo ship which was built in 2010 and currently operates as part of Seabulk and its new joint venture with Crowley known as Fairwater is completing its portion of the annual effort. The ship is delivering 321 pieces of cargo, consisting of containers filled with mechanical parts, vehicles, construction materials including cement pilings for a pier project, food, electronics equipment, and comfort items; supplies needed to sustain the next year of operations at McMurdo Station, Antarctica.\nShe followed her running mateOcean Giantwhich conducted the first portion of the mission.

She made a stop at Lyttelton, New Zealand, and is currently on her return trip to Hueneme, California where she is due in mid-March.\nFollowing the offload,Ocean Gladiatorwill be loaded with 149 containers of retrograde cargo for transportation off the continent. This includes trash and recyclable materials for disposal and equipment no longer required on the station, as well as the 65-ton floating Modular Causeway System, which was used this year in place of the ice-pier for cargo operations.\nBefore departing McMurdo station,Ocean Gladiatorwill also be loaded with ice core samples that will be stored on the ship in a sub-zero freezer. The ice core samples will be delivered to the United States for scientific study.\nWhile she was at the base, members of Navy Cargo Handling Battalion ONE were assisting with the offload. The teams live in barracks at McMurdo Station, or on the ships for the duration of the mission.\nFebruary is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, but weather is a constant factor in Antarctica. The continent is known for its extreme environment, particularly subzero temperatures and high winds. The MSC team headed by Marie Morriw, ship liaison to the Joint Support Forces Antarctica highlights there is a small window of just a few weeks for ODF to take place. Temperatures on the ice they report hover around freezing during the day and below zero at night. Cargo operations can move forward, despite the temperatures, but high winds can put a pause on work for hours, with the ships’ cranes unable to move cargo in winds over 25 knots.\nFollowing operations in Antarctica,Ocean Gladiatorwill travel to Japan to deliver the floating modular causeway, before sailing for Port Hueneme, California, where they will offload cargo, completing their mission."

        "content": "After saying the French Riviera did not want large cruise ships, the mayor of Nice who also represents the region agreed to reconsider and provide a compromise to the industry. Like other destinations around the world, the mayor is now proposing daily limits to reduce but not eliminate cruise ship port calls.\nMayor Christian Estrosi of Nice who is also president of the Nice Côte d'Azur Metropolis signed a decree in Januaryblocking cruise shipswith over 900 passengers or over 190 meters (690 feet) in length as of July 1. He cited the negative impacts of overtourism and challenges to the marine environment declared “I don’t want these floating hotels putting down their anchors in Nice.”\nWhile he received extensive press coverage it was quickly pointed out by many in the industry that Nice is not a major cruise ship port. It has a small dock only able to handle luxury cruise ships which the mayor was happy to have as they align with the exclusive image of the city. However, he sought to extend the ban into VIllefranche-sur-mer where large cruise ships regularly anchor. The mayor said cruise ships to go to the port of Cannes or Marseille which have the facilities to handle large ships but are more distant from the attractions.\n“We are urging a reconsideration,” a spokesperson for the cruise line trade group CLIA Europe said. The group called for a “holistic tourist management approach,” while emphasizing its estimate that the ban would stop as much as two-thirds of the 90 scheduled cruise ship calls for the summer of 2025. CLIA said it would cost $10 million in local revenues and as much as $600 million regionally.\nThe mayor of Villefranche spoke out against the bad while experts also questioned if Estrosi had the legal authority to impose his restrictions. Large cruise ships anchor 300 meters (nearly 1,000 feet) offshore in Villefranche which it was pointed out places them in federally controlled not local waters. However, it was also pointed out that the cruise ships send their tenders into the local waters to ferry passengers ashore.\nThe French news agency AFP reported today, February 28, that after consulting with local leaders Estrosi offered up a compromise. The report said he will submit a new plan on March 7 to the local council which he said would balance the interests of public health and the local economy.\nThe compromise calls for permitting cruise ships with up to 2,500 passengers to anchor in the bay and tender passengers ashore. The mega cruise ships would still be required to go to Cannes, while the smallest ships with under 450 passengers would also be permitted to call in Nice.  The compromise also limits calls to one cruise ship per day.\nThe port authority told AFP that this plan would permit about 65 of the planned 90 cruise ship calls scheduled for this summer. It noted originally that only about 20 of the ships would have had more than 2,500 passengers aboard.\nOther destinations including Key West in Florida also sought in the past few years to limit the size of cruise ships and it was successful in reducing the number of ships in port in a day. Others such as Bar Harbor in Maine stopped all large cruise ship calls while in Greece the government’s solution was a cap on the top number of people per day on the busiest Greek Islands and an increased port tax to fund port improvements."

        "content": "\nOn Saturday, Guyana mobilized its military assets after Venezuelan navy reportedly entered its territorial waters. In a live address, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali said that a Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol ship was positioned within Exxon's Stabroek Block lease area, off the Atlantic coast of Guyana. The patrol ship is said to have approached oil production facilities, including ExxonMobil’s FPSOProsperity.\nThe Venezuelan government has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that its patrol ship was operating in what it described as “disputed international waters”. In response to the incident, Guyana has summoned the Venezuelan ambassador to register a formal protest. In addition, Guyana has deployed air patrol and coast guard assets to boost surveillance of territorial waters.\n“Guyana’s maritime boundaries are recognized under international law, and this incursion is a matter of grave concern. We will remain in close contact with our partners in protecting Guyana’s interests,” said President Ali.\nUS State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs was among foreign partners to stand in solidarity with Guyana. “Venezuelan naval vessels threatening ExxonMobil’s FPSO unit is unacceptable and a clear violation of Guyana’s maritime territory. Further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,” commented the Bureau.\nGuyana and Venezuela have a long-standing territorial dispute, with the matter currently before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Guyana brought the case before the ICJ in 2018, seeking a final judgement on its internationally recognized boundary.\nVenezuela claims the oil-rich Essequibo Region, which is under the control of Guyana. The area is located on the northwestern flank of Guyana, and constitutes nearly 70 percent of the country’s national territory. On several occasions, Venezuela has issued decrees to annex the region. In January, President Maduro went further to announce that Venezuela will conduct gubernatorial elections in Essequibo. This goes against an ICJ order issued back in December 2023. The order restricts Venezuela from interfering with the governance of Essequibo until the court renders a final judgment. The decision is expected by next year.\nVenezuela intensified its ownership claims of Essequibo in 2015 after ExxonMobil revealed commercially viable oil reservoirs located offshore from the region.\nExxon is an American company, and tensions between the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the White House are elevated at present. The Trump administration announced last week that it would be ending a partial license for Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. Gulf Coast, cutting off one of the regime's few remaining sources of foreign currency."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Commerce Department has laid off as many as 880 employees from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the agency that provides weather forecasting, prepares nautical charts and administers federal fishery quotas. The cuts were primarily among probationary employees - either new hires or people who had been recently promoted to a new role - and the exact number of layoffs was not disclosed. The announcement drew protests from the scientific community, along with warnings about what cuts at NOAA will mean for maritime interests.\n\"NOAA’s data and science are used routinely by weather forecasters, mariners, farmers, emergency responders, businesses and everyday people across the country,\" said Dr. Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Everyone in the United States relies on NOAA in their daily lives whether they realize it or not, something that will come into focus for many in the weeks and months ahead.\"\nMore cuts are expected. The General Services Administration is canceling office leases for some of the spaces that NOAA uses, and the agency has frozen the credit cards that its scientists and staffers use to pay for work expenses, according to the New York Times. The administration is also expected to cancel agreements with NOAA contractors totaling another 2,500 people. Coming soon, the Office of Management and Budget has issued planning guidance to federal agencies - including NOAA - for the next round of layoffs.\n\"Breaking up, defunding, or reducing NOAA's highly integrated workforce will severely impact our nation's economy,\" five former NOAA administrators said Friday in an open letter. \"It will also make it more difficult to receive weather forecasts, be assured of the safety of seafood, and ensure the timely delivery of purchases from overseas, which are delivered primarily through our nation's ports.\"\nFormer NOAA acting administrator Timothy Gallaudet told NPR that the cuts \"are really seemingly contradicting the administration's priorities,\" since downgrading weather services and weather research will have an impact on the economy - and on national security. Many of the personnel laid off last week were early-career scientists who were conducting research on improved forecasting methods. \"It's an absolute gutting of young talent,\" one staffer told NPR.\n“This loss of talent at NOAA is going to set the agency back years and compromise the integrity of missions that directly support human health and safety, economic prosperity and national security,” a policy analyst at NOAA's National Ocean Service told the New York Times.\n\"We’re the group that has the unique combination of early career motivation/drive but also enough expertise to be quickly effective as we are promoted into new roles,” said former NOAA hurricane researcher Dr. Andrew Hazelton, who was laid off last week. “This is not the group you’d get rid of if you wanted to make an organization more efficient — it’s what you’d do if you want to destroy an organization.”\nFormer NOAA administrator Richard Spinrad said Friday that the impact could be serious for U.S. fisheries, which have a global reputation for responsible management. \"That’s a $320 billion annual industry. And it’s hard to be the best in the world in an industry like that if you can’t support the industry with things as fundamental as stock assessments, how many fish are out there,” Spinrad told the Rhode Island Current."

        "content": "American sanctions have reduced Russia's ability to ship oil on lightly-regulated \"shadow fleet\" tankers, but Moscow is maintaining its fossil fuel export revenues at about $700 million per day, in part thanks to the renewed participation of Greek tanker owners. Greek owners have emerged as crucial players in keeping Russian crude flowing to global markets, particularly to India and Turkey, according to Vortexa.\n\"Preliminary February data is showing Russian crude volumes carried by Greek operators at a 12-month high,\" said Mary Melton, a senior freight analyst at Vortexa, in a new research note. \"Russian crude exports to India and Turkey will need to be offered below the price cap so that Greek operators can facilitate these volumes.\"\nBloomberg confirms that Russian Urals crude is now trading below $60 per barrel, a deep discount to Brent - and enough of a discount to allow Western tankers to legally participate in Russian energy exports.\nThe need for a discount is clear. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 183 Russia-linked vessels in January, targeting approximately one-third of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" — a collection of aging vessels that were purchased, renamed and reflagged in order to circumvent Western shipping restrictions. Until recently, that strategy has largely worked, allowing Russia to get around the $60 per barrel \"price cap\" imposed on Russian energy shipping by the G7 nations. Russian energy revenue has been stable since 2023, despite sanctions.\nCourtesy CREA\nAccording to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), Russia's seaborne crude oil revenues surged by 13 percent in January compared to December, reaching $240 million daily. This suggests that Russia found ways to command higher prices despite the sanctions regime, according to the center's researchers. China is the country's largest buyer, and Russia has put particular emphasis on ensuring the continued flow of premium ESPO grade crude from the Russian Far East to China.\nShadow fleet tankers transported 84 percent of the total volume of Russian seaborne crude oil in January, according to CREA, but in February, above-board Greek operators had an increasing share. \"These Greek-operated vessels have migrated out of mostly Atlantic Basin trade, especially in the Mediterranean,\" Vortexa's Melton noted. \"This could lead to significant tightening in Atlantic Basin Aframax supply, and higher earnings for vessel operators in those regions.\""

        "content": "\nEthiopia and Somalia are on a path for renewed cooperation after the two sides agreed to end the Somaliland port dispute. Last week, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed toured Mogadishu and held talks with Somalian President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Top on the agenda of the meeting was Horn of Africa security as well as the start of technical negotiations for Ethiopia’s port access, as agreed on in Ankara last December.\nWith Turkey acting as the mediator, Ethiopia and Somalia agreed to reach a “mutually beneficial commercial arrangement, which ensured Ethiopia gains access to the sea under Somalia’s sovereignty. In an interview with local media last week, Somali foreign affairs minister Ali Mohammed Omar said that talks are ongoing, and he suggested that the aim is to reach a framework agreement by June.\n“That framework will determine which type of port to offer, the exact area in the Indian Ocean and the overall cost of it,” said the minister.\nThis is remarkable progress in finding a long-term solution to Ethiopia’s ambitions for port access. Under the previous deal, Addis Ababa was planning to lease a 12-mile section of Berbera's coastline in the self-governing breakaway region of Somaliland, without Mogadishu's permission. Unfortunately, the decision stoked tension in the already-restive Horn of Africa region.\nEthiopia became landlocked in 1993 after Eritrea gained independence, marking the end of a three-decade war between the two countries. Currently, Ethiopia utilizes Djibouti's ports, through a network of roads and the 752-kilometer Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway.\nHowever, as one of the largest economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia is pushing to build its own port on the Indian Ocean. The port could also serve as a base for the Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Services Enterprise (ESLSE), one of the largest African ocean carriers.\nCurrently, ESLSE has a fleet of ten bulk carriers but has announced plans to add an extra six, as Ethiopia’s import and export needs grow. According to a 2023/2024 performance report, ESLSE handles around 45 percent of Ethiopia’s dry cargo imported through Djiboutian ports."

        "content": "\nAs international interest in the Polar regions mount, China and Russian cooperation in the Antarctica has achieved a new milestone. The two countries have begun joint Antarctic drilling, crucial in collecting data to understand the changing Earth’s climate system. This week, a Sino-Russian scientific team carried out a successful geophysical survey on an existing borehole in the Larsemann Hills region of East Antarctica. The well had been drilled into a 545-meter thick glacier during the Chinese 40th Antarctic expedition, from November 2023 to April 2024.\nIn this 41st expedition, involving some Russian scientists, the study involved measuring key parameters of the well. These include the borehole temperature, inclination and changes in borehole diameter. The researchers also collected ice core and bedrock samples. The current expedition begun in last November and ends in May.\nSince last year, China and Russia have held talks over joint drilling in Antarctica. In September, Beijing and Changchun city hosted international conferences on Antarctic exploration, which were attended by Russian specialists from the Federal Agency for Mineral Resources (Rosnedra). With the successful geophysical survey this year, the cooperation is likely to extend to other sites in East Antarctica.\nDuring the conferences, a proposal was made for a Russian-Chinese project to drill the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains in East Antarctica. The scientific results to be obtained from the drilling could be one of the most advanced of our time, said Rosnedra. Through its Kunlun station, China has been carrying out studies near Gamburtsev. The mountain range occurs beneath Dome A, the highest plateau in Antarctica, with an elevation of 4100 meters. In 2012, China drilled the first pilot well in this region. However, further work is needed to get to the bedrock of the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains.\nDeep ice-core drilling in the Gamburtsev region remains one of the primary goals of modern polar research. Ice-core studies provide an excellent method for investigating past variations of global climate and forecasting the future.\nChinese and Russian cooperation in the Antarctic has taken various dimensions, with Antarctic drilling now presenting another important avenue. However, the two countries are seen as disruptors to the existing Antarctic governance system. Both seek to impose new views on resource exploitation in Antarctica. China and Russia have consistently opposed plans to expand marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Southern Ocean, which would mean reduced areas available for krill fishing."

        "content": "\nChina is moving ahead with plans to build a deep-sea manned laboratory - a stationary submarine with a crew of six and a maximum working depth of 2,000 meters.\nThe proposal has been in the works for years: it received an endorsement from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017 and made its way into the 14th Five-Year Plan in 2021. On Friday, the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology in Guangzhou kicked off a five-year program to start construction on the 600-ton deep sea submersible.\nThe manned subsea lab is designed for the study of cold seeps, areas of the seabed where oil and gas leak out naturally into the water column. Most oceanographic research programs are limited in duration by necessity, as existing research submersibles have short loiter times at the bottom. The subsea lab concept would allow scientists days or weeks to monitor the ecosystem with ROVs, \"manned mobile observation platforms,\" and other high-end devices for subsea exploration. Resident scientists will be able to stay submerged for 30 days at a time before resurfacing.\nAccording to Global Times, the technology developed during the subsea lab project could have secondary applications in deep-sea mining, O&G exploration, and \"rights protection\" of China's ambitious maritime sovereignty claims in the South China Sea. Specific areas of technological focus include fabrication of large, high-pressure titanium alloy components, as well as depth-rated hatches for docking submersibles at 2,000 meters. The latter could have applications for submarine rescues.\nIllustrations of the submersible suggest a design with five joined spherical pressure hulls - much like Russia's highly secretive Losharik, a deep-diving spy sub designed to tap subsea cables. All going to plan, the submersible should be ready to begin sea trials in 2030."

They recovered some personal effects and two oars from the vessel.\n\n\n\nDefense Australia reports the rower is fatigued after his ordeal. He is undergoing a medical assessment while the HMASChoulesis bringing him to Sydney, Australia.\nAssociated Press in Australia acknowledges only three people who have successfully made the solo journey across the Pacific. The first was a British citizen in 1983, followed by another in 2015. An Australian became the first woman in 2023 to complete the solo trip, but a 24-year-old Australian had to be rescued in 2023 by a passing cruise ship after his boat capsized off Vanuatu. He however did not qualify as he had made a stop-off in the Cook Islands after setting out from Peru in 2022.\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority emphasized the strong coordination with Defense Australia and the Royal Australian Navy in making today’s rescue possible."

The minister assured that government policy had not changed saying that Norway and the U.S. “maintain a close and strong defense cooperation.”\nNorwegian fuel supplier Haltbakk Bunkers, which describes itself as the largest operator of tankers along the Norwegian coast, posted a statement on social media calling for the boycott after Friday’s meeting between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The company said it had decided to immediately stop as a fuel supplier to U.S. forces in Norway and their ships calling in Norwegian ports. “No fuel for Americans!,” the company wrote online.\nThe CEO of the company, Gunnar Gran, admitted to the Norwegian newspaper VG it was a “symbolic measure,” as the company does not have a contract with the U.S. forces. He told VG last year they delivered approximately 3 million liters of fuel to the American warships. In 2023, the company had bunkered the aircraft carrier Gerald Ford during its first visit to Norway.\nThe company highlighted its support for Ukraine while condemning the confrontation in Washington D.C. It was similar to the statements of support for Ukraine coming from world leaders and other businesses in Europe.\n“We have seen reports raising concerns about support for US Navy vessels in Norway. This is not in line with the Norwegian government’s policy,” Defense Minister Tore Sandvik said in a written statement. “I can confirm that all requested support has been provided... American forces will continue to receive the supply and support they require from Norway.”\nThe company without comment later deleted the posting from its social media.\nNorway, the U.S., and European countries regularly cooperate and jointly deploy on military missions. U.S. warships make frequent Norwegian port calls, often as part of NATO exercises. Today the UK’s Royal Navy also highlighted that its forces are training with the frigate HNoMSOtto Sverdrupand the tanker HNoMSMaudto help both navies integrate before they work together during the maiden deployment of Britain’s flagship HMSPrince of Wales.

        "content": "\nA study carried out by Polish GNSS researchers has determined that the GPS interference observed in the Baltic recently exhibits capabilities beyond commercial grade, and it appears to emanate from ships in transit - not from a fixed land-based source in Kaliningrad, as some analysts have speculated. If accurate, the apparent discovery of powerful ship-mounted transmitters would help explain the shifting pattern of GPS disruption in the region. It would also align withpast reportsof high-power radio equipment fitted aboard vessels in the Russian \"shadow fleet.\"\nThe study monitored GPS disruption at ground level with a sensor installed at Gdynia Maritime University, 75 miles east of central Kaliningrad. It was mounted high enough for a line-of-sight radio horizon of about 20 nautical miles offshore (depending on transmitter antenna height). This is enough to reach out into the Gulf of Gdansk, but not far enough to cover the main east-west sea lanes of the central Baltic, where the vast majority of the region's traffic occurs.\nOver a period of six months beginning in June 2024, the sensor picked up 84 hours of GNSS interference, including 29 hours in October alone. Events lasted for up to seven hours at a time, and caused horizontal positioning errors of up to 100 feet - enough to affect navigation in confined waterways.\nMulti-constellation jamming (GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo) was observed through September 2024; the pattern changed to multi-tone interference from October onwards. This interference \"likely originated from a mobile maritime source, given its periodic occurrence and movement patterns,\" the researchers wrote.\nThe ground-level disruption affects maritime interests, and did not correlate with observations of ADS-B aircraft navigational system disruption at higher altitude. Since the ground-level GNSS events aren't detected by airborne ADS-B monitoring, the team called for setting up a terrestrial sensor network for GNSS disruption with geolocation capabilities, which would be used to spot the offending vessels and identify them for possible enforcement action.\n\"The interference . . . exhibited noticeable fluctuations in power levels, suggesting that the jamming source was in motion. Given the system's radio horizon, which primarily covers a portion of the Baltic Sea, and assuming that the interference source was not located within Poland’s borders, the most plausible explanation is that the jamming originated from a vessel in international waters,\" the researchers concluded."

The plea was entered on November 5th at a federal court in Chicago.\nIn mid-2021, Pang began communicating with an unnamed person in Colombia about a plan to carry out a jihadist attack in the United States. The motive for the conspiracy was to avenge the death of Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian paramilitary leader who was assassinated by U.S. forces in 2020. Soleimani led Iran's IRGC Quds Force, the organization responsible for Iran's covert operations and proxy forces.\nU.S. investigators inserted themselves into this conspiracy and got Pang to meet with undercover agents who posed as Quds Force affiliates. In the fall of 2022, undercover agents met up with Pang in Chicago and in Lake Bluff, a suburb next to Naval Station Great Lakes. As the \"conspirators\" developed their plan to attack the naval station, Pang provided them with material assistance, according to the Justice Department: he admitted that he gave them photos and videos of key locations inside the base, as well as two military uniforms and a cell phone to be used to test a detonator.\nPang has been held without bail and will soon be sentenced. The maximum penalty for his offense is up to 20 years in prison.\nThe Naval Criminal Investigative Service worked with the FBI's Chicago counterterrorism task force to pursue the case, and called it \"a shining example of outstanding proactive investigative work\" with multiple agency partners."

The Krivak-classAdmiral Grigorovich(F745) appears to be lying just offshore, in Syrian territorial waters, providing protective cover and poised to escort theSparta IVon its homeward journey. At the other end of the Mediterranean, the Gorshkov-classAdmiral Golovko(F461) looks as if it may have been escorting theBaltic Leader,another Russian cargo ship last seen in Tartus in early February, as it made its way back eastwards across the Mediterranean. In between times, the Ropucha-class landing shipAlexandre Shabalin(L110) has also been loading in Tartus, a more obviously naval vessel. On March 2,Admiral Grigorovich, Alexandre Shabalin, Sparta IVand two other Russian cargo ships, theSyanie SeveraandAsacalon, were noted by naval open source specialist MT Anderson leaving Tartus as a convoy.\nThese ship movements indicate that the Russians have business-like dealings with the new Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) government in Syria, who have also provided effective protection to allow the evacuation to continue without interdiction or hindrance. But the fact that heavy equipment is being withdrawn clearly implies that if the Russians manage to retain a foothold in Syria, it will be a smaller presence and will have a restricted role when compared with the operational freedom that the Russians had enjoyed since Soviet days.\nRussian negotiations with the HTS government continue over a future presence. But as the talks continue, the political environment is changing. Given the recent global political upheavals, it should no longer be assumed that the United States is opposed to a continued Russian presence – as the Biden administration unambiguously was.\nIsrael has no wish to see an Iranian-dominated Syria, part of a Shi’a crescent of influence stretching from Iran, across Iraq and Syria, into Lebanon, replaced by Islamist influence supported from a dominant Turkey to the north. A continued Russian presence could act as a restraint on Turkey, as could a continued US presence in Syria. Israel’s interests are better served by a weak but stable Syria; hence its move into Syrian areas of the Golan Heights and its stated intention to support the Syrian Druze minority in areas south of Damascus, which have been threatened by HTS-aligned forces in recent weeks.\nIsrael also has an interest in preserving moderately-inclined Kurdish political autonomy in North East Syria and also in Iraq, as a counter-weight to both Sunni and Shi’a extremists and factional fighting, but also as a bulwark against increased Turkish influence.\nThe Russians have continued to maintain a naval presence in the Mediterranean, headed by its Kilo-class submarineKrasnodar(B265). Without its base facility in Tartus, it instead has used port calls in Algeria and Libya as a means of resting crews and replenishing ships, and its oiler auxiliaries have even still been permitted to top up in Tartus. It will be a while before such port calls overtax those hosting the Russians – by which time the Russians may have arrived at a new slimmed-down basing deal with the new Syrian government."

A year after declaring offshore zones and selecting the first potential projects, the government granted two more feasibility licenses to proceed with the planning for wind farms in the Southern Ocean and the other for the Pacific Ocean.\nOnly in the past few years did Australia pass its first framework legislation to establish the process for developing offshore wind energy sites. The government selected areas and began accepting project applications in the multi-step planning process.\nProjects back industry majors were the latest to be moved from provisional licenses to full feasibility licenses. One project, Novocastrain Wind is owned by Equinor and Oceanex Energy. It calls for up to 2.1 GW of installed capacity off the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The other is Spinifex being co-developed by Parkwind, which is part of JERA, and Alinta Energy. It proposes 1.2 GW which would be equivalent to 10 percent of Victoria’s electricity needs.\nEach of the projects received licenses that grant the rights to explore the proposed projects, seek environmental approvals, and prepare a management plan. The management plan needs to be approved before they can begin feasibility activities and must address how the project will interact with shipping and fisheries.\nWith the approvals, the projects can undertake research and marine studies. This may include the use of lidar buoys to assess wind and other ocean conditions. They can also proceed with detailed environmental assessments and engage with the business community to develop the supply chain. The feasibility licenses provide for up to seven years. The companies then would submit construction plans for approval.\nThe companies hailed these steps are important milestones in the development of offshore wind energy for Australia. Each has been undertaking preliminary work. They highlighted the need for more work but said it would support moving forward with the investments to develop these projects.\nRWE was granted one of the first feasibility licenses from the Australian Government in July 2024 for the development of an offshore wind farm. To be located in the Bass Strait, off the Gippsland coast in Victoria, it is expected this could become Australia’s first project. The area was Australia’s first designated offshore wind zone. RWE said it would use the feasibility process to apply for a commercial license to build and operate the wind farm for up to 40 years anticipating it could be commissioned in the 2030s with up to 2 GW of capacity."

        "content": "Finnish authorities confirmed in a statement on Sunday, March 2, that they have released the product tankerEagle Sthat it has been detaining since a December 25 incident with damage to undersea transmission cables. They determined that the seizure could be canceled in part after the cable companies withdrew their request and the detention from the Port State inspection was lifted. They also said they were releasing the cargo but continue to hold three crewmembers in the ongoing investigation.\n“As the criminal investigation conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation, including the forensic investigation on boardEagle S, has progressed, there are no longer grounds for continuing the seizure of the tanker. Therefore, the seizure was canceled on Friday, February 28, 2025. As far as the criminal investigation is concerned, the tanker is not prevented from continuing its passage to leave Finland's territorial waters,” the Helsinki police said in a statement.\nThe Border Guard vesselTurvaescorted theEagle Sout of Finnish waters on March 2. The vessel’s AIS signal shows it underway on Monday at nearly 11 knots. It is declaring Port Said, Egypt as its next port call.\nFinnish authorities detained the vessel hours after Estonian electric transmission company Elering and Finnish electricity system operator Fingrid reported on December 25 an interruption in their EstLink 2 power connection. The vessel was ordered into Finnish waters and then on January 2 a Port State inspection found 32 deficiencies ranging from inoperative fire equipment and a radar as well structural conditions not as required in cargo areas. That detention order remained in place for 53 days.\n“Our inspectors have visited on board the ship and concluded that the deficiencies that led to the detention of the ship and the other deficiencies detected during port state control have been rectified,” said Sanna Sonninen, Maritime Director at Traficom. “Therefore, Traficom has releasedEagle S. Cooperation with the ship’s flag state (Cook Islands), crew, and classification society has been excellent.”\nThe Helsinki Police continue to work with the National Bureau of Investigation. They said there would be further interviews with the crew and examination of the material gathered on the grounds of criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communication. The vessel’s anchor was retrieved from the seafloor on January 6. The goal is to conclude the criminal investigation by the end of April.\nBased on the criminal investigation, eight crewmembers are reported to be suspects. However, the travel ban was also rescinded for five individuals with three required to remain in Finland.\nInvestigators are also reporting that they tested the unleaded gasoline and diesel cargo aboard the vessel. They have determined it can be transferred from the European Union. The detention of the cargo was permitted to lapse.\nElering and Fingrid said in a separate announcement that they withdrew their motion to detain the tanker for compensation for the damages. According to Kalle Kilk, chairman of the management board of Elering, the costs of the detention are unreasonable. He said it would have cost the company hundreds of thousands of Euros per month plus a one million Euro deposit. He said the costs could exceed the value of the ship and noted it would be difficult to sell the ship while the legal dispute was ongoing. The company said they plan to sue the ship’s owners for the repair costs while reporting a Finnish law firm assessed the trial could last up to five to six years.\nThe Finnish authorities have asserted their actions prevented additional damage to the cables while pointing to sabotage. Other cases however have shown possible unintentional damage. Sweden detained and released another ship after saying it was convinced that the incident was an accident. They however reported last week that they were investigating another incident of cable damage reported by a Finnish company for its cable off Sweden’s Gotland.\nThe December incident led to increased patrols by the Baltic countries. They also pressured NATO which has agreed to add resources for monitoring while the UK launched its own tracking tool using AI and other advanced technologies for vessels.\n"

        "content": "CMA CGM Group is moving forward with the project itannouncedin December 2024 to develop and operate fully electric container barges on inland routes in Vietnam. The group placed an order for the first barge to be built by China’s Shandong Xinneng Shipbuilding.\nThe group called the order an important step to promote green inland river operations in the Asian market. The first barge was co-designed by CMA CGM’s New Build and R&D teams in partnership with China’s CATL for the battery technology. They are also working with China’s Jining Energy Group for the energy system which will include a solar-powered recharging facility to be located at the Gemalink terminal in Cai Mep, Vietnam.\nThe plan calls for an 80-meter (262-foot) barge. It will have a capacity of approximately 180 TEU. It is designed to sail entirely on battery power between Bihn Duong Province inland in Vietnam and the Gemalink terminal, a route of approximately 180 kilometers (112 miles). Annually they project the barge will transport more than 50,000 TEU annually. The operation is projected to start in 2026 and Nike has previously announced it would be using the barge to transport its products made in Vietnam.\nShandong Xinneng Shipbuilding was developed starting in May 2022 as China’s first domestic inland new energy shipbuilder. With this order, the yard has an orderbook of 165 ships. They highlight a capacity to annually build 400 inland ships in the size range of 1,000 to 5,000 tons. The company started construction in October 2022 and trial production in October 2023.\nVietnam is seen as a fast-growing market as the country develops its manufacturing capabilities. CMA CGM highlights that it has been in Vietnam since 1989 and currently operates 29 weekly mainline services from seven ports in Vietnam. The group says the new inland solution is part of its long-term commitment and decarbonization ambitions, along with Vietnam’s goal of being carbon net zero by 2050. The goal of the electric barge operation is to also create a model that can be replicated in other markets."

        "content": "\nA damaged and failing bridge briefly shut down inland shipping on the Elbe at Dresden last weekend, the second time in five months that barge traffic has been halted by the risk of falling concrete and steel.\nOn September 11, 2024, at about 0300 hours in the morning, two spans of the Carola Bridge collapsed. A light-rail train had just gone by, but it was past and clear of the span, and no one was injured in the collapse. The bridge was one of four main crossings of the Elbe in downtown Dresden, and the loss of the span has been disruptive for businesses - and for shipping interests, which use the Elbe to access upriver regions as far as the Czech Republic (when water levels allow).\nThe bridge was built under Communist rule in 1967-71. It had been inspected properly and passed all routine exams, according to Simone Pruefer, the head of the city's engineering office. \"We were all very surprised,\" she told German media.\nA post-accident study by the Institute of Concrete Structures at TU Dresden determined that the collapse was caused by hydrogen-induced stress corrosion of the bridge's steel components. This form of corrosion is nearly impossible to detect with conventional methods, the study concluded, as it affects steel elements that are hidden from view.\nThe waterway was shut for four months for demolition and removal, a task made more challenging by the discovery of WWII-era bombs at the demolition site (common for Dresden, which was bombed heavily by Allied forces). Later testing revealed that the cause was hydrogen-induced stress corrosion.\nThe surviving bridge spans have similar corrosion problems, and the surviving bridge spans will have to be completely demolished and rebuilt. To ensure safety of navigation in the interim, the city has installed acoustic monitoring systems.\nLast week, another prestressed steel component broke in the still-standing section of the bridge, prompting another temporary navigation shutdown. Every time the temperature fluctuates, it exerts stress on the surviving steel cables and raises the risk of another critical failure, bridge engineer Steffen Marx of TU Dresden told local media. The city has hired a contractor to complete the demolition of the rest of the bridge on an expedited basis, in hopes of finishing the job by the end of 2025.\nFor now, ships are free to pass through during a limited two-hour slot from 0900 through 1100 hours each day. They must pre-register, and only necessary crew may be on board during the transit."

        "content": "China continues to grow its influence over South America with China Merchants reporting an agreement to buy Brazil’s only privately operated VLCC terminal. The company reports the deal is part of its continued growth in the Latin America region and further consolidates its position globally.\nChina Merchants Port Holdings Co. reported on February 28 that it completed an agreement calling for it to acquire 70 percent of Vast Infraestrutura, operator of the onshore crude oil transshipment terminal in the Port of Açu. It is an industrial deep-water port that is within 24-hour sailing distance of Brazil’s major offshore production fields. It is the only terminal capable of handling Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) that is not operated by Petrobras.\nThe deal calls for an initial payment of approximately $448 million but not to exceed $714 million based on adjustments for cash and other considerations. There are also milestone payments of $56 million contingent on operating licenses being received by the end of 2026 and 2027 and potential earn-out payments of approximately $160 million based on the five-year performance to the end of 2029.\nChina Merchants reports it has been actively exploring new growth drivers for its existing ports business. This deal coupled with the 2017 acquisition of TCP Participaçoes, the Brazilian container terminal operator, will enhance China Merchant’s regional strategy.\nU.S.-based EIG Global Energy Partners is the primary investor in the parent company of Vast which started the terminal a decade ago in 2015. The terminal started with large agreements with Shell and other energy majors.\nThe newly acquired terminal handles approximately 30 percent of Brazil’s crude oil exports which are shipped through the facilities located north of Rio de Janeiro. The terminal averages 560,000 barrels per day. It currently has a licensed capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day. Vast highlights the strategic location of the terminal as well as its three berths allowing predictable operations with low downtime and a dedicated fleet of tugs to handle the tankers. In 2023, Vast reported a net profit before taxes of approximately $43 million.\nChina’s expansion in the Latin America region has drawn a lot of attention including from Donald Trump who targeted the involvement in Panama and the ports at the Panama Canal. Last month China celebrated the opening of the megaport project in Chancay, Peru. Analysts see it both as an effort to exert influence over South America well as to reshape global trade routes.\nUnder pressure from the United States, Panama reported that it would not renew its participation in China Belt & Road initiative. The country’s attorney general also filed with the courts to declare the port operations contract with China’s Hutchison unconstitutional."

        "content": "China’s CK Hutchison announced that it has an agreement in principle to sell its international ports portfolio including the controversial terminals in Panama to a consortium being led by famed U.S. investment group BlackRock in partnership with Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), MSC Group’s terminal operator. The deal valued at $22.8 billion (enterprise value) is for 80 percent ownership of CK Hutchison’s portfolio of 43 global ports and in a parallel agreement for 90 percent ownership of Panama Ports Company, which operates the terminals in Balboa and Cristobal, Panama.\nThe companies emphasized that it is a preliminary agreement after a bidding process run by CK Hutchison, but they have entered into exclusive negotiations and a non-disclosure arrangement. The BlackRock-TiL Consortium is conducting confirmatory due diligence with the companies targeting signing the definitive agreements on or before April 2.\nThe sale could be seen as a victory for Donald Trump who repeatedly asserted that “China is running the Panama Canal.” Panama had responded by saying it was reviewing the contracts with Hutchison and the country’s Attorney General recently filed a brief in a court case calling the contract extension granted to Hutchison in 2021 “unconstitutional.”\nThis transaction is “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news report concerning the Panama Ports,” asserted CK Hutchison Co-Managing Director Frank Sixt commenting on the transaction.\nThe portion of the agreements for the Panama terminals will require confirmation by the Government of Panama of the proposed terms. The Wall Street Journal reports that BlackRock has briefed the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress on the planned acquisition.\n“This transaction is the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received,” highlighted Sixt. He called the valuation compelling and said the deal was in the best interest of the company’s shareholders. It includes 43 ports with a total of 199 berths in 23 countries.\nCK Hutchison expects to receive cash proceeds in excess of $19 billion from the transactions after minority interest and the repayment of loans. The company emphasized the agreements do not include any interest in the HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, South China, and other ports in China.\nThe Wall Street Journal is reporting the deal would be the largest-ever infrastructure acquisition for BlackRock. It is being structured between BlackRock and the recently acquired Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which became part of the company last year. GIP focuses on energy, transportation, and waste and water infrastructure including acquisitions in 2024 in the U.S. offshore wind energy sector.\nMSC has been moving aggressively to expand all parts of its business, including the terminal operations. It recently completed a deal with the City of Hamburg to acquire 49 percent of the terminal operations in Hamburg in addition to deals last year for terminals in key global markets.\nCommenting on today’s announcement, Diego Aponte who is Chairman of TiL and President of the MSC Group said, “We are very focused on this industry, and we know that the investment in Hutchison Ports will be a very viable investment commercially.”\nThe sale would likely reduce pressure on Panama. Hutchison’s involvement with Panama dates to 1997 and the time of the handover of the canal under the treaty with the United States. The company operates terminals at each end of the Panama Canal, in Balboa and Cristobal, and currently holds a concession that was extended until 2047."

It was the latest in a series of movements that have become so frequent The Times (London) reports it has been nicknamed “the Syrian Express.”\nThe Royal Navy reports that the Russian corvetteBoikiywas first detected moving south from the Baltic and HMSSomerset, a Type 23 frigate based in Portsmouth, was dispatched to track the movements of the warship. The UK regularly tracks the movement of Russian warships in the Channel with Commander Joel Roberts of the frigate commenting, “Somersetis well versed in the escort of Russian ships, having conducted these operations on a number of occasions.”\nThis time it triggered a multi-day operation that included Somerset as well as coordination with UK patrol aircraft and NATO forces. TheSomersetdeployed her Merlin helicopter to gather additional information and the Belgian minehunter BNSCrocusalso joined in the tracking.\n\n\nSomerset trailing the Russian corvette Boikiy\n\nBoikiyrendezvoused with the cargo shipBaltic Leaderwhich was believed to be coming from the Tartus base in Syria.

At the beginning of this year, the Portuguese reported tracking the vessel as it was inbound for the Mediterranean on another apparent voyage on the “Syrian Express.”\nForSomerset, this was the second time this year it was activated to track Russian ships. In January, the Royal Navy reports Somerset along with the patrol ship HMSTynetracked the suspected Russian spy shipYantar. Two weeks ago, HMSIron Duke, HMSTyne, and RFA Tideforce monitored five Russian ships.

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Despite significant resources and financial investments, the European Court of Auditors found in a new report that ships continue to pollute EU maritime waters with shortcomings in the tracking and enforcement. The auditors are calling for further steps and possible enhancements in the environmental action program to meet the EU’s zero pollution ambition.\nThe audit focused on ship-sourced pollution and the more than a decade of regulations from the EU. It examined EU actions between January 2014 and September 2024. They report that €216 million in funding was provided between 2014 and 2023 focusing on elements such as port waste reception facilities, collection of fishing nets, and research. While it concluded the EU’s efforts were well-designed and continue to improve, it said implementation had weakened and that the efforts of the 22 member states “is far from satisfactory.”\n“Pollution at sea caused by ships remains a major problem, and despite a number of improvements in recent years, EU action is not really able to steer us out of troubled waters,” said Nikolaos Milionis, the ECA Member responsible for the audit. “In fact, with over three-quarters of European seas estimated to have a pollution problem, the zero-pollution ambition to protect people’s health, biodiversity, and fish stocks is still not within sight.”\nThe auditors found that EU countries underuse the tools provided for them such as those from the European Maritime Safety Agency. As an example, they cited in 2022-2023 that the European Satellite Oil Monitoring Service identified a total of 7,731 possible spills in the EU. Yet, they found that member states failed to act and only confirmed seven percent of the cases.\nThey also said that member states do not carry out enough preventative inspections of ships. They reported that states failed to meet their mandatory target rates for inspections and that the penalties for polluters also remain low.\n“Actions to prevent, tackle, track, and penalize various types of ship-source pollution are not up to the task,” the auditors warned. They concluded that neither the European Commission nor the member states fully track the EU money used to combat seawater pollution. As a result of the lapses in the efforts, the auditor said “the actual amount of oil spills, contaminants, and marine litter from ships remains largely unknown, as does the identity of polluters.”\nAmong the specific shortcomings in the regulations, they pointed to the recycling obligations for end-of-life vessels. They highlight that one in every seven ships in the world was flying an EU flag in 2022, but the figure for end-of-life ships was 50 percent lower as owners continue to circumvent recycling regulations by adopting non-EU flags before disposing of these ships. The European Commission at the end of February alsocited this issuesaying it would be enhancing its efforts to enforce the rules and adapt as the Hong Kong Convention comes into force this year.\nThe audit is also critical of the handing of containers lost overboard. “EU rules on containers lost at sea are far from watertight,” the audit says. It highlights that there is no guarantee of reporting and that few containers are recovered.\nThe recommendations call for improving the monitoring and effectiveness of pollution alert tools as well as monitoring member states to confirm they are performing mandatory checks. They said that enhancing monitoring and reporting would be a key step along with better tracking of EU-funded projects.\nThese findings they suggest should be used to possibly enhance legislation and the previous eighth environmental action plan which was released in 2022. The ambition is for zero pollution of the EU’s waters by 2030.\nThecomplete reportis available for download online.\n"

The company previously showed off the vessel for the first time in Dubai during the UN’s COP 28 in November 2023 and now seeks to highlight ammonia’s potential as the IMO works to set its net-zero policies.\nThe Singapore-flagged vesselGreen Pioneer(3,100 dwt) arrived in the UK on March 1 from Singapore with the company and UK government highlighting it would demonstrate the viability of ammonia as a sustainable marine fuel. Also after being certified in Singapore in the spring of 2024, the vessel will undergo inspections by the UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency.\n“The MCA will conduct thorough inspections and checks to ensure the vessel’s safety and operational readiness for its onward journey,” said Lars Lippuner,  MCA Director of UK Customer Services. “It has been a pleasure working in collaboration with Fortescue to bring this innovative vessel to Europe, and we are excited that the shift to a more sustainable marine fuel and a world’s first is being showcased here in the UK.”\nFortescue acquired an offshore supply vessel,MMA Leveque, early in 2022 from Australia-based MMA Offshore. Built in 2010 in Indonesia, the vessel was originally outfitted with four diesel-electric Cummins main engines. Two of the four engines were converted to be able to use ammonia or diesel for the demonstrations. The first-ever ammonia bunkering took place in March 2024 in Singapore and then a second in May as it completed testing.\nFortescue Executive Chairman and Founder, Dr. Andrew Forrest, said they brought the vessel to the UK to deliver the simple message and highlight the critical message to embrace real zero fuel standards. He called it an opportunity that cannot be missed urging the IMO to fast-track shipping’s move away from dirty bunker fuels.\nThe UK’s Maritime Minister Mike Kane called the vessel the type of innovation that will drive decarbonization forward. He highlighted the government’s support and efforts to achieve net-zero goals.\nTo supportFortescue Green Pioneer’s time in the UK, the vessel and team are reported to have been working closely with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to ensure full compliance with UK regulatory requirements. Port State Control inspections were scheduled for Southampton after the vessel’s arrival. It will then travel to West India Dock in London to showcase its technology and capabilities to key maritime stakeholders, partners, and the public.\nThe MCA notes that it is currently working with other member states at the IMO to further develop the interim guidelines on the use of ammonia as a fuel. The IMO still must review and finalize standards and then move for adoption. It is seen as a critical step as engine manufacturers move into their final stages of testing for ammonia engines and expect to be ready for commercial deliveries in the near future."

        "content": "\nChina State Shipbuilding Corporation is reporting a giant new order for containerships valued at between $2.5 and $2.6 billion. While CSSC did not identify the customer, industry insiders widely believe it is from France’s CMA CGM Group following through on its earlier commitments and disregarding the U.S.’s threat to impose fees for Chinese-built ships.\nThe order is going to China’s Jiangnan Shipyard and calls for a dozen large 18,000 TEU containerships. The vessels will be fueled by LNG and incorporate the latest energy-saving technologies according to the filing from CSSC. The ships are due for delivery in 2028 and 2029.\nCSSC highlights that this large agreement comes from a company that “has been a long-term partner.” The Chinese shipbuilder said it would be deepening its relationship with the customer. CMA CGM and Chairman Rodolphe Saadé participated in a 2023 trade mission between France and the EU to China. The group signed acommitment for ordersvalued at $3.1 billion, which was called the largest order for the Chinese state shipbuilder.\nCMA CGM highlighted in the past that it has a long-standing relationship with the Chinese shipbuilding industry. The group said in 2023 that it had ordered more than 70 containerships to be built in China. The yards built the Jacques Saadé class which were the first large LNG-fueled containership ships and a new generation of 18,000 TEU vessels.\nCMA CGM highlights that it currently has a fleet of over 650 vessels and carried over 23 million TEU in 2024. Alphaliner calculates the group has an additional 94 containerships on order with a combined capacity of approximately 1.5 million TEU while the group has a current capacity of approximately 3.9 million TEU.\nConfirmation of this new order comes just days after the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office made follow-up recommendations on specific steps to take to stemChina’s unfair policiesdesigned to increase its domination in shipbuilding. In the last days of the Biden administration, the office found that China had policies that were subsidizing the industry against foreign competition.\nThe Trump administration hasproposed a series of feesthat would add to the operating costs of foreign companies that employ Chinese-built ships. Under the proposed actions, each U.S. port call for each vessel built in China, but operated by non-Chinese interests, could result in a fee of up to $1 million, depending on the proportion of Chinese-built ships in that operator's fleet. It also proposed an additional $1 million for each port call for operators who have newbuilds on order in China.\nThe Trade Office outlined several alternatives which are being reviewed by the White House on how to structure the fees on Chinese vessels. Most observers believe the Trump administration will proceed as it today, March 4, also moved forward with an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, doubling the base rate, while some categories already had tariffs ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent or even 100 percent on Chinese EVs.\nCSSC however highlighted the shipbuilding contract as a major export order. They noted the deal is denominated in U.S. dollars, while other recent deals were switched to the Chinese currency."

        "content": "The issue of false flags continues to grow and promises to take center stage in an upcoming meeting of the IMO Legal Committee scheduled for the last week of April. Citing the dangers and the required steps, France and the Netherlands submitted proposals which are drawing attention as they highlighted two previously unheard-of registries.\nFrance’s note to the IMO Secretariat calls out the “Maritime Administration of Matthew Island” citing it as the latest example of fraudulent registries. It has sent everyone scurrying to the Internet and reference sources to answer the question: where is Matthew Island?\nTurns out it is an uninhabited island in the southern Pacific east of New Caledonia. France claims it as its territory, but Vanuatu has sought to challenge the rights saying it belongs to the indigenous people of its country. It does not much matter, because it is a volcanic outcropping and most sources note the size of the island changes due to volcanic and ocean activity.\nThe Netherlands at the same time is warning of another fraudulent registry posing as the registry of Sint Maarten calling itself the MSTA Registry operated by International Maritime Registries & Regulatory. Sint Maarten is the Dutch side of the Caribbean Island shared with the French who call it Saint Martin. While it is a popular cruise ship destination, the papers to the IMO assert that no one has been authorized to operate this registry.\nThe submission highlights the lack of transparency in both of these operations a point that they contend is common among these false flag operations. They note these two websites have very similar interfaces.\nShaddy operators emerging to operate so-called international registries is nothing new. Guyana at the end of 2024 highlighted that five tankers sanctioned by the U.S. were falsely displaying Guyana as their registry. The authorities noted that the country has a closed registry only available to residents and none of the ships qualified.\nThe IMO had previously said over 100 ships were showing in databases with false flags. As the shadow fleet of tankers grew to serve the Russian oil trade, as well as Iran, the number is thought to have increased dramatically. The UK in a submission to the IMO’s Legal Committee cited over 230 examples while some reports say it is now over 270 ships.\nAs part of the lead-up to the Legal Committee meeting, France and the Netherlands outlined a series of steps to continue the crackdown on false flags. In their submission they acknowledge “every state whether coastal or landlocked has the right to sail ships flying its flag on the high seas,” but they note there must be better records and transparency. They note there are various obligations of flag states and that communications are required among flag authorities or their managers, especially in the event of an accident or inspection.\nThey are calling for the IMO to require states to set conditions for registry in their national law. The IMO they said should use digital tools to confirm the authenticity of the registration certificate and enhance the procedures for the allocation of IMO numbers.\nLiberia which uses an international manager for its flag also submitted a paper for the upcoming meeting. It supports the proposals previously submitted to the IMO while offering some suggested improvements for the effective use of resources and the enforcement of available tools.\nThe IMO started its latest efforts to step up thecrackdown in 2019. At the time it outlined steps including the creation of the first database to track vessels under UN Security Council sanctions.\n\nTop photo of Mathew Island in 2012 byJd.Girard(CC BY-SA 3.0)"

The BBC reports the port handles bulk and steel-based imports and exports.\nThe Humber Rescue lifeboat got the callout Sunday evening to assist the stranded ship. An attempt was made to pull it free but it failed and the boat was sent back to base. Following coordination with HM Coastguard Humber, the lifeboat reports it undertook a second attempt early Monday morning at 0700, this time with the assistance of three tugs. Despite efforts, the vessel remained grounded. Later that evening, at approximately 1800, a third attempt was also unsuccessful. Local officials told the BBC that they might have to wait for the spring tides in April before the vessel could be refloated.\n\n\n\nBuilt in 2004 and registered in the Netherlands, the vessel is 82 meters (269 feet) in length. It is owned by Wisdom Shipping and managed by Amasus Shipping. On the website, they emphasize the vessel was designed with a low draught (3.4 meters / 11 feet) but for now, it is stuck."

        "content": "It is rare that maritime interests get billing in the annual State of the Union speech, the most-watched formal policy address that a U.S. president gets to deliver. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump took time to call for a reinvigorated American shipbuilding industry, and pledged new support for both commercial and naval yards.\n\"To boost our defense industrial base we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House that offers special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America where it belongs,\" Trump said. \"We used it to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.\"\nThe announcement is the first mention of the new shipbuilding office. That function has historically been housed in the Maritime Administration and in Naval Sea Systems Command, and Trump did not provide further details. However, the news met with strong approval from America's shipbuilders: the industry's main trade association called for enhanced cooperation between industry and government to create a consistent demand signal for shipyards.\n\"We applaud the creation of the White House Office of Shipbuilding, and the entire shipyard industrial base not only stands at the ready to work with the new Office of U.S. Shipbuilding, but we are also ready to answer the call to design and build America’s commercial and military fleets,\" said Matthew Paxton, President of the Shipbuilders Council of America. \"By fully utilizing the existing domestic shipyard capacity, the shipyard industrial base can meet the growing demands of national defense, restore American competitiveness, and create thousands of skilled jobs.\"\nThe U.S. Navy's growing problems with the shipbuilding industrial base - particularly supply chain delays and workforce shortages - have raised the industry's profile in Washington. The previous Secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, put a spotlight on shipyard delays and sought foreign investment from South Korea's Big Three yards in the hope that their high-tech methods could help right the ship. In the Senate, Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) - a longtime advocate for growing the fleet - recently warned that \"just about every major U.S. shipbuilding program is behind schedule, over budget or irreparably off track.\"\nIn his speech Tuesday, Trump also emphasized his administration's efforts to restore more American influence over the Panama Canal, and noted a newly-concluded deal that handed control of the container terminals on either side of the waterway to an American hedge fund.\n\"My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it. Just today a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple other canals,\" Trump said."

The ship has no provisions at all for human occupancy during operation.\nThe 180-foot, 240-tonne autonomous gray hull is in the water and will now undergo sea trials, beginning in the spring. Its crewless design has specific advantages, according to DARPA: without making room and allowances for people, there is little in way of a deckhouse, and the vessel has a narrower beam. This means less construction cost, less weight, better hydrodynamic efficiency, better stealth performance, and a better operating window in rough sea states, according to DARPA.\nThe prototype is the product of the agency's No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) program. DARPA has been running multiple tests to support the operating concept in parallel with construction, including at-sea refueling for a Defiant-sized vessel. The U.S. Navy's USV Squadron 1 conducted the test in partnership with DARPA using two experimental unmanned vessels, the crewboat-based Ranger and Mariner.\n\n\nCourtesy DARPA\nThe design objective is to produce an unmanned ship that has 90 percent reliability at sea for a year at a time, with minimal human intervention. Ryan Maatta, Marine Engineer Manager at SERCO and Deputy Program Manager for DARPA's NOMARS program, told Naval News that the design could drive \"greatly reduced cost per mission hour.\"\n\"It's going to put more payload out on the ocean, more mission systems Out on the ocean for much cheaper than the Navy does traditionally,\" he said."

During this urgent transit, she went aground at Napier Point, just south of Bella Bella. The vessel quickly took on a list, and the Canadian Coast Guard deployed a fast rescue craft to respond. The CCG officers pulled all four fishermen aboard to safety.\nThe same day, Western Gambler capsized, resulting in minor sheening on the water. The Heiltsuk First Nation's marine response team deployed a containment boom around the wreck, as well as additional booms to protect a nearby hatchery. The vessel had an estimated 7,500 liters of fuel on board, according to the Heiltsuk Nation.\nThe CCG, the Heiltsuk government and BC's Environmental Emergency Branch set up a unified command for the response, and a commercial salvor was selected to perform pollution abatement and wreck removal.\nHeiltsuk Marine Emergency Response Team responded and deployed containment boom around the vessel. They also deployed deflection boom along the shorelines and to protect the McLoughlin Bay hatchery.\nA Unified Command has been established to oversee the incident and ensure an appropriate response.\nOn site operations to begin the salvage started on February 26, and crews were able to quickly rig the vessel and parbuckle it upright. Severe weather moved in during the operation, so the vessel was secured to the side of the barge and repositioned to a nearby safe harbor to continue dewatering. No sheening or pollution were observed during these evolutions.\nAfter the wreck was safely aboard the barge, the team returned to the site of the grounding to begin dive operations for removing any remaining debris. That work wrapped up on February 27, and the barge  got under way for mainland BC to deliver the wreckage.\n"

In the latest development, HII is highlighting that its Newport News Shipbuilding yard printed and installed the first-ever manifold using the technology for the soon-to-be-delivered aircraft carrier USSEnterprise.\n“What started as a proof of concept quickly turned into a tangible result that is making a meaningful difference to improve efficiencies in shipbuilding,” said Dave Bolcar, NNS vice president of engineering and design. “The benefits of this innovation will extend well beyondEnterprise(CVN 80), as we incorporate our expertise in additive manufacturing into the fundamentals of shipbuilding.”\nThe valve manifold assembly, a specialized assembly that allows the distribution of a single source of fluid to multiple points on the ship, is installed in a pump room on Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrierEnterprise. The assembly is approximately 5 feet long and 1,000 pounds. Newport News collaborated with DM3D Technology to manufacture the manifold body.\nAccording to the shipyard, it is another demonstration of its pursuit of opportunities to support construction using additive manufacturing. Similar manifolds planned for the next carrier in the class,Doris Miller(CVN 81), will also employ additive manufacturing rather than traditional casting methods.\nThis latest advancement in the development and deployment of additive manufacturing HII reports builds on Newport News’ prior certification and approval as a supplier for additive manufacturing components on Naval Sea Systems (NAVSEA) platforms. To date, the shipyard has created more than 55 additively manufactured parts installed on both new construction vessels and those currently in the fleet, with plans to install more than 200 additional parts this year.\n\n\nNewport News highlights its growing use of 3D printing technology (HII)\n\nNewport News says the use of certified 3D-printed parts has the potential to accelerate the construction and delivery of vessels to the U.S. Navy. The technology provides the opportunity to reduce lead times and improve manufacturing quality for critical components.\nFour years ago, the U.S. Navy moved to accelerate the use of 3D printing after having installed its first-ever 3D part in 2018. First used as a source for critical and obsolete parts, the Navy moved in 2022 to install printers and test them on vessels on deployment. The USSEssex, a Wasp-class Landing Helicopter Dock, was the first to install a printer in July 2022, and as the technology has been proven the Navy is now ready to accept parts using the technology on its most advanced vessels including the newest carriers."

The State Department and Treasury Department have been asked to draft a list of measures for potentially easing stringent U.S. sanctions, which have been the most effective tools of economic persuasion that the West has deployed against Moscow.\nThe news aligns with a personal falling-out between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which burst into public view with a contentious news conference at the White House on Friday. After a heated exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky was asked to leave the building. Trump subsequently announced a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine, a profound blow for Ukraine's front-line forces.\nSources close to the White House told Reuters that the sanctions relief measures under consideration would be for individual Russian citizens and companies. Ukraine's government responded with a call for the White House to wait for more progress in peace talks, in order to maintain leverage to bring an end to the invasion. However, Russia has indicated that negotiations over Ukraine are only part of the discussion with the Trump administration: the bilateral talks also cover something else - \"normalizing\" relations between Moscow and Washington.\n\"Of course, if we are talking about normalizing bilateral relations, then [Russian interests] need to be freed from this negative burden of so-called sanctions,\" said Dmitri Petrov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"It is probably too early to talk about anything [being lifted] . . . we have not heard any official statements.\"\nCurrent U.S. sanctions include significant restrictions on Russia's energy sector and its tankers. The previous administration's effort to target Russia-linked \"shadow fleet\" of aging tankers has forced Russian Urals exporters to drop their prices below $60 per barrel for the first time in more than a year, and tanker rates from Russian loading ports have soared."

        "content": "\nJapan’s Mitsui Ocean Cruises reports it has purchased a second, small luxury cruise ship from Carnival Corporation’s Seabourn Cruise Line as it seeks to expand its domestic cruise operations. The shipping major best known for its bulker operations announced plans in 2023 to diversify its business with an expansion of its cruise line which was operating a single ship.\nTheSeabourn Sojourn(32,477 gross tons) was delivered to MOL on February 28 and immediately chartered back to Seabourn to complete its published itineraries. After a scheduled world cruise ending on May 15, 2026, the ship will be handed over to Mitsui Ocean Cruises which says it will be refurbished and positioned into the short to medium length cruises in the domestic Japanese market. Details on the name and refurbishment will be announced at a later date.\n“The purchase of this vessel brings forward the company's plans to expand its cruise business, ahead of the launch of two new ships,” MOL said announcing the second cruise ship acquisition. The company in 2023 mapped a strategy calling for building new cruise ships and now says the second acquisition “will begin operations prior to the new vessels in order to provide Mitsui Ocean Cruises' services to customers as soon as possible.”\nThe new cruise line was launched in December 2024 with the formerSeabourn Odysseywhich was acquired in March 2023 and chartered to Seabourn to complete its itineraries. The ship renamedMitsui OceanFijientered service at the end of last year with MOL saying it would also serve the international market. The company just announced the opening of a North American sales organization for the ship.\n“We launchedMitsui Ocean Fujiin December 2024 and are very pleased with the guest reaction to the ship and onboard product,” said Tsunemichi Mukai, President of Mitsui Ocean Cruises. “While all new cruise ships take a little time to settle in, the experience onMitsui Ocean Fujiis continuously improving, and we are now extremely confident these two ships are the most suitable vessels to expand our cruise business.”\nThe sister ships were built by Italy’s T. Marriott entering service in 2009 and 2010. They were considered an advancement in the luxury market with accommodations for just 458 passengers. They measure 649 feet (198 meters) with 229 passenger suites.\nThe sale of the second ship by Carnival Corporation comes as it is focusing on its larger brands and building new mega-ships. Seabourn introduced two luxury ships for expeditions built in 2022 and 2023 but will be overall downsized after delivering its second cruise ship to MOL. The line has a third sister to the two sold to MOL plus two slightly larger 600-passenger versions as well as the expedition ships.\nMOL reports Japanese will be the official language aboard the second ship while saying its size will permit it to reach a variety of ports including in the Seto Inland Sea and remote islands in Okinawa and Hokkaido. It also looks to leverage its experience operating the sister ship to immediately offer enhanced services aboard the ship when it enters service in late 2026.\nMitsui Ocean Cruises says the announced cruises of theMitsui OceanFijiand its older cruise ship Nippon Maru will not be affected by the purchase. TheMitsui OceanFijiwill continue to focus on medium to longer term cruises which will include international fly-cruises. All its cruises will call at a minimum of one international port. Nippon Maru mostly operates in the domestic market but has also offered longer international cruises.\nMOL’s expansion in the cruise sector comes as NYK is also preparing for the launch of its second cruise ship.Asuka IIIwas recently floated out at Meyer Werft in Germany and departed the yard on Sunday, March 2 arriving in Eemshaven, Netherlands yesterday to prepare for sea trials and delivery. She is due to enter service in July from Japan as an addition to the olderAsuka II.\nJapan’s Ryobi Holdings, a diversified company that includes operations in transportation and tourism, also announced plans at the end of 2023 to enter the cruise market. It ordered a luxury, yacht cruise ship to be built in Portugal for delivery in 2027."

        "content": "The French shipping group CMA CGM recently took delivery of its first dual-fuel methanol containership. While the group continues significant investments in LNG-fueled newbuilds it also recognized the need for diversified sources during this period of transition in the maritime industry.\nThe new vesselCMA CGM Irondeparted Singapore on March 4 bound for the Khalifa port in the UAE on its first voyage. The vessel is joining the route between Ais and the Middle East Gulf region.\nCMA CGM ordered 12 methanol-capable vessels from HD Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries in South Korea in 2023. The order was valued at $2 billion with the series due for delivery in 2025 and 2026. Registered in Malta, CMA CGM is saying the container ship is “a new milestone on its group’s path toward net zero carbon by 2050.”\nThe naming ceremony for the new ship took place on February 17 in South Korea shortly before her delivery. CMA CGM Iron is 146,000 dwt with a capacity of approximately 13,000 TEU. The vessel measures 1,099 feet (335 meters). The sister ships, which will includeCMA CGM Cobalt, Argon, Platinum, Mercury, Helium, Krypton, Thorium, Osmium, Silver, Copper,andGoldwill be progressively deployed in 2025 and 2026.\n\n\nCMA CGM Iron is the first of a new class of a dozen methanol-fueled containerships (CMA CGM)\n\nThis new class is the latest step in CMA CGM’s effort with the company reporting it has invested nearly $20 billion to order LNG and methanol-powered ships. In 2024, the Group took delivery of 12 new LNG-fueled vessels and was linked yesterday to a new $2 billion order placed in China for another dozen LNG-fueled vessels. The group says that by 2029 it will have 153 ships capable of using low-carbon energies (biogas, biomethanol, and synthetic fuels) in its fleet. CMA CGM reports a total fleet currently of over 650 vessels with orders of nearly 100 new ships.\n“In the future, the diversity of technologies and the availability of greener fuels, such as biomethane or biomethanol, will remain a major challenge for the CMA CGM Group and the industry,” the company said last week in its annual financial results report.\nMethanol continues to emerge as a fuel while concerns continue about the supply and the cost of the fuel. One key challenge is that it has a lower energy density than other alternatives. In part, this might account for a slower pace for additional orders for methanol-fueled ships. There are also reports within the industry that shipowners have revised building contracts with Alphaliner saying this week that Wan-Hai has approached shipbuilders in South Korea about possibly switching its order for eight 16,000 TEU ships to LNG engines.\nWhile there were 166 new orders in 2024 according to DNV, no methanol-fueled orders have so far been placed in 2025. This compares with 44 orders in the first two months of this year for LNG-fueled vessels.\nOverall, the methanol orderbook grew quickly in the past two years with containerships leading the sector. DNV calculates that there are 25 containerships currently in service able to use methanol which has caught up to the product tanker segment. However, the orderbook shows over 300 methanol ships scheduled by 2030, two-thirds are containerships."

No Russian officials were sanctioned in the announcement.\nThe Houthis repeatedly attacked merchant shipping in the Red Sea from late 2023 through the end of 2024, then paused their operations in January after the announcement of the group's stated objective - the phased ceasefire agreement between Israel and Palestinian terror group Hamas. The Houthis' primary military sponsor is the government of Iran, which has provided the group with weapons and funding for years, but the U.S. Treasury also has reason to believe that the terrorist organization has received support from Iran's Russian allies as well.\n\"By seeking weapons from a growing array of international suppliers, Houthi leaders have shown their intent to continue their reckless and destabilizing actions in the Red Sea region,\" said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent in a statement. \"The United States will use all available tools to disrupt the Houthis’ terrorist activities and degrade their ability to threaten U.S. personnel, our regional partners, and global maritime trade.\"\nAccording to the Treasury, Houthi spokesman Mohammad Abdulsalam has helped arrange the group's efforts to get weapons and support from the Russian government, working from offices in Oman. Abdulsalam has traveled to Moscow and met with the Russian foreign ministry, as well as members of the Russian military, according to the Treasury's staff. An aide to Abdulsalam, Eshaq Abdulmalek Abdullah Almarwani was also designated for his role in the talks.\nAli Muhammad Muhsin Salih Al-Hadi, head of the Sanaa Chamber of Commerce (SCC), plays a key role in financing Houthi weapons purchasing. He has traveled to Russia to make arrangements \"to secure defense equipment for Houthi militants and investment in Houthi-controlled industries,\" according to the Treasury.\nTop Houthi leader Mahdi Mohammed Hussein Al-Mashat, chairman of the terror group's Supreme Political Council (SPC), has also worked to increase cooperation between the Russian government, Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Houthi movement, according to the Treasury. SPC member Mohamed Ali Al-Houthi helped coordinate the group's truce with Russia and China, which pledged a moratorium on Houthi strikes on maritime traffic linked to the Houthis' leading international supporters.\nAlso named were two senior Houthi operatives - Abdulmalek Abdullah Mohammed E Alagri and Khaled Hussein Saleh Gaber - who also traveled to Russia to participate in the meetings. Alagri has also joined talks with the Chinese government, according to the Treasury.\nThe Houthi military trade with Russia involves both imports and exports, according to the Treasury. The department asserts that Houthi operative and \"major general\" Abdulwali Abdoh Hasan Al-Jabri operated a \"lucrative human smuggling operation, recruiting Yemeni civilians to fight for Russia in Ukraine.\" The recruits were not always well-informed of their new role, Treasury said, but their efforts have earned the terrorist group a new source of much-needed revenue.\nThe weapons talks between Moscow and the Houthis may have had direct relevance to the safety of shipping in the Red Sea. In September, government sources told Reuters that Iran was helping the Houthis negotiate with Russia to acquire the P-800 Oniks (Onyx, Yakhont) supersonic antiship missile - a potent upgrade to the terrorist group's Iranian-supplied munitions, which sank two ships out of more than a hundred attacked. Houthi officials likely met with Russian representatives in Tehran twice last year, security sources told Reuters, and the talks about procuring the Oniks were expected to continue."

They said they had been at sea for five days and now had no food or water and were cold as there was no indoor shelter available on the platform.\n\n\nMigrants on the lower platform signalling to one of the aircraft that were dispatch to confirm the situation (Sea-Watch)\n\nThe operator Miskar reported the situation and the European Coast Guard Fonex reportedly confirmed the presence of the migrants on the platform. They issued an alert to Malta, Italy, and Tunisia as the platform sits at the edge between the SAR areas maintained by Tunisia and Malta.\nSea-Watch says the Tunisian navy was going to go to the platform and reported it would remove the people on Sunday. However, no help arrived. The NGO says Italy and Malta did not respond to the situation.\nThe NGO’s vesselAurorawas dispatched and finally reached the platform on March 4. It found the people cold and hungry huddled on the walkways of the platform. They were taken aboard the Aurora and given initial attention.\nItaly ordered theAurorato the port of Lampedusa where it arrived today, March 5. The people were offloaded while the NGOs highlighted it as another example of neglect by the authorities which failed to rescue the people.\nThe Miskar platform was also the center of a 2022controversywhen several NGOs accused Shell and Malta of not responding to another group of migrants that also took shelter on the platform. In that case, the NGOs were unable to rescue the people who were removed by the Tunisian navy and returned to Africa."

        "content": "Work officially began with the next milestone on the fifth and final vessel in the Maritime Administration’s program to provide state-of-the-art training ships to the state-run maritime academies. The grand block for the fifth vessel, which has been assigned to the California State University Maritime Academy, was placed into the dry dock to begin assembly of the ship.\nThe orders for the vessels began in 2020 using the Vessel Construction Manager acquisition model where MARAD retained TOTE Services to manage the construction of the vessels and Philly Shipyard (now Hanwha Philly Shipyard) received the orders. The fifth vessel was added to the contract in April 2022. Philly Shipyard at the time said the fifth vessel was valued at approximately $300 million, bringing the total order intake under the contract for the five-ship program would be approximately $1.5 billion.\n\"California State University Maritime Academy is honored to be part of a distinguished fleet of purpose-built training ships, each designed to meet the evolving needs of America's maritime education while also providing the U.S. with ships that can support disaster response and other critical national needs,\" said Vice Admiral (Ret.) Michael J. Dumont, Interim President of Cal Maritime. \"This vessel stands as a testament to innovation, resilience, and the nation's unwavering commitment to preparing the next generation of mariners. It will be proudly operated by the crew, cadets, and faculty of the only state maritime academy on the West Coast.\"\nThe program is known as the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV). The ships were designed to provide a modern training facility replacing outdated vessels used for the training programs. The training facilities include classrooms and a fully equipped bridge as well as a modern diesel power plant versus the steam plants that many of the previous training ships employed. The vessels are also able to handle a container, have RoRo capabilities, and can also be used for disaster relief.\nHanwha, which acquired the shipyard at the end of 2024 and looks to expand its U.S. government work highlights the speed of the construction program. They note that all five vessels’ keels were laid over the past 39 months. TOTE highlights that it is a demonstration of the efficiency of the contracting model.\nEach of the vessels is 525 feet (160 meters) in length and is designed with a range of over 10,000 miles at 18 knots. They accommodate 600 students and teachers and can accommodate up to 1,000 people on their humanitarian missions. The vessels also have a full hospital and helipad to support the humanitarian deployments.\nThe first and second NSMVs,Empire StateandPatriot State, were delivered in September 2023 and 2024. Both have now undertaken their first training voyages as they settle in at SUNY Maritime College in New York and Massachusetts Maritime Academy.\nThe three remaining vessels are currently in various stages of construction at Hanwha Philly Shipyard. TheState of Maineis in the final stages of outfitting and will be delivered later this year for the Maine Maritime Academy. The fourth vessel,Lone Star State, completed block assembly in October 2024 will be at Texas A&M Maritime Academy and the California vessel,Golden State, is tentatively scheduled for delivery in late 2026."

TheSM Portland(51,314 dwt) has resumed its voyage bound for Vancouver where it will be inspected by Canadian authorities.\n“Due to heavy rolling by the inclement weather, unfortunately, it caused cargo damage, including container loss, collapse, and damage of 115 containers,” SM advised. Customers are being instructed to check their documents to determine if they might have had boxes onboard the vessel which had called in China and South Korea before departing for Vancouver where it was due to arrive on March 10.\nThe ship, theSM Portland, has a capacity of 4,228 TEU and is 856 feet (261 meters) in length. It was built in 2009 and acquired by SM Line in 2021. The company reports it encountered severe winter weather with strong winds near the Bering Sea. AIS signals show the vessel changing course early on March 4 and resuming its crossing on March 5. SM Line reports the vessel had slowed and adjusted course for safety.\nWhen the vessel arrives off Vancouver, the line reports there will be an investigation by Transport Canada and the Canadian Coast Guard before it is permitted to berth. SM Line warns customers that it expects schedule delays.\nSM Line was started in 2017 as a niche carrier and the following year, 2017, it launched service to North America. The company continues its Pacific routes in cooperation with the larger Korean carrier HMM.\nThis incident comes more than four years after one of the worst container loss events happened in the North Pacific in November 2020 on theONE Apsus. The vessel also encountered heavy weather resulting in the loss of over 1,800 containers and damage to many more boxes that remained on deck. Maersk experienced a similar issue with its containershipsMaersk EssenandMaersk Eindhoven, both of which also suffered container losses at sea on the Pacific that same winter season.\nThe heavy losses in 2020-2021 prompted new initiatives in the industry to address dangerous rolling. The shipping companies were advised to enhance training for their crews and new technologies were developed to help monitor and alert crew to potentially dangerous conditions.\nThe World Shipping Council in its 2024 annual report highlighted the industry’s success in reducing losses with its data showing just 221 containers were lost at sea in 2023 out of 250 million transported. The IMO also moved in 2024 to tighten the rules requiring reporting of container losses."

After several rounds of dive operations, a commercial contractor has recovered an estimated 340,000 liters of petroleum, the service confirmed to New Zealand outlet Stuff - but officials declined to say how much fuel remains on the ship.\nThe task was supposed to finish in January, but has taken longer than expected. The salvor continues to work on recovering remaining amounts of fuel from the vessel's tanks and compartments; conditions on scene are challenging, including periods of rough weather and a difficult location at the edge of the reef.\nThe ship will likely remain in place and become a part of the reef structure, New Zealand defense minister Judith Collins told local media. Despite local complaints about the smell of diesel fuel, the government of Samoa \"has decided it wants it to stay where it is,\" she said. Collins suggested that it will likely be a diving attraction when cleanup operations are completed, much like an artificial reef.\nHMNZSManawanuiwent aground near a reef on the southern coast of Upolu, Samoa on October 5. The commanding officer ordered the 75 crewmembers aboard the vessel to abandon ship, and all made it safely to shore, despite rough surface conditions. Several of the survivors were injured while crossing a reef to reach safety, but all survived; the vessel caught fire and sank the next morning.\nManawanuiwill not be replaced, Collins confirmed in January, and her missions will be picked up by the patrol boat HMNZSOtago- a much smaller vessel lacking Manawanui's working deck and 100-tonne crane."

        "content": "\nWhen a Louisiana refinery's mooring dock collapsed upon contact with a barge in 2023, allision damage might have been suspected - but the National Transportation Safety Board has determined that it was the dock to blame, not the vessel. A structural inspection had discovered serious deterioration of the dock six years before the accident, and no progress was made in making repairs in the year and a half before the casualty.\nIn the early hours of April 25, 2023, the towing vesselOvide Jwas arriving at the Chalmette Refinery crude oil dock with two laden barges and a cargo of 50,000 barrels of crude. The refinery is on the Lower Mississippi near mile 89, just downriver from New Orleans. The dock was built in 1967 out of wood and steel pilings, dolphins, and access bridges. The transfer platform was located on dolphin number three, along with a boom crane and the pipe manifold.\nThe relief captain was at the helm as the towboat approached the dock from downriver, using the current to guide the tow slowly towards the pier. The relief captain made his final approach at 0001-0004, maneuvering slowly to make contact with the dock at about 0.3 knots.\nWhen the tow made contact with dolphin number 3, part of the dock fell off into the river. The relief captain put the starboard side engine in neutral in order to avoid fouling the propeller with any debris from the collapse. The other two dolphins remained intact, so the crew moored to the surviving portions of the dock and notified the company of the casualty. Luckily, no one was injured.\nTheOvide Jand her barges sustained no damage from the incident, and the timber fendering around the dock was undamaged. Video from the pilothouse showed no signs of a hard contact (like jarring, vibration or movement of objects). The relief captain later told investigators that the maneuver - which he had performed at the same dock 20 times in the past year - had gone perfectly to plan.\n\"When you come in, you touch up stern first. . . . So, when I came in, I lightly touch on the stern. . . . As soon as I touched up, the dock collapsed,\" he said. \"If I had to do it again, I would do it the same way over again. I would not change a thing.\"\nThe dock sustained about $7 million worth of damage: 150 feet of the structure collapsed, and the support piles for dolphin number three were sheared off below the waterline. But the damage may have started long before the casualty event, based on past inspection reports. In 2017, a third-party engineering inspection found major deterioration of the braces between the dolphin's pilings. Six years before the collapse, three horizontal braces on the dolphin were broken, one more was damaged and two pilings were \"severely deteriorated.\" The dock owner informed NTSB that the recommendations from this inspection had \"not been progressed\" before the dock collapsed.\n\"Because a portion of the dock collapsed from what appeared to be a low-impact contact during docking, it is likely that the dock’s dolphin no. 3 transfer platform structure was compromised to the extent that it could not sustain the forces from a typical docking. The dock owner was aware that the dock had structural integrity issues before the collapse but had not yet taken steps to address them,\" NTSB concluded."

        "content": "In a surprise move that was also seen as a vote of confidence for the lagging dry bulk sector, the Saverys family announced they are paying nearly $1.2 billion to become investors in Golden Ocean. The company describes itself as one of the world’s leading dry bulk shipping companies currently with a fleet of 91 vessels.\nThe Saverys’ company CMB.TECH continues its efforts at consolidating the shipping industry after acquiring Euronav and converting it to the tanker operating company under its umbrella. The company currently has more than 150 seagoing vessels with operations in crude oil, dry bulk, containers, chemicals, offshore wind, and workboats.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, CMB.TECH is acquiring a 40 percent stake in Golden Ocean (more than 81 million shares) at a price of $14.49 per share. They represent renown investor John Fredriksen’s entire stake in the company, but CMB.TECH reports it will not trigger a mandatory takeover bid or similar offer.\nAccording to CMB.TECH, the acquisition is in line with its strategic objective of diversification. It says it intends on becoming a long-term shareholder and investing in a modern dry bulk fleet. Last year, CEO Alexander Saverys told the investment community that they planned to use the traditional sectors of the shipping world to help fund and drive their push for decarbonization. CMB.TECH is at the forefront of developing ammonia and hydrogen systems for shipping.\n\"The acquisition of the Golden Ocean shares from Hemen represents a significant milestone in CMB.TECH’s diversification strategy,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH while announcing the agreement. “We look forward to engaging with the board, management, and employees of Golden Ocean and to build on Golden Ocean’s and Mr. Fredriksen’s strong legacy to drive long-term growth and innovation.”\nFor Fredriksen, it ends his long association with the dry bulk sector and Golden Ocean. He made his investment in 2000 and a decade ago merged the company with Knightsbridge Shipping. Golden Ocean continues to grow its position reporting in late 2024 that it had completed the delivery of 10 new 85,000 dwt vessels. They were built in South Korea.\nWhile the dry bulk sector has been under pressure, analysts viewed the acquisition as a sign of confidence in the opportunities. They noted that the Saverys are paying a strong premium to the valuation of Golden Ocean. The stock, which reached a recent high of $15 a share in May 2024 on NASDAQ, has been trading under $10 a share for all of 2025.\nCMB.TECH has been active in the dry bulk sector through Bocimar. The company owns 30 bulkers that transport coal, iron ore, grain, and minor bulks."

If operationalized, the \"Thunderforge\" software initiative could have a profound effect on how the Navy and Marine Corps fight.\nAccording to Breaking Defense, the biggest operational advantage may be surprisingly mundane: collating and analyzing all the data needed to plan the logistical details of a military operation, which can take hundreds of hours of work using dated Pentagon computing systems. This would free up staff officers for more strategically-important tasks.\nThe Thunderforge system draws on AI agents developed by Scale AI, along with Anduril's Lattice platform and Microsoft's large language model (LLM) products. The developers emphasized that the agents will always operate under human oversight.\n\"Today’s military planning processes rely on decades-old technology and methodologies, creating a fundamental mismatch between the speed of modern warfare and our ability to respond,\" said Bryce Goodman, DIU Thunderforge Program Lead and contractor. \"Thunderforge brings AI-powered analysis and automation to operational and strategic planning, allowing decision-makers to operate at the pace required for emerging conflicts.\"\nThe system will be deployed first with Indo-Pacific Command and European Command, the two regions with the most at stake in a high-end fight. Adm. Sam Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and a proponent of unmanned systems, commended DIU for its work to \"iteratively develop, test, and ultimately field emerging technologies at speed and scale.\" Maj.

The grant is the first of two announced under a program launched by the government in 2023 to support the development of port infrastructure needed for the floating wind sector.\nLocated on the northeastern shore of Scotland near Inverness, the Port of Cromarty Firth has a long history of supporting the offshore industries first in oil and gas and more recently offshore wind. Port officials highlight that its position with deep, sheltered waters is perfectly suited to accommodate large ships. The plan calls for bringing the wind farm components to the port where they will expand the lay area as well as provide space for the construction, installation, and operational support.\nThe components will be manufactured around the UK. The new facility will be the Quay West and the Phase 5 laydown area. The floating turbines can be assembled and pre-commissioned, before being towed to the wind farm site.\nThe port presented a plan that would make it the UK’s first custom-built integration hub for floating offshore wind construction. It said the expansion was critical to meeting the plans for the sector.\nThe UK remains the largest installed base of offshore wind in Europe although China surpassed it for total size in the global market. The government has mapped a strong strategy to make wind energy a key component in the long-term strategy and committed to investments in floating wind farms which will be the next phase of the industry.\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero launched the Floating Offshore Wind Manufacturing Investment Scheme (FLOWMIS) to meet the port needs of the floating wind sector. The Department confirmed the grant to the Invergordon-based Trust that operates the port as part of an effort to fund the proposed expansion project. They said today’s grant would pave the way for the port to secure matching funds from banks and investors.\nThe port also plans to use the grant to start the process of awarding pre-construction contracts for the expansion project. They report the work must be completed by 2027 to be ready for the first commercial-scale floating wind projects.\nPort Talbot is the second port selected under the FLOWMIS program. The Department reports the plans for the shortlisted port are currently under development. Talbot is located on Swansea Bay in Wales."

If the anonymous comments on Chinese social media were transformed into policy, Palawan would be the first major piece of inhabited sovereign territory that China has claimed in the Philippines. Though new, such a claim would be consistent with China's foreign policy objectives: Beijing has laid similar historical claim to Tibet, Taiwan and parts of northern India.\nIf the new Palawan claims were promoted on open-access Western platforms like X or Facebook, Manila would likely have little cause for concern. But since the Chinese internet is tightly governed and subject to rigid censorship, and China has allowed the Palawan claims to stay posted online, the Philippine government has reacted with alarm.\n\"We categorically reject the baseless and revisionist claims circulating on Chinese social media that Palawan was historically part of China and should be returned to it,\" said Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Año in a statement. \"Palawan has always been and will always remain an integral part of the Republic of the Philippines. No historical record, legal precedent or credible evidence support the claim that Palawan was ever under Chinese sovereignty.\"\nThe claim on Chinese social media suggests that Palawan is \"Zheng He Island,\" named for the 14th-century Chinese explorer Zheng He. Año noted that there is no historical evidence that Zheng He visited Palawan, nor any sign of Chinese settlement in the province. \"These false narratives, proliferated through digital disinformation and information warfare tactics, appear to be part of a broader effort to undermine Philippine sovereignty,\" Año warned.\nThe \"Zheng He\" theory would extend China's ambitions beyond the boundaries of the well-known \"nine-dash line\" policy, Beijing's historically-derived claim to almost all of the South China Sea. The nine-dash line covers most of the Philippines' western exclusive economic zone, along with large sections of the Vietnamese, Malaysian, Indonesian and Bruneian economic zones. An international court invalidated the basis of that claim in 2016, but China has ignored the ruling.\n"

The move comes just weeks after the company alsonamedformer Wärtsilä CEO Jaakko Eskola as its new chairman of the board.\nThe yard which has a long heritage in the cruise ship sector was acquired in 2014 by Germany’s Meyer family which was best known for Meyer Werft in Papenburg, Germany. The family reports it has invested over €300 million in the development of the shipyard after acquiring it from STX. They highlight that it delivered at least one large cruise ship a year during the decade working with customers TUI’s Mein Schiff. Carnival Cruise Line, Costa, and Royal Caribbean International.\nTim Meyer took over as CEO in 2020 after being a managing director at the Papenburg yard since 2016. He replaced his brother Jan Meyer who had been CEO of Meyer Turku for two years since 2014. The company highlighted recently that Tim Meyer had been successful in returning the shipyard to profitability. He cited efforts to develop the organization, streamline processes, implement a new enterprise resource planning system, and a development program. Revenues are reported to have grown from €500 million to €2 billion.\nThe pandemic placed a strain on the operations but both the yards in Turku and Papenburg were able to retain their orders. Papenburg however required a financial bailout from the German government last year and as part of the deal the Meyer family ceded ownership of the yard but it still retains 100 percent ownership of Turku.\nTim Meyer said in the press release he would be focusing on the development and strategies of the shipyard and the family’s other businesses. Jan Meyer had shifted to a business development role at Papenburg, while their father Bernard Meyer has stepped down from the management of both shipyards.\n“In Casimir, we have found an exceptional leader with years of experience from various industries such as construction,” said board chairman Eskola. “I already have experience from successfully working together with him in a company majority owned by a family.”\nLindholm will assume his new role in May after departing Cargotec, which today focuses on heavy road equipment after a series oftransactions. Kalmar the manufacturer of cranes and heavy cargo handling equipment was spun-off and in late 2024 it agreed to sell MacGregor, a leader in maritime cargo and load handling, to a private investment firm. Previously Lindholm was president and CEO of Eltel Group, an infrastructure company, and before that, he was at Lemminkäinen Group, a Finnish construction company.\nHe takes the leadership of Meyer Turku as the yard is focused on building the world’s largest cruise ships for Royal Caribbean International. At the end of February, it started the propulsion plant onStar of the Seasahead of planned sea trials and delivery ahead of its entry into service during the summer. The first blocks were set in the dry dock last October for the next 250,000 gross ton cruise ship which will beLegend of the Seasand due for delivery in 2026. Royal Caribbean has ordered a fourth Icon class cruise ship from the yard due in 2027 and has options for two additional sister ships.\nMeyer Turku completed the last of the cruise ships for TUI’s Mein Schiff in June 2024 ending a decade’s long relationship. Currently, the yard is also working on a new patrol ship for the Finnish Border Guard."

        "content": "\nCMA CGM Group announced plans for a significant $20 billion investment into the U.S. maritime and logistics sectors expanding on its previous plans to expand its U.S. port terminals and logistics operations. The announcement came as Chairman and CEO of CMA CGM Group Rodolphe Saadé met with President Donald Trump and alluded to U.S. shipbuilding plans.\nThe French group currently owns seven terminals in the U.S. including in the Port of New York New Jersey and Los Angeles. It also owns APL, the former American President Lines, acquired in the 2016 acquisition of Neptune Orient Lines.\n“Over the next four years, we will significantly grow our U.S.-flagged fleet, expand the capacity of key container ports on both coasts, develop state-of-the-art warehousing across the country, and establish a significant air cargo hub in Chicago,” said Saadé. “I am proud to build on our long-standing relationship with the United States through this commitment of $20 billion to the country’s maritime future and logistics capabilities.”\nCMA CGM Group said its investments over the next four years would contribute to the development of American maritime capabilities and advance the U.S. administration’s recently announced priority to strengthen American shipbuilding capabilities. CMA CGM highlights it has been servicing U.S. markets for 35 years and reports it handles about 5 million TEU annually in the U.S. out of the 23 million TEU carried globally in 2024.\nOne element they highlighted would include “bolstering APL’s U.S. flag capacity.” Saadé told Trump the company would like to triple the size of its U.S.-flagged fleet to 30 ships. It was unclear however if these vessels would be used for APL or within the CMA CGM fleet. In 2020, CMA CGM transitioned APL’s express services into the CMA CGM branded operations refocusing APL to a niche operation servicing the United States Government, providing its U.S. flag service, and continuing its service to the Guam-Pacific trade.\n\n???????????????? French shipping magnate Rodolphe Saadé pledges $20bn US expansionBoss of CMA CGM says expansion will add further 10,000 jobs in UShttps://t.co/a50W0hQt0WPS. At such a price, we could have also negotiated with Trump to rename the Gulf of America the Gulf of Phoenicia????????????pic.twitter.com/Ut9c4QTOfx\n\nThe company did not detail the proportions of the other investments but reported it would include its terminal and logistics operations and its expanding air cargo business.\nThe group said it will develop port infrastructure in key locations across the U.S., including New York, Los Angeles, Dutch Harbor, Houston, and Miami to contribute to efficient operations and supply chains. It said the new investments would accelerate digitization, improve connectivity, and increase safety for port workers and cargo.\nCMA CGM in 2023 reported plans toinvest $600 millionafter it completed the acquisition of terminals in Bayonne, New Jersey, and Staten Island, New York from Global Container Terminals. At the beginning of 2022, CMA CGM also completed the acquisition of Fenix Marine Services (FMS), which operates a terminal at the Port of Los Angeles. It is reported to be the third largest terminal in the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex.\nThe other planned investments will include improving U.S. logistics and supply chain infrastructure with new warehousing and automotive logistics platforms. As part of this investment, CMA CGM Group will also expand its American air cargo capacity including a new hub in Chicago and deploying five new Boeing 777 freighters. CMA CGM will open a new logistics R&D hub in Boston, focusing on advanced robotics and automation solutions.\nThe planned U.S. investments are part of a larger overall growth plan for CMA CGM Group. The carrier currently owns over 300 vessels and operates in total more than 650 with reports that it has an additional 94 on order in China and South Korea. The U.S. shipbuilding plan might help to earn some relief from the Trump administration which is reported to be planning fees on carriers calling in the U.S. that build or operate Chinese-built ships. Earlier this week, the carrier waslinked to a $2.6 billion orderplaced with China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) for a dozen new containerships. The group said in 2023 that it had ordered more than 70 containerships to be built in China."

        "content": "\nThe new head of U.S. Transportation Command wants to buy as many more foreign-built ships as necessary to replenish the sealift fleet, purchasing secondhand hulls abroad and repairing them in the United States to meet Military Sealift Command's standards. This acquisition strategy has been used to bolster the Ready Reserve since the Cold War, and is viewed by defense logistics planners as a rapid and cost-effective way to get new tonnage into a deteriorating sealift fleet.\n\"The median age of the 46 Roll-on/Roll-off ships we use to surge from the continental United States is 47 years; 14 of the 46 ships are 50 years old or older,\" said Gen. Randall Reed (USAF) in written testimony for the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"USTRANSCOM supports the Navy’s strategy to recapitalize the government-owned fleet by acquiring foreign-built sealift ships from the commercial used market while also removing limitations on the number of used sealift vessels that the DoD can procure.\"\nThe Navy and the Maritime Administration have been buying foreign ships for the Ready Reserve for some time, and have authorization to purchase a maximum of 10 used ro/ros. That cap is approaching: seven used hulls have been bought already, and two more are expected this year.\nGen. Reed testified that the optimal course of action would be to waive the cap and buy four more a year going forward, two a year at minimum. These purchases would offset the built-in decline in capability as the fleet ages out: 30 sealift ships are on track to decommission by 2034, and the aging fleet's ability to get underway on short notice is already in doubt. Reed noted that many of the oldest ships have steam plants, and it is difficult to recruit mariners to work on these vessels.\nGen. Reed told the committee that in the short term, Transportation Command needs all the flexibility that it can get to buy used tonnage on the commercial market, and would like a waiver of the 10-ship cap on purchasing foreign-built hulls. However, he emphasized the importance of the Jones Act and the need to continue building vessels in America.\n\"Together we are working to get ships in any way we can. The address last night by the commander-in-chief emphasized that sealift is definitely something we need to do. He intends to make sure we can return to the seas,\" he said. \"We need to build new and buy used.\""

The actions would have impacted the support for vessels that the Navy’s bases as well as other critical services such as the delivery of supplies and munitions.\nAt issue were the complaints by the two unions, Unite and Prospect, that their members were not being consulted as part of the new services contract being negotiated by operator Serco Marine and the UK’s Ministry of Defense. The contract covers services at Navy bases in Devonport, Portsmouth, Faslane, Great Harbour Greenock, and Kyle of Lochalsh.\nThe company has a 10-year contract valued at £1.2 billion ($1.5 million) which is up for renewal. Serco provides navigational support for everything from the pride of the fleet aircraft carriers and nuclear subs to all other naval vessels and is also responsible for delivering fuel, water, and munitions at all Royal Navy ports, tank cleaning, and passenger transportation. Serco took over these critical roles in 2008 as part of the government’s move to privatize the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service.\nPromise, which mainly provides services at Faslane, Portsmouth, and Devonport, began the strikes with a 24-hour stoppage on February 3 and continued with actions short of a strike, which include adherence to work rules and a ban on overtime. Unite was scheduled to start a series of walkouts as well refusing overtime as of today, March 6.\nFollowing talks with the MoD, Serco, and the Royal Navy, Unite reported that it had agreed to suspend its strike action at Devonport, Portsmouth, Faslane, Great Harbour Greenock, and Kyle of Lochalsh. Serco has agreed to delay signing its new contract with the MoD to allow for 30 days of union consultations.\n“There will now be a consultation period to ensure the service is fit for purpose under the new contract. During this period, strike action will be suspended but action short of strikes will continue,” said Unite national officer John McGookin.\nThe unions contended that the government was looking to reduce the contract by £250 million ($310 million) which Unite says is putting nearly 100 jobs at risk. Unite has 300 members which represent about half of the workforce. It said among the steps being discussed was a proposal to reduce the number of tugs used to move nuclear submarines to four from the current six.\nSerco had confirmed to the BBC that negotiations regarding the in-port contract were ongoing while emphasizing that no changes had been agreed. The MoD said it was an issue between the employer and the unions and a strike would not impact the Royal Navy’s operations. Serco had promised to keep the unions apprised of the negotiations."

        "content": "\nSince returning to the White House, Donald Trump has vowed to restore “maximum pressure” on Iran with targeting of the oil trade being a top priority. In an exclusive report, Reuters revealed today, March 6, that the Trump administration is considering ways to delay the shipping of Iranian oil by inspecting tankers.\nCiting six unnamed sources,Reuters saysthe Trump administration is considering leveraging a 2003 agreement designed to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to slow the delivery of Iranian oil and increase pressure on the supply chain and counterparties. According to the report, tankers would be stopped for inspections in major sea lanes and critical points such as the Malacca Strait.\nReuters reports its sources told them the goal would be to slow down Iran’s oil exports and make it more difficult to meet delivery contracts. The concept is that it would further disrupt the supply chains and the critical revenues Iran gains from oil exports. One source speculated to Reuters that exports could be reduced by some 750,000 barrels per day.\nIran is reported to have made more than $50 billion in each of the last two years from oil exports despite Western efforts to increase sanctions. Further, TankerTrakers.com reported earlier this week that it calculated “Iran's crude oil exports were up by exactly 50 percent during February vs January.”\nThe fleet of tankers servicing the Iranian oil trade also continues to grow. The watchdog group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) maintains adatabaseand says when it started in 2020 it listed 70 tankers. Today it lists over 510 tankers, many of which are known to be using false flags. TankerTrackers.com calculates the U.S. “has only blacklisted 234 (or 45 percent) of the 522 tankers involved in the Iran sanctions oil trade.”\nIran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate including citing its ability to close the critical Straits of Hormuz. The regime has in recent years taken a “tit-for-tat” response seizing tankers in the Persian Gulf after the U.S. attempted to seize oil cargos.Two Greek tankersand their crews were held for an extended period after the U.S. went after a cargo on a tanker disabled in Greek waters. Greek courts forced the U.S. to release the oil cargo but when the U.S. was successful in seizing another cargo Irantook more tankersincluding one undercharter to Chevron.\nReuters cites a speech by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian where he last week acknowledged the new U.S. efforts. The new Trump administration launched two waves of sanctions in its first weeks including a dozen tankers it said were involved in illegal ship-to-ship transfers. Pezeshkian reportedly said the new actions were creating uncertainties about how to unload their oil and gas cargos.\nIran has shown strong resilience by adapting to the sanctions and adopting new measures. Bloomberg this week reported the use of more Aframax and Suezman tankers versus VLCCs. They cited eight smaller tankers involved in transfer in February saying these vessels provide additional flexibility. They said these ships were able to deliver the oil to smaller Chinese ports.\nIran media was quick to carry today’s report from Reuters on the new efforts. Government officials have yet to respond."

        "content": "\nFailure by the U.S. Coast Guard to invest in maintaining and renewing its crumpling shore infrastructure and a lack of funding from the U.S. Congress has resulted in a significant increase in the amount required to carry out the work. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is again shining the spotlight on the agency’s mounting challenges, estimating that the USCG now requires $7 billion to rebuild its deteriorating shore infrastructures, more than double the amount required in 2019.\nGOA carried out a detailed assessment in 2019 of the Coast Guard’s shore infrastructures and made recommendations to manage the growing challenges. Based on USCG assessments, GAO determined that about 50 percent of the facilities were past their expected service life. The agency needed $2.6 billion to revamp the facilities comprising assets like piers, runways, and buildings. USCG it reports has about 40,000 shore infrastructure assets with a value of $24.5 billion.\nSix years later GAO finds little has been achieved and the agency is now grappling with an infrastructure maintenance backlog amounting to $7 billion. The Coast Guard admitted in a 2023 report that the condition of most of the facilities ranged from “mediocre to fair” and were contributing to the worsening operational challenges.\nThe Coast Guard cites budgetary constraints for the backlog, reporting the government’s budgets since 2019 failed to include requested funding levels that the agency identified were required to meet its targets in terms of shore infrastructure investments. A case in point is the 2025 financial year in which the agency requested $709 million but was only allocated $167 million by Congress.\nApart from budgetary constraints that have forced the deferment of maintenance, the agency is also attributing the surge in backlog to new facilities that are needed to accommodate new assets including the offshore patrol cutters (OPC). The agency is building 25 OPCs that will replace the aging medium endurance cutters.\n“We found that the Coast Guard-estimated $7 billion cost to address its shore infrastructure is understated because there are hundreds of additional projects that lack cost estimates, and the Coast Guard has not updated all of its existing cost estimates for inflation,” said GAO.\nIn its report, GAO highlights that the current shore infrastructure backlog cuts across recapitalization projects that include replacing assets that have reached the end of their useful life, new construction projects that include building a boat maintenance facility, and deferred depot-level maintenance projects, such as repaving an airfield. Also affected are critical infrastructures like housing units for service members and their families, training centers, and command centers.\nGAO reports it made six recommendations to the USCG in 2019, of which the Coast Guard has only fully addressed two while also taking steps toward three of the recommendations. It says the Coast Guard is in the process of systematically assessing the condition of its shore infrastructure but has not developed supporting details on project alternatives and trade-offs in congressional budget requests.\nThereport concludesthe USCG should be taking the recommended steps to more efficiently manage existing resources, including reducing costs. It would also provide the Coast Guard and Congress with better information to address the mounting shore infrastructure challenges."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump paused American tariffs on Canada and Mexico for the second time. The pause is the latest in a long series of changes: his first administration negotiated a zero-percent tariff deal in 2019 - the U.S. Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - but after winning the election in November 2024, Trump announced the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on most goods from USMCA members. The White House paused this tariff hike on February 3 before it entered into effect, then put it into action on March 4, then paused it again on Thursday.\nThe Thursday pause occurred in two phases. In the morning, Trump announced via social media that he would temporarily suspend the tariff increase on Mexico, but did not mention Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that tariffs on Canadian goods remained in effect. Later in the day, Trump signed two executive orders exempting both Mexican and Canadian goods for another month.\nThe pause is temporary, and the tariffs will resume on April 2 unless another solution is announced. Mexican and Canadian goods traded outside of the USMCA framework - a limited category that includes some Mexican-built vehicles - are still subject to 25 percent tariffs in the interim. An additional tariff of 10 percent on all Chinese goods remains in effect.\n\"[The pause] basically makes it more fair for our car manufacturers during this short interim period before April 2,\" Trump said. \"Long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening here.\"\nThe latest pause follows a sell-off in the stock market, the announcement of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods by the Mexican and Canadian governments, and a series of complaints from major American manufacturers - particularly automakers. The tightly integrated North American parts supply chain left American carmakers exposed to the added costs from paying tariffs at each border crossing, which they would have to pass on to consumers. By contrast, carmakers in Europe, Japan and Korea were not exposed to the tariffs, and this gave their products a new price advantage over American autos.\nAt the signing ceremony, Trump said that the pause had nothing to do with the markets. Following news of the new tariff pause, the Dow closed down by one percent and the Nasdaq by 2.6 percent, reflecting continued uncertainty in the market."

The Coast Guard highlights that the unique icebreaker celebrated its 49th year of operations after life extensions designed to keep the vessel operational until at least 2029 when the new icebreakerPolar Sentinelis scheduled to finally be completed.\nPolar Star’s crew performed icebreaking duties in McMurdo Sound, clearing routes to ensure safe passage for cargo vessels for McMurdo Station and New Zealand’s Scott Base.Polar Staralso conducted a crew exchange with the New Zealand Defense Force shipAotearoawhile it was operating in the region.\n\n\nThe annual mission was completed this week with the Polar Star departing McMurdo Station (USCG)\n\n“The surface ice conditions in McMurdo Sound were abnormally light this year, a welcome change of pace from the extreme conditions experienced last year,” said Captain Jeff Rasnake,Polar Star’s commanding officer. “Operation Deep Freeze presented a number of challenges, beyond those inherent in maintaining and operating a 49-year-old ship to complete this arduous mission. We benefitted tremendously from a great deployment plan which allowed us to take advantage of favorable conditions and use the elements to stay ahead of events without pressing the cutter or crew excessively.”\nPolar Staralso worked with the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to support a secure and sustainable Southern Ocean. It was the first United States surface asset to support CCAMLR. The crew’s efforts to observe and monitor fishing and other activity on the high seas safeguarded resources and U.S. national interests in the Antarctic region.\nThe vessel and her crew have transited nearly 16,000 miles since departing its Seattle homeport in November with stops in Honolulu, Sydney, and McMurdo Station. To celebrate its 49th year of service, the vessel also visited Cape Polar Star in the northern part of the Ross Sea. Cape Polar Star was named after the icebreaker for the scientific support provided by the cutter in the area during Operation Deep Freeze 86.\nPolar Staris the United States’ only asset capable of providing access to both polar regions. The Seattle-based cutter is a 399-foot heavy polar icebreaker commissioned in 1976. It is 13,500 tons and is 84 feet wide with a 34-foot draft. The cutter's six diesel and three gas turbine engines produce up to 75,000 horsepower.\n\n\n\nAfter years of delays, design challenges, and cost overruns, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Navy Integrated Program Office received approval on December 19 to begin building thePolar Sentinel, the first of three planned heavy icebreakers. The order for the vessel was placed with VT Halter which was later acquired by Bollinger Shipyards. The new vessel is slated to be larger at 460 feet (140 meters) in length and 23,300 displacement tons.\nDuring a speech in January days after taking office, Donald Trump said the U.S. would launch a massive building program for new icebreakers. In total, he said there could be 40 vessels built although due to the complexity of the heavy icebreaker, it is unlikely that all the vessels would be of that class. The U.S. currently only has thePolar Staras the heaviest vessel, along with the medium icebreakerHealywhich has been in operation since 2000, and the recent acquisition of commercial polar icebreakerAiviq, renamedStoris, which is expected to be commissioned in 2026 to provide bridging capacity until the new fleet is in service."

They asserted that nothing illegal was happening, but they would investigate the allegations.\nAccording to the newspaper, Opposition Leader Tina Browne asked the Ministry of Transport to respond to the reports that vessels registered in the Cook Islands have been “arrested overseas” on allegations of transporting arms to Russia or involvement in the shadow fleet.

The Cook Islands News reports he assured parliament that if there were any merit to the allegations “rightful steps” would be taken.\nThe tankerEagle Swhich was detained for over 50 days in Finland after the Christmas Day incident with the undersea cables is registered in the Cook Islands. The vessel was transferred to the Cook Islands’ vessel registry in July 2023 and its registered owners are listed as a company in Dubai. In addition, the U.S. sanctioned four tankers registered in the Cook Islands in its sweeping January 2025 package.\nThe Ministry of the Foreign Affairs of the Cook Islands said it is well aware of the situation and is taking the global media coverage “very seriously.” The government has repeatedly denied the allegations that Maritime Cook Islands has become a haven for Russian-linked tankers. It says that they comply with international sanctions. Maritime Cook Islands is an outside manager employed to administer the registry.\nThe Cook Islands however maintains an open registry with the media reports stating it added over seven million DWT of tankers and became a top 30 registry in 2024. The Ministry said it had not expected the number of vessels in the registry to increase so dramatically noting it is currently over 780 foreign vessels.\nThey asserted that there are no illegal operators as vessels have either been deregistered or have voluntarily removed themselves from the registry. A dozen tankers were removed from the registry in July 2024 for violations. Nicholas responded to Browne asking for some time to conduct a review and said if the allegations were proven to be accurate then there would be an investigation and appropriate actions taken."

        "content": "Russia’s energy shipping company Sovcomflot reported financial results on Friday, March 7, citing the continuing impact of Western sanctions on its operations and warning that the pressures on its operations were likely to increase this year. This came as Donald Trump posted on social media that he was “strongly considering” additional sanctions on Russia to push it to the negotiating table with Ukraine.\nSovcomflot told investors that Western sanctions have continued to erode its profits. The press release said, “The company's operations were subject to the influence of geopolitical factors and illegally imposed sanctions by unfriendly countries. The company continues to work systematically to minimize the negative impact of sanctions restrictions on its activities, consistently adhering to high standards of maritime safety and the quality of maritime operations.”\nAmong the factors cited was that some vessels had to be idled which the company said created “operational difficulties.” Operating costs for the year were up approximately 13 percent. This comes even after Sovcomflot downsized operations previously selling tankers and transferred vessels to companies outside the sanctions.\nThe result was that 2024 net profits were down by over half (55 percent) to $424 million. Revenues were down by 20 percent ($1.87 billion) as the company has also had to deal with the price cap imposed on Russian oil by the G7.\n“New large-scale sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department, introduced after the reporting date, became an additional limiting factor in the company's operations,” wrote Sovcomflot. It was referencing the January 10 announcement by the Biden administration. Before leaving office, Joe Biden imposed the largest sanction effort to date which included a new listing of Sovcomflot. The Treasury identified as blocked property 69 vessels, including 54 oil and product tankers and four liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, owned by Sovcomflot.\nDonald Trump is now threatening to further increase the pressure on Russia writing on social media today that Russia is “’pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield” causing him to “seriously consider” large-scale banking sanctions, other sanctions, and tariffs. He said if enacted the sanctions would be in place until a cease fire had been achieved and a final agreement on peace is reached.\nRussia is reportedly anxious to loosen the sanctions which have placed an increasing hold on its economy. Energy products are one of the primary sources of revenue for Russia."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The Trump administration is reported to be building out its plans to penalize China for its subsidy of the shipbuilding industry by seeking international support while also linking it to the rebuilding ofU.S. shipbuildingand breaking China’s monopoly on cargo cranes. Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have seen drafts of executive orders proposed to Trump that follow up on the recommendations of the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office and the announced White House office on shipbuilding.\nSpeaking to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said, “We used to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore, very much. But we’re going to make them very fast, very soon.”\nThe Trade Representative in the last days of the Biden administration concluded an investigation into China’s shipbuilding policies. The report called for steps to reign in China’s unfair advantages in shipbuilding which it concluded were built through government subsidies and policies. Unconfirmed reports recently said the Trump administration had taken the Biden report and was looking at fees on shipping lines using Chinese-built ships and calling at U.S. ports.\nIn anexclusive reportfrom Reuters, it said it has seen a draft of the executive order proposing fees on all ships entering U.S. ports from carriers that have Chinese-built ships in their fleets. The fees would be regardless of where the individual ship was built or registered.\n\"The national security and economic prosperity of the United States is further endangered by the People's Republic of China's unfair trade practices in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors,\" the draft order says according to Reuters.\nIt highlights that the draft changes from theprevious reportsin that it widens the potential number of ships subject to the fees. It does not say how the fees would be calculated but drops previsions that limited the fees to fleets with 25 percent or more of the ships on order or for delivery from China.\nThe draft order according to Reuters also calls on the U.S. to “engage allies and partners” to enact similar fees. According to Reuters if they did not support the U.S. they could “risk retaliation,” which is emerging as one of the Trump administration's bargaining tactics. Retaliation has become a key piece of the emerging trade war and tariffs and Trump’s report that on April 2 the U.S. will enact reciprocal tariffs on any nation that imposes tariffs on U.S. goods.\nThe report highlights that the sweeping fees would reach beyond the major Chinese carriers including COSCO and its subsidiary Orient Overseas Container Lines (OOCL). By including all fleets with Chinese-built ships, it would impact all the major carriers including MSC Mediterranean Shipping, Maersk, CMA CGM, and others.\nThe draft also links to the separate issue that emerged over Chinese cargo-handling equipment according to Reuters. During the Biden administration, the dominance of China’s ZPMC (Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Company) was highlighted and accusations emerged that China controlled the cranes or was using them to spy on the United States. Biden moves to place tariffs on the large cranes used by ports to load and unload containers and to reshore a U.S. capability to build large cargo cranes.\nAdditional tariffs would be imposed on Chinese-made cargo equipment according to Reuters’ review of the draft executive order.\nThe draft on the response to Chinese shipbuilding subsidies comes after The Wall Street Journal reported the White House was also working on a sweeping executive order for the shipbuilding industry. It reportedly will order Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to review procurement as it relates to shipbuilding and proposes raising wages for shipyard workers involved with nuclear shipbuilding.\nTrump during his meeting at the White House on Thursday with Chairman and CEO of CMA CGM Group Rodolphe Saadé alluded to major steps coming soon in the shipbuilding and shipping industries."

        "content": "\nThe Canadian Coast Guard provided an update on the ongoing operations to salvage the grounded containershipMSC Baltic IIIsaying the focus remains on the fuel aboard the ship and the prevention of environmental damage. While there is daily activity, the Coast Guard reports weather and ice conditions are impacting the operations about 50 percent of the time and many days teams are not able to get aboard the vessel.\nThe 37,636 dwt containership blacked out on February 15 while approximately 12 nautical miles outside the entrance to Bay of Islands, Newfoundland. The crew was removed uninjured in a challenging operation involving a Canadian rescue helicopter while the vessel was driven ashore in a remote cove on the western side of the island.\nBased on the current conditions, Bruce English, Senior Response Officer, Marine Environmental and Hazards Response, for the Canadian Coast Guard, said their focus is not on speed but on minimizing the impact of the incident. He was unable to provide a timeline while speculating the operation would involve a combination of overland and a barge alongside first to remove the fuel oil and then the cargo.\n\n\nLose ice has clogged the remote cove where the vessel is located with temperatures and winds challenging the operation (Canadian Coast Guard)\n\nMSC Mediterranean Shipping Company as the operator of the vessel has appointed T&T Salvage and the Eastern Canada Response Corporation to develop the salvage plan and manage the environmental dangers. English reports those companies have brought in resources from around the world and are staging equipment on Newfoundland for the response. An ice class tug and barge arrived in Corner Brook carrying tanks some of which will be put onshore for eventual use as they remove the approximately 1.7 million liters of heavy fuel and marine gas oil onboard. The Coast Guard believes the majority of the required equipment is now onsite for the operation.\nAccessing the vessel from the shoreside with heavy equipment requires upgrades to a road into the area. The operation is in the final approval stages from Canada for the roadwork and English reports a draft plan showed that it would take approximately two weeks of work to make the road usable for the trucks and other equipment. Previously they had said the salvage operation might also build a walkway to the bow of the vessel to increase access.\nThe salvage teams have been aboard and they confirmed to the Canadian Coast Guard that the vessel has significant hull and structural damage although it is now resting solidly on the seabed. English said that they have been advised there is flooding in the three of the holds, the tanks, and the engine room. The vessel can not be safely refloated at this stage.\nWhen the operation can commence, the fuel oil in the tanks will need to be heated before it can be pumped off the ship. However, the salvage teams have determined the cranes aboard the ship are operational which will be helpful for the cargo operations.\nMSC in a statement reported that “we have secured the hazardous containers still aboard to avoid any risk of marine pollution and have a plan for their removal.” The Canadian Coast Guard said that MSC had informed it that two empty containers were damaged but posed no risks. The vessel has approximately 470 containers, over half of which are empty, aboard.\nUnder Canadian law, the vessel owner is responsible for the costs. The Canadian Coast Guard declined to speculate on the cost of the operation."

Turkish authorities have not commented on the allision where the tanker was hit by a Turkish-owned containership, but it was captured on video which was broadcast on Turkish TV.\nThe tanker namedMia(149,686 dwt) was anchored approximately 5 miles offshore near Istanbul. The vessel’s ownership is considered to be murky with a company registered in the Seychelles listed as the owner, no known manager, and no inspections on file since 2014. The U.S. sanctioned the vessel in 2024 and cited it as being registered in Guyana. The authorities in Guyana however reported that it was a false flag as the ship has no ownership ties to the country which operates a closed registry. The U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control also places a strong likelihood the tanker also operated under the aliasesMagusandFreedom.\nThe videos show theOrita(8,000 dwt) striking the container ship as the vessel appears to be turning. It is a small container ship with a capacity of 672 TEU. It was built in 2005, registered in Panama, and managed by a Turkish company.

        "content": "The Canadian government today, March 7, marked the contract signing for a new polar icebreaker to be built at Seaspan Shipyard making official an order first announced in 2021. Under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the government is renewing the fleets of the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard including two heavy polar icebreakers providing the Canadian Coast Guard the ability to operate self-sufficiently year-round in the high Arctic down to temperatures at -50° C.\nThe contract ceremony was led by the Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, on behalf of the Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Quebec Lieutenant. The government of Canada reported the value of the contract at C$ 3.15 billion (before tax) (US$2.2 billion) with the vessel to be built at Seaspan’s Vancouver Shipyards in British Columbia.\n“The contract awarded to Seaspan's Vancouver Shipyards for the build of a new polar icebreaker underscores our dedication to ensuring safe and efficient navigation in Arctic regions,” said Wilkinson. “This state-of-the-art vessel will not only strengthen our icebreaking fleet, but will also support critical scientific research and environmental protection efforts, and ensure national security in the Arctic.\"\n\n\nJohn McCarthy, CEO of Seaspan, along with Minster Wilkinson at the contract ceremony (Seaspan)\n\nWith the contract now in place, Seaspan reports it is ready to cut steel on this ship and begin full-rate construction. It has scheduled the official start of construction for April 2025. The other polar icebreaker is being built by Chantier Davie Canada located in Quebec. That shipyard was awarded a contract valued at C$16.47 million (including taxes) (US$11.5 million) in September 2024 to advance work on a Polar-class icebreaker.\nSeaspan highlights it will mark the first time a  polar icebreaker has been built in Canada in more than 60 years.  Building the complex and densely-outfitted multi-mission ship they report represents a significant challenge for the shipbuilders and when completed the vessels will have more advanced capabilities than the Canadian Coast Guard’s current heavy icebreakers.\nThe polar icebreakers will be 158 meters (518 feet) with a design displacement of 26,00 tons. They will have more than 40 MW of power with an ice-class azimuthing propulsion system. Functional design of the polar icebreaker was completed in 2024 by Seaspan working alongside established Finnish companies who have extensive experience in designing Arctic-going vessels.\nCanada in November 2024 signed the ICE Pact Memorandum of Understanding with the United States and Finland to deepen existing cooperation, strengthen their shipbuilding industries, and allow new equipment and capabilities to be produced more quickly. The three countries committed to working more closely together to engage to help meet future global demand for Arctic and polar vessels.\nThe United States approved the contract for the construction of its first heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Sentinal, in December. It is the first of three heavy Polar icebreakers the U.S. ordered from VT Halter, which was later acquired by Bollinger. After long delays in the design phase, the U.S. expects to complete its first polar icebreaker in 2029."

        "content": "South Africa Begins Safety Audits on its Commercial Fishing Fleet\nSouth Africa has launched nationwide safety inspections on all its commercial fishing vessels. Last week, the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) said that the audits are in response to a series of recent fatal fishing incidents. This saw eighteen fishermen lose their lives last year, leading to calls for higher safety standards in the fishing sector.\nThe safety inspections began last week at Port Elizabeth (Gqeberha) and will be conducted in the next four months, covering all other major fishing ports across South Africa. Specifically, the audit will focus on fishing vessels that have been involved in major maritime incidents. Other targeted fishing vessels include those built or registered before 1998.\n“The audits play a vital role in shaping a robust fishing vessel safety improvement plan, aimed at preventing future maritime incidents,” said SAMSA Acting CEO Mbalenhle Golding.\nSAMSA earlier reported that its rescue team had to deal with significantly higher numbers of maritime accidents in 2024 compared with previous years. Top on the list of incidents involved commercial fishing vessels. The most tragic was the sinking of the 63-year-old FVLepantoback in May, resulting in the deaths of 11 crewmembers. The vessel capsized around 34 nautical miles off the coast of Kommetjie town, near Cape Town.\nIncidentally, five months later, the sister vessel of FVLepanto, the 62-year old FVArmana, caught fire and sank off Cape Town. All the 20 crew members evacuated successfully. While the age of the South African commercial fishing fleet has been brought to question, there are apparent violations to safety and operational procedures, according to a preliminary report on the sinking of FVLepanto. The report released in December by SAMSA revealed the troubling state of maritime safety in South Africa.\nIn the case ofLepanto, investigators found glaring gaps in crew training on basic life-saving equipment. Survivors also confirmed that the accommodation doors on the port and starboard side were left open at the time of incident. These watertight doors are required to be closed at all times while the vessel is at sea.\nOther issues include modifications to the vessel without complying with stability calculations. For instance, wood decking had been replaced with concrete decking, which may not have been approved."

The modernization and expansion program has been ongoing for the last three years, under a 30-year Build-Operate-Transfer concession signed in 2019 with the Saudi Ports Authority (Mawani).\nThe $800 million upgrade has seen the terminal’s capacity double from 1.8 million TEU to 4 million TEU. The capacity will further rise to 5 million TEU in a subsequent expansion phase.\nThe new terminal spans a total quay length of 2,150 meters, including a deep-water quay with an 18-meter depth, capable of accommodating up to five ultra-large container vessels simultaneously.\nIn response to the growing demand for perishable cargo, the terminal’s capacity for reefer containers has also been expanded from 1,200 to 2,340. In addition, DP World has developed a facility for inspecting up to 75 reefers at one time - the biggest such port-centric facility in Saudi Arabia.\nIn line with DP World’s carbon neutrality strategy, the new terminal features automated and electrified yard cranes. The operator said that the target is to reduce CO2 emissions at the terminal by 50 percent in the next five years. Other measures in the pipeline include floating solar platforms, electrified trucks and water recycling systems.\nDP World has been operating in Jeddah port since 1999. In fact, it was the first concession for the operator outside its UAE home base.\nWith Jeddah a crucial link for Saudi Arabia’s global trade, DP World is further investing in a large logistics park, adjacent to its South Container Terminal. The 415,000 square meter Jeddah Logistics Park is the largest integrated facility of its kind in Saudi Arabia. It will offer warehousing, distribution and freight forwarding services, further cementing Jeddah’s position as a key regional trade hub connecting Africa, Asia and Europe. The construction of the facility began last year in May and is expected to be completed by Q2 2026.\nThe launch of the Gemini Cooperation between Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd has come with liner connectivity advantages for Jeddah Port. Under Gemini, five new shipping services were added to three Saudi ports, including Jeddah, Dammam and Jubail. On top, Jeddah was selected as one of the regional hubs for the Gemini cooperation. The new shipping services connected the three Saudi ports to other international terminals, including Port Said in Egypt, Tangier in Morocco, Algeciras in Spain, Mundra and Pipavav in India."

Like all older museum ships, she began to develop issues with leakage, and in 2022 she transited to the nearby Gulf Copper yard to begin a two-year comprehensive refit. Gulf Copper bought a larger (used) drydock to accommodateTexas, completed all below-the-waterline work, and successfully refloated the aging vessel.\nHowever,Texasdid not immediately have a place to go. Talks between the Battleship Texas Foundation and the board for Galveston Wharves (Port of Galveston) broke down in October, and the port authority called off negotiations. USSTexaswas originally slated to berth in the area of piers 19-21, but this would have put her on the busy and narrow shipping channel, raising a variety of concerns about safety of navigation and hurricane preparedness (related to storm surge concerns). Port director and CEO Rodger Rees told the Houston Chronicle that the conversation was \"not getting anywhere,\" so the board pulled the plug in late October.\nThe two sides resumed discussions in November, and eventually settled on nearby Pier 15. The site is an industrial wharf that has low utilization and does not figure prominently in port expansion plans, according to Galveston Wharves. It is still within walking distance of the port's busy cruise terminals, and the slip is located off the main channel.\n\"After years of hard work and dedication, we’re thrilled to have the support of the Wharves Board to bringTexasto Pier 15 in Galveston- just a short walk from Pier 21 and the historic Galveston Strand.Texas, the last ship of its kind, will promote tourism, educate future generations, and create a visitor experience worthy of her crew and legacy,\" said the Battleship Texas Foundation in a statement."

        "content": "\nAt the beginning of the year, the IRGC Navy (Nedsa) announced that it would hold a series of major exercises in January, to be concluded by the Nedsa's \"largest ever fleet review\" on January 27.\nNothing quite fitting this description appears to have occurred, but Iran’s other naval force, the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy (Nedaja) assembled a substantial sail-past of ships at the conclusion of the naval element of Exercise Zulfiqar 1403 on February 26.The presence of ships on this fleet review is of some interest, at a time when the new US administration has warned that it could commence stop and searches of tankers in international waters believed to be carrying sanctioned Iranian oil. At a time when the Nedaja is limiting its press releases revealing the make–up and location of its operationally-deployed assets which could be tasked to protect such tankers, it is of interest to note which ships remain in home waters.\nThe Nedaja has not released the names of vessels seen on February 26 off Bandar Abbas, but it is possible to identify more than ten that were involved. Often, Iranian media sources splice in video from previous exercises to bulk up the assets on display, but in this instance the choppy sea state and meteorological conditions common to all the imagery released provide some veracity.\nThe Alvand and Moudge Class frigates IRINSAlvand(F71) and IRINSJamaran(F76) led the fleet, followed by IRINSBayandor(F81). Two submarines were spotted:  IRINSFateh(S920) and an unidentified Ghadir Class midget submarine struggling in the heavy swell. Kaman and Sina Class fast attack craft IRINSNeyzeh(P231) and IRINSZereh(P235) were also suffering in the swell, and in separate footage the Kaivan Class patrol boat IRINSTiran(P202), first launched in USCG’s Curtis Bay (MD) yard in 1957, was seen launching a 35km-range Nasr anti-ship missile, developed from the Chinese C-704.\nNumbers were made up by IRINSSirjan(K472) and a second unidentified Delvar Class logistics vessel, and by the Hendijan Class auxiliary IRINSBahregan(A1406).  The largest vessel in the Nedaja, the converted tanker IRINSMakran(K441) was not featured in the sail-past but could be seen in the background.\nKnown to be out on deployment at the moment are the Nedaja’s 100th Flotilla, made up of IRINSBushehr(K422) and IRINSLavan(L514), on the annual winter training cruise with 220 naval cadets aboard. The flotilla was due to leave Mumbai on February 28.\nThe Nedaja had announced last November that the 100th Flotilla was heading to the Red Sea to rotate into the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden security mission. With the 100th Flotilla clearly elsewhere, it is not clear when the 99th Flotilla led by IRINSDena(F75) left the Red Sea, as there was no normal homecoming announcement, but IRINSDenawas spotted in Port Klang, Malaysia on February 24.\nRear Admiral Shahram Irani, the Nedaja commander, had indicated to Press TV in February that there were a further two unaccounted-for flotillas currently deployed in the Indian Ocean.  It appears therefore that the Nedaja is maintaining a high level of operational deployments at present, which - given the obsolescent status of most of its fleet - is an impressive maintenance and manning achievement. Given the security situation in the region at present, it will need to be sustained.\nThe Iranians usually conduct Exercise Maritime Security Belt with the Chinese and Russian navies in mid-March, and the suspected Russian contingent appears to still be on track to make the date. The Steregushchiy Class Project 20380 missile corvettesHero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov(F339) andRezkiy(F343) and the oilerPechenga(IMO 7710977) were on March 3 conducting a live firing exercise in the Eastern Indian Ocean."

The Canal Authority is reporting it was a carefully planned, complex operation to bring the heavily damaged vessel through the canal on its way to Greece.\nOffloading of the 150,000 tons of crude aboard the tanker was completed in December 2024 after nearly a month-long operation managed by Ambrey and Mega Tugs. The tanker run by Greece’s Delta Tankers was northbound in the Red Sea when it was struck in August and disabled. After the crew abandoned the tanker, the Houthis went aboard and set off multiple explosions starting oil fires and destroying the bridge in addition to the previous flooding and damage to the engine room.\nThe Suez Canal Authority reports it oversaw the offloading operation after the vessel was towed into the port south of the canal. The Authority’s pollution control vesselKasht2 was positioned nearby during the offloading while the operation was monitored by teams in case of pollution.\n\n\nBridge and control systems were destroyed by the Houthis (SCA)\n\nPlanning for the transit took weeks according to Lieutenant General Osama Rabie, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority. He highlights that the 274-meter (899-foot) tanker has no steering control and was a challenge as a large dead ship tow.\nThe tanker was being towed by theAigaion Pelagos, a large anchor handler operated by Megatugs of Greece. The Suez Canal Authority assigned its largest tug,Baraka, along with theMohamed Bashir,Suez 1, andSuez 2to the transit. Tug Suez 2 was attached at the stern to act as a rudder to help guide the tanker.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transit began Saturday, March 8, and took approximately 24 hours. They initially positioned the dead ship to enter the Suez Canal and then conducted the transit in stages. They paused in Great Bitter Lake while the southbound convoy passed. It continued in stages pausing for crew changes. In total 13 pilots were used to guide theSounion.\nThe tow operation reached the northern terminus of the canal on March 10.

        "content": "\nThe Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) has unveiled its latest wreck find: the remains of the steamerWestern Reserve,which went down 132 years ago in Lake Superior.\nWestern Reservewas a historically significant ship. She entered service in 1890 and was among the earliest lakers ever built out of steel plate. Her novel design allowed her to carry heavier loads at higher speeds than competing wooden-hulled vessels.\nOn August 30, 1892,Western Reservewas under way on a ballast voyage to the port of Two Harbors to take on a load of iron ore. She had 32 crewmembers and passengers on board, including shipowner Capt. Peter Minch, his wife, his two children, his sister-in-law and her daughter.\nWhen they reached Whitefish Bay, rough weather picked up and the captain ordered the anchor dropped to wait for calmer conditions. When the winds died down, they heaved anchor and headed out into Lake Superior. At 2100 hours that night, they were hit by a squall and the ship - which was just one and a half years old - began to break up.\nThe crew launched two lifeboats, and all got away. However, one of the lifeboats capsized as soon as the crew boarded, leaving just one boat afloat as the ship slipped below. Two crewmen from the lost lifeboat were pulled from the water by the survivors.\nThe second boat nearly made it to safety twice. A steamer passed in the night, but did not see the survivors. At about 0730 hours the next morning, the boat approached the Upper Peninsula's shores near the Deer Park Life-Saving station. The boat flipped in the surf, sending the shipowner, his family and the surviving crewmembers into the water.\nThe sole survivor, wheelman Harry Stewart, managed to make it to shore on an uninhabited beach. After making it to safety, he told investigators that theWestern Reservehad begun to break apart in heavy seas; further inquiries revealed that the shipbuilder had used contaminated, brittle steel for the vessel's construction, leaving it vulnerable to cracking from metal fatigue. The sinking led to stronger standards for steel plate in U.S. vessel construction.\nIn late summer 2024, the GLSHS' research vesselDavid Boyddiscovered the wreck site on sidescan sonar, right at the edge of detection range. A follow-up deployment with an ROV confirmed the identity of the wreck.\nThe survey revealed that the wreck had broken in half, and the stern section landed first in 600 feet of water. The bow section came down on top of the stern.\n\"Knowing how the 300-footWestern Reservewas caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" said GLSHS director of marine operations Darryl Ertel."

After launching an independent terminal company in 2023, Hapag-Lloyd reports it has acquired a controlling interest in one of the independent terminals in Le Havre, France.\nHanseatic Global Terminals, a wholly owned subsidiary based in Rotterdam, was announced in July 2024. Hapag said at the time the aim was to increase operational efficiency and promote sustainable growth that will benefit customers and partners worldwide. It says that terminal and infrastructure investments represent a crucial component of the strategic agenda for Hanseatic Global Terminals.\nThe company acquired 60 percent of the shares of CNMP LH from Seafrigo Group, a company specializing in temperature-controlled food logistics. Seafrigo will continue to hold a 40 percent stake in the terminal operator.\n“By acquiring a majority stake in the CNMP LH terminal in Le Havre, we are strengthening our position in one of our core European markets,” said Dheeraj Bhatia, CEO of Hanseatic Global Terminals (HGT). “At the same time, we are continuing to expand our global terminal portfolio while paving the way for targeted investments to enhance efficiency.”\n“This will significantly raise the profile of our joint terminal as an important gateway for container transports in the Port of Le Havre,” said Eric Barbé, President of Seafrigo Group. The companies projected that the container throughput of the CNMP LH terminal is expected to grow in the coming years – including in the attractive reefer container business.\nCNMP (Compagnie Nouvelle de Manutentions Portuaires) highlights that it is a historical stevedoringcompany operating in Le Havre since 1920. It has a multimodal terminal with river barge access and 1 km (.6 miles) of rail connection. It is an independent service provider to multiple carriers calling at the port.\nLe Havre, the companies emphasized numbers among the 10 largest ports in Europe. They called it the most important port for sea transport to and from France reporting it has an annual container throughput of 3 million TEU and offers hinterland connections to Paris.\nHapag called it a strategic acquisition for Hanseatic Global Terminals in keeping with its strategy of expansion. HGT manages a portfolio of stakes in 21 port terminals and complementary logistics services across 12 countries and four continents, with plans to expand its stakes to over 30 terminals by 2030."

Based in Galveston, Texas, and a division of Malaysia’s MISC, the company reports one of its existing purpose-built Lightering Support Vessels has been selected for the hybrid conversion project.\nThe company operates a fleet of these vessels reporting it performed more than 15,500 STS transfers making it a market leader in the U.S. Gulf region. It also provides lightering operations in offshore Uruguay and the Brazilian Basin.\nAET has signed an agreement with marine battery company Fleetzero for the hybrid power project. Under the agreement, one of AET's Lightering Support Vessels (LSV) will be retrofitted with a plug-in hybrid-electric system. The Lightering Support vessels are used to transport equipment and crew to conduct ship-to-ship cargo transfer operations.\n“By integrating plug-in hybrid electric solutions into our fleet, we are transforming ambition into action to deliver more energy with less emissions,” commented Zahid Osman, President & Group CEO of MISC Group. “This pilot project also allows us to evaluate the feasibility and operational performance of this technology, paving the way for potential deployment across AET’s and potentially MISC’s fleet.”\nAfter the conversion project, the vessel will operate primarily on battery power, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 82 percent according to the companies when compared to conventional LSVs on a tank-to-wake basis. They estimated it will help the vessel to avoid 1,220 tonnes of greenhouse gases per year and significantly reduce fuel consumption and maintenance costs.\nFleetzero, a start-up focusing on marine battery applications reports its products are designed by mariners and engineers from the world’s best automotive EV companies, the company’s Leviathan solution incorporates the best automotive EV technology but is fundamentally built for the unique challenges and requirements at sea. Its battery storage solutions are modular to provide a scalable power range between 200 kWh to hundreds of Megawatt-hours of energy storage. They are designed and tested in accordance with ABS, DNV, RINA, Lloyds, and ClassNK rules.\nThe base agreement for the project was signed in December 2024 with the companies reporting more details will be released in the near future.\nFleetzero in March 2024 reported it had received a strategic investment from MOL Plus, the venture capital operation of Mitsui O.S. K. Lines. The companies reported they would be exploring the application of the battery system on MOL’s vessels."

The contract for the other large polar icebreaker was confirmed with Seaspan in Vancouver with both vessels being part of the country’s National Shipbuilding Strategy.\nDavie has been contributing to the program for the two icebreakers which were first announced in May 2021, including a contract last fall for design work. Chantier Davie has already played a critical role in supporting Canada’s fleets, receiving over C$2.8 billion (US$1.9 billion) in contracts from 2012 to 2023 for various types of work on ships for the Canadian Coast Guard, the Royal Canadian Navy, and Transport Canada. The orders for the icebreakers come as the National Shipbuilding Strategy is marking its 15th anniversary and government officials highlighting it has contributed to Canadian shipyards delivering eight large vessels and 34 small vessels to the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard while supporting federal fleets with critical repair, refit, and maintenance work.\nDavie reports work will begin in 2025 on its icebreaker project which it values at C$3.25 billion (before tax) (US$2.25 billion). Delivery on the design they are calling Polar Max to Canada by 2030. On Friday, March 7, the government of Canada reported the value of the contract at C$3.15 billion (before tax) (US$2.2 billion) for asimilar vesselto be built at Seaspan’s Vancouver Shipyards in British Columbia.\n\n\n\n“The contract awarded to Chantier Davie Canada for the build of a new polar icebreaker underscores our dedication to ensuring safe and efficient navigation in Arctic regions,” said Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Quebec Lieutenant. “This state-of-the-art vessel will not only strengthen our icebreaking fleet, but will also support critical scientific research and environmental protection efforts, and ensure national security in the Arctic.”\nDavie reports it will be the first vessel built under the trilateral partnership announced in November 2024 between Canada, Finland, and the United States. Davie acquired Helsinki Shipyard in 2023 and it will provide support to the project. They note that Helsinki Shipyard has built more than half of the world’s icebreakers. Davie reports it plans to implement a workforce exchange, enabling Québec employees to learn world-class icebreaker construction expertise first-hand from their Finnish colleagues.\nWhile the early phase of the polar icebreaker construction is underway, Davie reports modernization of its Lévis Shipyard will continue, giving it time to accelerate the hiring of skilled workers across all trades. According to the company, this will enable it to leverage its Canadian supply chain sooner than anticipated, while ensuring the completed polar icebreaker is delivered from Lévis.\nThe Canadian Coast Guard currently has 18 icebreakers of varying sizes and capabilities, making it the second-largest icebreaking fleet in the world. Canadian officials said these larger, more powerful polar icebreakers will ensure the Coast Guard’s operations continue at higher latitudes for longer periods while allowing it to strengthen Arctic security, advance high Arctic science, and better respond to maritime emergencies."

It would also benefit the port by providing lower-cost electricity, according to ABP.\nThe panels will be mounted at a fixed angle on floating pontoons, which will be anchored to the bottom of the dock. The array of 47,000 panels would cover about a third of the entire surface area, leaving the remainder open for leisure usage - notably shoreside and pierside fishing. ABP notes that using the water area for power generation also leaves land free and unencumbered for future port development. All going well, the project could be completed in as little as 9-12 months after planning approval is received.\nABP carried out wildlife surveys and assessments to ensure that the array would have no significant impacts, and it held two public planning meetings to solicit input from residents.\nThe port company has bigger plans for Barrow's long-term expansion, to include new infrastructure to support offshore wind operations and a new jetty."

        "content": "\nThe governments of South Korea and Japan plan to use maritime trade as a bargaining chip to avoid the unfortunate fates of Canada and Mexico, the first two U.S. allies hit by the White House's tariff proposals. Both Japan and South Korea have shown interest in a big-ticket LNG export project from the state of Alaska, and Korea is also pitching its shipbuilding capabilities as a way to build up American maritime power.\nSouth Korea's trade and industry minister, Ahn Duk-Geun, met last week with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to talk about cooperation on shipbuilding and tech industry development. As an outcome of the discussion, Ahn's office said that Korea will be setting up a shipbuilding cooperation task force drawing on multiple government agencies, including foreign affairs and defense. The U.S. Department of Commerce will set up a similar working group.\nAhn told Korean media that the Trump administration is interested in accessing South Korea's sophisticated naval shipbuilding capabilities. The U.S. Navy is struggling to overcome cost and schedule issues with almost all of its major shipbuilding programs, in part because of supply chain and labor recruitment issues; South Korea has the world's second-biggest shipbuilding industrial base, and though it has labor issues of its own, it does have a much larger pool of skilled tradesmen to draw upon. One of its yards, Hyundai Heavy Industries, has built Aegis-equipped destroyers.\nAccording to Business Korea, Ahn offered priority access to newbuild slots at Korean shipyards for package orders of warships, tankers and icebreakers - in return for guaranteed safety from U.S. tariffs. Those slots are hard to come by, as the orderbooks at Korea's Big Three yards are booked through 2027-8 in a hot commercial newbuild market.\n\"At this point we don’t know how the Trump administration will play out its trade policies in the long term. So what’s most urgent now is to secure a communication channel and keep negotiating in favor of our firms,\" Ahn said.\nThe other big offer on the table is the prospect of Asian investment in the long-stalled Alaska LNG project, a proposed pipeline and export terminal that would commercialize vast quantities of natural gas from the remote North Slope. The terminal near Anchorage would liquefy up to 20 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG for export, but at an eye-watering construction cost of $44 billion.\n\"Currently, our country's energy supply is heavily skewed towards the Middle East, and imports of U.S. energy are important for energy security, so we are actively reviewing this,\" Ahn said. \"We are also considering ways for private businesses to diversify energy import channels.\"\nJapan is also in the running for a role in Alaska LNG, which had been all but defunct until the new flurry of diplomatic activity. In February, President Donald Trump described an agreement with Japan to offtake \"historic\" amounts of gas from the as-yet-unbuilt terminal.\n\"The administration is working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investment of trillions of dollars each,\" President Donald Trump said in his recent joint session address."

        "content": "Germany’s trade union Ver.di Nord (United Services Union) is launching a broad and escalating strike in Northern Germany this week which will close the Kiel Canal and impact parts of the Port of Hamburg. Officials are warning even after the three-day strike there are expected to be lasting repercussions and delays.\nA vital waterway for short sea and feeder shipping in the Baltic region, the Kiel Canal was due to close Monday evening, March 10, and will remain closed through the day shift on Thursday, March 13. Ships have been ordered to clear the canal with no new shipping being permitted to enter the canal for most of the day on Monday to provide time for ships to clear the waterway. The gates at both ends of the canal were due to be closed by 2200 Monday evening.\n“Nothing will be moving,” warned a spokesperson for Ver.di. “No ships will be able to go in or out.” In addition, the spokesperson said, “Ver.di has called on the employees of the Waterways and Shipping Office to go on a warning strike so that the federal government can also feel the effects.”\nThe so-called warning strike is a short-term, limited action by the union under German law. It is done to call attention to their cause which in this case is contract negotiations for public service employees. Announcing the strike, the union lamented that offers had not been put forth ahead of the negotiations. The next round of contract talks is scheduled for March 14-16.\nThe union says wants the terms of the new contract to help to increase the attractiveness of jobs in the public sector, combat staff shortages and reduce the burden on employees. Ver.di is demanding a pay increase of eight percent in total, but at least 350 euros per month. They are also demanding higher bonuses for stressful shift work, three additional days off, and a new type of \"my time account\" to give employees more time independence.\nThe new round of strikes began over the weekend with reports that all 13 of the country’s major airports would be going on strike. The Hamburg Airport is reported to have already closed as of Sunday during an unannounced strike.\nVer.di is calling for theatres, daycare centers, and public swimming pools to close, garbage collection to be suspended, and most municipal services to be halted. The scope of the strike is set to increase daily.\nThe Kiel Canal calls itself “the world’s most frequented artificial waterway.” It provides a direct route between the North Sea and the Baltic, reducing the trip by 260 nautical miles which equates to saving 14 to 18 hours of transit time. The canal is approximately 50 nautical miles and takes six to eight hours to transit. Ships will either have to wait for it to reopen or make the trip around Denmark in the congested sea lanes.\n“After reopening, major delays should be expected for all west- and eastbound traffic heading towards the Kiel Canal. The period of congestion cannot be predicted, as it will depend on the volume of ships waiting to transit,” ship agency and logistics company GAC Group warned customers in an alert.\nThe local branch of Ver.di is calling on employees at the Port of Hamburg to join this week’s action. The port is already warning of anticipated delays noting that one in three containers handled in Hamburg passes through the canal."

Tug boats are in the vicinity to ensure theSolongremains away from the coast and to respond as the situation develops.\"\nAt 2320 last night local time the Coastguard reports theSolongseparated from theStena Immaculateand began to drift southwards. The Stena vessel was anchored approximately 10 miles off the coast near Hull, England, and remains there while the Coast Guard continues to track theSolong. Daylight images today show multiple fireboats near the containership spraying the fire.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the owners of the vessel Ernst Russ is now denying the reports of dangerous chemicals in some of the containers. “We are able to confirm that there are no containers on board ladened with sodium cyanide...,” they stated. “There are four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical and these containers will continue to be monitored.”\nImages of theStena Immaculateshow the large fire is extinguished. Experts said they are remaining cautious however that there might still be fire below deck and they would be monitoring the vessel. Boskalis confirmed Dutch media reports that it has been retained to oversee the salvage operation for the tanker. The company said the timeline was unclear but that resources were already traveling to the ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coastguard also clarified previous reports saying that the 36 crewmembers were ashore and none were in hospitals. They said one was treated after coming ashore and declined further medical assistance. One crewmember from theSolongremains missing after the search was called off on Monday.\n“We also recognize the dangers that others are faced with as they work to stabilize and secure the vessels and cargos involved,” Ernst Russ said in its statement. “Our team is actively engaged with all local authorities, and we will work with clean-up teams to ensure every effort is made to mitigate further impacts on the marine environment.”\nThe Coastguard reports teams are working with ship owners, salvors, and insurance companies. A Counter Pollution and Salvage Team is assessing the situation and is developing a plan ready for implementation as soon as the situation allows.\nSpeculation is running rampant on the Internet over the cause of the incident while CBS Newsinterviewedone of the sailors from theStena Immaculate. It’s reporting he said \"a massive ship came from out of the blue\" and that “it appeared as though nobody was on the bridge of theSolongat the moment of the crash.” The two vessels remained pinned together with theSolongcontinuing its forward momentum.\nA spokesperson for the British Prime Minister however has told the media “I understand there doesn't appear to be any suggestions of foul play at this time.\" The investigations however are ongoing.\nUK officials said its Marine Accident Investigation Branch is in touch with officials in Portugal and the United States, the flag states of the two vessels. Reports said there are internal discussions as to which country will lead the investigation although the MAIB is reported to already be in the area gathering information and possible evidence.Further updates on the situation were expected later in the day from HM Coastguard."

        "content": "\nNorth Korea has unveiled what it claims to be its first nuclear-powered submarine, raising questions about whether it received technical assistance from Russia in exchange for the vast quantities of ammunition that Pyongyang has shipped off to the front in Ukraine.\nState media outlet KCNA released photos of what it claims to be a \"nuclear powered strategic guided missile submarine,\" or SSBN. A South Korean weapons expert, Moon Keun-Sik, told AP that it appears to be twice as large as previous North Korean subs and may have capacity for up to 10 missiles. This is enough to be \"absolutely threatening to us and the U.S.,\" he said.\n\nCourtesy KCNA\nIn a statement carried by KCNA, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un said that the objective for Pyongyang's navy is to contain \"the inveterate gunboat diplomacy of the hostile forces,\" referring to the United States and South Korea.\nWhile it would be the North's first nuclear-powered sub, it would not be its first ballistic-missile sub. Pyongyang has a smaller 2,000-tonne converted attack sub that it uses for testing sub-launched ballistic missiles, one at a time. It also has unveiled a conventionally-powered ballistic missile submarine, the Pukguksong-5, which has been panned by Western and South Korean analysts.\nThe North has nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, but it was not publicly known to possess a functioning naval reactor until last weekend's announcement. To some, the rapid development suggests that Russia may have had a hand. In 2023, Kim Jong-un made a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to supply Russia with artillery ammunition and soldiers; only the North Korean side of the deal has been visible to the public so far, in the form of its footprint on the battlefield in Ukraine. Exactly what Kim received in return is as-yet unknown to the public. Whatever that reward may be, the sub's construction started sometime before the deal with Russia was reached and could have incorporated some amount of Russian input, defense expert Yang Uk of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies told Korea Times.\n“The released photos suggest that the submarine has been under construction for more than two years. North Korea may have received technology from Russia in the latter half of 2023, while supplying artillery shells and missiles in return to aid Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Yang said."

It was a part of the regular NATO efforts in the region where activity by Russians has been watched more intently this year as more ships were entering the Mediterranean as the political situation in Syria unfolded.\nThe Spanish frigateÁlvaro de Bazán(5,800 tons displacement) part of the F-100 class was assigned the monitoring operation. It operates as part of Standing NATO Task Force No. 2 (SNMG2). NATO maintains two escort groups (SNMG) and two minesweeping groups (SNMCMG) responsible for the waters ranging from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Northern Flank, and the Southern Corridor (from the Strait of Hormuz to the Suez Canal), including the coasts of Somalia.\nFew details were released on the monitoring, but the Spanish Navy identified the submarine asKrasnodar, of the KILO II class. The subs are diesel-electric attack submarines built in 1980 and operated by the Soviet Union. The Spanish only said that it was “in the waters of the Eastern Mediterranean.”\nThe submarine was traveling with the Russian tugboatEvgeniy Churov. According to the report, it accompanied the submarine on its way to the port of Alexandria, Egypt. The monitoring of the merchant vessel ended when the Russian vessels separated and each took a different course.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Bazán tracked the Russian vessels (Spanish Navy)\n\nEuropean Security & Defense reported in February that the sub and the tug had been observed off Portugal after having made their way from Northern Europe and the Baltic. The Royal Danish Navy tracked the vessels at the beginning of February as they transited west.\nAccording to the report, the Krasnodar and another Russian submarineNovorossiyskwere both based in the Black Sea until 2022. TheNovorossiyskwas seen at the end of the year leaving the Mediterranean so if theKrasnodarremains in the Mediterranean, the news outlet said Russia would be restoring its presence in the region.\nNATO and the West have been closely watching the Russian retreat from Syria and the steady stream of vessels moving into and out of the Tartus naval base.

        "content": "\nYemen's Houthi rebels have set a deadline for Israel to lift its blockade on food aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip, and have pledged to resume attacks on shipping on Tuesday if the demand is not met.\nOn March 2, Israel shut down international food aid convoys to Gaza in order to apply more pressure on the terrorist group Hamas, which continues to hold 24 living Israeli hostages and 34 deceased hostages' remains. The cutoff of aid affects Gazans at a population level, as the destruction of the territory has left hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs dependent on humanitarianassistancefor survival.\nLast weekend, Israel cut off electricity supplies to Gaza's sole desalination plant at Deir el-Balah, which supplies water to about 600,000 displaced people. The plant has recourse to generators and to solar power, but the loss of a utility grid connection makes its future (and the local water supply) more tenuous. A spokesman for the terror group Hamas accused Israel of committing \"collective punishment and a full-fledged war crime\" by withholding food, water and electricity.\nYemen's Houthi rebel faction - backed by Iran - agreed to cease its attacks on shipping in the Red Sea in January when Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement. Given the recent breakdown in the ceasefire arrangement, the Houthis warned Friday that attacks in the Red Sea could resume imminently if Israel does not restore access for food trucks in Gaza.\nHouthi militants have been attempting to rearm after more than a year of constant engagement with U.S. forces in the Red Sea, and have sought to supplement Iranian-supplied weaponry with a new Russian government supply relationship. Russia, which has been working to renew its diplomatic ties with the United States, has reportedly been in talks to provide the Houthis with the P-800 Oniks supersonic antiship missile - a munition that Soviet ngineers designed to attack U.S. Navy destroyers, like the ones that engage with Houthi forces in the Red Sea."

        "content": "\nAn innovative project to develop a shipboard ammonia-cracking technology took a key step forward toward the vision of building a zero-emission dry bulk carrier for the copper industry. Class societies ABS and DNV working with Norway-based Pherousa Shipping and technology company Metacon have issued design Approval in Principle reporting they found “no show stopper conditions” to employing the innovative technology.\nAmmonia continues to draw interest with systems in development but so far it has required carbon fuel primers to start ignition and presents the challenges of lower energy density versus traditional fuels. Hydrogen similarly shows potential as a power source but so far has been limited to small near-shore support vessels and inland shipping.\n“The Approval in Principle from two of the leading classification societies and certification bodies, ABS and DNV, marks another important milestone for us in the development of zero-emission solutions for the maritime industry,” said Hans Bredrup, Chairman of Pherousa. “By granting Pherousa these AiPs, both ABS and DNV clearly state that there are no showstoppers of the Pherousa technology for marine application.”\nPherousa’s concept working with an exclusive license agreement from Metacon for the application of the technology onboard ships focuses on developing ammonia cracking, the release of hydrogen energy from ammonia as a carrier, at scale to power larger vessels. The ammonia cracking technology would be used with PEM Fuel Cells and a Fuel Gas Supply System generating a fully electrical propulsion plant.\n“Ammonia cracking combined with a PEM Fuel Cell has no need for pilot fuel or other fossil sources,” explains Morten Løvstad, VP and Global Business Director for Bulk Carriers at DNV. He called it, “an innovative solution for maritime application towards full decarbonization.”\nPherousa reports that Ammonia Cracking can be applied to a variety of developed technologies, such as supplying Hydrogen to PEM Fuel Cells, replacing conventional fuels with Hydrogen as pilot fuel on Ammonia fueled Internal Combustion Engines, or supplying Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engines. It could also be used for supplying Hydrogen to Auxiliary Engines to reduce emissions. According to the company, any of the four alternatives can be fitted onboard any type of vessel and with an engine power of up to 15-20 MW.\n“The efficiency of ammonia cracking will play a decisive factor in its ability to contribute to decarbonization of the industry,” predicts Stergios Stamopoulos, Director, Global Sustainability forAmerican Bureau of Shipping (ABS).\nPherousa and Metacon report that have conducted thorough research and tests to develop the Ammonia Cracking technology concept. The companies have delivered a working prototype that demonstrated the practical potential of this approach.\nThe Pherousa subsidiary, Pherousa Shipping, reports it has worked closely with two major copper miners during the design process of an Ultramax 64.000 dwt vessel, to find the optimal layout for emission-free transportation of copper concentrates between its origin and the smelters. The vessels are intended to be on water in parallel with the new IMO regulative that comes into force in 2030.\nThey are focusing on the copper industry because the commodity is essential for emerging markets linked to decarbonization. They believe end-users of copper utilized for solar panels or electric cars will seek to build a carbon-free supply chain including shipping.\nHaving achieved the design reviews from ABS and DNV, Pherousa reports it is now transitioning from concept to scale-up and market entry. It looks to deploy its innovative solution on a global scale."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The crime wave that has been plaguing the area around the Singapore Strait in 2025 is continuing. While it remains most petty crime, robberies, the caution continues because the perpetrators appear to have become more brazen, and far more of the reports indicate the perpetrators are carrying guns or knives versus past years.\nAfter incidents in which a seafarer was injured and required a medical evacuation and others were tied up, the most recent did not include any direct interaction between the crew and the boarders. Security consultant Ambrey is advising crews not to confront the perpetrators.\nThe most recent incident overnight between yesterday, March 10 and today took place aboard a tanker flagged in Panama. The crew reported it saw seven boarders while the vessel was underway near the Phillip Channel. Near the western connection of the Malacca and Singapore Strait, it has become a frequent spot for activity this year.  The report says the boarders appeared to be carrying guns.\nThe monitoring operation ReCAAP had issued its weekly update yesterday, March 10 reporting one further incident that took place near the eastern side of the Singapore Strait. A tug pulling a barge, accompanied by a second tug, reported seeing three people on the barge. Again, it appeared to be a case of armed robbery with scrap metal being stolen while the vessels were underway.\nSince the first of the year, ReCAAP shows that it has received a total of 26 reports across the entire Southeast Asia region. However, on Monday, it said 23 of the 26 incidents reported since January were in the Strait of Malacca or Singapore Strait region. This compares with just six reported incidents in the first two months of 2024.\nReCAAP has been calling for the regional states to be more responsive and increase their patrols along the straits. They have also called for faster response times and increased efforts to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators.\nAmbrey is advising crews transiting the region to lock down their vessels. They emphasize closing off access to the accommodation block and stores. Most of the incidents have involved the boarders stealing stores or lose tools from the engine room areas.\nMost of the cases do not include a confrontation between the crew and the robbers. Ambrey advises crews should carry out partnered deck patrols to increase safety. When they are discovered, most time, the boarders grab what they can and quickly leave the ships. The incidents have also come in clusters suggesting that when the groups enter the channels they prey on multiple ships over a short period of time."

        "content": "\nAustal Ltd., the Australian parent company of defense shipbuilder Austal USA, has announced a capital raise of as much as US$140 million to pay for the expansion of its main shipyard in Mobile, Alabama.\nAustal USA is the core of Austal Ltd.'s enterprise, and it is rapidly growing to meet the needs of its primary customer, the U.S. Navy. It holds contracts for an array of smaller auxiliary vessels, along with a large-scale subcontract award for module construction to support General Dynamics Electric Boat's submarine projects.\nOn Tuesday, Austal announced that it plans to place about 53 million new shares with institutional investors at a price of US$2.40 per share, a discount of about 15 percent compared to the company's last closing price. The funds will go towards construction of the US$300 million Final Assembly 2 complex, which began construction last July and is due for completion in 2026. The infrastructure project is located just south of Austal's current complex, and will include a new assembly hall, a wharf and a new shiplift, which will make it easier for the company to launch newbuilds. The bay will be used for building large modules for the Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter program and for the Navy's T-AGOS-25 research/surveillance vessels.\nWith the addition of a shiplift, Austal will also have the capability to bring vessels back onshore for maintenance in addition to its newbuild work.\nAustal requested a brief trading halt Tuesday morning pending the announcement. \"This announced raise will ensure that Austal is appropriately funded for FA2, which one complete, will facilitate the delivery of large steel vessels in the current pipeline for the US Navy and ensure Mobile continues to be well placed to execute on future opportunities,\" said Austal CEO Patrick Gregg in a statement.\nAustal is widely expected to be a top contender to build additional Constellation-class frigates (alongside Fincantieri Marinette Marine), once the design has stabilized and production of the first hull has gotten under way. It is also well-situated to compete for mid- and large-sized unmanned vessel orders.\n“The long-term investment made in developing deep defence relationships in the United States and Australia, founded on product innovation, technology and demonstrated shipbuilding and support capabilities, is starting to deliver increased returns,\" Gregg said in an earnings statement in February."

Russian shipping experts have questioned the fleet's suitability for open-water service in Black Sea winter weather, given that most of these sister ships are over 50 years old, and their design was never intended for rough surface conditions.On December 15,Volgoneft-212broke in half and sank in a severe storm about five nautical miles outside of the Kerch Strait. Waves in excess of 25 feet were forecast by Russia's meteorological agency in advance of the sinking, and the effects were enough to snap the aging tanker in half. The tanker was carrying about 4,300 tonnes of mazut, a Russian residual fuel oil produced from low-quality feedstocks. The tanker Volgoneft-239 broke up and grounded near Taman shortly after, spilling a similar load of mazut.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Morspas\nThe cleanup effort for the wreck site of Volgoneft-239 took until the end of January, and it incurred significant costs. A response team led by Russian salvage agency Morspasluzhba (Morspas) built an earthen dike around the perimeter of the wreck, protecting it from wave action and creating a sheltered space for pollution abatement work to proceed. The oil was heated, pumped out and driven off by the truckload.\nMorspas has sued Volgatransneft - the owner of theVolgoneft-239- to recover the full cost of the cleanup, and the case is proceeding at an arbitration court in Krasnodar. Volgatransneft petitioned to have the lawsuit transferred to a court in Moscow, but Morspas objected, and the court refused the request. The hearings will begin in early April; the amount of the claim has yet to be fully calculated.\nThe same court has already fined Volgatransneft a minor penalty of $3,500 for alleged technical violations in connection withVolgoneft-239'ssinking.\nCourtesy City of Anapa\nSeparately, the city of Anapa has filed a claim of $2.4 million against Volgatransneft and Kama Shipping - the owner of theVolgoneft-212- to recover the costs for the beach cleanup that followed the spills. The city administration plans to increase the claim when extra cleanup costs occur, as more washed-up waste is expected for years to come.\nExperts consulted by Forbes put the estimated environmental damage from the spills at about $300 million. The tankers are insured for a maximum of about $30 million for pollution compensation, according to Alexei Kurinny, a Communist Party MP.\nThe lost vessels were part of aflotillathat provides bunkers for Russia's \"dark fleet\" near Novorossiysk, and helped transfer fuel oil to at least three U.S.-sanctioned tankers, according to Russian investigative news outlet IStories.\nRussia’s Ministry of Transport has confirmed that the fuel oil aboard the tankers belonged to Rosneft, Russia's giant state oil company, which posted a profit of $14 billion in 2023."

The police said the unidentified individual was in custody while they continued the investigation.\n“Following enquiries undertaken by my team, we have arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision, this follows the conclusion of search operations by HM Coastguard for the missing crew member of theSolong,” said Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson. They did not announce the position of the individual or which vessel he was from but the BBC is reporting that it is the master of theSolong.\nThe charges were set as manslaughter after HM Coastguard reported late on Monday that a search for one missing seafarer from theSolonghad ended. Earlier today, the UK’s Minister of Transport Mike Kane told Parliament, “Our working assumption is that, very sadly, that the sailor is deceased.”\nBoth shipping companies as well as the authorities said their focus was on the 36 survivors of the incident. They were all given medical attention are reportedly moved to local hotels.\nThe UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has launched a preliminary assessment to establish the causes of the collision. It is reported to be collected information while also working with the authorities in the United States and Portugal as the flag states of the vessels.\nHumberside Police reported today that have commenced a criminal investigation into the cause of the collision and are working in collaboration with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The police however are leading the investigation of any potential criminal offenses.\n“Extensive work has already been carried out, and we are working closely with our partners to understand what happened, and to provide support to all of those affected,” said Nicholson. “The man arrested remains in custody at this time whilst enquiries are underway, and we continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident.”\nThe police’s response comes as there has been growing speculation that theSolongmight have been on autopilot when it plowed into the port side of the tanker. One of the American seafarers aboard theStena Immaculatetold CBS Newsoff the record that he had not seen anyone on the bridge of the containership as it struck the tanker. He said the vessel “came out of the blue.”\nThe issue of lax watchkeeping has been involved in several incidents in the North Sea and Baltic region in recent years. The MAIB and others have warned of distracted bridge watches and a lack of lookouts despite the requirements."

        "content": "The U.S. Navy is interested in developing a remotely-operated robotic bottom crawler that can detect and disable sea mines and other threats on the seabed.\nThe service is seeking an unusual combination of exquisite attributes. The crawler must be lightweight (under 150 pounds) and must be able to swim on the surface autonomously for two nautical miles to reach offshore locations. It must be able to operate in water depths of up to 2,000 feet, and must be able to carry modular payloads of up to 100 pounds. In addition, it must be able to power itself - and any power-consuming attachments, like disruptors, short-range diagnostic sensors, and manipulators - for at least six hours at a time. One requirement is entirely unique to a mine clearance application: the device must meet specifications for low magnetic signature so that it can get to within three feet of influence-activated mines.\nWhen submerged, the device would release a tethered float that would rise to the surface and enable a radio-frequency command link to operators on shore or in a nearby boat. Supervisory autonomy is desired but not a requirement.\n\"There is no commercial capability available\" for an off-the-shelf solution, the Navy noted in a solicitation issued late last year.\nSubsea crawlers have existed for years for research and cable-lay applications, but none have mine clearance capability. Commercially available base models include the Bayonet series by GreenSea IQ and the Geomar Viator, but these devices greatly exceed the weight limit specified by the solicitation, and lack the swimming self-deployment capability.\nIf successful, the crawler program may later become classified, the Navy said in its solicitation. Only U.S. firms can participate."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAfter days of back-and-forth threats, the White House and the premier of Ontario, Canada backed down from steep tariff hikes that would have hit consumers on both sides of the border.\nLast week, in response to Trump's ongoing tariffs on Canadian goods, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on all exports of electricity to U.S. customers - and pledged to raise the levy or shut off power exports completely if the White House added any more tariffs. \"Believe me when I say I do not want to do this, I feel terrible for the American people, because it’s not the American people who started this trade war. It’s one person who’s responsible. That’s President Trump,\" Ford said.\nThe Canadian and American grids are deeply intertwined, and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and New York all import power from Ontario. The province estimated that about 1.5 million homes would be affected, and that the tariff would generate about $300-400,000 daily for Ontario's government. (Utilities in Minnesota and Michigan downplayed the impact and suggested that it would be negligible for the average household.)\nTrump responded Tuesday by threatening to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to a total of 50 percent - a crippling impact on Canada's metal producers and on the U.S. manufacturers that rely upon a Canadian supply chain. He blasted Ford for using electricity as a bargaining chip and again called for the annexation of Canada.\n“The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,” Trump said Tuesday morning. “The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear.\"\nBy the afternoon, tensions appeared to have cooled, at least temporarily. Ford announced that he had arranged a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick to discuss renegotiation of the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade deal that Trump negotiated in 2019. In response, Ford said that Ontario would suspend its 25 percent tariff on electricity exports, and the White House confirmed that it would suspend the threat to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.\nA 25 percent U.S. tariff on steel and aluminum imports from all countries remains in effect, along with a 10 percent tariff on Canadian oil and a 25 percent tariff on all Canadian and Mexican goods that fall outside of the USMCA framework. An across-the-board 25 percent tariff on both USMCA members takes effect April 2, though implementation has been delayed twice.\nFarmers begin to feel tariff pinch\nIn response to newly-imposed 20 percent U.S. tariffs on most Chinese goods, Beijing has imposed an array of retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural products, calibrated to target goods that China can replace with other sources. The tariffs include a 15 percent hike on U.S. exports of chicken, wheat and corn, and a 10 percent hike on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit. Goods that are already en route will not be affected, so long as they arrive by April 12.\n\"Farmers are frustrated. Tariffs are not something to take lightly and 'have fun' with. Not only do they hit our family businesses squarely in the wallet, but they rock a core tenet on which our trading relationships are built, and that is reliability,\" said Caleb Ragland, a soy farmer and the president of the American Soybean Association."

        "content": "In posting on social media, Ukrainian authorities are reporting a deadly attack on the port of Odesa. It is being widely reported that four sailors aboard a Greek-managed bulker were killed during a Russian missile attack, a fifth crewmember injured, and an employee of the port company was also injured. The attack on Odesa comes as both sides have escalated their efforts on the front lines while the Trump administration continues to push for peace talks.\nHours after it was reported that Ukraine had launched a massive drone attack on Russia, sirens were warning of a missile attack against the city of Odesa this evening. According to the reports, the alarm was sounded around 2000 local time, and minutes later a large explosion was reported.\nSerhiy Bratchuk of the Public Council at the Odessa OVA posted the reports online. It was later posted (but now deleted) by the Odesa Port Authority. Included with the posting is a picture of a fire-damaged bulkerMJ Pinar.\nThe vessel which is registered in Barbados is not currently broadcasting an AIS signal. Many ships have gone dark entering the Black Sea and the ports of Ukraine. Its last signal placed the 30,465 dwt vessel at Sulina, Romania. A message to the vessel’s manager in Greece has not received a reply.\nThe reports indicate the vessel was on dock in Odesa loading 30,000 tons of wheat. At least one missile is reported to have struck the seawall causing extensive damage to the pier, terminal’s grain gallery, and other infrastructure. The report indicates there was a fire aboard the vessel that killed three Syrian and one Ukrainian crewmember and injured one other crewmember. The ship is reported to have a crew of 12 aboard. A port employee also aboard the vessel is reported to have been injured.\nToday’s attack if confirmed could be the deadliest for seafarers in the port.\nA delegation from the World Food Program was also visiting the port today. They toured the port facilities and met with officials to discuss the operations of the port and shipping corridor. The UN continues to place a high priority on food exports from Ukraine primarily to countries in Africa.\nToday’s attack came the same day as it was reported that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had sent a letter to Donald Trump and that the U.S. agreed to resume sharing military intelligence and shipping materials to Ukraine. Reports from the talks underway in Saudia Arabia are indicating a potential ceasefire in the three-year war. Ukraine had reportedly accepted a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States.\nVessels have occasionally become collateral damage during the long war with repeated reports of damage during attacks on the port. The feeder ship MSC Levante F was reported to have suffered damage at the beginning of March while it was docked in Odesa. The company later denied significant damage, but the Governor Oleh Kiper also wrote that two port employees sustained injuries in the same attack."

        "content": "\nAs the Canadian government marks the 15th anniversary of its National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) it is moving ahead with critical orders including the first official construction contract for the new River-class destroyers. The ships which will make up the backbone of Canada’s naval combat capabilities are reported to be the largest and most complex shipbuilding effort undertaken in Canada since the Second World War.\nCanada’s Minister of Defense joined with his colleagues in the government to announce the implementation contract to start construction on the first three of the new vessels. The work was awarded to Irving Shipbuilding which is based in Halifax and which has been closely involved in the project. Irving began construction of the production test module of the River-class in June 2024 and now expects full-rate production to start next month, April 2025.\nThe River-class Destroyer is based on BAE Systems’ Type 26 warship design being built by the United Kingdom and a variant of which is being built for Australia as the Hunter Class Frigate. Canada’s Minister of Defense reports its new vessels will have enhanced underwater sensors, state-of-the-art radar, and modern weapons. The vessels are designed to provide combat power at sea support joint-force operations ashore and undertake a broad range of missions ranging from counter-piracy and counter-terrorism to intelligence and surveillance, interdiction and embargo, humanitarian assistance, research and rescue, and enforcement of law or sovereignty.\nThe new vessels are designed to replace the 12 Halifax-class frigates that are currently operating in the Royal Canadian Navy. Those vessels have been in service for approximately 30 years with the first of the class commissioned in 1992. They will also take over the role of the Iroquois-class destroyers which were in service between 1972 and 2017. Canada built four of the destroyers with two decommissioned in 2015 and the last one of the class in 2017.\n“Today’s announcement is a major step forward in delivering the first three River-class Destroyers – these impressive ships will offer an incredible capacity to the Royal Canadian Navy and Canada, ensuring that we can defend our waters against any adversary and deliver frontline combat power anywhere in the world,” said Vice-Admiral Angus Topshee, Commander, Royal Canadian Navy.\nThe first contract has a value of C$8 billion (US$5.6 billion) and is intended to fund the first six years of construction. It supports the construction of the first three ships of the class as well as the training, spares, and maintenance products required for the ship once they are commissioned. The first three ships are slatted to be named Fraser, Saint-Laurent, and Mackenzie, after Canada's vital waterways.\nThe Government of Canada reports following extensive analysis it has determined that the cost to build and deliver the first three ships at C$22.2 billion (US$15.4 billion). This estimate includes the costs that will be paid to Irving Shipbuilding through the implementation contract, as well as costs associated with the delivery of equipment, systems, and ammunition that Canada will be acquiring to bring the first three ships into service.\nAt the end of last week and over the weekend, the government also confirmed the orders under the NSS for two heavy polar icebreakers. They represent an equally challenging project to the new destroyers. The orders for the icebreakers were split between Davie and Seaspan with the vessels projected for delivery in 2029 and 2030."

        "content": "\nA spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry responded to a question from Reuters calling the proposed fees on Chinese-built ships “wrongdoings.” It comes as the war of words continues, and the trade war heats up after Donald Trump began imposing new tariffs.\nThe White House is yet to officially comment on its response to the U.S. Trade Representative’s finding that China unfairly subsidized and supported its shipbuilding industry. The report issued in January recommended actions after finding China was dominating shipbuilding through the state-owned industry and a broad system of support.\nReuters asked for comments from the Foreign Office after the news agency last week reported the Trump administration was seeking allied support for a series of fees against Chinese-built ships. It is believed the U.S. will charge a fee on any Chinese-built ship calling in U.S. ports regardless of the nationality of the shipowner. Further, the fee would be commensurate to the percentage of Chinese ships in the owner’s fleet.\n“Such measures as imposing port fees and levying tariffs on cargo handling facilities hurt the U.S. itself as well as others,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said during Monday’s press briefing. “The move not only hikes global maritime shipping costs and disrupts the stability of global industrial and supply chains, but also increases inflationary pressures in the U.S. and hurts the interests of American consumers and businesses.”\nIndustry analysts Alphaliner analyzed the global containership fleet. In its report, it says “37.8 percent of the current active containership fleet was built in Chinese shipyards.” It has been highlighted in other reports that this includes all the major carriers. MSC Mediterranean Shipping has drawn extensively on relationships with China and the Chinese leasing industry as it is building its fleet of ultra large container vessels. CMA CGM developed its large LNG-fueled ships in China and just this week Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding is highlighting sea trials for a new generation of 24,000 TEU LNG-fueled containerships for CMA CGM.\nThe global containership order book is reported at nearly 800 vessels. Alphaliner reports that 70 percent of the orders are placed with Chinese shipyards. It notes that “out of the Top 10 shipyards in terms of vessels on order, seven are located in China.”\nChinese officials have been speaking out against the U.S. trade investigation since it was first launched in 2024. They have repeatedly said the problems with U.S. shipbuilding were long and deep-seated issues while China is using technology to advance its industry.\n“The practice will ultimately fail to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry,” said Mao Ning. “We urge the U.S. to respect facts and multilateral rules, and immediately stop its wrongdoings. China will take necessary measures to defend its lawful rights and interests.”\nThe U.S. Trade Representative’s office is currently receiving comments on its proposals. A public hearing is scheduled for March 24, which is the same day the comment period is due to close."

The said that any Israeli vessels attempting to violate the ban would be subject to “military targeting.”\nThe group is citing the “failure to fully implement” the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. They assert that Israel is procrastinating including delays in opening the crossings into Gaza for the delivery of humanitarian aid.\n“This ban will remain in effect until the crossings to the Gaza Strip are reopened and humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, is allowed to enter,” the Houthis declared.\n\n????? ?????...pic.twitter.com/w6CKmh2ann\nPropaganda video posted by the Houthis as they reiterated their threat against Israeli shipping\n\nThe renewed threats come as the United States is pushing for more progress on the peace efforts in the region. Donald Trump on social media last week threatened Hamas if it did not immediately release all the hostages and bodies of Israelis that it is still holding.\nMost of the major shipping companies however had previously said it was too soon to return to the region while the security efforts also continue. The EU renewed Operation Aspides and the command continues to cite its close protection missions for merchant vessels transiting the area. Lloyd’s List Intelligence reports in an analysis that transits through the Bal el-Mandeb remain down by more than half versus 2023.\n\n\nEUNAVFOR Aspides has continues its security efforts during the lull in Houthi attacks (Aspides)\n\nOperators have also kept vessels out of the region due to the unpredictable nature of the attacks. In the past, the Houthis targeted vessels saying that the operators were supporting Israel or vessels with indirect associations with Israel. In some cases, it was believed the Houthis were using outdated information gained from the Internet.\nThe renewed threat comes almost three months after the group claimed its last attack on commercial shipping, the Maersk-operated containershipSanta Ursulawhile it was transiting to Oman. The attacks had become less frequent during late 2024 although the group continued to target U.S. Navy vessels including claims of three launches against the carrier USSHarry S. Trumanin the days leading up to the implementation of the ceasefire. They also continued to launch missiles toward Israel which had led to several retaliatory strikes by the Israel Defense Forces on ports and other facilities in Yemen."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe House Republican caucus plans to pass a continuing resolution (CR) rather than a budget to cover the remainder of the fiscal year, a procedural option that keeps federal spending at constant levels and avoids a difficult fight over spending priorities. Overall, theproposed CRwould raise defense spending by $6 billion year-on-year, roughly $16 billion below the amount needed to keep up with current levels of inflation.\nThe U.S. Navy has historically disliked CRs because they disrupt long-term shipbuilding and maintenance plans, which rely on a steady increase in funding levels. This one is different: it also adjusts several important line items, including an apparent cut in funding for the delayed Constellation-class frigate program.\nThe proposed CR sets a budget of $233 million for the Constellation-class for FY2025, a fraction of the $1.2 billion that the Navyrequestedthis year. (The CR also includes five cost-to-complete adjustments for the frigate totaling $400 million, which will cover prior-year shipbuilding cost increases from FY2020-24.)\nAlso on the list of cuts is the Landing Ship Medium, a key priority for the Marine Corps and a frequent point of friction for the Navy. The line item for this intratheater transport ship has been reduced to just $30 million, down from a requested amount of $268 million.\nThe CR also boosts funding for destroyer construction by an unrequested $1.5 billion. The Navy typically buys two destroyers a year from GD Bath Iron Works in Maine and HII Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi, and its long-term shipbuilding plan calls for orders of just under two per year through 2050.\nIn the past, defense officials have expressed skepticism about whether the two yards could follow through if given an order for a third destroyer a year. \"We don’t see the yards being able to produce three a year. We don’t see them being able to produce two a year. And that’s just data,\" Pentagon comptroller Mike McCord told USNI in 2024. \"Everybody’s struggling with skilled labor. Everybody’s struggling with supply chains.\"\nMaine and Mississippi have politically powerful representation on the House and Senate Armed Services committees; Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) told Roll Call that the funding for an extra destroyer was justified, given the strong recent performance of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in the Red Sea."

        "content": "\nThe first full-scale seaglider prototype using the wing-in-ground effect recently completed the first on-water tests of a prototype with humans onboard. According to Regent Craft, which is developing the new vessels, it was the kickoff of a testing campaign that will culminate with the first human seaglider flight at mid-year.\nThe company was launched in 2020 to develop the technology which it believes will present a new paradigm in travel. Its design is for an all-electric high-speed vessel that operates exclusively over water connecting coastal destinations. The vessel operates in three modes — floating on the hull, foiling above the waves on hydrofoils, and flying in ground effect within one wingspan of the surface of the water. The company’s first design, the Viceroy, is a 12-passenger vessel that can travel at up to 180 mph and up to 180 miles on a single charge.\nThe company successfully flew its quarter-scale seaglider prototype in 2022, validating its technological approach to redefining wing-in-ground craft (WIGs), vessels that operate in ground effect low over the surface of the water. Last year, it reported it had received permission to advance to prototype testing while raising more than $90 million from investors to develop the vessel. Regent has also advanced its maritime certification process with the U.S. Coast Guard and with maritime regulators in key markets around the world, in partnership with the maritime classification society Lloyd’s Register.\n\n\nPaladin was lowered into the water in Rhode Island to start the first trials\n\nRegent christened its new vesselPaladinbefore lowering her into Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. The 12-passenger Viceroy seaglider prototype is 55 feet (16.7 meters) long with a 65-foot (approximately 20-meter) wingspan, making it the largest-ever all-electric flying machine.\nOfficially commencing sea trials, Regent’s test captains completed the first in a series of on-water tests. Sea trials follow months of sub-system testing of the critical onboard systems, including motors, batteries, electronics, mechanical systems, and vehicle control software, and will progress to the first human seaglider flight in the coming months.\n\n\n\nThe company has attracted strong attention from both regional air carriers as well as the shipping industry. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines made a strategic investment in 2024 and Brittany Ferries is among the companies reporting it was exploring using the vessels. Regent reports its total order book is valued at more than $9 billion.\nConstruction has started on a 255,000-square-foot manufacturing facility located in Rhode Island. The company expects the facility will come online in 2026 as it moves forward with the commercialization of its seagliders.\n\n\n\n"

The Coast Guard is reporting that it detected a research vessel in restricted waters and then again today four Chinese Coast Guard vessels entered the same area in Kinmen near Dongding Island in the Taiwan Strait.\nNumerous previous incidents have been reported leading to Taiwan announcing that it wasincreasingits monitoring and efforts to interdict vessels loitering in its waters. It said a specific target would be Chinese-owned merchant ships operating under foreign flags such as Cameroon and Tanzania. In January, a Chinese-owned cargo ship was accused of damaging offshore cables and at the end of February, the Coast Guarddetaineda Chinese-owned vessel registered in Togo. The Coast Guard believed it caught the vessel in the act of dragging its anchor near sensitive undersea cables. Taiwan’s telecom provider reported at the same time that one of its cables had been interrupted.\nThe Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu branch of the Taiwan Coast Guard Administration reports it detected a Chinese research vessel,Yanping 2entering the restricted waters at midday on March 12. After making radar contact, the Coast Guard sent two patrol boats at approximately 1300 local time to intercept the vessel. When the patrol boats reached the area, they immediately began broadcasting messages for theYanping 2to depart the area.\nThe Coast Guard Administration reports as the Chinese vessel was being directed out of the area its crews observed the vessel dropping some type of detection equipment into the water. One of the patrol boats began searching the waters while they also broadcast a message to the Chinese to retrieve the equipment that had been released into the water.\n\n\nTaiwan condemned China for \"harassing our waters\" with scientific research vessels and survey ships (CGA)\n\nTheYanping 2has been registered as operating over the past decade for the Fujian Seismological Bureau and Fujian Marine Research Institute. Taiwanese officials said they believe the Chinese are conducting seabed geology, topography, and hydrology research, but it might not be purely for scientific research purposes. They believe the Chinese could be using the guise of scientific research to hide its true intentions.\n“The Coast Guard Administration strongly condemns China for harassing our waters with scientific research vessels and survey ships,” the officials said reporting yesterday’s incident.\nAfter being confronted, the Chinese vesselYanping 2replied it would cooperate and stop the activities. It retrieved the equipment that had been placed in the waters. At 1552 the Coast Guard patrol boats reported the Chinese vessel had left the restricted area which was about three miles southeast of Dongding Island.\nTaiwan asserts that the Chinese are using the gray zone to harass the island. At 1450 local time today, March 13, four Chinese Coast Guard ships also sailed into the southern waters of Kinmen. The Taiwan Coast Guard intercepted the vessels and instructed them to turn around and leave. While they were being monitored, they departed the gray zone at 1700.\nThe Taiwan Coast Guard reports it will continue its efforts to monitor and drive away vessels from its restricted waters."

The market is now driven in part by an array of political circumstances - particularly the on-and-off shutdown of the Red Sea, and the White House's changing tariff announcements.\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's proposed multimillion-dollar port fees for Chinese-built ships could have particularly significant effects on U.S. trade patterns, and the industry is watching closely. Xeneta's top analyst, Peter Sand, noted that all top six carriers have fleets that are more than 20 percent Chinese-built and orderbooks that are more than 40 percent Chinese. He called the fee proposal \"a challenge to globalization and free competition,\" and recommended an analytical rather than reactive business response.\n\"Uncertainty is toxic for trade, and businesses today are overwhelmed by shifting regulations, unpredictabletariffs, and constantly changing trade dynamics. The best advice? Stay calm, keep your options open, and avoid locking into long-term commitments without a clear upside,\" recommended Xeneta's Peter Sand. \"Businesses should focus on data-driven decision-making, risk management, and adaptable logistics strategies to navigate anincreasingly volatile market.\"\nThe White House has already imposed tariffs of 20 percent on Chinese goods. Circuitous routing is one common response, and one container equipment trader suggested that business is already picking up for moving cargo through Southeast Asia, the Mideast or the Subcontinent.\nThe Red Sea is another wild card. If it reopens and stays stable, global slot capacity will increase and rates will come down - but only if carriers have certainty that Houthi attacks will not restart. At present, that moment still appears far off."

        "content": "The German Shipowners’ Association (VDR) released its annual report on the strength and vital role of shipping in the country’s economy and security. Citing “turbulent times” the group which represents the largest part of the German merchant fleet is calling for new long-term measures to support its smaller shipowners and efforts to reduce bureaucracy to increase global competitiveness.\nThe group highlighted in its presentation that despite global turbulence and uncertain times in international trade policy, that German shipping remains a key contributor to the country’s economic strength and supply security. They reported that approximately 26 percent of exports and 60 percent of imports are handled by sea.\n“Without a strong and independent merchant fleet, there is neither economic stability nor national security – especially in times when geopolitical and trade policy risks are steadily increasing,” said VDR President Gaby Bornheim.\nAlthough Germany remains a strong maritime hub and continues to rank seventh globally, VDR reported that the industry is slipping in key areas. German shipping’s tonnage has declined from a peak of approximately 90 million gross tons in 2010 and 2011 to a current 47.4 million gross tons. While container shipping remains the largest segment, Germany has slipped to third behind Switzerland (home of MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company) and China.\nGerman shipping companies purchased 70 vessels in 2024 (1.9 million gross tons) and newbuilds numbered 74 vessels (2.6 million gross tons). However, sales numbered 180 ships (4.1 million gross tons).\n“The VDR therefore calls for targeted, long-term measures to strengthen the competitiveness of German shipping companies and Germany as a maritime location to avoid falling behind internationally,” the group writes in its report.\nWhile the total German merchant shipping industry consists of approximately 290 companies and a fleet of 1,764 ships, the VDR’s data highlights just under half are flying EU flags and only 15 percent are registered in Germany. Further, it highlights that 80 percent of German shipping companies are small to medium-sized companies with fewer than 10 ships, with 44 percent specifically operating a single ship.\nIt cites a broad range of challenges for the industry including Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs which it says are causing uncertainty in the German and global merchant fleet. It also cites the geopolitical disruption to shipping routes and maritime trade. The VDR warns that national interests must not come at the expense of free global trade flows.\nIn addition to geopolitical and trade policy uncertainties, VDR reports that German shipping companies face an increasingly dense administrative burden within Europe. It says that double reporting requirements and regional special regulations on climate protection unnecessarily complicate ship operations and weaken competitiveness.\n“It is high time for Europe and Germany to abandon their dubious leadership in excessive bureaucracy and regional special regulations. Streamlined processes and globally consistent climate protection requirements are essential to safeguard Germany’s economic strength at sea,” warns VDR CEO Martin Kröger.\nWhile highlighting the challenges for shipping, VDR also reports a positive trend in 2024 as more young talent was attracted to the industry. It reports a 14 percent increase in trainees, with 499 training contracts at sea and 214 onshore. It highlights that shipping is attracting more young professionals while saying it is vital to continue to attract young talent into the industry."

The overarching objective is to protect the public and the environment to the best of our ability, during this ongoing incident response,” HM Coastguard said in its update midday on Wednesday. “There have been no further reports of pollution to the sea from either vessel beyond what was observed during the initial incident.”\n\n\nThermal imaging from a neighboring vessel showing the allision as it happens -- note the weather conditions from the bridge view in the first images (Orca AI supplied)\n\n\"This video footage clearly shows the context of the accident, that is the fog conditions at the time, while the moment of impact is also shown clearly,\" commented Yarden Gross, CEO and Co-founder of Orca AI, a maritime operations platform utilizing artificial intelligence and computer vision to aid mariners. The company describes the video saying the footage comprises two videos, one captured by the SeaPod's day cameras showing the dense fog that would likely have prevented the crew of the feeder containershipSolongfrom seeing theStena Immaculatewith the human eye. The second video captured by the SeaPod's thermal cameras shows the approach of theSolongand the explosion as it hit the tanker.\nThe fires aboard the containershipSolongare being described as “greatly reduced in their extent and intensity” while the vessel’s owner Ernst Russ said in a statement that the operational response to fully extinguish the fire and stabilize its containership continues. It said that fire activity onboard had diminished since yesterday, but that the vessel continues to emit smoke with occasional reports of flames. Pictures show the vessel charred end to end. The containership continues to be held in a safe position offshore by a tug with additional support vessels remaining in the area.\nThere are no visible flames on theStena Immaculate, which remains at anchor with safety tugs in position nearby.

He said they “hoped a decision on what to do with it could be made over the next 24-48 hours.” Hanell said that they now believe only two of the vessel's 18 fuel tanks had leaked, with an estimated 10 percent of the cargo.\nThe investigators have not made any public comments although the Internet remains ripe with speculation. A spokesperson for Ernst Russ commented that the master of the vessel who was detained by the police and its entire team are “actively assisting with the investigations.” They confirmed that the master is a Russian national and the rest of the crew are a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.\nMedia in the UK is also highlighting that theSolongwas cited for a range of issues during Port State inspections in 2024. The vessel’s owners responded that the issues had been resolved at the time of the inspections. While deficiencies were identified during inspections in both the UK and Ireland last year, the vessel was not detained.\nHM Coastguard said the operations would only proceed to the next phase when it was safe to do so. They have continued to monitor the temperatures aboard both vessels while also looking for any indications that the fires were flaring up or further pollution."

        "content": "\nThe Australian Border Force has destroyed an Indonesian fishing boat after finding hundreds of illegally-obtained shark fins on board off the remote Northern Territory.\nOn February 11, the Australian authorities spotted and intercepted the Indonesian vessel fishing illegally near Croker Island, a sparsely-inhabited Aboriginal territory off the Cobourg Peninsula. Illegal fishing is a major issue in the Arafura Sea, and the ABF has allocated significant new resources to interdict and discourage Indonesian fishermen in Australia's northernmost waters.\nAboard the vessel, the authorities found 339 shark fins, fishing equipment, and 200 kilos of salt for preserving illegal catch. Not present were the remaining portions of the sharks, indicative of a finning operation.\nAll seven fishermen aboard the vessel were arrested, and their vessel was seized and destroyed. The suspects were brought ashore in Darwin to face charges under the Fisheries Management Act, and all pleaded guilty on March 4.\nThe fishermen were released on an AU$1,000 undertaking to be on good behavior for at least five years. One suspect had an outstanding warrant for a prior offense, and he was sentenced to a month in prison.\n\"This illegal activity will not be tolerated in our waters. We will intercept you, you will lose your catch, your equipment and possibly even your vessel,\" said ABF Operation Lunar Commander Tracie Griffin.\nThe case brings the number of Indonesian fishermen prosecuted at Darwin to a total of 132 suspects in eight months. The ABF has also destroyed several other vessels, including two that were burned at sea last month."

        "content": "\nThe Port of Vancouver, Canada is celebrating remarkable performance after cargo throughput hit record highs last year, despite challenging circumstances.\nVancouver Fraser Port Authority (VFPA) saw overall cargo volumes hit a record 158 million metric tonnes, a five percent increase compared to the previous record of 150 million MT set in 2023. The growth was a result of increase in volumes across all segments including oil, auto, bulk and container shipping.\nDuring the year, Vancouver and other Canadian ports had to contend with challenges including labor disputes, local and global geopolitical tensions, climate change and extreme weather such as wildfires. Despite this, Vancouver cemented its status as Canada’s biggest facilitator of international trade.\nThe Trans Mountain pipeline expansion has unlocked new markets across Asia for Canadian petroleum products, and liquid bulk exports surged by an unprecedented 203 percent to 17.1 million tonnes. Dry bulk however posted a four percent decline to 96 million MT driven by fall in coal and potash exports.\nContainer trade recovered throughout 2024, returning to pre-pandemic growth trends. Vancouver’s four container terminals handled 3.5 million TEU, up 11 percent compared to 2023 and two percent compared to 2019.\nGrowth was also recorded in the ro/ro segment, with a record of almost 470,000 vehicles handled by auto terminals.\nDuring the year, the top trading partners that moved goods through the port were China with 46 million tonnes, Japan with 19 million tonnes and South Korea with 18 million tonnes. Trade to the U.S. through the port increased to seven percent of total cargo moved, amounting to 10 million tonnes, driven by increased petroleum exports.\nWhile the performance shows that Canada’s biggest port is on a growth trajectory, trade uncertainties ignited by tariff wars could affect the port’s activities this year. Confusion continues around the 25 percent tariff imposed on certain Canadian goods by President Trump, and the steps that Canada is taking to retaliate.\n“The Port of Vancouver stands ready to support efforts to diversify Canada’s international trade and build a strong, resilient national economy. We will continue partnering with governments and industry to plan and deliver the long-term capacity needed to support trade through the gateway,” said Peter Xotta, VFPA President and CEO.\nApart from cargo, Vancouver also cemented its position as a key cruise facility with passenger visits hitting a record 1.3 million, a seven percent increase from 1.2 million in 2023.\nTo sustain growth going forward, Vancouver has been undertaking significant investments to improve operations and efficiency. These include densification and modernization at Global Container Terminal’s Vanterm terminal, which is increasing container handling capacity, enabling larger container ships to berth and reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

        "content": "Global chemical tanker operator Odfjell has joined the growing list of shipping companies that are incorporating wind-assisted propulsion into their operations as they seek to lower emissions. The company’s first sail installation was completed in Antwerp, and the chemical tankerBow Olympuswill now be carefully monitored to observe the impact on operations.\n“The five-year-old vessel will soon embark on what could be called her second maiden voyage—this time, crossing the Atlantic towards Texas with four eSails,\" said Erik Hjortland, VP Technology for Odfjell. “Each nautical mile will be thoroughly analyzed in real-time to document the energy-saving effects. That data will be fundamental in informing future decisions as we continue to improve the environmental performance of our existing fleet.”\nOdfjell selected bound4blue’s eSails, a wind foil that it said is best suited to the challenges of chemical tankers. They noted that the deck of the vessel is covered in pipes for multiple cargo tanks. The integration of the sail foundations required careful planning to ensure a seamless fit with tanker operations and the vessel’s requirement for air draft limitations.\nBound4blue says that it was able to minimize the size and eliminate the need for tilting systems because its eSails generate six to seven times the propulsive lift of equivalently proportioned rigid sails. The fully automated eSails generate propulsive force by dragging air across an optimized aerodynamic profile. TheBow Olympuswhich is approximately 600 feet (183 meters) and 49,000 dwt, was fitted with four 72-foot (22-meter) eSails.\nTo accommodate the vessel’s operating schedule, the installation was undertaken in two stages. The foundations were fitted during a scheduled drydocking. The sails were installed during two days, March 10 and 11, at the EDR Antwerp Shipyard.\n“We’ve made some major steps in minimizing our emissions, reducing our fleet’s carbon intensity by 53% against the 2008 baseline,” says Hjortland. “We’ve done this through many operational measures and by installing a range of different energy-saving devices. Wind power was the next step.”\nThis project is funded by the European Union under a grant agreement from the Innovation Fund program. The tanker company says once results are validated from the operation of this first vessel, the plan is to install sails on more of its vessels.\nOdfjell joins owners such as Amasus, Eastern Pacific Shipping, and Louis Dreyfus Armateurs with operational eSAILs. David Ferrer, Co-Founder and CTO of bound4blue notes that other major shipping companies such as Maersk Tankers, Marflet Marine, and Klaveness Combination Carriers are filling the company’s growing orderbook."

        "content": "\nAnticorruption authorities in Indonesia are examining a sprawling fraud scheme at state energy giant Pertamina, which holds a near-monopoly on clean product distribution in the country. Executives at Pertamina allegedly set up a complex scheme to import gasoline from foreign refineries, inflate the price and skim money off the top at multiple points in the supply chain. The scheme touched chartering, procurement, blending and distribution, according to local authorities, and one U.S.-based shipping company is suspending the director of its Indonesian JV in response.\nIndonesia's oil industry is highly concentrated, and a small \"oil mafia\" of well-placed officials and private individuals exert considerable control over the trade. Recently-elected President Prabowo Subianto campaigned on a promise to rein in this \"mafia,\" and the Pertamina case is the first big test of that effort. (It is not the first time for Pertamina, which has undergone five previous corruption investigations in the past 10 years.)\nAccording to local prosecutors, from 2018-23, a group of nine executives carried out fraudulent trades in order to increase their own earnings. The overall cost to the Indonesian state and local consumers came to about $12 billion.\nAccording to officials, the starting point of the scheme was to declare that certain locally-produced crude was too poor in quality to be used in Indonesian refineries. This opened a legal avenue to import more expensive foreign-sourced gasoline to make up the artificial gap. At that point, the suspects allegedly purchased lower-quality 90 octane gasoline on the foreign market, then blended it and fraudulently resold it as higher-quality 92 octane gasoline in Indonesia. Motorists who used a low-quality fuel in an engine designed for high-octane gas could experience knocking and poor performance, and lawsuits are expected.\n\"An engine that continuously experiences knocking will lose combustion efficiency. Over time, carbon deposits will accumulate on the piston head and combustion chamber, drastically reducing performance,\" said Dr. Nur Aklis, a mechanical engineer at Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta (UMS).\nSome of the suspects also allegedly inflated the cost of chartering to import this fuel by 13-15 percent, then pocketed the difference.\nOne individual arrested in connection with the scheme, Muhamad Kerry Adrianto, is also a director at the Indonesian joint venture operation of Navigator Gas (the firm is not accused of any involvement). The U.S.-listed LPG carrier operator has taken steps to remove Adrianto from his role, and expects that the change will have no material impact on its business."

        "content": "Retailers are continuing to front-load their imports into U.S. ports due to the uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and the potential that the Trump administration will move to impose fees on Chinese-built ships reports the National Retail Federation. While the trade group expects volumes to remain elevated through the spring, its Global Port Tracker is reducing the forecast for second quarter imports versus last month’s outlook.\nThe group highlights the concerns among members and the elevated import levels so far in 2025 as seen for example on the reports of strong monthly volumes at the port of Los Angeles and Long Beach. However, after separately reporting declines in monthly consumer sales in both January and February, the NRF is now saying import volumes could see year-over-year drops this summer.\nThe National Retail Federation’s Port Tracker rallies container volumes at the major U.S. ports. The group raised its forecast by 3.5 percent for the first quarter while lowering its second quarter projection by 2.5 percent. It now expects possible year-over-year declines in import volumes to start in June and July, noting it would be the first decline since September 2023.\n“Retailers are continuing to bring as much merchandise into the country ahead of rising tariffs as possible,” said Jonathan Gold, Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy at the NRF. “The on-again, off-again tariffs against Canada and Mexico won’t have a direct impact on port volumes because most of those goods move by truck or rail. But new tariffs on goods from China that have already doubled from 10 to 20 percent are a concern, as well as uncertainty over ‘reciprocal’ tariffs that could start in April.”\nThe trade group notes that retailers have been working on supply chain diversification, but that doesn’t happen overnight. In the meantime, it says tariffs are taxes on imports ultimately paid by consumers, not foreign countries, and American families will pay more as long as they are in place. Economists have echoed this concern while Donald Trump this week dismissed talk of an impending recession due to his trade policies.\nThe NRF is projecting more than 6.4 million TEU for imports in the first quarter of 2025 noting that levels were up 4.4 percent in January over December and 13.4 percent year-over-year. It projects the momentum continued into February with a 6.1 percent increase, making it the busiest February in three years, a month that is traditionally slower as factories close in Asia during the Lunar New Year celebrations. It is forecasting a 10.8 percent increase year-over-year for March and a 5.7 percent increase year-over-year for April.\nThe retailers however are projecting the momentum will end with just a 2.8 increase in May followed by monthly year-over-year declines. June they project could be down 3.2 percent year-over-year and increasing to a 13.9 percent year-over-year decline in July. The forecast also shows container import volumes below 2 million TEU in July 2025 which would be the first time it has fallen below that level since March 2024.\nThe NRF is now forecasting a total of 12.78 million TEU for the first half of 2025. That would be up 5.7 percent versus last year.\nThe group notes if the Trump administration moves ahead with port fees on Chinese-built ships, that carriers might move to larger vessels. They expect the major lines would seek to consolidate calls at major ports rather than making multiple stops at smaller ports. Others have speculated that shippers might route move volumes through the Canadian and Mexican ports to reduce exposure to the proposed port fees.\nThe NRF believes the growing uncertainties and continuing “tariff turmoil” are increasing concerns and are likely to be reflected in import volumes as the year progresses."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe U.S. House of Representatives haspasseda continuing resolution (CR) rather than a budget to fund the federal government for the rest of the year, leaving funding levels effectively flat. Without a normal appropriations bill, the Pentagon lacks funding to offset inflation and the authorities needed to start new programs. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee today, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby said that the CR would have several significant effects: at a time when the Navy is working hard to maximize readiness, the flat funding of a full-year CR puts maintenance availabilities for 11 ships at risk. These yard periods would have to be pushed to next year or skipped altogether, which would create growth work and unexpected issues during the next maintenance availability.\nThe timing is poor for the Navy. Unable to compete with China's PLA Navy on tonnage, the service has embarked on a plan to do more with what it has. Under now-departed CNO Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the Navy set a \"stretch goal\" to achieve 80 percent surge availability across the entire fleet, matching its targets for aircraft availability. That target remains in place under VCNO Adm. Kilby, who is performing the duties of CNO following Franchetti'sdismissallast month.\n\"Our goal is to achieve and sustain an 80% combat-surge ready (CSR) posture. We began these efforts with naval aviation in 2018, improving the operational availability of tactical aircraft. We are now scaling our efforts across all aviation platforms, as well as in the surface and submarine communities,\" Adm. Kilby said in prepared testimony.\nIn addition to the effects of a CR on maintenance and readiness targets, Adm. Kilby warned that the lack of a proper budget could interfere with the service's progress on recruiting. The Navy had a serious recruiting shortfall in 2023, but made an all-out effort to turn it around and succeeded last year in hitting its numbers. Navy recruiters are outperforming targets this year, and the service is on track to reach 100 percent enlisted rating fill by the end of 2026 - so long as the CR doesn't derail the effort.\n\"I'm very concerned about the impact of the CR on that machine and slowing it down. We want to bring in all the people we need and bring down our gaps at sea, and a CR makes that a little more challenging,\" said Kilby.\nThe committee sought input from service leaders on what could be done to allow the armed forces to make the most of the funds they have, including more flexibility to use appropriations for new purposes. Kilby emphasized the value of budgetary flexibility to adapt to new technology and new threats - for example, to pivot funding to meet new drone and missile risks in the Red Sea. These changes are hard to do under a continuing resolution, Adm. Kilby said, so having more flexibility in the budget from the start would allow the Navy to make do more easily when a CR occurs.\nCivilian DOD layoffs and an ongoing military-wide hiring freeze are a concern for the service leaders, but Kilby noted that two critical groups - public shipyard employees and the Military Sealift Command mariner pool - are exempt from these workforce reduction initiatives.\nThe Navy also came in for criticism for the persistent maintenance issues in the amphibious fleet, which have caused friction between the Navy and the Marine Corps for years. Just 13 out of 32 amphibs are currently available for deployment, and General Christopher J. Mahoney (USMC) testified that the current levels of amphib capacity are \"not going to do it\" to generate USMC warfighting capability. \"We have got to get ahead of the maintenance curve, and that means years ahead,\" said Mahoney."

        "content": "\nWhile businesses have been closely following the Trump administration's tariff policies, the seven-figure port fee proposal from the US Trade Representative (USTR) could have even deeper effects on American shipping interests. If adopted, Chinese-built ships - and global operators who use Chinese-built ships elsewhere - would have to pay millions of dollars for every port call in the U.S. Exporters would be required to ship an increasing percentage of their goods on U.S.-flagged tonnage, and eventually on scarce U.S.-built tonnage. This plan's steep costs could be enough to put some smaller companies out of business, drive others away from American shores, or end some categories of American exports altogether, maritime businesses and shippers warned in comments to the USTR.\nACL, the conro specialist that operates in Transatlantic trade, handles more than half of the American heavy machinery and equipment exports from New York, Baltimore and Norfolk to Europe. It is the only U.S.-headquartered carrier serving these American manufacturers on the East Coast. In a submission to the USTR, ACL explained that it went to China to buy all five of its specialized new conros because no one else would build them. In 2012, the few qualified U.S. yards said that they were booked seven years out with Navy work, ACL claimed; Japanese yards didn't want to bid on such a small series, and Korean yards said that it wasn't worth the cost of doing a custom design for just five vessels. When ACL sought bids in China, it received a competitive offer, and the vessels were built under class supervision in Shanghai.\nIf the multi-million-dollar fees went into effect, ACL said, it would make the company \"totally uncompetitive versus the other carriers in the US trades,\" and ACL would be forced to shut down its U.S. operations. It would cease services, close its U.S. headquarters, lay off its staff and leave American shippers using foreign shipping services. Those foreign operators would be dramatically more expensive, ACL warned.\n\"US export container rates to Europe for a carrier with a Chinese-built fleet - now averaging $500 per 40-foot container today - would climb to around $2,500 per 40-foot overnight – a 500% increase – simply to cover the new service fee,\" ACL said. \"American manufacturers would have less choice of carriers and face significantly higher transportation costs.\"\nSeaPort Manatee, the largest port in Southwest Florida, said that the port fees would also likely end the U.S. operations of the regional line World Direct Shipping (WDS). WDS is a Florida-headquartered container line connecting the U.S. with Mexico, and supports about $1 billion a year in U.S. economic activity. \"Cargo would be diverted from WDS vessels to trucks, resulting in 1,000 more trucks crossing the border each week, and increase congestion at Texas border crossings and increase wear/tear on U.S. highways,\" noted the port authority. \"The proposed action is very likely to negatively impact United States supply chains . . . and negatively impact American businesses and families (e.g., lost jobs; increased cost of goods and services).\"\nU.S. agricultural interests are also concerned. The Agriculture Transportation Coalition, a trade body for farmers who export goods by container, warned that the fees would \"render US ag unaffordable and uncompetitive.\" The group believes that this would have an extreme impact on U.S. agricultural commodity exports. \"Because there is ample substitute supply from other countries, it would end US ag sales to foreign markets,\" the association told Lloyd's List.\nEnergy Products Partners, a leading U.S. midstream firm, warned that the fees would also have a devastating impact on oil and gas exports. If the fees take effect, \"there will be no ‘drill baby drill’ [and] the ‘liquid gold’ under our feet would stay in the ground,\" EPP told Lloyd's List.\nThe costs outlined by the USTR could also be just a starting point. Beijing could take its own actions in response, further raising costs, one established freight broker noted. \"The reality is that, similar to the retaliation of U.S. trading partners to recent major tariff increases, similar fees would be imposed on U.S. ships calling Chinese ports,\" the broker warned.\nThe International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU)'s Washington branch also pointed out that the extra charges could incentivize carriers to simply offload cargo outside of the United States - in Mexico or Canada - and then truck it across the border without paying the port fees. Without parallel restrictions to equalize costs at the land border, U.S. port traffic and longshore jobs could decline."

        "content": "A new tug construction project underway at Turkey’s Uzmar shipyard will integrate a marine battery power system with a methanol-fueled engine to minimize emissions from the operations. The vessel is being built for Svitzer and will be launched later this year for operations in Gothenburg, Sweden.\nThe tug is based on Svitzer’s TRAnsverse tug design and will be used for escort duty. With a gross tonnage of approximately 806 tonnes, the tug will be capable of achieving speeds of up to 14 knots. Delivery is planned in the second half of 2025.\nThe order for the 6MWh battery went to AYK Energy and is its first contract with Uzmar. The battery will be built at the company’s new facility in Zhuhai, China, and delivered to Uzmar for installation in the tug. AYK attests to having the highest energy density and volumetric density in the industry today. Combined with its Battery Management System) and packaging solution, it reports it has tailored unique solutions for the maritime sector. It claims to offer the safest, lightest, most affordable, easiest to operate, and commission battery with the ability to operate in smaller spaces.\n\"Battery solutions are constantly expanding, and we are proud to be at the forefront when it comes to providing those solutions to the maritime sector,” said AYK Energy founder Chris Kruger, He said the contract “shows our continuing progress in winning the bigger battery projects.”\nThe battery power system will be supported for the first time by dual-fuel methanol engines. The engines will be used for backup power and to extend the range of the tug. However, according to the companies, they expect the tug to perform more than 90 percent of its escort duty operations using its battery-electric powertrain. They said the vessel’s design will also allow the battery-powered tug to operate more efficiently than internal combustion engine-powered tugs of a traditional design.\nUzmar says that the combination of battery power and methanol engines will provide a safe, efficient, and reliable solution.\n“The launch of a first-of-its-kind newbuild project with our partners at Uzmar Shipyard is a significant milestone for our decarbonization ambitions,” said Gareth Prowse, Head of Decarbonization at Svitzer.  The battery electric tug will mean we can deliver our services to customers in the Port of Gothenburg with significantly lower carbon emissions, and still to the highest operational and safety standards.”\nCompanies such as Svitzer see battery power as becoming an important option in the sustainability transition. Marine batteries are demonstrating that they can play a fundamental role in decarbonizing the industry, as an increasing number of tugs are being built and deployed with battery-electric powertrains.\n"

The fires appear to be out on the tanker Stena Immaculate and it remains where it was anchored when it was struck by the containership.\n“Small pockets of fire are still reported to be on the top deck ofSolong,” HM Coastguard reported noting that crews continue to respond to the vessel. The containership continues to be held off the English coast in what they are calling “a safe location connected to a tug.”\nChief Coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan said: “Both vessels are presently stable and salvors have been on board to carry out initial damage assessments to secure future safe access to both ships,” in his end-of-day update on Thursday.\nThe Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) reported earlier on Thursday that it was gathering preliminary information and interviews but was waiting while the prior has been to allow the emergency services to undertake their efforts and to secure the vessels. MAIB said it has been gathering witness accounts and obtaining digital data.\nIt also reported that the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Coast Guard had joined the efforts. In addition, the Marine Safety Investigation Authority of Portugal has also joined but MAIB reports it was agreed that the UK will lead the safety investigation with Portugal and the U.S. “acting as substantially interested states.”\n\n\nGermany provided HM Coastguard with assistance including planes and drones for close-up inspections of both vessels (Havariekommando)\n\nHumberside Police Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson however reported that the Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday had granted a 36-hour extension for the man they have in custody.\n“Detectives are continuing to question him following his arrest on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision,” said Nicholson. “Extensive lines of inquiry by police into any potential criminal offenses which arise from the collision between the two vessels are ongoing, whilst partner agencies continue their own assessments of the incident.”\nMAIB said when it is safe its teams would conduct a detailed inspection of both vessels and manage the retrieval of the Voyage Data Recorders (VDR) from both ships. In addition to gathering witness accounts, MAIB said its further investigation work will look to establish the navigational practices on board both vessels; the manning and fatigue management; the condition and maintenance of the vessels involved; and the environmental conditions at the time.\n\n\nInspection of the Stena Immaculate (Havariekommando)\n\nThis comes as speculation continues to grow on the repercussions of this incident. Marcos Alvarez, Managing Director, Global Financial Institution Ratings for the credit rating service Morningstar DBRS said they do not expect this to “materially affect the credit profile of marine insurers in 2025.” However, he notes that multiple insurance policies, including those for hull and machinery, liability, and marine cargo, will be activated. “We estimate that liability and salvage losses will exceed the cost of hull and cargo claims said Alvarez. Morningstar believes total insured losses in the range of $100 to $300 million will “remain manageable,” while noting the findings of the U.S. investigation into sabotage and the MAIB investigation could have “significant implications,” for handling any insurance claims for the incident.\nThe U.S. shipping company Crowley confirmed late on Thursday that the team from SMIT had been aboard theStena Immaculate, but they cautioned it would take time to complete the assessment. They said a salvage and tow plan would be finalized with the appropriate authorities."

        "content": "Hanwha Ocean completed an extensive overhaul and repair project on the USNSWally Schirramarking the first time a South Korean shipyard has undertaken a major refit of a U.S. government vessel. Officials are hailing it as a key step in deepening the relationship as the South Korean industry looks to realize more opportunities under Donald Trump’s plan to enhance the U.S. Navy.\nThe 40,000 displace ton vessel, which is part of the Military Sealift Command’s Lewis and Clark dry cargo class, spent approximately six months at Hanwha Ocean’s Geoje shipyard plant for overhaul maintenance work on the hull and machinery. The project as specified included major equipment inspections and replacement and systems upgrades.\nThe shipyard also reports during its inspection it identified additional steps to improve the vessel’s operations and it was successful in obtaining a revised contract from the U.S. Navy. MSC reports that during the dry docking, more than 300 work items were addressed including hull corrosion and a full rudder replacement. The vessel departed South Korea on March 12.\n“Hanwha addressed extensive deterioration and damage to the hull, propeller, rudder, and rudder post/steering gear,” said Cmdr. Patrick J. Moore, commanding officer, MSC Office-Korea. “Notably, Hanwha engineers reverse-engineered the damaged rudder, completely replacing the unit when blueprints were not available. This saved significant time and resources in gettingWally Schirraback to sea, a testament to their resilient supply chains, advanced automations, and skilled workforce.”\nThe project was conducted under the U.S. Navy’s ship maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) program. Hanwha signed a contract with the U.S. Navy in July 2024 after completing the certification process to become the second South Korean shipyard authorized to bid for contracts. HD Hyundai was also authorized last year and reports it plans to start bidding for contracts in 2025. South Korea’s HJ Shipbuilding & Construction, the renamed former Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction, has also according to media reports formed a team to complete the qualification process to enter the MRO program.\nUS MSC officials note that normal voyage repairs are routinely conducted in Korea but this is the first time the much larger work has been performed. The South Koreans report the market is valued at approximately $8 billion and is growing steadily.\nHanwha Ocean currently has a second project underway, the overhaul of the refueling vessel USNSYukonwhich arrived at the yard in November. Hanwha Ocean said that it is also involving small and medium-sized shipbuilding companies in the Geoje area as subcontractors to share the economic benefits with the broader industry. The shipyard says it is targeting five to six MRO contracts for 2025 and looks to further expand its overseas MRO business."

It is saying as many as 20 seafarers were lost but the Chinese failed to report the incident.\nThe South Korean news agency Yonhapreleased the reportciting multiple unidentified sources. They were told the incident happened in February in the Yellow Sea. The area between the Korean peninsular and China is reported to be known as a “hot spot” for coal smuggling.\n\"The North Korean ship appears to be overly loaded with coal,” the report states. “The cargo and ship sank altogether,\" the source told Yonhap, adding China does not appear to want the accident to be known as it probably connived in North Korea's violation of the UN Security Council sanctions.\nThey are indicating that A Chinese ship collided with the North Korean ship possibly in heavy fog. The Chinese ship is reported to have suffered “minor damage,” while the North Korean vessel was lost. The Chinese attempted a rescue and recovered “a few people,” while the report says between 15 and 20 were lost.\nIt is impossible to independently verify the report. The news outletNK Newshowever attempted by scouring China’s Maritime Safety Administration notices. NK News reports the agency “lists an unidentified shipwreck in the Yellow Sea, about 80 km from Lianyungang, one of the known hotspots for coal smuggling.” The outlet also highlights a notice of a sunken vessel off the coast of Ningo-Zhoushan posted on February 17. It says the report omitted the name, flag, or type of vessel.\nNorth Korea depends mostly on an aging fleet of ships although it did highlight building one new vessel in the past few years. There was another unreported incident in June 2024 in which South Korean intelligence said as many as 90 North Korean troops might have died when a transport was lost."

        "content": "Four of the officers who were aboard the Van Oord dredgerVox Maximain June 2024 when it blacked out and hit a bunker tanker pleaded guilty in a Singapore court on Thursday for failing to properly discharge their duties.  The four individuals are facing steep fines for causing the worst oil spill in Singapore in a decade.\nRichard Ouwehand, age 49, was the master of the dredge at the time of the incident. Martin Hans Sinke, age 48, was the chief officer and in charge of the navigation which was moving the vessel from the Western Anchorage to the SDT Engineering Marine Tuas shipyard. Eric Peijpers, age 56, was the second engineer, and Merijn Heidema, age 26, was third engineer. Each admitted to one charge under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.\nThe dredgerVox Maxima(43,400 dwt) was underway on June 14 in Singapore harbor when the vessel lost propulsion and steering causing it to strike the docked bunker tankerMarine Honour(9,000 dwt) while it was alongside another vessel at the Pasir Panjang Terminal. One of the bunker vessel’s tanks was ripped open and an estimated 400 tons of fuel oil leaked into the harbor and fouled the shoreline in sensitive environmental areas.\nProsecutors told the court the clean-up took more than two months. They said the full extent is being analyzed. TheMarine Honouris still undergoing repairs with an estimated cost of US$5 million. According to the reports, at least six of the vessel’s ballast tanks, 10 cargo tanks, and a slop tank all suffered damage.\nPrevious reports said the dredge had lost steering and propulsion during the incident with the details coming out during the court hearings. On the morning of June 14, the engineers on watch were conducting maintenance work while the vessel was at anchor, and they opened a circuit breaker on the high-voltage switchboard stopping power to the step-down transformer on the starboard side of the vessel.\nAt noon the watch changed in the engine room and Peijpers and Heidema came on duty and they were told the vessel needed to be ready to move at 1:30 p.m. local time to the shipyard. They switched the vessel from its auxiliary generator to the main generators to prepare for the navigation, but prosecutors said they failed to perform their duties and did not realize the circuit breaker was still open. The only electrical power was coming from the port side generator because the circuit breaker had remained open.\nUnderway, the vessel’s two hydraulic pumps started to draw power and then the second came online it overloaded the port side circuit breaker shutting down all power to the low-voltage equipment. The vessel lost control as its controllable pitch propellers and rudders lost power.\nThe prosecutors alleged that the master Ouwehand and chief officer Sinke failed to properly engage emergency steering.\nThe Vox Maxima just missed hitting one vessel, the 15,000-dwt product tanker Super Hero. The report said the crew of the tanker was able to alter speed and course to avoid a collision. However, the out-of-controlVox Maximathen plowed into theMarine Honour.\nProsecutors told the court that the master and chief officer should each be fined between US$15,000 and US$22,500. The recommendation for the two engineers was that each should be fined between US$30,000 and US$37,500. They were facing a maximum penalty of up to two years in jail and fines of up to approximately US$37,5000 each.\nThe court has scheduled the sentencing for April 2."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe Canadian Port of Vancouver reported a very strong performance last year as its cargo throughput hit record highs. The port is also looking to capitalize on its position as a possible port of entry for increased Chinese and Asia trade due to the uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and Donald Trump’s plan to impose port fees on Chinese-built ships.\nVancouver Fraser Port Authority (VFPA) reported a strong performance in 2024 that saw overall cargo volumes hit a record 158 million metric tonnes, a five percent increase compared to the previous record of 150 million MT set in 2023. The growth, which was achieved despite a challenging environment, was a result of an increase in volumes across all segments including auto, bulk, and container.\nDuring the year, Vancouver and other Canadian ports had to contend with numerous challenges including labor disputes, local and global geopolitical tensions, climate change, and extreme weather such as wildfires. Despite the challenges, Vancouver cemented its status as Canada’s biggest facilitator of international trade with the bulk sector leading in terms of volume growth with an eight percent increase to 117.9 million MT.\nVancouver is highlighting that the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline and Westridge terminal unlocked new markets across Asia for Canadian petroleum products, something that saw liquid bulk exports surge by an unprecedented 203 percent to 17.1 million MT. Dry bulk however posted a four percent decline to 96 million MT driven by a fall in coal and potash exports.\n\n\nCMA CGM's containership completed the first LNG bunkering in Vancouver on March 9 (Seaspan)\n\nContainer trade recovered throughout 2024, returning to pre-pandemic growth trends following several tumultuous years that included a pandemic-era surge in consumer demand and numerous supply chain disruptions. This resulted in Vancouver’s four container terminals handling 3.5 million TEU, up 11 percent compared to 2023 and a two percent increase compared to 2019.\nGrowth was also recorded in the RoRo segment, with a record of almost 470,000 vehicles handled by auto terminals.\nDuring the year, the top trading partners that moved goods through the port were China with 46 million MT, Japan with 19 million MT, and South Korea with 18 million MT. Trade to the U.S. through the port increased to seven percent of total cargo moved amounting to 10 million MT driven by increased petroleum exports.\nWhile the performance shows that Canada’s biggest port which handles trade of approximately C$300 billion (US$208 billion) with up to 170 countries every year is on a growth trajectory, trade uncertainties ignited by tariff wars could impact the port’s activities going forward. Confusion continues to engulf a 25 percent tariff imposed on certain Canadian goods by President Trump, something that has forced Canada to retaliate.\n“The Port of Vancouver stands ready to support efforts to diversify Canada’s international trade and build a strong, resilient national economy. We will continue partnering with governments and industry to plan and deliver the long-term capacity needed to support trade through the gateway,” said Peter Xotta, VFPA President and CEO.\nApart from cargo, Vancouver also cemented its position as a critical cruise facility with passenger visits hitting a record 1.3 million, a seven percent increase from 1.2 million in 2023.\nLast week, Seaspan Energy reports it successfully completed Canada’s first ship-to-ship LNG bunkering for a containership in the Port of Vancouver. It took place on March 9 in English Bay. The LNG was provided to theCMA CGM Pointe Du Piton, a 7,900 TEU containership that was built in 2024 by HD Hyundai Samho by theSeaspan Garibaldi, one of three LNG bunkering vessels recently introduced by Seaspan. The company started its Pacific Coast LNG bunkering operation in December 2024 and brining it to Vancouver is seen as another factor supporting the growth of the port.\nTo sustain growth going into the future, Vancouver has been undertaking significant investments to improve operations and efficiency. These include expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline and Westridge terminal, densification, and modernization at Global Container Terminal’s Vanterm terminal increasing container handling capacity. The efforts are also enabling larger container ships to berth at the port."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Academy’s now well-publicized sexual assault scandal and the cover-up known as Operation Fouled Anchor is back in the spotlight with news that seven additional complaints have been filed. The law firm representing all the complainants, Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight reports it has filed a total of 29 complaints as the victims rush to file before a pending deadline.\nIn the seven new complaints, the individuals who were either cadets or prospective cadets of the Coast Guard Academy allege they were sexually assaulted either while in the dorm rooms, other USCG locations, or in one case an instructor’s home. As with the earlier complaints, some allege they were assaulted by classmates who entered their dorm rooms without permission while they were sleeping. In some cases, there are allegations that cadets had been drinking despite the Academy's strict policy against underage consumption of alcohol. Some of the cases were older, higher-ranking members of the service who are alleged to have taken advantage of cadets.\nThe scandal went public in June 2023 with anexposé by CNN. It recounted the years of sexual incidents at the Academy and how senior officers had ignored or purposefully hidden complaints. It also exposed that the Coast Guard had starting in 2014 conducted an internal investigation known as Operation Fowled Anchor but purposefully hid it and failed to reveal it to Congress.\n“Additional Coast Guard Academy sexual assault survivors continue to reach out to me,” said Christine Dunn, Partner and Co-Chair of the Sexual Violence at the law firm. Dunn along with Associate Jillian Seymour and Ryan Melogy of the New York law firm Maritime Legal Solutions, are handling the cases. “I’ve heard story after story of the sexual violence they endured at the Academy and how the Academy turned a blind eye,” said Dunn. “The Coast Guard can no longer be allowed to sweep sexual assault under the rug.”\nThe law firm says it believes the case to be the first known collective action by sexual violence survivors against a U.S. service academy. Each of the divisions of the military as well as the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy have faced charges of sexual assault. In one of the most famous cases, known as the Tailhook Scandal, U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviation officers were alleged to have sexually assaulted up to 83 women and seven men during a 1991 event in Las Vegas, Nevada. Protections against sexual assault have become a cornerstone issue for Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and others.\nOne of the challenges the complaints face is a complex legal process in which they must first file administrative claims under the Federal Torts Claims Act. Today, the seven new cases were filed against the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security which now oversees the Coast Guard, and the Department of Transportation which formerly had oversight of the Coast Guard.\nUnder the process, the government has six months to review the filings. Only then can the claimants move to file suit. However, there is a two-year statute of limitations for FTCA claims. The lawyers seek to get around this by claiming the extent of the sexual assaults and the cover-up only became public with the CNN investigation in 2023 and subsequent hearings in the U.S. Congress.\nThe Congress has been highly critical of the Coast Guard and its leadership for the handling of the scandal and failure to bring it to a close. In addition to faulting the USCG for failing to properly investigate and pursue allegations, Congress has proposed new regulations related to cadet safety. The Coast Guard Reauthorization Act calls for new mandates including requiring the Academy to install electronic locking mechanisms to secure cadet rooms and common spaces. The lawyers have accused the Academy of enabling the behavior by having a rule barring cadets from locking their dorm rooms.“Decades of documented moral failures by leaders of the U.S. Coast Guard have made it clear to Congress, the public, and survivors that the agency is unwilling to take steps needed to protect Coast Guard Academy cadets from systemic sexual abuse,” said attorney Ryan Melogy. “It has become obvious that only outside pressure can lead to change.”\nDunn and the Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight law firm reported it was filing the first complaints, from 12 women and one man who had attended the Academy in September 2023. In September and October 2024, Sanford Heisler filed similar FTCA complaints on behalf of additional sexual assault survivors, and with today’s filings, bring the total number of former Academy cadets represented by the firm to 29.\nIn January 2025, the new Trump administration ousted Admiral Linda Fagan, Commandant of the Coast Guard, in part due to her focus on DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). Admiral Kevin E. Lunday assumed the duties of Acting Commandant and will face the challenge of addressing what many see as a long-running, systemic problem that is yet to be fully addressed."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "After initially saying it would not comment on a “commercial deal,” the Chinese government used the media to lash out at the deal and criticize CK Hutchison. The proposed sale involves operations in 43 global ports outside China and the terminals at each side of the Panama Canal but is becoming embroiled in the larger political debate and the trade war between Trump and China as well as the government’s criticism of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing who controls CK Hutchison.\nThe government-owned newspaper Ta Kung Pao based in Hong Kong and seen as a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party released a strongly worded editorial on Thursday, March 13, attacking the deal on patriotic terms. It cites the Trump administration's moves on tariffs and pending proposal for port fees on Chinese-built ships rolling it all into an American plot for domination. They warn the deal is part of a plot to deprive China of access to key shipping routes and global trade.\nThe New York Times highlights that the article says if the deal is completed, “the United States will definitely use it for political purposes and promote its own political agenda. China’s shipping and trade there will inevitably be subject to the United States.”\nThe reports cite that there has been a growing strain between Li Ka-shing and the Communist government which views him as supporting rival positions. The article calls CK Hutchison which said it would make $19 billion on the deal “profit-seeking,” and says it is “spineless groveling,” as well as a betrayal of the Chinese people.\nSaying that the deal goes against national interests, the editorial warns that the company “should think twice,” and “carefully,” about its position and where it stands. Official government sources quickly reposted the article which was seen as a further government endorsement of the positions.\nAnalysts said it was not surprising that China would speak out against the deal but it might just be bluster as it does not want to lose its position in major ports such as Felixstowe in the UK, Rotterdam, Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia. CK Hutchison however would retain its Chinese ports meaning China does not have to approve the deal.\nThe sale of the two terminals in Panama at Balboa and Cristobal was positioned as a parallel but separate transaction. The government of Panama has already said it would be reviewing the sale and now Bloomberg speculates that Panama might use China’s criticism to reject the sale. Trump hailed the BlackRock deal as a key component to regaining control of the Panama Canal but NBC News reported yesterday Trump has also asked for plans to place a U.S. military presence in Panama possibly to seize the canal.\nThe terms of the sale are for a partnership with BlackRock and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company’s Terminal Investment Limited (TiL). MSC has taken a low profile in the media creating the impression that the deal is BlackRock’s.\nHutchison has not responded to the criticism of the deal but the value of its stock plunged as investors feared the sale might not proceed. The company had set the beginning of April as a target for a final agreement."

        "content": "Hours after reports surfaced that Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was rejecting Donald Trump’s overtures for new talks, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced a new round of sanctions targeting the oil industry and tankers. The move by the Office of Foreign Assets Control comes as the Trump administration has vowed a campaign of “maximum pressure” against Iran.\nIt was widely reported last week that Donald Trump had sent a letter via the United Arab Emirates to Khamenei seeking to start a new dialogue regarding Iran’s nuclear program. When asked by reporters, Trump last Friday only said “good things” are going to happen very soon. Today, however, Iranian media reports Khamenei dismissed the idea of negotiations referencing Trump’s decision during his first term to withdraw from the prior agreement.\n“The Iranian regime continues to use the proceeds from the nation’s vast oil resources to advance its narrow, alarming self-interests at the expense of the Iranian people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent announcing today’s designations. “Treasury will fight and disrupt any attempts by the regime to fund its destabilizing activities and further its dangerous agenda.”\nThe U.S. asserts that Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum is allotting 20,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the military. Further, they said the allotment would be increased to over 500,000 barrels per day. The U.S. asserts that half of Iran’s oil revenues will be going to its armed forces by the end of 2025.\nToday’s action designated Iran’s recently appointed Minister of Petroleum, Mohsen Paknejad, who assumed the role in August 2024. The U.S. said he is responsible for masterminding the oil operations and allotting the oil to the Iranian military to supplement its funding.\nThe U.S. also designated 13 additional tankers, including one registered in Iran and others registered internationally. The U.S. alleges the vessels are being used to transport oil from Iran or lift Iranian oil from storage in Dalian, China. Some of the oil is being transported to China or distributed to others in Asia. The tankers are said to be manipulating their AIS signals to disguise efforts to ship Iranian crude oil.\nThe vessels named include the Iran-flaggedPolaris 1, as well as Peace Hill (Hong Kong), Seasky (San Marino), Corona Fun (Panama), Neso (Panama), Lexi (Cameroon), Itaugua (Cameroon), Lydya N (Palau), Blue Gulf (Palau),Shannon II (Barbados),Malili(Indonesia),Celebes(Indonesia), andMarina Vision(Indonesia).\nThe effort also targeted a range of companies including ones in China and India. It lists companies in Hong Kong, Singapore, Seychelles, Suriname, and Bangladesh that it says are facilitating the oil trades or operating the tankers.\nJust weeks after returning to office, Trump announced thefirst round of sanctionson Iran targeting an additional 13 tankers. Since then, it has been reported in the media that the administration was looking at other ways of interrupting Iran’s oil trade, including possiblylaunching inspectionson tankers at sea under regulations designed to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nLast month, TankerTrackers.com highlighted that the U.S. so far has only sanctioned less than half of the tankers known to be involved in Iran’s oil trade. They calculated that over 500 tankers are working with Iran."

The wreck of the vessel known asWestern Reservewas discovered some 60 miles northwest of Whitefish Point in Lake Superior.\nTheWestern Reservewas a 300-foot all-steel cargo ship that had a short career but which left a lasting mark on the industry even following her sinking in August 1892 causing the death of 27 with only one survivor. Built just two years earlier for millionaire Captain Peter G. Minch, a highly respected shipping magnate, the steamer was one of the first all-steel vessels on the Great Lakes.\nHistorical accounts indicated that the steamer was built at a time when Minch and other shipping magnates were pioneering the industrialization of bulk carrier freight service on the Great Lakes. Her steel construction made it possible forWestern Reserveto carry heavier loads of freight than her wooden rival steamships.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, theWestern Reservewas admired as a pioneer. Apart from being deemed one of the safest ships afloat, she was also designed to break cargo shipping records. She earned the description of being “the inland greyhound” for her outright speed on the lakes.\nIronically, the fate that was to befallWestern Reservewould occur when the ship was not transporting cargo but on a leisure voyage. In August 1892 Minch decided to take his family aboard the ship for a late-summer cruise up through Lake Huron en route to Two Harbors in Minnesota.\nWhile the weather was pleasant and Captain Albert Myer had assured Minch and his family of a smooth voyage, things started to unfold when the vessel reached Whitefish Bay. Rough weather prompted the crew to drop anchor to await better conditions. Soon after they weighed anchor and steamed into Lake Superior, where a gale overtook the ship, battered her, and caused her to break and sink. Desperate efforts to attempt survival using lifeboats proved futile, with wheelsman Harry W. Stewart being the only survivor after swimming a mile to shore after his lifeboat capsized.\n\n\n\nFor about two years, explorers at the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) have been trying to locate the wreck ofWestern Reserve. In July last year, the society’s marine operations director Darryl Ertel and his brother Dan Ertel made the initial discovery aboard research vesselDavid Boydusing sonar technology. Subsequent ROV deployments confirmed the identity of the shipwreck, revealing a ship broken in two, with the bow section resting on top of the stern in approximately 600 feet of water.\n“Every shipwreck has its own story, but some are just that much more tragic,” said Bruce Lynn, GLSHS Executive Director. “It is hard to imagine that Captain Peter G. Minch would have foreseen any trouble when he invited his wife, two young children, and sister-in-law with her daughter aboard theWestern Reservefor a summer cruise up the lakes. It just reinforces how dangerous the Great Lakes can be…any time of year.”\nTheWestern Reserveis the latest shipwreck to be discovered in Lake Superior where more than 550 undiscovered wrecks are believed to be lying on the seabed.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "\nThe annual Iranian-hosted Exercise Maritime Security Belt with the participation of Russian and Chinese ships got underway on March 11 concluded on March 15. The exercise took place in the waters off Chahbahar on Iran’s eastern border with Pakistan. This was the seventh iteration of the exercise.\nThe exercise featured three phases of activity: an assembly and preparation phase, a maritime drill phase and a harbor summary lessons-learned phase, concluding with the customary fleet review. The overnight maritime phase - which will have been a boon to Iranian sailors fasting for Ramadan - included practicing offensive actions against maritime targets, visit/board/search and seizure operations, damage control procedures, and joint search and rescue drills.\nGiven the sea time needed to assemble the participating fleet, with the Chinese deploying from Djibouti and the Russians from Vladivostok, the active part of the exercise was extremely short, almost symbolic in character, emphasizing that the exercise had greater political significance this year than in previous years.\nSensing pressure from the new Trump administration, Iran has been seeking to strengthen its defense alliances, in the hope that they will provide some restraint to direct action against Iran’s nuclear weapons development programmer and ballistic missile capability. Both these capabilities were damaged by recent Israeli direct action, but remain largely intact and extant as a threat, with senior Iranian officers promising that Exercise True Promise-3, the next attack on Israel, will go ahead and has been scheduled.\nThere will also be fears in Iran that both Russia and China may have much more to gain by doing deals with the Trump administration, rather than persisting with support for Iran - which in overall terms could be seen as a cost rather than a benefit. Russia benefits - particularly while the Ukraine war continues - from Iranian shipments of missiles and drones, and China enjoys cheap Iranian oil. But the cost of being Iran’s best friends is to be associated with Iranian expansionism across the Middle East, adventurism which damages both American interests but also other regional countries which both Russia and China have far more profitable and productive relationships with. Chinese support for Iran has in any case always had some limitations. The Trump administration has been forthright in its determination to close down the threat from Iran, but less demonstrative about the threat posed by Russia. This all makes the Iranians nervous.\nHolding the exercise in the waters off Iran’s Sistan-Baluchistan also speaks to the threat posed by continuing separatist unrest in the province which is claiming a steady stream of Iranian security force casualties. While the insurgency is largely supported from across the land border from Pakistan, which has its own problems with Baluch separatists, Iran claims the insurgency is supported by unidentified foreign backers. Hence signaling an improved coastal defenses and surveillance capability to deter arms smuggling in this area will be a priority. China also has an interest in security in Baluchistan, as Chinese economic and commercial assets working on Belt and Road Initiatives have been subject to terrorist attacks in the area in the recent past.\nChinese participation came from the 47 th Naval Escort Group which commenced its deployment to Djibouti in December. The ships deployed were the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Baotou (F113) and the Type 903A replenishment ship Gaoyouhu (K904). The Chinese normally deploy three ships for this exercise, so representation this year was smaller than previously.\nThe Russian contingent for the exercise as expected consisted of the Steregushchiy Class Project 20380 missile corvettes Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov (F339) and Rezkiy (F343), plus the oiler Pechenga (IMO 7710977). On March 4 this flotilla from the Vladivostok-based Pacific Fleet concluded a live firing exercise in the Eastern Indian Ocean, en route to Chahbahar for the exercise.\nIranian vessels deployed consisted mainly of the ships which participated in a naval fleet review off Bandar Abbas on February 26, led by the Alvand and Moudge Class frigates IRINS Alvand (F71) and IRINS Jamaran (F76) and the obsolescent IRINS Bayandor (F81), with a number of fast attack missile boats. The IRGC Navy was represented by the catamaran missile corvette Shahid Soleimani (PC313-01). The converted oil tanker Shahid Bagheri (C110-4) did not put in an appearance as was expected, tending to confirm reports that is not yet operationally viable as a platform for launching drones.\nNaval staff from Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates attended the exercise as observers."

It is the next step in an effort by the Dutch to enhance the capabilities of its fleet and makes it only the fourth country after the U.K. and Australia to have successfully launched the missile from one of its vessels.\nThe test firing took place off the U.S. East Coast near Norfolk, Virginia in collaboration with the U.S. Navy and a Defense project team. The Netherlands released an image of the missile as it was launched from the frigateDe Ruyter.\nBuilt by Damen and commissioned in 2004, the frigate is one of four deployed by the Dutch. It is 6,000 tons displacement with an operating speed of 30 knots. The Dutch have announced plans to extend the life of the class at least for another decade with the modernization of systems.\nThe Dutch announced in 2023 plans to acquire the U.S. missile system for the frigates as well as its submarines. The U.K. has already deployed the system and in December 2024 Australia test fired its first Tomahawk from HMASBrisbanewhile off the U.S. West Coast. Australia and Japan have also placed orders for the system for future deployment.\n\n\nAustralia conducted its first test firing of the Tomahawk in December off San Diego (Australian Defence Force)\n\n“With this launch, the navy is gathering necessary information,” said the Netherlands’ Defense Ministry, “This will eventually allow it to fire Tomahawks from the air defense and command frigates.” Media reports have said the Netherlands expects to deploy the system in 2027.\nThe Ministry highlighted that the weapons would give the Royal Navy extra combat power and greater distance. The missiles have a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n“Think of command centers, anti-aircraft installations, and enemy units,” said the Ministry. They said the system would give the navy the ability to eliminate (strategic) targets deep inland from the sea."

Prosecutors and the defendant are scheduled to appear in the Hull Magistrates Court tomorrow, Saturday, March 15, at which time additional details might become public.\nThe captain of theSolong, Vladimir Motin, a 59-year-old from Primorsky, St Petersburg, Russia, was taken into custody and arrested the police reported on Tuesday less than a day after the two vessels collided about 10 miles off the UK coast. The police said they were leading the investigation of any potential criminal offenses after it was reported that a Filipino crewmember, Mark Angelo Pernia, age 38, was missing and presumed deceased. The search for the missing crewmember was suspended Monday night HM Coastguard reported.\nThe police said they were continuing to speak with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident in conjunction with the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Bureau which is leading the maritime inquiry. They called it a complex investigation and returned to the court on Wednesday to get a 36-hour extension and again on Thursday for a further 24-hour extension.\n“Additional time has been imperative to the investigation due to the complexities of the incident with the vessels in the sea, the number of witnesses involved, and establishing any scenes to collate and gather information and evidence,” the police said on Thursday.\nThe Prosecution Service cautioned against speculation to protect Motin’s rights to a fair trial. A spokesperson for the containership's owner said in a statement that it would be \"inappropriate for us to comment on ongoing police investigations. We are fully supporting the crew and assisting the investigation into the incident.\"\nHM Coastguard reported on Friday that the situation aboard both vessels remained stable as salvage teams were planning for the next steps. They said that small periodic pockets of fire continued on theSolong, which “are not causing undue concern.” The containership continues to be held in position by a tow line while the tanker has remained at anchor where it was struck on Monday."

The designs received initial design approval from ClassNK (Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, which reviewed the basic design drawings and risk assessment in awarding Approval in Principle (AiP).\nThe project is a partnership between Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Co., Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, and Namura Shipbuilding Co. They highlight to respond quickly to future demands, the designs have been completed in more detail than generally required for the AiP process. They are focusing on the market potential as a transitional fuel for power plans and the maritime sector as well as a hydrogen carrier.\nMitsubishi Shipbuilding, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, and Namura Shipbuilding have been working to develop a basic design for a large ammonia carrier. They report that the vessel is intended to have an engine that utilizes ammonia as the main fuel source, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the vessel. In addition, the rendering incorporates the rigid sail system, Wind Challenger, which was developed by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Oshima Shipbuilding Co. and first deployed in 2022.\nThe ship is designed to be even larger than the conventional segment for Very Large Gas Carrier/Very Large Ammonia Carrier (VLGC/VLAC) vessels. According to the project, this will enhance the efficiency of marine transport.\nThe revolutionary ship design they report satisfies the port entry restrictions at major power plants in Japan. It ensures compatibility between ammonia loading/unloading terminals, and cargo handling connections at a level almost equivalent to existing VLGCs.\nIt is anticipated that the first vessels could be built in the second half of this decade."

Operation command highlights the vessel along with a second ship,Ocean Gladiator, transport about 80 percent of the items needed for survival over the severe Antarctic winter when the station is cut off from the rest of the world. The supply mission was started in 1955 and conducted each year time for access to the base.\nOcean Giantfirst traveled to the U.S. support base in Lyttelton, New Zealand where it resupplied and took on additional cargo bound for McMurdo Station. When it reached its destination teams first had to deploy the causeway system which was used to replace the traditional ice pier which had been deemed unusable this year.\nIn total, 380 pieces of cargo, which included containers filled with mechanical parts, vehicles, construction materials, office supplies, and electronics equipment were offloaded fromOcean Giantin the Antarctic. The ship then loads station waste and recyclables and other materials for transport back to California. It made a resupply stop in New Zealand, departing on February 19 for California. It will now offload the materials brought back from Antarctica to complete the annual mission.\nThe second vessel,Ocean Gladiator, followed the same route arriving in Antarctica at the station on February 20 delivering a further 321 pieces of cargo.

        "content": "The International Combined Task Force 150 is continuing with efforts to tackle illicit activities in the waters of the Middle East. The task force, which is currently under the command of New Zealand reported the seizure of a total of 318 kilograms of heroin and 83 kilograms conducted by the Royal Navy’s frigate HMSLancaster.\nThe Royal Navy highlights that the illicit activity was first detected by its new Peregrine remote-controlled mini-helicopters while the frigate was on its patrol. The operators of one of the drones detected suspicious activity during a night flight when they saw two boats side-by-side in the Arabian Sea.\nThis prompted the launch of the frigate’s Wildcat helicopter for further investigation. The crews observed packages being transferred between a small craft and a dhow. The frigate made its way to the location at full speed while the team waited for daybreak. Teams were sent on the frigate’s fast boats for the interdiction.\n\n\nLancaster's crew retrieving the packages the smugglers tossed overboard\n\nThe smugglers however attempted to evade capture by getting rid of their illegal haul reports the Royal Navy. The small boats began dumping packages overboard. The crew ofLancasterhowever was able to recover the packages, which were subsequently tested and confirmed to be illegal narcotics. The interdiction by the Duke-class frigate was the first for the Royal Navy in 2025.\nThe Royal Navy highlights thatLancaster’s capabilities in fighting smugglers and drug runners were enhanced through the uncrewed Peregrine air system which was only introduced into operations at the end of 2024. Peregrine is the first remotely piloted helicopter operated by the Royal Navy. At just three meters long, the drone is capable of sorties lasting up to five hours and is suited for long and demanding surveillance missions.\n\n\nRoyal Marines from HMS Lancaster boarding the dhow\n\n“I am really pleased that Lancaster has been able to demonstrate the utility of a tailored air group consisting of the Wildcat helicopter and recently procured uncrewed Peregrine air systems in a combined 24-hour deck cycle to achieve persistent surveillance and beat illicit drug runners in the region,” said Sam Stephens, commanding officer of HMSLancaster.\nThe interdiction was the second for CTF 150 since New Zealand assumed command in mid-January. Last month, the U.S. Coast Guard cutterEmlen Tunnellseized nearly 2,357 kilograms of hashish aboard a dhow off the coast of Oman. CTF150 says its mission has been vital in tackling drug trafficking on the so-called “Hash Highway” covering the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Indian Ocean, and Gulf of Oman.\nThe Royal New Zealand Navy frigate HMNZSTE Kahais scheduled to join CTF 150 later this month. The last time New Zealand contributed a ship to CTF150 was a decade ago whenTe Kahaoperated under a French-led operation. At that time, the frigate intercepted, confiscated, and destroyed 257 kilograms of heroin."

Reports said he appeared with an interpreter and did not enter a plea. The court ordered him held and set a hearing for April 14 at the Central Criminal Court known in the UK as the “Old Bailey.”\nDuring the hearing which lasted less than an hour, prosecutor Amelia Katz provided the first details surrounding the incident. She told the court Motin had taken the watch about three hours before the allision and was in command when the containership hit the tanker. She told the court records show the vessel was traveling at a speed above 15 knots.\nReuters quotes the prosecutor as telling the court, \"For a period of over 40 minutes before the collision, theSolongwas on a direct route for impact with theStena Immaculate, which was anchored and stationary. There were no communication attempts from theSolongto warn of the impending collision and theSolongdid not adjust its course or speed at any point.\"\nFrank Ferguson, Head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, said yesterday in a statement that they had authorized the charging of Motin. He noted that Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia, age 38 and a crewmember on theSolong, was missing and presumed to have died during the collision and subsequent fires. His death promoted the manslaughter charge.\n“The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against this defendant are now active and that he has the right to a fair trial,” Ferguson said in his statement. “It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary, or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”\nFriday evening, a spokesperson for the owners of the containership, Ernst Russ, told The Maritime Executive, \"It would?be inappropriate for us to comment on ongoing police investigations.

        "content": "\nMVJairan, the second of two Iranian cargo vessels which is believed to have loaded sodium perchlorate in China, was on Saturday morning passing through the Straits of Malacca en route to Bandar Abbas. Sodium perchlorate is the primary feedstock for making ammonium perchlorate, used by Iranian solid-fueled ballistic missiles.\nThe vessel, which is owned by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) and is subject to secondary US Treasury sanctions, is expected to dock in Bandar Abbas well before its scheduled arrival time on March 26, and is currently traveling with its Automatic Identification System switched on.\nThe 16,694 ton MVJairanis believed to have taken on a cargo of 24 containers loaded with sodium perchlorate, enough to refine sufficient ammonium perchlorate to fuel about 250 medium range missiles of the types used by Iran to attack Israel in Operations True Promise-1 and 2.\nIn the form it is being shipped, sodium perchlorate is classified in the United States as a hazardous product, with explosive risks and the health risks of breathing difficulties and kidney failure from fume exposure. Besides being the feedstock for ammonium perchlorate, it can also be used as an oxidizing agent in engraving processes and in the manufacture of livestock fattening agents. But as a dual use product, and specifically because it is being conveyed by IRISL, the shipment should fall under the provisions of UN Security Resolution 1929, which cautions states to be aware of IRISL’s sanctions-breaking activities and its role in supporting Iran’s missile development, manufacture and maintenance activities.\nSodium perchlorate is processed and fashioned into ammonium perchlorate rocket fuel at the Iranian facilities at Parchin south of Tehran and Khojir. Ammonium perchlorate makes up 70% of the standard fuel load of most of Iran’s solid-fueled ballistic missiles.\nIranian ballistic missiles which use ammonium perchlorate include medium range Khybar-Shikan and Fattah missiles, and the shorter range Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles. In original and variant form, these have been widely exported to Russia and Axis of Resistance allies, and have been used to attack shipping at sea and targets in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Israel and Ukraine, as well as in the attacks causing injuries to American service personnel at Al Asad in Iraq.\nIllustrative of the uses to which ammonium perchlorate is put to in its solid fuel missiles, and the threat which it poses, in February last year the Iranian news agency Tasnim showed video of two containerized solid-fuel Zolfaghar missiles being fired from the deck of the IRGC’sShahid Mahdavi(Pennant 110-3) in the Gulf of Oman.\nThis missile has also been used by the Houthis to attack Aramco oil facilities at Ras Tanura. From theShahid Mahdaviand its sister ships, the Zolfaghar also has a mobile and wide-ranging anti-shipping capability.\nIran is likely to be seriously short of ammonium perchlorate at present, enough to take the risk of interdiction while shipping the material and the risk of causing political embarrassment to China - which currently is keen to protect its negotiating position with the United States over tariffs. Iran’s own ballistic missile domestic fuel production facilities have been damaged in Israeli attacks, and output demands are high because of the need to replace stocks expended in attacks on Israel and to meet increased exports to Russia.\nThe MVJairanis believed to be travelling without escorts at present, and by traveling with its Automatic Identification System switched on, it clearly believes that nobody has the political will to intercept the ship - notwithstanding efforts by eight US senators to press the US Department of State into taking action. As it closes on Iran, the MVJairanhas passed through the Straits of Malacca where it was particularly vulnerable, and as it travels towards the northern Indian Ocean it will soon acquire cover from the regular Iranian navy, which has in recent months has increased its naval presence in this sea space."

Houthi media outlets reported that more than 30 people died and 100 people were injured in 47 airstrikes, which hit targets in Hodeidah, Bayda, Marib and the Houthi capital of Sanaa.\nCENTCOM operations against Iran-backed Houthis continue...pic.twitter.com/DYvc3gREN8\nGoing forward, Trump pledged to use \"overwhelming lethal force\" until the Houthis stop attacking shipping in the Red Sea.\nThe Houthi movement launched attacks at more than 100 vessels last year, killing four seafarers and sinking two vessels, but it largely suspended its campaign in January when Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. As the Gaza ceasefire teeters on the verge of collapse, the group has threatened to renew attacks on merchant shipping in the Red Sea - initially focused on Israeli-linked vessels.\nIn a statement Sunday, Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree claimed that the group had targeted the American aircraft carrier USSHarry S.

        "content": "\nGuangzhou Shipyard's new jackup bridging barges have been deployed for their first known over-the-shore logistics exercise at Zhanjiang, China. Three of the barges were lined up perpendicular to the shoreline, jacked up, and then connected using their bridging ramps to create an expeditionary \"pier\" extending far out into the water.\nVideopic.twitter.com/aSxP4gJOXo\nBeachfront photos and videos of these \"invasion barges\" have been circulating on Chinese social media since last week. Open-source analyst Damien Symon identified the new exercise location in Zhanjiang using background imagery and synthetic aperture radar.\nIt is not the first time that the unusual special-purpose jackups have been spotted by Western analysts. In January, H.I. Sutton (and others)noticedat least three of the unique vessels at Guangzhou Shipyard, and quickly identified them as amphibious logistics enablers - uniquely designed to bridge the surf zone and transfer high volumes of military cargo to a secured beachhead. The bridge section is hinged and affixed to the bow, and when lowered, it spans about 400 feet. Three of the barges installed back to back would reach a substantial distance offshore, well back from the surf zone into deeper water.\nLike the \"Mulberry Harbors\" installed in Normandy after D-Day, the vessels would likely be deployed after a successful amphibious assault secured a beachhead on hostile territory and established a defensive perimeter. In a cross-strait assault to retake Taiwan, they could open up a larger menu of possible invasion landing zones: if they function as designed, they would allow Chinese forces to deliver heavy military equipment ashore early in the conflict, without the need to seize a major seaport first - so long as the beachhead could be defended from a counterattack.\nThe U.S. Army/Navy equivalent to this system, Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), centers on a floating \"trident pier\" tethered to shore. A floating deck barge located offshore helps offload cargo from deep draft ro/ro ships; that cargo is rolled onto Army ro/ro landing craft; and the landing craft deliver the cargo the final mile to the end of the floating pier. This carefully orchestrated system was designed for calm waters, and it is fragile above Sea State 3, as demonstrated during therelief mission to Gazalast year. That operation wascalled offafter repeated setbacks in open-ocean weather conditions.\nThe Chinese \"invasion barges\" are elevated on jackup legs, and appear less vulnerable to wave action than the U.S. Navy/Army JLOTS system."

        "content": "\nPhilippine-based International Container Terminal Services (ICTSI) has announced a major program of upgrades at key terminals around the world. After posting its most profitable year ever in 2024, with earnings of $850 million, it plans to invest $580 million in capital expenditures for 2025.\n“Our balance sheet remains strong, giving us the financial strength and flexibility to pursue new opportunities and invest in existing projects,” said ICTSI in a statement.\nSome of the planned projects in this round of financing include the new ICTSI terminal in Bauan, Batangas in Philippines. The construction of the Luzon International Container Terminal (LICT) was announced in October. With the funding now available, construction could begin in the second quarter. The $800 million terminal is scheduled to be completed in 2028 and will become the Philippines’ largest privately funded maritime terminal investment.\nAnother project planned for expansion is ICTSI’s Matadi Gateway Terminal (MGT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Last week, ICTSI said that it will be undertaking several key projects at the terminal this year, aimed at improving operational efficiency and customer service. One of the major initiatives is the construction of a 2.65-kilometer road linking the Port of Matadi to the national highway network. The first phase covering 1.75 kilometers was completed in June last year. The second phase began last month. Upon completion, the improved road access is expected to reduce container dwell times and streamline cargo deliveries to the port. Matadi is DRC’s main port serving the sprawling city of Kinshasa and the surrounding hinterland.\nOther terminals ICTSI is targeting for upgrades include completing the Phase 3 expansion of Mexico’s Contecon Manzanillo terminal in Colima. In addition, ICTSI is also pursuing equipment upgrades in its Rio Brasil Terminal, Brazil.\nMeanwhile, ICTSI is still battling with Maersk in a court case in South Africa over the operation of the Durban Container Terminal Pier 2 (DCT2). The hearing of the case proceeded in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court last week. Maersk, through its subsidiary APM Terminals, had moved to the court seeking review of Transnet’s decision to award ICTSI the concession for DCT2. APM Terminals cited irregularities in the awarding of the tender. While the case is nearing its conclusion, the terminal has been left without an operator for over one year. The concession is part of Transnet’s privatization initiative, aimed at resolving persistent port inefficiencies in Durban and other major ports across South Africa."

The Coastguard is saying the pollution likely entered the water at the point of collision on March 10 and that a retrieval operation has begun in the developing situation.\nThe RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) identified the pollution reporting on Sunday that a sheen had been spotted on the water. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said an aerial survey confirmed the pollution which has now been identified as plastic nurdles (small plastic pellets). Today, the Coastguard is reporting observers have found the first clumps of burnt pellets washing ashore.\nNurdles are small pellets of plastic resin used in plastic production. They are sized between 1 and 5 mm and weigh less than a gram. The concern is that they pose a risk to wildlife and are especially challenging to clean up. Sri Lanka dealt with a large-scale clean-up effort in 2021 when the containershipX-Press Pearlburnt and sank off Colombo and a large quantity of nurdles washed ashore. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) moved in 2023 for new regulations on the transport of nurdles because of the pollution risks.\n\n\n\nHM Coastguard released pictures of the burnt clumps on the beach. The said retrieval has started today.\nNews of the first pollution came after U.S. shipping company Crowley, which operatedStena Immaculateunder charter for the U.S. government, reported salvage teams had found the damage was contained on the vessel. SMIT Salvage is handling the job and its teams reported that only one cargo tank and one ballast tank were breached when the vessel was hit.\nCrowley reports there was a total of 220,000 barrels of Jet-A1 fuel aboard. They now believe that 17,515 barrels were lost in the fire or leaked after the vessel was hit. The remaining cargo and the vessel’s bunkers are reported to be secure.\nThe company is crediting the crew of theStena Immaculatewith heroic actions as the fires were beginning. It said the crew had the presence of mind to activate fire monitors to provide boundary cooling water to the adjacent tanks.\nThe companies have warned that the salvage operation will be complex and that it will require time. Plans are being developed for both vessels and being reviewed with the MCA."

        "content": "\nA fire incident this week onboard a Chinese fishing vessel,Dae Jin,while berthed at Suva Harbor, Fiji has rekindled concerns on marine safety in the country. The 24-year-old Fiji flagged longliner is said to had just completed offloading its catch when the fire started in the engine room. Twelve crewmembers, including Chinese and Indonesian nationals were able to escape, although some reported minor injuries. Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) confirmed the incident and said an investigation has been launched to establish the cause of the fire. Fiji Ports Authority also dispatched a tug to tow the burnt vessel out of the port.\nHowever, this incident comes hot on the heels of a growing push to clean up dozens of fishing shipwrecks abandoned near Suva Harbor. As operational costs for the fishing industry rise in the Pacific region, some companies are increasingly abandoning vessels in remote islands. In the case of Fiji, 25 vessels, mostly Chinese-owned, are now abandoned near Suva Harbor. This poses a significant environmental threat as well as a navigation risk to other passing vessels.\n“The vessels started stacking up in the harbor during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the owners came forward and helped in the clean-up process. That is why the number has dropped from 44 to 25. For the remaining wrecks, owners have refused to comply with removal notices,” MSAF CEO Joeli Cawaki told BenarNews.\nIn addition, some of the abandoned vessels could have been illegally operating without licenses and salvage coverage, leaving the entire disposal and clean-up costs to local authorities. MSAF estimates that it requires $170,000 to dispose of all shipwrecks abandoned off Fiji.\nWith an expansive EEZ and an influx of foreign-owned fishing vessels (some operating without licenses), Fiji is likely to deal with more cases of abandoned vessels in future. Unfortunately, the country is yet to ratify the Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks. The convention, which was adopted in 2007 and came into force in 2015, provides a legal basis for states to remove shipwrecks that have potential threats to safety of lives, goods and the marine environment. The convention makes ship-owners financially liable for costs of wreck removal. If ratified by Pacific Island countries such as Fiji, it could give an impetus to their marine debris removal programs. So far, Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, Palau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Nauru are signatories to the convention."

        "content": "\nWith the ongoing push for Ethiopia’s seaport access, the country is also advancing in the reorganization of its navy. On Friday, a Russian Navy delegation led by the Deputy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Vladimir Vorobyev, visited Ethiopian Navy facilities and training center in Bishoftu town, around 30 miles south of Addis Ababa.\nDuring the visit, the two sides signed a cooperation agreement on training and capacity building. Russia has pledged to work with Ethiopia in its efforts to modernize its navy, following an initial visit back in 2022. With a cooperation agreement now in place, “both sides will continue to work together to strengthen the naval rebuilding that Ethiopian navy has begun and to further strengthen its readiness to protect Ethiopia’s interests in the international waters,” said Deputy Commander in charge of operations in the Ethiopian Navy, Commodore Jamal Tufisa.\nWhile Ethiopia’s navy was originally founded in the 1950s, it had to be dissolved following Eritrea’s independence in 1993, which left Ethiopia landlocked. However, after taking office in 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced he would revive the Ethiopian naval forces. At the time, Abiy said that France would assist Ethiopia in rebuilding its maritime capabilities. The following year, French President Emmanuel Macron visited Ethiopia, culminating in the signing of a defense cooperation agreement that provides a framework for France to support the reconstruction of the Ethiopian Navy.\nIn 2023, the Ethiopian Navy held a graduation ceremony for part of its personnel who had received training in navigation, engineering, communication and armament. The training had been delivered by foreign and domestic instructors. The agreement with Russia shows that Ethiopia is keen to expand the pool of foreigner partners available to train its navy.\nThe cooperation coincides with Russia’s new search for a permanent base in the India Ocean. Last month, Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) foreign minister Ali Youssef Ahmed said that there were no obstacles for a Russian base in Port Sudan. Partly, this has been seen as a reprieve for the Russian Mediterranean flotilla, which was forced to leave Port of Tartus, Syria. But the ongoing civil war in Sudan could delay any constructive arrangements for a foreign naval base in the country.\nTop image: An aging monument to the Ethiopian Navy, Addis Ababa (Dvermierre / CC BY SA 4.0)\n"

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Federal officials were successful in withdrawing for what is believed to be the first time an environmental permit granted by the Biden administration for an offshore wind farm. New Jersey’s proposed Atlantic Shores offshore wind farm project had been singled out by Donald Trump in his opposition to the industry and this latest development adds another hurdle to an already troubled project and potentially the industry.\nAtlantic Shores which was proposed as a joint venture between Shell and EDF Renewables received its federal permitting including approval of its Construction and Operations Plan by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in October 2024. The plan calls for a two-phase project with a total capacity of 2.8 GW. The first phase, which would be in the southern part of the state near Atlantic City has consistently been reported to be in position to become New Jersey’s first offshore wind farm.\nDonald Trump singled out the project during the 2024 presidential campaign and in February 2025 said he hoped the New Jersey project would be “dead and gone.” Among the presidential executive orders were steps to review the industry and its impact on the environment.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency filed a motion in February to remand the 2024 approval granted to Atlantic Shores for review. Friday, March 14, Environmental Appeals Court Judge Mary Kay Lynch granted the motion saying it was appropriate based on Trump’s Executive Orders.\nLocal opponents have been contending that the review of the project’s EPA air quality filing did not meet a number of procedural requirements. They allege that the air quality modeling for the EPA permit was not done properly. The permit only pertains to the pile driving operation to set the monopoles for the project and not its operations.\n“Atlantic Shores is disappointed by the EPA’s decision to pull back its fully executed permit,” Atlantic Shores said in a brief statement. It emphasizes that “regulatory certainty is critical to deploying major energy projects.”\nThe project has already faced significant hurdles. Early in 2025, Shell said it was stepping back from its involvement in offshore wind energy and wrote off the value of its investment in Atlantic Shores. The project was also bid into New Jersey’s fourth wind solicitation but the state ended that round without selecting projects leaving Atlantic Shores without its necessary power agreements.\nLocal opponents celebrated Friday’s decision. They reported they have also written to the Interior Department and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asking them to reconsider the approvals granted during the Biden administration.\nThe American Clean Power Association warned that Friday’s decision “could chill investment in the U.S. for all types of infrastructure if a project permit is canceled for political reasons and not because of real impacts.”\nIn the last weeks of the Biden administration, BOEM approved other offshore wind projects including SouthCoast Wind which would serve Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and the Maryland Offshore Wind project. It approved a total of 11 projects and set in motion reviews for others. Since taking office Trump has stalled the future reviews and with Friday’s decision concerns are being raised about the projects approved but not yet in construction. The concern is that the Trump administration will use other loopholes such as the EPA permit for Atlantic Shores to delay the approved projects."

        "content": "\nAs shipping's global regulatory structure faces increasing pressure from regional interests, the International Chamber of Shipping and the Comite Maritime International (CMI) have announced a joint campaign to encourage national governments to ratify more IMO treaties.\nICS and CMI have been concerned for a long time that many governments are not ratifying important conventions. This year, they have updated their joint campaign to address the issue, and are encouraging shipowners to educate their governments about the importance of ratification. The effort focuses on a handful of conventions that the two organizations believe are the most important:\n- The IMO Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks (Nairobi WRC)- The IMO 2010 Protocol to the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea Convention (HNS Convention)- The IMO Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (Hong Kong Convention)- The United Nations Convention on the International Effects of Judicial Sales of Ships (Beijing Convention)\nOf these, the HNS Convention is the only one that has not yet received enough signatories to enter into force, and it has been awaiting full ratification since 2010.\nICS has long advocated for a single global rulebook for shipping, which is by definition a global industry. Merchant ships cross national boundaries every day, and the alternative to a robust international framework \"would be a plethora of conflicting national or regional rules that would seriously compromise the efficiency of world trade,\" according to ICS.\nRatifying conventions adds weight to their validity, brings national enforcement mechanisms to bear, and can add protection for signatory nations. The Nairobi Wreck Removal Convention requires shipowners to carry insurance for the increasingly high costs of wreck removal, and allows coastal states to pursue insurers directly to recover expenses. Non-signatory coastal states could miss out on that protection within their territorial seas, and could be left on the hook for the cost of cleanup of a foreign ship. Only 70 nations have ratified the Nairobi WRC to date.\nICS and CMI noted that IMO is available to provide legal and technical assistance to national governments if they wish to ratify and implement a new convention. Implementation typically requires new domestic legislation and new administrative functions in each ratifying country, and IMO has a program to help set up these mechanisms - but only if asked.\n\"The purpose of the campaign is for ICS and CMI members, which represent national shipowner associations and national maritime law associations respectively, to engage with their governments to urge them to ratify these conventions where they are not currently in force,\" said Kiran Khosla, Principal Director (Legal) at the International Chamber of Shipping. \"It is fundamental that the same regulations are equally applied to all ships engaged in international trade, and that the same rules apply during the entire voyage. A global industry needs global regulations.\""

The unions reported that government officials had been receptive in a recent meeting, and they hoped to make progress on a simmering dispute over reforms to France’s retirement policies.\nDockworkers and other port employees have been conducting a rolling series of strikes since January in a dispute that dates back to 2023 and the federal government’s plans for reforms in the national retirement project. The government of French President Emmanuel Macron pushed through controversial reforms in 2023 including raising the national retirement age from 62 to 64.\nThe unions are demanding that their industry be exempt from the changes to retirement. They insist it is a physically demanding profession that entitles them to special consideration.\nThe Federation National des Ports et Docks scheduled a strike for March 18 that was reportedly going to stop all activity in the ports of Le Havre and Rouen.  There were fears that it would include a suspension of the cross-channel ferry operations to England.\nThe job actions had varied since January ranging from four-hour stoppages to strikes ranging between one and three days. A prior action on February 27 stopped nearly all cross-channel ferry services for the day. The unions had vowed to intensify their actions in March with tomorrow’s strike to last for 72 hours.\nAfter a meeting with representatives from the Prime Minster and key government agencies, the unions said the government was more receptive to talks and honoring its earlier promises. The unions had been arguing that the government was not responding to earlier commitments and not proposing additional talks till 2027.\nThe unions have scheduled a general meeting for March 25 to review the status of their efforts. Leaders while they were seeking to ease tensions it would be possible that they would initiate new industrial actions in April if the government does not respect its commitments to the dockworkers."

They are believed to have taken control of the vessel off Durdura, in the vicinity of Ely, which is on the northern coast of Puntland, a semi-autonomous region within Somalia and the same area where other vessels have been attacked.\nAtalanta says there is a crew of eight Somali nationals aboard the vessel. It is monitoring the situation and coordinating with the Combined Maritime Forces and the Yemeni Coast Guard.\nIt is the second incident this year with another Yemeni fishing boat taken a month ago on February 17 and held for five days while the pirates robbed the vessel and its crew before fleeing. However, unlike the prior event which was labeled when it started as an armed robbery, this time Atalanta has classified the incident as a hijacking.\nThere also was an incident in December where pirates armed with AK-47s boarded a Chinese fishing boat and held up to 18 crewmembers. The Chinese embassy reported the vessel was freed in mid-January.\nThe last vessel that Atalanta classified as hijacked was in May 2024 after a rash of incidents that started in late 2023 around the same time the Houthis in Yemen began attacking shipping. Most of the attacks have been against smaller fishing vessels, but Atalanta continues to warn of the regional danger. Based on the continuing dangers, the European Union at the end of 2024 extended the mandate for the Atalanta mission at least until early 2027.\nAtalanta was formed in late 2008 and undertook its first patrols in 2009.

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nFully autonomous navigation is still in the testing stage for merchant ships, but AI mariner-assistance systems are already in commercial use - and their developers say that the technology is already bringing demonstrable safety improvements. In this interview, Dor Raviv, Co-Founder and CTO of Orca AI, told TME about how autonomous technology is improving safety and efficiency for commercial vessels worldwide.\nLet's start with a general overview of what's new in assisted navigation and autonomy in the maritime space. What are you seeing in the marketplace?\nMaritime shipping and commerce have gone through turmoil for the last few years, but it's been a very good era for AI and digitalization. At Orca AI, we've grown dramatically. We're now installed on more than 750 commercial ships with an order book exceeding 1,500 vessels. We've proven that AI perception for collision avoidance works and that it's something the market wants and needs. We've also made significant advancements in Japan with our autonomous ship collaboration. We've concluded the proof-of-concept phase and are now working on a full commercial suite for fully autonomous ships.\nThis growth is driven by multiple factors: increased safety requirements, new EU and IMO regulations on emissions and fuel reduction, and the challenge of recruiting crews to work aboard large ships.\nMore broadly, seafarers themselves have undergone massive transitions. Technologies like LLMs, ChatGPT, cloud computing, and generative AI applications are being utilized in so many day-to-day use cases. This has generated interest, trust, and a better understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations.\nTwo years ago, if you asked a room full of captains who had used AI in the past week, no one would know what you were talking about. Two weeks ago, I asked the same question to a room of captains in Athens, and everyone had used AI in the past week for something. This broader adoption has set the scene for what to expect from an AI system onboard a ship.\nWe also see an increased focus on maritime defense — shoreline monitoring, port monitoring, passive perception systems, mission autonomy, and USVs. Just last month, the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln collided with a commercial ship, which is exactly the type of situation Orca AI helps prevent.\nWe've been working with several navies on using cameras, which are much cheaper than radars, to provide computer vision-based perception adequate for autonomous navigation. The race for data to power AI for autonomous capabilities is in full swing.\nCan you tell us about the challenges in crewing and how automation on the bridge can help?\nIn an autonomous voyage scenario, crew will always be onboard, but perhaps in reduced numbers. If we can prove the system understands its limitations, we can approach our clients and say, \"Consider reducing watchkeepers under these conditions.\" That delivers immediate value — maybe reducing manning by one or two people per ship, which is massive savings.\nA ship might start with a decision support system for collision avoidance while docked. As it leaves port and enters coastal navigation in high traffic, it might use a Level 2 autonomy system for collision avoidance recommendations. When entering the high seas, it could switch to Level 4 autonomy focused on fuel and emissions optimization while maintaining navigational safety — this covers about 90-95% of the voyage.Upon encountering severe weather, low visibility, high traffic, or search and rescue situations, the system would automatically notify the crew to return to the bridge and handle these delicate situations.\n\nAn officer monitors an ARPA (right) and an Orca AI display (center) during a transit (Orca AI)\nAt Orca, we introduce these capabilities incrementally. Using our existing hardware, we're working with ABS toward Level 2 autonomy for 2025. This means understanding the limitations of sensor fusion, computer vision, collision avoidance, and translating those into a system that knows its boundaries and when to call the crew. After we gain trust with this bottom-up approach across our fleet of 1,500 ships, the transition from Level 2 to Level 3 autonomy becomes easier because we already understand the system's limitations. The phased approach, closely connected to crew requirements, makes much more sense for adoption.\nIn terms of timeline, how far out do you think we are before we start seeing ships that self-navigate in specific conditions?\nI believe maritime will transition faster than automotive or aviation. There are so many incentives, and while the industry is perceived as slow-moving because ships move slowly, the regulation here actually moves quite fast.\nAs the IMO MASS code for voluntary implementation comes to fruition by 2027, while EU ETS regulations have already started, I think that in about two years, we'll see ships navigating autonomously in the open sea under supervision and restrictions.\nThe infrastructure to support this is already here. Advanced perception systems like Orca AI's are already in production at scale. This scale allows ships to share rich data between themselves — not just AIS data, but context-based information like specific events, congestion, port traffic, etc.\nWe already have the connectivity and bandwidth to calculate optimizations in the cloud and share them back to ships in real-time. Remote teams already have access to live data streams including video from all cameras, sensor data, and location information.\nAll the class societies I've spoken with are moving quickly to approve these capabilities. They've brought in experts from universities to help push autonomy and AI to the mass market. In the past two years, I've conducted about six computer vision workshops with different class societies, discussing benefits, limitations, data gaps, benchmarking, evaluation scenarios, and the human aspects of AI integration.\nWhen the system is able to stand watch, do you anticipate there will still need to be at least one person on the bridge?\nIt's a good question. Realistically, such systems need to gain the trust of the crew — that's more important than gaining management's trust. It will vary depending on different crews and situations.\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, we'll always need someone on the bridge, at least in the foreseeable future — maybe just one person who isn't looking out the window but is monitoring other systems. But perhaps after 5-10 years, these systems will be so good that, yes, why not? Solo circumnavigators go to sleep from time to time; they're not awake 24/7.\nIt will take time to gain the confidence and trust of crews, but fortunately, they have plenty of time to evaluate these systems because they spend so much time on the bridge. I think this transition will happen faster than in other industries.\nInsurers have a clear economic incentive to improve safety. Can you tell us about your work with insurance partners like NorthStandard?\nThis is a very good question. Historically, insurance companies look at track records to set premiums. Now they have unprecedented amounts of context and data flowing from platforms like ours. They need our help understanding and assessing what constitutes risk.\nThis is brilliant because you have all the evidence to objectively prove whether these systems increase or decrease safety events, which could eventually lead to premium reductions. That's the holy grail.\nWe've been able to prove this to NorthStandard, and they now subsidize half the cost of our system to their clients in the first year. We have so much anonymized data backed up by chart data, video data, context events — all easy to explore, learn from, and use to understand improvements.\nThe goal for insurers is to become the most attractive insurance company by offering lower premiums to clients who adopt AI, automation, and data collection. It's a win-win-win scenario, and we're gaining interest from more insurers because we can empirically prove that ships using Orca are safer. We can track KPIs over time and show the data.\nAre we going to get to a point where AI can identify sailboats and fishing boats for COLREGS purposes? Or make passing arrangements on VHF?\nToday, all autonomous navigation systems use a camera as the primary sensor and everything else is fused to it. If I identify something as a fishing boat rather than a sailing boat, there's currently no logic in other systems to handle that distinction. You need a system with richer context to understand that if an object looks a certain way and is stopped, it's probably a fishing boat.\nIt's natural for humans to identify lights and patterns, but hard for AI systems to derive meaning from those cues alone. Practically speaking, when a system replaces people, it needs to operate properly without some legacy human requirements. For example, in foggy conditions where you traditionally listen for sound signals, I wouldn't trust a microphone to locate other vessels. I'd simply ask a crew member to come to the bridge and listen.\nSimilarly, it's extremely difficult to parse radio communications from speakers of different languages and translate that into machine code. Even with the latest ChatGPT technology, I wouldn't trust it as the sole solution for managing ship encounters. I'd want someone on the bridge in those situations.\nThe same applies to delicate operations like port docking. Instead of expensive technologies like lasers, LiDAR, and QR codes to position a ship precisely, maybe just use two tugboats. Don't over-solve problems or find solutions to problems that might not exist.\nDor Raviv is the Co-Founder and CTO of Orca AI, a company that provides AI-powered navigation systems for maritime vessels. Orca AI's collision avoidance system is currently installed on more than 750 commercial ships worldwide."

The indication is that the crew was uninjured and that the vessel is back underway after the boarders left the vessel.\nThe Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG) first issued the alert saying that it had received a report that an unnamed tanker had been boarded approximately 40 nautical miles southeast of Santo Antonio do Príncipe, on the island of Príncipe in the island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe off the west coast of Central Africa. MDAT-Gog’s last report was that the “unauthorized persons” had cleared the vessel and it was proceeding to Libreville in Gabon for refuge.\nThe vessel is being identified as theBITU River, a Panama-flagged bitumen tanker operated by Rubis Asphalt, a company that sourced bitumen at the refinery and distributes it across West and Central Africa. The 15,500 dwt vessel was built in China in 2022 and is the fifth bitumen tanker in the company’s fleet. The ship is 475 feet (145 meters) in length and the company reported when the vessel was delivered that it would operate with a crew of 14.\nAIS signals show the vessel had departed the anchorage at Lome, Togo and was proceeding to Douala in Cameroon. The security reports said three persons boarded the vessel. It is unclear when the shots were fired, but the company security officer late told MDAT-GoG the pirates had departed. There was no indication if the vessel was robbed or if any crewmembers were kidnapped.\nMDAT-GoG reported an incident in a similar location off São Tomé and Príncipe taking place on December 21 and December 22. In that incident the crew was able to secure itself in the citadel. Other recent incidents included an approach off Equatorial Guinea and a fishing boat being attacked off Gabon at the end of January.\nMartin Kelly, Head of Advisory at EOS Risk Group, wrote that this region is “the new stomping ground for pirates in West Africa.” He indicates that six vessels have been boarded since January 2024 off Equatorial Guinea and Gabon with 14 crewmembers kidnapped in three pirate attacks."

On land, satellite imaging shows that China has recently invested in infrastructure and housing development in the long-contested border zones along its western boundaries with India and Bhutan, raising concerns that Beijing could unilaterally declare ownership of lands that were previously subject to negotiation. For maritime security, the main concern is the Chinese island-building and maritime presence campaign in the Spratly Islands. China claims ownership of the entire archipelago under its \"nine-dash line\" policy, which was invalidated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2016. China has disregarded the ruling, and it has invested heavily in fortifying and manning a string of island bases within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone, hundreds of miles away from mainland China.\nIn related language, the G7 also emphasized \"the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to international security and prosperity.\" China claims Taiwan as its own, and has vowed to bring the island under Beijing's control, by force if necessary. China opposes foreign support for Taiwan, and it asserts that cross-strait relations are purely an internal Chinese matter.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Ottawa received the G7's statements as an affront, and it responded within hours. \"The [G7] statements are filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions to suppress and attack China. China strongly deplores and opposes this and has lodged solemn representations with the Canadian side,\" an embassy spokesperson said. \"[They] repeat the same old rhetoric, ignore facts and China's solemn position, grossly interfere in China's internal affairs, and blatantly smear China.\"\nTop image: China's island base at Mischief Reef (Tony Peters / CC BY 2.0)"

        "content": "\nScottish government-owned ferry agency CMAL has awarded a contract for seven small electric ferries to Polish yard Remontowa, snubbing a bid from the Scottish government's own shipyard, Ferguson Marine. The decision leaves Ferguson without orders for new tonnage, except for a module construction contract for BAE Systems.\nFerguson said that its bid led the tender on measurements of quality, but Remontowa won the contract on price. The two yards have been competitors in the same segment for years, and the loss could have an effect on Ferguson as it seeks to rebuild its orderbook.\nIn a statement, CMAL said that it had to follow Scottish public procurement law, and Remontowa's bid came out on top under the tender formula. \"We are confident in Remontowa’s ability, and have worked with them before, most recently with the delivery of the MV Finlaggan in 2011. We will now enter a 10-day standstill period before finalizing the contract,\" said CMAL CEO Kevin Hobbs in a statement.\nScottish opposition politicians slammed the award and said that it should have been handed to Ferguson directly, without a tender process. \"It should be a given that a nationalized shipyard wins a Scottish government contract,\" said Scottish Conservative spokesperson Sue Webber. \"It could yet prove the death knell for the yard.\"\nFerguson's reputation for quality took a turn for the worse during the construction of CMAL's long-delayed LNG ro/pax ferries, Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa. The project underwent multiple design changes and rounds of rework, and the costs forced Ferguson into administration in 2019. The Scottish government bought the yard out of bankruptcy and managed it through the completion of the two ferries; the project ended up four times over budget and six years behind schedule.\nAfter years of work, Glen Sannox finally entered service in January 2025. The ferry was briefly taken out of service on Friday due to a newly-discovered hull crack at a weld seam. It was repaired, and the vessel returned to commercial operations on Sunday.\nLeadership turnover has been comparatively high at Ferguson. The yard's interim CEO, John Petticrew, resigned Thursday after less than 12 months in the role. He had been expected to depart in November, but the board could not recruit a permanent CEO to replace him, and he agreed to stay on until April while the board sought a successor. He chose to depart last week instead, citing family reasons.\nPetticrew's predecessor, David Tydeman, was fired by the yard's government-appointed board after a series of unexpected delays and technical problems.\n\"We remain focused on securing a sustainable and prosperous future for the yard and are very close to announcing a permanent CEO to replace John Petticrew. We look forward to providing more detail on this very soon,\" Ferguson's chief financial officer David Dishon told BBC."

A U.S. military spokesman put the numbers differently, counting one ballistic missile and 10 drones; the drones were reportedly shot down by U.S. Air Force and Navy fighters, and the missile fell short of target.\nIn a statement Monday, Trump said that Iran exercised full operational control over Houthi forces, \"dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated military equipment.\" Iran has supported the Houthi movement since the start of the Yemeni civil war, and  U.S. forces have repeatedly intercepted Iranian missile component and drone shipments aboard dhows bound for Yemen. The intercepted components correspond to systems known to be used by the Houthis.\n\"Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of Iran, and Iran will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences,\" Trump said in a statement.\nOver the weekend, the president promised a continuing campaign of \"overwhelming lethal force\" until the Houthis fully abandon their campaign of attacks on merchant shipping.\nIn response, Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, told state media that \"we warn our enemies that Iran will respond decisively and destructively if they carry out their threats.\"\nHouthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said Sunday that the group will\" confront escalation with escalation,\" and that the terrorist group still has \"escalation options\" if the U.S. continues airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen."

He had been hanging on to life for months by eating whatever he could catch, and was in critical condition when found.\nMaximo Napa Castro, 61, set off from the city of Marcona, Peru on December 7. He was planning to spend two weeks at sea to fish, and had supplies for the journey. 10 days into the trip, he encountered a storm and his skiff's engine failed, leaving him adrift. Without an EPIRB, he had no way to send a distress signal for help. He ran out of food and water, and ate insects, birds and a turtle in order to keep going; he relied solely on rainwater for his drinking water supply, when it was available at all.\nWhile he was adrift, his family held out hope that he might still be rescued, even as the days turned into weeks and months. \"Every day is anguish for the whole family and I understand my grandmother’s pain, because as a mother, I understand her,\" said Napa's daughter, Ines Napa Torres, in a Facebook post. \"We never thought we would go through this situation, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.We will not lose hope, Dad, of finding you.\"\nAn Ecuadorian fishing patrol boat found Napa at last on March 11, adrift at a position about 600 nautical miles off the coast of Ecuador. He was severely dehydrated, and he was taken ashore in critical condition and delivered to a hospital in Paita, Peru; he was given IV treatment to nurse him back to health, and was discharged from the hospital on the 15th. He was flown to Lima for a joyous reunion with his mother and the rest of his family.\n\nNapa's family has complained that Peruvian authorities did too little to find the fisherman when he went missing. \"It took three months of constant struggle for the entire family to search on our own, and even to the point of pleading with the authorities to continue the search,\" his sister Flor Napa told Diario Correo. \"We didn't see the proper commitment to this, and I feel disappointed in the local and national authorities for not providing support in these cases.\"\nThe local authorities noted that Napa did not have an EPIRB. \"I think it was a fortuitous event.

The fine comes after the Australian Maritime Authority (AMSA) last year banned the vessel from sailing to Australia also related to safety issues in 2023.\nKMAX Leader, a Liberia-flagged bulk carrier, arrived at the Port of Gladstone in October 2023 reporting propulsion issues. Through the port agency, Universal Shipping Alliance, AMSA was advised the vessel would require eight to 10 days to complete repairs. Instead, the port and AMSA found themselves dealing with the ship for four months while two cyclones also impacted the area. The vessel finally left Australia in February 2024under towafter engineers had repeatedly failed to resolve the mechanical problems.\nAMSA now says, “The captain of theKMAX Leaderand its Australian agent, Universal Shipping Alliance, failed to respond to and act on the issued direction, despite repeated requests.” After the vessel left the port under tow, AMSA slapped a 12-month ban on it from entering Australian waters.\n“In this case, with a cyclone bearing down on the port, the consequences of not engaging a towage vessel to move the vessel out of the port, could have been catastrophic,” said AMSA Executive Director Operations Michael Drake. He warned that ignoring lawful directions from AMSA is not an acceptable option.\nAMSA emphasizes that a failure to act on a direction is a serious violation of the Navigation Act 2012 and carries severe consequences. As such it went to court and now the Gladstone Magistrates Court agreed. A fine of A$63,000 (US$40,000) was imposed on the owner along with court costs for failing to comply with AMSA’s written direction.\nOwned and managed from the Philippines,KMAX Leaderwas built in 2010 and became one of four ships AMSA barred from Australia during 2024. Three of the vessels, includingKMAX Leader, were banned for maintenance issues while the fourth was banned due to improper storage of explosives and repeated violations by the shipping company. AMSA highlights during its 2023-24 financial year, it issued 57 directions to vessels and operators in relation to safety breaches, mechanical deficiencies, and maritime labor issues.\n“We will not compromise on the safety of vessels and crew, or any potential threat to the community or environment,” said Drake."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAmerica's seaports have weighed in against the Trump administration's steep proposed fees on Chinese-built shipping, which could amount to an additional $3.5 million per port call if fully implemented. In comments to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) warned that the unprecedented fees would make U.S. exports less competitive, and it provided the industry's first hard numbers for what the proposal might cost in lost revenue.\nIn a statement, AAPA president and CEO Cary Davis warned that the fee structure would do little to counter China's dominance in shipbuilding, and said that it would have few near-term effects on domestic shipyard production. \"A fee on foreign vessels will simply not bring back American shipbuilding. Our existing shipyards are working at or near capacity, and higher demand for American vessels will not enable them to produce more ships with the same resources,\" Davis said, noting AAPA's support for alternative support policies like the SHIPS Act.\nAfter the USTR announced the fee proposal last month, AAPA joined a multi-industry study to assess the impact of the fees, conducted by Trade Partnership Worldwide. The early results suggest a double-digit decline for American exports because of the increased cost of shipping. The study's initial conclusions suggest that if the fees fully enter into effect, agricultural exports will drop by about 16 percent, petroleum and coal exports will fall by eight percent, and U.S. goods exports overall will drop by about 12 percent.\nU.S. goods exports amount to roughly $2.1 trillion per year, so a 12 percent drop would be a revenue decline of about $250 billion annually for U.S. exporters - equal to about one percent of U.S. GDP.\nThe plan as written would likely reduce traffic to smaller secondary ports, AAPA said, and would risk squandering federal investments in channel deepening and port infrastructure in midsize seaports on the Gulf and East Coasts.\n\"AAPA respectfully urges the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to reconsider its approach to countering Chinese dominance in the global shipbuilding industry by narrowing the scope of the proposed fees or reversing course,\" the association said.\nThe Louisiana Maritime Association (LaMA), which represents Lower Mississippi River maritime service companies, warned that American maritime workers could lose out in the near term, even if the fees eventually succeed in boosting future U.S. shipyard activity.\n\"The fallout will affect railroads, pilots, towage (tug) companies, barge companies and many small, independent businesses such as line handling companies, dock, terminal and facility workers,\" warned LaMA. \"The myriad of United States companies dependent on the shipping industry could (and reportedly already are) lose business based on the anticipation of the implementation of this USTR action.\"\nBIMCO reviews effects of port fees\nShipping association BIMCO also weighed in this week, and it provided a detailed overview of the likely effects.\n\"The proposed actions will impose much increased transport costs on US imports and exports and have negative effects on the wider US economy; their impact on Chinese dominance is much less certain,\" said BIMCO deputy secretary general Lars Robert Pedersen in a statement. \"The ships already built of Chinese origin will not disappear from the world fleet if the proposed port fees are introduced.\"\nPedersen predicted a splitting of the global shipping market into two halves: some shipowners would put together fully non-Chinese fleets in order to call in the U.S. without the penalties. Meanwhile, other shipowners would use Chinese tonnage to serve the rest of the global market, without making port calls in the U.S., and at lower price.\n\"The totality of the world fleet would not change, but the overall cost of maritime trade would increase due to less competition in the now segregated US market,\" he cautioned.\nThe boxship sector, which has consolidated into less than 10 large operators, is less likely to divide up the market in the same way, he said. Instead, ocean carriers will concentrate port calls into the largest hubs, avoiding the extra fees that would come with each call at secondary ports. Those smaller ports would go underutilized while congestion would grow at the major trade gateways, he warned.\nPedersen noted that a U.S.-built requirement for U.S. export shipping would raise costs \"significantly,\" and would affect the competitiveness of American exporters - particularly farmers. Inexpensive commodities like grain and soy would be most affected as a percentage of cargo value, he warned."

        "content": "\nThe Chinese government continues to apply pressure after the news of CK Hutchison’s planned sale of its international port operations, including in Panama to a partnership between U.S. investment group BlackRock and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company’s TiL ports group. The deal has become mired in the politics between Donald Trump and China.\nWhile Beijing has officially remained silent on the deal, it has used proxies to increase the pressure against Hutchison and Li Ka-shing, the tycoon behind the company. He has long been seen at odds with the Communist Party but when CK Hutchison announced plans to sell its foreign port operations early in March it called the deal “purely commercial,” and said it was “unrelated to recent political news reports,” in a veiled reference to Trump’s assertions regarding the Panama Canal.\nThe company, headquartered in Hong Kong, has largely gone silent in the face of the campaign being waged in the media. Yesterday, the company said it would not hold its normal briefings with investors and the media when it releases its financial results.\nIn a regularly scheduled press conference, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive John Lee spoke out against the proposed sale echoing last week’s pressure from a newspaper closely linked to the Community Party. Analysts highlight that historically Hong Kong has not asserted legal rights to review transactions selling assets to foreign companies, unlike the mainland government that closely controls foreign asset sales.\nLee speaking to reporters cited the “extensive discussions” related to Hutchison’s proposed sale saying it reflects “society’s concern” over the sale which last week the newspaper called unpatriotic and against national interests. Today, Lee said, “These concerns deserve serious attention.”\nHe said that any transaction “must comply with the legal and regulatory requirements. Hong Kong will handle it in accordance with the law and regulation.”\nHutchison highlighted when announcing its plan that the deal, which involves a total of 43 ports in 23 countries, does not involve its Chinese port operations. Further, the sale of the two terminals in Panama is in a parallel transaction subject to the review of the Panama government and separate from the other international ports.\nChina has said it views the deal as coercion by the United States and efforts to extend the U.S.’s dominance over China and others.\n“The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong,” Lee told reporters today. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic, and trade relations.”\nAt the same time, it was reported that China sent a delegation to Panama over the weekend. Under pressure from Trump, Panama has sought to back away from its close relationship with China including serving notice that it would not renew its participation in the Belt and Road initiative. The Panama Government continues to assert that the canal belongs to Panama but said it would review the proposed transaction between Panama Ports controlled by Hutchison and the BlackRock-MSC partnership. Earlier, Panama said it was reviewing the contract awarded to Hutchison to run the two terminals.\nHutchison and BlackRock agreed in March to enter into exclusive negotiations to finalize the terms of the transaction. The companies set a target of on or before April 2 to sign definitive documentation for the Panama Ports Corporation portion of the deal. It said that the acquisition of the HPH Ports Sale Perimeter would proceed on “an expedited basis” subject to the BlackRock-TiL Consortium conducting normal and usual confirmatory due diligence, settlement of definitive documentation, and receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, amongst others."

This sealift convoy was spotted departing Syria on March 2, laden with Russian military equipment from the ongoing evacuation.\nIn early December, U.S.-designated terror group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted longtime Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, driving Assad's Russian military backers into retreat. Under Assad, Russia held a 49-year lease on the port of Tartus, home of the only Russian naval base in the Mediterranean. Under HTS, the terms of Russia's ability to stay at the base have been up for negotiation, and Russia's military has been extracting shiploads of vehicles and containerized cargo from the port since January.\nRussia has been in talks with Syria's new Islamist leadership about a revised status of forces agreement, and has received positive signs from HTS about maintaining Russian base infrastructure - in exchange for continued Russian support for the battered Syrian economy. No final deals have been announced, but a sanctioned Russian tanker recently got underway from Murmansk with a load of one million barrels of crude oil for Syria's Baniyas refinery, replacing the Iranian supplies upon which al-Assad relied.\n\"Russia is using fuel as rent money for its maintained armed presence in port Tartus, Syria,\" observed TankerTrackers.com, which first reported the shipment."

        "content": "\nDP World signed a long-term strategic agreement with Maersk as part of its plans to expand maritime services at its terminal in the Port of Santos, Brazil. DP World operates one of Brazil’s largest private terminals at the Port of Santos and plans to increase capacity by 50 percent to support Maersk’s growth in Latin America.\nUnder the terms of the eight-year agreement, Maersk will introduce additional long-term services and maintain a minimum service level. In the first year, Maersk will launch six new services with eight weekly calls, increasing to seven services and 10 weekly calls in 2026 following DP World’s capacity expansion.\n“This announcement is another strategic step for DP World in Brazil, reinforcing our presence at the Port of Santos, and accelerating new expansion opportunities in the country,” said Márcio Medina, Commercial Vice President at DP World in Brazil. He noted the agreement with  Maersk “not only allows us to expand our operational capacity for container handling but also ensures long-term aces to Brazil’s leading port and logistics hub.”\nCurrently, the terminal handles 1.4 million TEUs annually. To accommodate growing demand, DP World is investing R$450 million (US$79 million) to expand its container-handling capacity to 1.7 million TEUs by the end of 2026. The company also plans to invest an additional R$1.6 billion (US$280 million) to further increase capacity to 2.1 million TEUs by the end of 2027.\n“This agreement with DP World secures service capacity for Maersk at the Port of Santos,” said Paulo Ruy, Regional Head of Terminal & Port Procurement for Latin America at Maersk. “By having this commercial agreement with DP World, we are able to meet the growing demand for container handling and enhance our service offerings, ensuring that we continue to provide end-to-end logistics solutions, in addition to our stand-alone products.”\nDP World reports it set a new record for container-handling volume at the Port of Santos in 2024, surpassing 1.25 million TEUs – a 14 percent year-over-year increase. The growth was driven by expanded container operations and the introduction of new services. The company recently invested R$50 million (US$8.8 million) in advanced port equipment as part of its ongoing R$85 million (US$15 million) terminal expansion project, which will increase capacity to 1.7 million TEUs. Additionally, DP World said it has strengthened its network through a new agreement with Rumo, Brazil’s leading railway operator, to develop a new terminal for grain and fertilizer shipments, adding 12.5 million tons of operating capacity per year."

The incoming missile was shot down, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.\nAfter the attempted Houthi strike, a Pentagon spokesperson told reporters that the U.S. campaign to tamp down Houthi attacks would continue as long as needed, and U.S. Central Command said that it was conducting \"continuous operations\" against Houthi positions.\nCENTCOM continuous operations against Iran-back Houthi terrorists…#HouthisAreTerroristspic.twitter.com/ppggVK1Jgg\n\"The Houthis can determine when this ends, and until then, the campaign will be unrelenting. All options are on the table,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters Tuesday. \"This is not an endless offensive. This is not about regime change in the Middle East, this is about protecting American interests.\"\nU.S. President Donald Trump has warned that his administration will hold Iran responsible for further Houthi attacks, given Tehran's role as the primary supplier of weaponry for Houthi operations.\nIn public, Iran denies that it has direct control over Houthi decisionmaking, though it counts the group as a member of its \"Axis of Resistance\" in the Mideast. On Sunday, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Commander Hossein Salami asserted that the Houthi movement \"makes its own strategic decisions, and the Islamic Republic of Iran has no role in setting the national or operational policies of any movement in the resistance front.\"\nIn private, Iranian officials have quietly told reporters that Tehran has asked the Houthis to deescalate the situation. The group does not appear ready to comply: On Monday, Houthi foreign minister Jamal Amer told Reuters that \"there will be no talk of any dialing down of operations before ending the [Israeli] blockade in Gaza.\" He added that Iran \"mediates sometimes but it cannot dictate things.\"\nThe renewed regional conflict is likely to prolong the timeline for the full resumption of maritime commerce in the Red Sea. Independent analysts suggest that container lines will be reluctant to return to the region until tensions calm down, and the hostilities could keep vessel diversions around the Cape of Good Hope going much longer into the year than expected. This is welcome news for the top-10 container lines, which have projected strong profitability as long as the longer Cape route continues - and low profitability as soon as the Red Sea reopens. The resumption of the Suez route will shorten voyages on the busy Asia-Europe trade lane by weeks, releasing excess vessel capacity onto the market and pushing down rates."

        "content": "\nU.S. shipping company Crowley in partnership with Naturgy is launching a new service to supply U.S.-produced LNG on a regular basis to Puerto Rico. It is part of a history-making move that brought a 1994 French-built LNG carrier into the U.S. registry using a provision added to the Jones Act for shipping LNG or LPG to Puerto Rico.\nCrowley acquired the LNG vessel in December 2024 from a subsidiary of Malaysia’s MISC Berhad. After U.S. Coast Guard inspection and approval, the vessel was renamedAmerican Energyand placed in the U.S. registry as of January 2025. It had previously operated as theIntanand was registered in Liberia. The vessel, originally known asPuteri Intan, was built by France’s Chantiers de l'Atlantique.\nThe 900-foot-long (274 meters) LNG carrier has a capacity 130,400 cubic meters (34.4 million gallons) per voyage and is now owned by Crowley and will be crewed by U.S. mariners providing regular service from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Puerto Rico. Crowley reports it will operate in accordance with the U.S. Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996. A provision made it possible for a foreign-built vessel to enter the U.S. registry for the trade to supply gas to Puerto Rico.\n\nCrowley is building on our 70-year commitment to the island of Puerto Rico. We’re proud to officially launch American Energy, the first domestic liquified natural gas (LNG) carrier to transport U.S.-sourced natural gas to Puerto Rico. In partnership with@Naturgy, each delivery…pic.twitter.com/XwmOeZbi1n\n\n“The entry into service of?American Energy?marks a significant step for fuel supply reliability in Puerto Rico for our energy grid, which will greatly benefit our people,” said Puerto Rico Governor Jenniffer González-Colón. “This partnership is an initiative to act using existing regulations to increase access to a U.S.-based LNG source that expands our options for the stabilization of our energy grid, as we work towards providing our residents and businesses a more consistently reliable power generation source.”\nCrowley highlights that the new operation builds on its 70-plus years of service to Puerto Rico. Annually, Crowley reports it delivers more than 94 million gallons of LNG through its LNG Loading Terminal in Penuelas as well as provides ocean delivery and land transportation using ISO tank containers. The company also operates the full-service marine Isla Grande cargo terminal in San Juan for its container and roll-on/roll-off vessels, including two LNG-fueled ships, and logistics services.\n\n\nU.S. flag raising on the American energy which has a homeport of Jacksonville, Florida (Crowley)\n\nCrowley and Naturgy have entered into a multi-year agreement that provides for the regular delivery of the U.S. mainland-sourced LNG to Naturgy’s operating facility in Penuelas, Puerto Rico.\n“This contract strengthens our presence in the global LNG market, particularly in the United States, and allows Puerto Rico to obtain a stable and competitive energy supply route,” said Jon Ganuza, general manager of supply and wholesale markets, Naturgy.\nThe U.S. Merchant Marine Act of 1920, widely known as the Jones Act, requires that cargo transported by ship between U.S. ports must be handled on vessels that are owned and registered in the U.S. While it also requires U.S.-built ships, provisions and exemptions have been provided when unique vessels, such as LNG carriers, are not available so that the ships can be added to the U.S. registry.\nThe new LNG service, which is expected to travel to the island twice each month comes as the recently-elected governor also looks to strengthen the island’s manufacturing sector. Today, she announced a new initiative to reshore manufacturing to the island as part of an effort to attract investment and strengthen the job market and economy of Puerto Rico."

        "content": "Continuing its efforts to incorporate new technologies to advance its efforts at reducing emissions, Stena Line is adding two wind rotor sails to one of its two NewMax hybrid vessels and completing the other sister ship “rotor sail ready.” The two vessels currently under construction in China are among the most advanced designs incorporating new technologies to be “future proof” as the company seeks to expand on its strategic ambition of shifting to renewable fuels and cutting CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030.\nThe NewNax vessels were ordered in early 2023 to be built by China Merchant’s Jinling Shipyard in WeiHai. At 147 meters (428 feet) in length and with 2,800 lane meters of capacity, the vessels represent an 80 increase over the current ships operating the freight service on the route from Belfast, Northern Ireland to Heysham, England. The ships will be equipped to carry 12 passengers and 26 crew.\nAmong the advanced features incorporated into the design is a hybrid propulsion plant able to operate on methanol fuel. In addition, to future proof the design, Stena reported during construction it was incorporating technologies that would take advantage of both battery propulsion and shore power when it becomes available.\nThe company reports it has now completed a deal with Norsepower to add two Rotor Sails to one of the vessels. Each rotor will measure 28 x 4 meters (approximately 92 x 13 feet) and is expected to deliver a further nine percent fuel savings on the planned route. The sister ship will be delivered ready for the future addition of rotor sails.\nAccording to Stena, operating on the Irish Sea between Belfast and Heysham, the vessels will have wind conditions that are very favorable for wind-assisted propulsion. The company has also said that the unique tidal systems prevailing in Heysham can be challenging, so each vessel will be fitted with a technology configuration making the ships more resilient to the prevailing weather conditions. They will have three bow thrusters for maneuverability and specially designed engine/propeller configuration to enhance berthing capabilities in extreme weather conditions.\n\n\nThe first vessel of the class, Stena Futura, was launched in October 2024 (Stena Line)\n\nSteel cutting for the first of the vessels began in January 2024 and its keel was laid in July. The vessel was floated in October as theStena Futurawhile the keel for the second shipStena Connectawas laid at the same time.Stena Connectawas launched at the end of February 2025. The first of the ships is scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of this year and the second one in 2026.\nThe company highlights that it became the first ferry operator to run a vessel on methanol with the 2015 conversion of theStena Germanica. Since then, it has pursued further steps including the addition of more bulbous bows, tilted propellers, additional shore power capabilities, and experimented with battery power. It views the rotor as the next step in its continuing effort to improve performance and reduce emissions from its fleet."

        "content": "Two vessels made contact in the Gibraltar anchorage early on Tuesday in similar circumstances to the 2022 incident which led to the loss of the cargo shipOS 35. While the government was quick to report the damage was minor, it renewed the questions about the use of pilots and the recommendations in theOS 35report that highlighted that pilots would likely have prevented the incident.\nShortly after midnight on Tuesday, March 18, the Panama-flagged LNG carrierSM Kestrelwas getting underway from the Western Anchorage. The vessel built in 2023 in Korea is part of the new Korea Line LNG subsidiary launched by SM Line. It is 114,000 dwt and 984 feet (300 meters) in length.\nA spokesperson for the Gibraltar government confirmed to the news outlets that the LNG carrier “came in contact” with another vessel. They said there were no injuries and no significant damage to either vessel, but both were ordered to remain in the anchorage. Class, flag, and port inspectors were due to inspect both vessels.\n\nLNG tanker comes into contact with anchored Bulk Carrier in western anchoragehttps://t.co/wHDHoAhNIa\n\nTheSM Kestrelmade contact with the Panama-flaggedDiamond Star II(57,700 dwt). The bulker had arrived in the anchorage on March 17. It was at anchor in the Western Anchorage, which is a busy part of Gibraltar Bay. Gibraltar has two anchorages, the Eastern which is used for provisioning and crew changes, and the Western where bunkering operations are conducted.\nTheOS 35was also maneuvering to leave the Western Anchorage in August 2022 and the vessel was encountering problems with the turns. As it got underway, it struck the bulbous bow and anchor of theAdam LNGcarrier, which only suffered minor damage. However, the cargo ship started taking on water and was ultimately directed into another part of the bay so that it could be grounded. It was a total loss and it took more than a year to salvage the vessel.\nGibraltar’s regulations only require pilots for berthing and unberthing, and not for departing the anchorage. In the case of theOS 35, there also was no requirement for the master to advise Gibraltar’s VTS of the intended plan so the VTS could not realize the vessel was off-plan. The VTS only called the vessel when it became concerned.\nThereport on the lossof theOS 35recommended that the Gibraltar Port Authority consider introducing compulsory pilotage for vessels departing the Western Anchorage. It also recommended the involvement of the VTS which could advise vessels on their departure plans. Short of these steps, it also called for the Gibraltar Pilots to highlight their availability for departures, and that they should make clear the process for requesting pilots for departures.\nBecause of its strategic location at the entrance to the Mediterranean, Gibraltar is a key port for many vessels. It is a busy bunkering port and a frequent stop for vessels for supplies and other services arriving from overseas or before they depart from the region. The Gibraltar Port Authority highlights that approximately 60,000 vessels transit the Strait of Gibraltar each year, with around 240 million gross tonnes of vessel calls per year at Gibraltar and its anchorages.\nTop photo byYmblanter-CC BY-SA 4.0"

        "content": "\nAt an annual general meeting held Tuesday, Maersk shareholders voted down an activist investor resolution that would have banned the company from shipping arms to Israel.\nEarlier this month, shareholder activist group Kritiske Aktionærer filed a proposal to stop number-two ocean carrier Maersk from shipping military cargoes to Israel. The motion was opposed by Maersk's board, and when it was put to a vote at the company's annual general meeting Tuesday, it did not pass.\nMaersk denies shipping weapons or ammunition to Israel. In a statement Tuesday, it noted that its U.S. subsidiary - Maersk Line Ltd. (MLL) - has never even filed a transportation plan to ship \"classified or sensitive cargo, which includes weapons and ammunition.\" MLL is a U.S. Maritime Security Program (MSP) participant, and it operates U.S.-flagged vessels that carry federal cargoes, including the military assistance shipments that are a critical element of U.S. foreign policy.\nHowever, Maersk's critics have differing opinions about which cargoes could be considered \"weapons.\" Investigative journalism group Danwatch has obtainedbills of ladingthat appear to show that more than a dozen Maersk-owned ships carried thousands of tonnes of militarily-useful goods to Israel since the beginning of the Gaza conflict. In one example of a complete system delivery, one bill of lading appears to show that MLL shipped seven armor-equipped Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks (HEMTTs) to Haifa in November 2023. While HEMTTs are cargo vehicles, they meet EU definitions for military equipment, and Israeli forces have used armored HEMTTs inside of Gaza for logistics and prisoner transport.\nThe tabloid Ekstra Bladet alsoidentifiednine bills of lading with HTS code 9306.90 (explosive munitions and parts thereof), four with HTS code 9305.91 (cannon parts), and 31 with HTS code 9306.30 (cartridge components).\n\"The transport of cargo on behalf of the US government does not contain weapons or ammunition. These shipments contain military-related equipment and are derived from US policy under the US-Israeli security cooperation program,\" Maersk told Extra Bladet in response.\nIn its statement Tuesday, Maersk again denied transporting weapons to Israel and pushed back against \"misrepresentations\" about its business.\n\"The [activist] campaign is spreading inaccurate allegations and has in some instances involved assumptions presented as documented facts and what looks like misleading information through twisting of publicly available data,\" said Maersk in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we have also experienced vandalism and illegal, aggressive demonstrations on our premises and against our employees. This will not change our position or our business practice, guided by international standards.\"\nThe company said that it has a strict policy of not shipping weapons or ammunition to active conflict zones, and that it complies with all international regulations. \"We fully recognize our responsibility as a global logistics provider and that it is on us to always reinforce the internationally agreed responsible business practices – even more so when operating in areas of active conflict,\" the carrier said in a statement."

        "content": "\nSouth Korea’s Hanwha Group is continuing its efforts to build its position in shipbuilding including the U.S. naval market by renewing its interest in Austal. Six months after reporting it wasdiscontinuingits efforts to acquire Austal, Hanwha today announced it is moving to become the largest shareholder in the Australia-based shipbuilder.\nHanwha announced the acquisition of 9.9 percent of Austal’s shares in open market transactions in Australia. Under Australian securities law, foreign companies can only purchase a 10 percent stake without filing with regulators, a step that Hanwha reported it has taken today. In addition to the shares purchased, Hanwha has entered into a swap transaction for an additional 9.9 percent of the shares with an Australian securities firm using a mechanism that allows it to receive the interests of shares without direct ownership.\nIn a filing with the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), Hanwha declared its interest in becoming an investor with a 19.9 percent stake in Austal. Analysts are calling it a clever move to quickly deepen the relationship without the time required to renew the acquisition bid, but at the same time, it achieves a first level of review from Australian regulators.\nIt became public in April 2024 that Hanwha was proposing to acquire Austal, but the Australian shipbuilder immediatelyrejectedthe approach saying it did not believe it would gain regulatory approval. Hanwha dismissed it saying that it already had strong ties in Australia and that a combination would strengthen the capabilities of the company in its role as national interest in Australia. However, it later accused Austal of insisting on onerous conditions to proceed with the offer.\nHanwha has indicated that it is paying a 16 percent premium to the closing price of Austal’s shares on Monday to increase its holdings. It reported paying $117 million for the initial share of 41.2 million shares. The acquisition was done through an Australian subsidiary owned by Hanwha Systems and Hanwha Aerospace.\nWhile Austal also builds high-speed ferries, offshore wind farm vessels, and oil and gas platform ships, Hanwha’s interest lies in its leadership role in naval shipbuilding. Hanwha highlights that Austal is one of the four key suppliers that directly build U.S. military vessels (along with Hutchison Ingalls, Lockheed Martin, and Fincantieri) and that Hanwha “plans to strengthen its position as a key player in the global shipbuilding and defense industry through this investment.”\nAustal is reported to rank first, holding 40 to 60 percent market share in the U.S. small surface combatants and logistics support vessel sector. It has shipbuilding facilities in Mobile, Alabama and San Diego, California in the U.S. as well as Australia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. It recently highlighted its fundraising efforts to support further expansion of its U.S. operations. Austal is reported to have an orderbook valued at US$9 billion.\n“As a strategic investor, we will support Austal’s growth and innovation and spare no effort in investing in strengthening the local defense industry and naval shipbuilding capabilities in Australia,” said Michael Coulter, President and Head of Overseas Business at Hanwha Aerospace. “Hanwha’s smart shipbuilding and defense industry capabilities can provide Austal with capital, network, operational and technical expertise.”\nHanwha said that its recent equity acquisition aims to strengthen its strategic partnership with Austal, not only in Korea and Australia but also in the United States, amid the favorable conditions of the global defense and shipbuilding industries.\nThe investment in Austal follows Hanwha’s acquisition of Philly Shipyard at the end of 2024. The company highlighted the opportunities to expand in U.S. shipbuilding and specifically for the U.S. government before Donald Trump took office and set expanding the U.S. Navy and restoring the U.S.’s shipbuilding capabilities as two of his first priorities."

        "content": "\nMore than a year after Chinese warships established a presence at the new naval base at Ream, Cambodia, the Cambodian government has announced that the base will soon hold its grand opening - and will host a Japanese warship as its first foreign guest.\nReam Naval Base is a Cambodian Navy station that has been modernized and expanded over the past few years with Chinese assistance. Chinese PLA Navy warships berthed for months at a newly-constructed pier at Ream in early 2024, raising concerns of a permanent Chinese presence in the Gulf of Thailand.\nAlthough Cambodia has long insisted that the base will be open to many foreign navies, it was not used to host the littoral combat ship USS Savannah in December 2024, nor was it used to welcome the Japanese destroyers Shimakaze and Suzunami when they arrived at Sihanoukville in February 2024.\nThe base will formally open on April 2 with a visit by Cambodia's ruler Hun Manet, son of Hun Sen, who ruled the country for more than 30 years and still controls the nation's senate. The Japan Maritime Self Defense Force's next call in Cambodia will be hosted at Ream, Cambodian armed forces spokesman Maj. Gen. Thong Solimo said this week.\n\"This would appear to be a conscious demonstration by Cambodia, that Ream is not exclusively for [China],\" ASPI's Euan Graham told AP.\nIn an earlier era, the U.S. Navy used to hold exercises with the Cambodian Navy at Ream Naval Base, and the U.S. and its allies invested in building small-scale infrastructure for the base. That changed rapidly after China began growing its economic and military ties to Cambodia. In 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported on an agreement between Cambodia and China to grant the PLA Navy a 30-year lease on Ream Naval Base, in exchange for assistance in expanding the facility. Beginning in 2022, China invested heavily in base construction and installed military-grade infrastructure beyond Cambodia's ability to construct on its own, like a carrier-sized finger pier and a large new drydock. Space-based surveillance companyBlackSkyhas noted that the pier is identical to the PLA Navy's new finger pier in Djibouti.\nThe U.S. Navy has not called at Ream since Chinese construction began, but earlier this month, Cambodian officials said that U.S.  warships would also be able to call at the base in the future."

        "content": "The U.S. Military Sealift Command has marked a key milestone nearly a decade after it started the program to introduce a new class of fleet replenishment oilers, now known as the John Lewis class. Construction was authorized in 2016 and began in 2018 on the first ship of the class, and now she has been officially introduced to the Third Fleet.\nThe 746-foot vessel, USNSJohn Lewis(T-AO 205) completed her final task in the certification by refueling the U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer USSMustinoff the coast of Southern California Saturday. It was certified on March 10, 2025, and with Saturday’s mission, the first fleet tasking, the ship becomes fleet operational. Certified “Ready for Tasking,”John Lewiswill depart on its first deployment later this year.\n“Having USNSJohn Lewiscertified for tasking, providing support to Third Fleet, gives the United States another asset to provide logistics services in a timely, safe and professional manner that MSC is known for throughout the Navy and throughout the world,” said Nikki Phelps, MSCPAC’s deputy operations officer. “This is a very positive step in the life of this ship and its fellow ships in the class.”\nChristened at the General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard in San Diego, California on July 17, 2021,Lewiscompleted sea trials in July 2022 and was moved to MSC operating in the Military Sealift Command Pacific area of operations as an MSC tasked ship.\nThe ship has already had a moment of distinction during her commissioning phase. In December 2022 transiting from Hawaii to California, she answered a distress call from a stranded sailor. She rescued the individual who had been drifting at sea in a small sailboat with a torn sail.\n\n\nJohn Lewis at sea during her builder's trials in 2022 (General Dynamics NASSCO)\n\nJohn Lewis, named for a famous leader in the U.S. civil rights movement and later a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1987 to 2020, is the first ship of the class. She and a sister ship,Harvey Milk, are the first two to become active, while a total of 17 vessels are currently under construction or on order. The Lewis-class oilers will replace the current Kaiser Class fleet replenishment oilers as they age out of the MSC fleet.\nThis class of oilers can carry 162,000 barrels of diesel ship fuel, aviation fuel, and dry stores cargo. The upgraded oiler is built with double hulls to protect against oil spills and strengthened cargo and ballast tanks."

        "content": "As the maritime sector works toward meeting IMO decarbonization targets, shipowners are searching for solutions to extend the service lives of their existing vessels. A new partnership between the innovation arm of Lomar Shipping, lomarlabs, is launching a partnership with a startup called Newlight to develop hydrogen retrofits to solve the challenge.\n“Hydrogen has enormous potential as a maritime fuel, but transitioning entire fleets to pure hydrogen is a long-term challenge,” said Haran Cohen Hillel, CEO of Newlight. “By taking immediate steps with the current fleet, we can decarbonize ship by ship—delivering real impact today.”\nNewlight reports it has developed a dual-fuel retrofit technology that will be a low Capex solution that enables existing vessels to integrate hydrogen as a fuel source. According to the company it on average should reduce fuel consumption by 20 percent.\nBy retrofitting existing diesel engines to operate on a hydrogen blend, the companies believe it can provide an immediate, scalable solution that cuts emissions without requiring a complete overhaul of the propulsion systems.\nLomarlabs announced a strategic collaboration that will make it possible to test the concepts using a vessel within the Lomar Shipping fleet. It reports that savings of up to 30 percent were demonstrated in workshop trials and through the collaboration will seek to replicate the results onboard vessels.\n“Decarbonization isn’t about waiting for the perfect fuel; it’s about acting now with every viable tool at our disposal,” said Stylianos Papageorgiou, Managing director of lomarlabs. Newlight’s dual-fuel retrofit technology promises an immediate, scalable, and cost-effective way to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. This is exactly the kind of practical innovation that will bridge the gap between today’s operational realities and the long-term vision of a net-zero maritime industry.“\nThe collaboration will focus on retrofitting conventional diesel engines to operate on a hydrogen-diesel mix. Lomarlabs and Newlight report they will conduct a pilot installation scheduled for summer 2025 on board a Lomar vessel to collect data and carry out harbor and sea trials.\nThis is one of several projects that lomarlabs has in its portfolio. Others include an effort to capture CO2 emissions from a vessel’s funnel or another technology to convert it to natural sea salts. It is also supporting a technology to reduce methane from the atmosphere and to develop autonomous magnetic crawler robots for hull cleaning. It is also involved in AI for autonomous navigation and the CargoKite, a concept to transport goods on autonomous ships propelled by a high-altitude wind kite system."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Lloyd's Register (LR) has updated its 2023 study on clean-fuel engine retrofits to account for changes in the green energy market. The low availability of e-fuels will delay the expected timeline for methanol-fueled engine adoption, according to LR, and more vessels will have to retrofit later if the fleet is to meet IMO emissions goals.\n\"A key assumption of the [previous] modeling was that all vessels built beyond 2027-2030 would be capable of using zero- and near-zero emissions fuels. Without further effective drivers to take up these fuels or visibility on alternative fuel availability, that date could be pushed back – meaning that more vessels need to be retrofitted in a shorter timeframe, exacerbating strains on retrofitting capacity,\" the class society said in an update.\nSo far, only Europe has enacted regulations that could motivate shipowners to make the costly switch to zero-emissions fuels, and carbon-tax discussions at IMO are still ongoing (with changing U.S. government views on climate change a wild card). Until IMO's deliberations are completed, shipowners will have difficulty picking the right investments to meet future targets. For now, owners are favoring conventional bunker-fueled propulsion or dual-fuel LNG engines, and orders for green fuel-capable vessels have taken a back seat, LR reported.\n\"Over 2024, increasing numbers of shipowners turned to LNG to reduce exposure to carbon pricing. More than 305 LNG-fueled ships were ordered, far outpacing growth in the methanol- and ammonia-fueled fleet. This included major shipowners, such as Maersk, that had previously touted progressive decarbonization plans based around methanol fuel,\" LR noted.\nMethanol conversions are just getting started but are expected to pick up over the next four years, primarily in the container segment. Methanol accounts for most of the planned conversions through 2029, but the numbers are small, in the single digits per year.\nIf the IMO adopts a regulatory structure to drive the uptake of zero-carbon fuels, as is expected, shipyard capacity for future alternative fuel retrofits might not be enough to meet the demand. LR has identified 16 yards that have the experience to carry out the work, and MAN has highlighted an additional 11. Taken altogether, these yards could handle about 465 conversions per year, less than the 1,000 per year that LR expects at the peak of demand.\n\"In 2025, there will be many more conversions based on existing orders, offering vital experience for the fledgling market. Whether the growth in order numbers themselves will accelerate will depend largely on the signals that both alternative fuel producers and shipowners receive from regulators,\" LR concluded."

        "content": "\nUnions representing more than 500 workers at the Osborne Naval Shipyard in Adelaide, Australia began an industrial action as contract negotiations over wages stretched into an eighth month with no resolution in sight. The walkout comes at a critical time as the BAE Systems’ yard is preparing to move into full production of Australia’s new Hunter Class frigates as well as other major projects scheduled for 2025.\nThe Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union (AMWU) reports that over 400 of its members walked out to demonstrate their frustration on Monday, March 17 during an all-hands meeting hosted by BAE Systems Maritime Australia Acting Manager Director Paul Berryman. They were joined by around 100 workers from the Australian Workers’ Union (AWU) and the Electrical Trades Union (ETU).\nA BAE spokesperson confirmed to the local media in Australia that the company is “negotiating an Enterprise Agreement that seeks to ensure improvements to wages and longer-term job security for our employees.”\nThe blue-collar workers at the shipyard have been undertaking stoppages during the last month. Negotiations for wage increases and other issues reportedly started in July 2024. AMWU says it is seeking a 30 percent wage increase on average over three years to “keep them in line with industry rates.” It reports that BAE Systems Australia is currently offering workers a 12 percent wage increase over three years.\n“Workers at BAE are rightly angry that they are paid on average 20 percent less than other workers with the same skills in the same industry,” said AMWU SA Acting State Secretary Stuart Gordon.\nThe dispute comes at a critical time for the shipyard which is currently staffing up as it prepares to move from test modules to the full construction of the first of three Hunter Class frigates and a total of six in the program. In 2018, the Australian Government selected BAE Systems to deliver the Hunter program for the Royal Australian Navy.\nThe shipyard recently highlighted that it had added 47 apprentices joining the Hunter Class Frigate Program at the Osborne Naval Shipyard in Adelaide. It said it was part of its largest-ever intake of apprentices in the state.\n“The future of the industry is built on attracting and retaining our skills and experience,” said Gordon. “We are the highly skilled tradespeople who are building the next generation of ships for the Australia Defence Force.”\nIn addition to the Hunter program, the union highlights the yard will also commence maintenance and upgrades mid-year on the Hobart-Class destroyers as part of the Defence Capability Enhancement Program. The workforce will also conduct work on Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs).\nBAE reports that it will continue to ramp up recruitment for the Hunter program with 400 new trades roles to be offered in 2025. Further, it says an additional 600 new roles will be offered across its maritime operations at Osborne.\nThe company reports it is continuing to negotiate in good faith. It said it would seek to hold the all-hands meeting in an effort to resolve the dispute."

No longer classified as a “major incident,” the focus is on salvage while concern continues to rise about the pollution being discovered along the shoreline.\nAfter more than a week, HM Coastguard reports the fires on board theSolonghave been extinguished. Salvors are now accessing all parts of the vessel, which remains held in position on a tow line. Salvage teams had already been able to inspect theStena Immaculate, which remains at anchor.\n\"Aerial surveillance flights continue to monitor both vessels and the retrieval operation,” said Chief Coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan. The organization is urging individuals to report sightings of debris while saying, “HM Coastguard will however continue to support the salvage and multiagency retrieval operations while keeping the overall situation under review.”\nWildlife organizations however are raising concerns saying it is a race against time to stop the spreading pollution from the incident. The first sighting of what has now been determined to be nurdles (plastic pellets) was reported on Sunday, March 16, and now according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and others they have been found “washing up along miles and miles of the Norfolk coast, including on our nature reserve.”\nSaying it is “deeply concerned,” the charity reports that the plastic pollution is currently mostly on the tidelines, but it fears it will spread inland. It highlights the nurdles, pellets the size of lentils, pose a significant risk to seabirds, which can mistake them for food. Further, over time they break down into microplastics.\n\n\nAmong the debris are large clumps of charred nurdles (RSPB photo)\n\nIt reports that many of the pellets are loose but some were clumped together in larger debris as a result of the fires. These larger masses are washing ashore with the teams reporting they are charred and smelling of kerosene.\n“We are also concerned about where more plastic debris may make landfall if it is not collected at sea,” said a spokesperson for RSPB. “Current modelling predicts it may end up at the RSPB nature reserve at Freiston Shore on the western side of The Wash, and at Holbeach. We are monitoring the situation closely and working with the authorities to help track the location of plastic debris.”\nThe owners of the vessel, Ernst Russ, said through a spokesperson that while there were nurdles aboard theSolongit does not believe any containers were lost overboard. It suggested that during the intense fires, some of the packaging might have opened and spilled some of its contents. It says it is “working proactively to mitigate any long-term impact on the marine environment” while liaising with the coastguard."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe consortium of Danish companies set up to develop the next-generation patrol ships for the Danish Armed Forces reports it is being taken over by Semco Maritime as it stands ready to meet the challenges to redesign and build the new ships. The group was selected in 2023 for the project but the government has recently decided to shift the focus to new ships better suited for the Arctic.\n\"The situation has changed in several areas since the decision to design new patrol ships was made in 2021,” said Minister of Defense Troels Lund Poulsen. At the end of January, he said, “We are in a significantly changed security policy situation, and the Danish Armed Forces are demanding a replacement for the aging Thetis class. The contracting parties have therefore agreed to reorient the existing patrol ship project to focus on the Arctic ships.\"\nThe Danish patrol ships were originally designed to operate in the Baltic Sea and Danish waters. According to the minister, the mission changed after Sweden and Finland joined NATO. He said there would be more countries and assets available for the security patrols in the Baltic.\nWhile the Baltic remains a Danish focus, the Defense Command has also expressed a desire for an early replacement of the current Arctic ships, the existing Thetis class. Commissioned in 1991, they are four 3,500-ton displacement patrol ships deployed by the Royal Danish Navy. The goal was shifted to design modern ships that will be more efficient and require less maintenance as replacements for the aging Thetis class. The new ships will strengthen Denmark’s support of Greenland as well as its operational capacity in the Arctic and the North Atlantic.\nPoulsen said in January, \"The work so far has by no means been wasted. A reorientation makes it possible to get started more quickly with the design work on the Arctic ships. It is expected that sub-elements from the design work of the patrol ships and experiences from the work with a Danish construction strategy can be reused.\"\nThe partnership then known as Danske Patruljeskibe (Danish Patrol Ships) received a contract for the front-end engineering and design activity for a new class of flexible patrol ships in June 2023. It consists of Denmark's largest defense company Terma, Odense Maritime Technology, a world leader in the design of military ships with ongoing frigate projects in, among others, the UK, Poland, and Singapore, one of Denmark's largest pension funds and investors in infrastructure, PensionDanmark.\nSemco Maritime has entered into an agreement to take over ownership of the group now known as Danske Flådeskibe. The consortium says it is ready to undertake the entire task of delivering and servicing new Arctic patrol ships and future frigates for the Danish Armed Forces.\n“With Semco Maritime as part of Danske Flådeskibe, we can deliver the entire package to the Danish Armed Forces when it comes to both state-of-the-art frigates and Arctic ships – from design, equipment and launching to service of the finished ships,” said Hans Schneider, CEO of Danske Flådeskibe.\nSemco Maritime they note has existing facilities and good expansion opportunities at the Port of Esbjerg, which has a good strategic location and status as a NATO port after significant investments in the infrastructure. The group says it expects to deliver the first ship to the Danish Navy as early as 2029."

Based on images provided by the service, the unnamed vessel was an older OSV, not a tanker, indicating a small-scale smuggling operation. It appeared to be flying the colors of the Iranian flag; the master was Iranian, and the rest of the crew were Iraqi and Indian nationals.\nThe custody of the crew has been transferred to civilian authorities for further investigation, and the vessel has been towed to the naval base at Umm Qasr.\nCourtesy Iraqi Navy\nThe source of the fuel was not disclosed, but illicit smuggling networks siphon government-subsidized diesel and gasoline out of Iran in substantial quantities, paying pennies on the dollar domestically and receiving far higher black-market prices in neighboring countries. Most of this illegal trade crosses Iran's land borders, but a portion of the illicit exports leave Iran by ship - typically aboard aging coastal tankers and other small vessels ill-suited for large-scale foreign trade. Iran's security forces routinely intercept these vessels in and around the Strait of Hormuz, but rarely are the smuggling vessels arrested in a destination market like Iraq."

        "content": "\nAfter decades of development, the U.S. Navy has deployed its first mine countermeasures mission package aboard an Independence-class Littoral Combat Ship, fulfilling the vessel's capability to perform its designated role at last.\nThe MCM package consists of a Textron-designed unmanned surface vehicle, aluminum-hulled and unpainted like the Independence-class; the AN/AQS-20 towed sonar for minehunting, installed on the USV; a helicopter-mounted mine detection system; and a minesweeping package installed on the USV. In service, it will replace the Navy's MH-53 mine countermeasures helicopter platform and the aging Avenger-class minehunting vessels.\nDesign of the Independence-class formally began in 2004, and the mission packages were designed in parallel. Initially, the minehunting package centered on Lockheed Martin's Remote Multi Mission Vehicle, an unmanned semisubmersible that the Navy bought in low-rate production to use for sonar towing. The Navy struggled to keep the RMMV in service at sea for more than 75 hours between failures, and it was ultimately replaced with a Textron USV design. This required the development team to start over in testing USV-sonar integration. The General Dynamics Knifefish unmanned submersible was also part of the initial package for neutralizing buried mines, but was canceled in 2021.\nThe revised MCM package achieved initial operational capability (IOC) in March 2023, nine years behind schedule, and the first unit was embarked aboard USS Canberra in April 2024. Installation involves craning the USV and containerized support equipment into the starboard side loading hatch, then maneuvering it around the mission bay with a compact, special-purpose straddle carrier.\nAfter a year of further experience with the package, USS Canberra and USS Santa Barbara have now deployed from San Diego on a mission to replace existing minehunting assets in Japan and the Mideast, according to USNI. One more vessel is expected to deploy this year.\nWork on the package is not yet done. In February, the Navy awarded Bollinger an advance order for $8 million to procure \"items needed to improve the MCM USV based on findings from operational testing.\" Production is under way for the minehunting payload for the USV, as well as the minesweeping payload.\nThe twin LCS classes were initially intended to accept all mission packages and to be interoperable with each other. This concept proved impractical in service, and in 2016, the Navy assigned the mine countermeasures role to the Independence-class and the antisubmarine warfare role to the Freedom-class. The ASW sonar suite failed to develop, in part because of interference from high noise levels from the Freedom-class' machinery, and the ASW package was canceled in 2022.\nThe Navy has downsized the Freedom-class, as the vessels cannot perform the ASW mission without an ASW sonar suite. Under then-Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday, the Navy sought to decommission the first nine Freedom hulls - one just five years old. Five Freedom-class vessels have been removed from service to date, along with the first four Independence-class hulls."

With the new orders from the beginning of the year, we are fully utilized until 2028,\" says Stephan Schmees, CEO of Neptun Werft.\nAt the end of 2023, Viking expanded its cruise ship orders with Neptun Werft for a total of nine river cruise ships, one additional for the Seine plus eight of the Longship series. The larger vessels are 135 meters (443 feet) long and accommodate 190 passengers.\nOne ship from the Seine series and four of the Longships will be delivered in 2025 and another set in 2026. Viking also added another eight ships to the order in January 2025. Those are scheduled for delivery in 2027 and 2028.\nNeptun Werft had previously built four river cruise ships,Viking Kari,Viking Radgrid,Viking Skaga, andViking Fjorgyn, in the Seine class. All the newer ships are being equipped with a hybrid system consisting of a diesel-electric drive, a battery system, and exhaust gas after-treatment. This will absorb peak loads and save a considerable amount of fuel. The ships will also be equipped with a number of technical innovations, such as a compact system for wastewater treatment as well as connections for shore power. Onboard, they have solar panels to further contribute to the ships’ energy efficiency.\nFounded in 1997 by Torstein Hagen, Viking is one of the pioneers in the modern river cruise industry.  It operates river cruises in Europe, Asia, and Egypt and has one ship on the Mississippi in the United States."

        "content": "\nFrance's Bolloré Group has been dogged by allegations of corruption in its African ports division for more than a decade, and even the unit's sale in 2022 has not stopped the controversy. A collective of 11 NGOs from West Africa have filed a complaint with the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office, demanding that Bolloré pay restitution for alleged corrupt practices that secured allegedly noncompetitive concession terms for the company's port operations.\nBolloré Africa Logistics - now known as AGL - got its start in the 1920s and grew into a ports empire across West and Central Africa. Bolloré Group sold the division to MSC for $6 billion in late 2022, and MSC retained the unit's separate identity and kept its longtime president at the helm. At the time of the sale, Bolloré had built up a presence in 47 countries with 16 container terminals, seven ro/ro terminals and two wood terminals, and it had 21,000 employees across the continent.\nAlong the way, Bolloré Group racked up complaints for allegedly corrupt dealings in West Africa. In 2018, French authorities put then-president Vincent Bolloré under investigation for allegedly using his media empire to help the election campaigns of leaders of Guinea and Togo, providing them with advertising at below-market rates in 2010. These politicians later granted lucrative container terminal concessions to Bolloré Logistics at Conakry, Guinea and Lome, Togo, respectively. Bolloré Group settled the matter with French authorities in a 2021 plea agreement and paid a fine.\nOn Wednesday, a coalition of African NGOs from Togo, Guinea, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Cameroon accused Vincent Bolloré, his son Cyrille Bolloré, and Bolloré Group of securing the right to operate ports in the region illegally, then later profiting from these arrangements by selling the business to MSC. The accusations relate to the Togo and Guinea cases, but also to activities at Tema, Ghana; Abidjan, Ivory Coast; and Douala and Kribi, Cameroon. The coalition - “Restitution for Africa” (RAF) - accused Bolloré of money laundering and fraud, and called for a full criminal prosecution.\n\"The continued ownership and operation of these assets until 2022 constitutes the offense of receiving stolen goods, which punishes the possession, use, or profit derived from fraudulent property,\" RAF argued in its complaint.\nRAF hopes to leverage a recently-enacted French law that allows the assets recovered from foreign corruption investigations to be returned to the countries affected, for use in economic development projects."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. State Department and Treasury working concurrently launched the next round of sanctions targeting Iran’s oil trade. In addition to listing additional tankers and their operators, the U.S. made its first designation of a so-called “teapot refinery” in China as well as the operator of a Chinese oil terminal for buying and storing Iranian crude oil from sanctioned vessels.\n“Teapot” refiners according to the U.S. Department of State are private Chinese refineries that are the primary purchasers of Iranian oil.  It noted that China is by far the largest importer of Iranian oil saying that these sanctions are “being imposed pursuant to President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign to drive Iran’s oil exports, including to China, to zero.”\nThe U.S. asserted that Shandong Shouguang Luqing Petrochemical Co. in Shandong Province, China was identified in mid-2022 as a buyer of Iranian oil associated with the Iranian military and Iranian military forces.\nIt reports that Luqing Petrochemical has purchased millions of barrels of Iranian oil worth approximately half a billion dollars. The oil was transported by shadow fleet vessels, some of which have been sanctioned for their role in transporting Iranian petroleum linked to the Houthis. It specifically identified the tankers Mehle (Panama flag) and Kohana (renamed Limas and sailing under the flag of Guyana) which were sanctioned by the Biden administration in January 2024 as transporting oil to the refinery.\nThe U.S. Department of State today also designated Huaying Huizhou Daya Bay Petrochemical Terminal Storage, an oil terminal in China. It is reported to be buying and storing Iranian crude oil from a sanctioned vessel.\nThe tanker listing was expanded with eight more vessels that the U.S. reports are transporting Iranian oil to teapot refineries and usually engaging in deceptive shipping practices, including automatic identification system (AIS) manipulation. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioning the vessels Natalina 7 (Comoros-flagged), Catalina 7, Aurora Riley and Viola (each Panama-flagged), Montrose (San Marino-flagged), Volans and Brava Lake (each Barbados-flagged), and Titan (currently unflagged).\nThe U.S. is linking some of the oil transactions to supplying funds to the Houthi militants in Yemen that are backed by Iran. Other transactions are reported to have funded the Iranian Ministry of Defense of Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL).\nOFAC in total imposed sanctions on 19 entities and vessels. It also included shipping companies and operators incorporated in Hong Kong, Liberia, China, the Seychelles, Panama, and the British Virgin Islands.\nTrump issued a National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 on February 4 ordering a campaign of maximum pressure on Iran. Since then, the State Department has announced sanctions on networks funding Iran, oil traders, tankers, and Iran’s recently appointed Oil Minister. Over the weekend, Trump also launched a new bombing campaign against the Houthis citing their 2024 attacks against merchant shipping."

        "content": "CMA CGM Group, which launched a niche air cargo operation in 2021, has made a last-minute rival bid to take over the troubled carrier Air Belgium. It comes as the French group has said it plans to continue to grow in the air cargo segment including expanding with a base in the United States.\nAir Belgium was founded in 2016 and started operations offering long-haul passenger flights and cargo operations in March 2018. It was struggling to establish its operations when the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the industry and forced it to ground its operations and convert passenger planes into cargo aircraft for medical transport. Citing the impact of COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, soaring fuel prices, inflation, and falling consumer purchasing power, the company ceased its passenger operation in September 2023 to focus on air cargo and leasing for passenger and cargo flights.\nThe company currently has two Airbus A330-200 and two Boeing 747-8F planes in operation highlighting the enhanced payload capacity and a variety of options provided by the fleet. The company however was placed under judicial supervision in September 2023 and moved a year later into judicial liquidation.\nA group called Air One Belgium, a joint venture of the UK’s Air One International and the Dutch company Peso Aviation Management, made a bid for the company which was accepted in December 2024. The deal has failed to close which last week led the Belgian authorities to revoke the acquisition permission and declared the deal had failed. The court gave Air Belgium till March 27 to find an alternate investor or face liquidation.\nCMA CGM was familiar with Air Belgium having started its cargo operation in 2021 working with the Belgium company. CMA CGM obtained its operating certificate in 2022 and launched its own fleet. CMA CGM currently operates four cargo planes, including three Boeing 777Fs and an Airbus A330F with orders for two more 777s and eight Airbus A350Fs due in late 2027 and beyond. Last week as part of a $20 billion investment plan for the U.S., CMA CGM said it would also establish a new air cargo hub in Chicago, and deploy five new Boeing 777 freighters, operated by American pilots.\nAir One Belgium announced that it was appealing the court decision as it wanted to proceed with its acquisition of the troubled Belgian carrier. Today, Air Belgium confirmed that CMA CGM has entered a competing proposal for the cargo operations.\nBelgium’s Walloon Brabant Business Court will review the bids. A hearing is scheduled for March 27."

        "content": "\nIn a public briefing Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) should have performed a standard engineering risk analysis on the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in March 2024 afterit was hitby the boxshipDali. The MDTA was on thenational panelthat came up with updated ship strike engineering standards in 1991, and it had three decades of well-informed advance notice to evaluate the Key Bridge, according to NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy.\nMDTA couldn't even provide the underlying data to perform the analysis when NTSB asked, so NTSB worked with the National Highway Administration to gather the needed information and do the engineering work itself. NTSB's analysis found that the Francis Scott Key Bridge's risk of collapse from a ship strike was 30 times higher than recommended by existing federal guidance, and 15 times higher at the pier that the boxshipDalihit on March 26, 2024.\n\"We were very surprised that they were so high, almost 30 times greater than the threshold thatAASHTOsets, and 15 times for pier 17 and pier 18. That was a surprise to all of us. But you know, it's something that MDTA could have known and should have known,\" Homendy said.\nIf MDTA had carried out the risk analysis anytime after 1991, the year that MDTA helped create the national standard, the state agency would have concluded that the bridge needed protection from a ship strike, Homendy said - and it could have prevented the collapse by making infrastructure improvements.\n\"There's no excuse,\" said Homendy.\n\nShe noted that as of late 2024, MDTA has still not performed the same risk analysis on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, which was designed in the same era as the Francis Scott Key Bridge and experiences the same ship traffic, but at higher vessel speeds.\nNTSB has issued an urgent recommendation to 30 bridge owners around the country to perform the standard ship strike risk analysis on 68 bridge spans, including both spans of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.\n\"We are saying there is a safety deficiency here, a potential safety risk, and you need to take immediate action,\" said Homendy. \"It shouldn't take an urgent safety recommendation to get action, and we expect that to be done now, and we'll follow up.\"\nMaryland's transport agency had decades of advance notice. In addition to the 1991 AASHTO recommendation, which MDTA helped draft, a senior Maryland pilot raised concerns about the risk of an allision between a big ship and the Francis Scott Key Bridge at least as early as 2006 - and continued to discuss the matter in local safety meetings for years, according to detailed records uncovered by the Washington Post.\nThe documents also show that at the staff level, the Maryland Transportation Authority was aware that their bridge was \"not designed to withstand collisions from large vessels,\" and that the cost of protecting it would be high.\nIn neighboring Delaware, a state agency has shown that safety upgrades are possible - and costly. Ten years ago, in 2015, Delaware's bridge transport authority set aside $2.5 million to design new protective dolphins for the Delaware Memorial Bridge to defend against ship strikes. The agency bundled the dolphin project into a large package of renovations, secured a permit from the Corps of Engineers, raised tolls on motorists, convinced two state governors to sign off on the cost, and issued bonds to raise funds. Construction started on theeight protective steel-and-rock dolphinslast year, and should be done by the end of 2025.\nNTSB will release its final report later this year, including the findings of its maritime investigative team on the factors aboard theDali."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told media on Thursday to expect \"some shuttle diplomacy\" as the Trump administration attempts to negotiate a maritime ceasefire deal.\nYuri Ushakov, aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said that the talks would include a discussion of the safety of shipping in the Black Sea. A conversation about sponsoring a safe navigation corridor began during Tuesday's phone call between Putin and Trump, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n\"There're a lot of nuances there, which need to be discussed. Hence, [negotiations would be necessary] to discuss these nuances, among other things,\" Peskov told Interfax.\nRussian attacks on merchant vessels in Odesa have recently resumed after a long lull; despite Ukraine's success in deterring the Russian Black Sea Fleet with drone and missile strikes, the Odesa port complex remains in range of Russian ballistic missile attacks.\nThe most recent strike occurred last week, and reportedlyclaimedthe lives of four seafarers aboard a Greek-managed bulker loading grain at Odesa. Three of the dead were foreign nationals. Two other individuals were injured, including one seafarer and one port employee.\nA Black Sea ceasefire has been attempted before. InJuly 2022, Russia, Ukraine and Turkey negotiated a \"Black Sea Grain Initiative\" that would pause Russian strikes on Ukrainian bulk food shipping, so long as all parties could inspect all Ukraine-bound ships. Russia repeatedly threatened to abandon the deal, and Russian officials slowed the inspection process to a near-halt, according to the unified command responsible for implementation. InJuly 2023the Kremlin walked away from the arrangement, blaming the West for banking sanctions that allegedly made it hard to export Russian fertilizer. Ukraine implemented its own safe navigation corridor by force, sinking ordamagingmore than a dozen Russian warships and driving the remainder to the safety of the sea's northeastern corner."

        "content": "Hapag-Lloyd reporting what it called “solid results” for 2024, outlined what it sees as another challenging year ahead. It became the latest of the major carriers to highlight the uncertainties and predict that the industry would continue to experience declines in profitability in the year ahead.\n“We anticipate earnings in 2025 to be lower than in 2024,” CEO Rolf Habben Jansen told investors. “The economic and geopolitical environment remains fragile.” He highlighted a long list of challenges to the industry including an expectation that the outlook for U.S. economic growth is now reduced. Hapag was the first of the major carriers to discuss its outlook after Trump’s tariffs and trade war began.\nOutlining the results for 2024, Jansen said they had been confronted with “a challenging market environment.” Container volumes however were up 4.7 percent to 12.5 million TEU while he said that freight rates overall remained stable for the year. As a result, Hapag reported revenues increased to just over $20 billion.\nThe carrier said that earnings increased slightly on an EBITDA basis to $5 billion, but the bottom line profitability was down versus 2024 to $2.6 billion. It sighted lower interest income, higher tax expenses, and higher transportation costs as it rerouted ships around the Cape of Good Hope. While the company remained strongly profitable, the board however is proposing a greater than 11 percent cut in its annual dividend reflecting the lower profitability.\nHapag’s results were largely in keeping with the other major carriers. Analysts at Sea-Intelligence yesterday forecast the sector would have total profitability on an EBIT basis of around $60 billion in 2024. That represents a significant decline from the peak of nearly $200 billion each in 2021 and 2022 according to the report.\n“The 2024 level of profitability is still significantly higher than the pre-Covid years,” noted Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence. “In fact, the EBIT recorded in 2024-FY is higher than the combined EBIT of 2019, 2020, and 2023.”\nHapag pointed to its efforts to consolidate and expand its terminal business in 2024 and its efforts to further improve processes which it said would yield results in the future. While saying it would keep “a very close eye” on unit costs while focusing on increasing efficiency, Jansen pointed to the implementation of the Gemini network with Maersk and continued efforts to develop its terminal business in 2025.\nNoting the “considerable uncertainty,” Hapag forecasted that earnings on an EBITDA basis would decline to a range between $2.5 to $4.0 billion. On an EBIT basis, Hapag predicts it will be between breakeven and $1.5 billion in 2025\nDespite the forecasts for 2025, Hapag continues to have a longer-term positive outlook. Jansen highlighted that it has 24 new ships ordered and financed to be built in China. He noted it was the largest newbuilding program in the history of the company. With approximately 300 containerships and a capacity of 3.7 million TEU, Hapag-Lloyd also is operating the largest fleet in the history of the company."

The Coast Guard estimated the U.S. wholesale value at about $520 million, and at EU wholesale prices it would be worth more than $700 million.\n\"You heard it said before that the Coast Guard's national security cutters are game changers in the counter-drug mission, but they still require a crew of men and women willing to service on or over the sea, and place themselves in harm's way,\" said Capt.

(Coast Guard HITRON crews compel suspect vessels to stop by firing warning shots when authorized, or by shooting out the vessels' engines with a .50-caliber rifle, below.)

Cocaine is sometimes cut with fentanyl before sale to the end user; a 2023studyled by a public health researcher at the University of Nevada found that about 15 percent of powder cocaine samples in the U.S. contained fentanyl.\nThemajorityof South America's cocaine exports are shipped to Europe, where demand is stronger and the drug commands higher prices. As a result of this price signal, a substantial share of the volume that passes through the Eastern Pacific and Central American corridor ends up in European markets, via container ports like Colon and Puerto Moin. The largest cocaine shipment ever caught in the United States - the seizure of 20 tonnes aboard MSCGayaneat Port of Philadelphia in 2019 - wasorchestratedby a European gang, and was intended for final delivery on European shores."

        "author": "Kay Brown",
        "content": "\nNearly three years after an enclosed space incident that claimed the lives of three stevedores, the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch issued a detailed report while calling for enhanced training and safety rules incorporating shoreside personnel into the efforts for enclosed space management. The recommendations take the unusual step of calling on the trade organizations to become involved in developing a minimum operational safety standard for stevedores conducting cargo operations aboard member vessels.\nDespite international and industry guidance on the training stevedores should receive before working on bulk carriers, MAIB highlights InterManager data that shows of the 257 enclosed space fatalities reported between 1999 and 2023, 67 (26 percent) of which were stevedores or shore workers. It concludes after investigating the 2022 incident that training and drills for emergency scenarios need to include the possible presence of shoreside staff.\nThe report details an incident in June 2022 aboard the Berge Bulk dry bulk carrierBerge Mawson(181,000 dwt) built in 2015. The vessel was in the Bunyu Island anchorage in Indonesia loading coal from barges using a floating crane. Stevedores were leveling the coal in hatch no. 7 using a bulldozer but the operation was paused and all the hatches were closed due to heavy rain.\nOnce the rain stopped, MAIB believes one of the stevedores made several attempts to gain access to the bulldozer. It concludes that unsupervised the worker descended into the cargo hold no. 8 access space where he collapsed. While theBerge Mawson’s crew was getting its rescue equipment, two other stevedores attempted to rescue their colleague and they two collapsed.\n“It is evident that the stevedores did not have a sufficient understanding of the hazards posed by coal cargos,” says Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents Andrew Moll. He also highlights that the shore personnel did not have training about the dangers associated with entering enclosed spaces and the crew aboard the ship did not prevent their access.\nMAIB concludes that the oxygen was depleted in the area creating a noxious atmosphere. As a result, all three men died.\nIt lists a series of failures saying that the atmosphere was not routinely tested before stevedores entered a compartment. The stevedores were not adequately supervised and had not been trained on the dangers of enclosed spaces. Further, they were unable to understand the safety labels and warnings posted on the ship.\nWhile it finds that the crew aboard the ship was trained, they were not trained for consideration of shoreside personnel working aboard the vessel and their safety drills did not involve scenarios with shore workers. As they rushed to get the safety equipment, the ship’s crew did not block or guard entry into the space.\n“To help prevent further loss of life it is essential that bulk carrier and terminal operating procedures, practices, and training equip shore workers to operate safely on board the vessels,” writes MAIB.\nThe report recommends reviewing and revising the Code of Safe Working Practices maintained by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. In addition to also making safety training recommendations to both the terminal operator and the shipping line, it is calling on Intercargo, InterManger, and RightShip to develop a minimum operating safety standard for stevedores conducting cargo operations on board their member’s vessels. It also says the trade groups should encourage members to introduce minimum operational safety standards for stevedores."

The German news outlet Der Spiegel reports the government will confiscate the shadow tanker and its cargo rather than let it go.\nThe customs authorities started the legal confiscation on March 14 reports Der Spiegel after the government and various ministries had discussed how to handle the laden tanker. According to the report, the government decided on the action as a demonstration to Russia and the shadow fleet after the European Union sanctioned the vessel in February 2025 for violations of the G7 price cap on Russian oil.\nThe tankerEventin(152,000 dwt) is loaded with approximately 100,000 tons of crude oil valued at over $43 million. Der Spiegel says the authorities are now planning how and where to offload the oil and what should happen to the vessel.\nEventindrew international attention in January when German response authorities deployed multiple tugs torescue the stranded vessel. It was said to have lost power and navigation and to have been drifting in the Baltic off the coast of Ruegen, Germany. The vessel was brought to an anchorage and that’s where the story began to unravel.\nBuilt in 2006, it became clear that the tanker registered in Panama was part of the shadow fleet servicing the Russian oil trade. It had loaded in Ust-Luga departing on January 7 with a declared destination of the Suez Canal. Three days later the vessel was drifting in the Baltic.\nA review of its documentation showed it has been owned by the mysterious Laliya Shipping since May 2024 with no known address. The vessel was being managed out of Dubai. Reports link the tanker to Fractal Marine DMCC, the Dubai-based tanker firm also involved in the Russian trade.\nWithin days, the captain of the vessel reportedly filed for permission to depart Germany after the Federal Ministry of Transport was informed the engine had been repaired. The ministry however said that it wasdetaining the tankerand inspecting the vessel’s documentation. It also sent a sample of the oil for testing.\nRussian officials told Reuters today that they have no knowledge of the vessel and its ownership. Der Spiegel reports that the state government in Germany is anxious to be rid of the ship and encouraging the federal government to act quickly."

        "content": "Officials in the UK and the Philippines confirmed that the crewmembers of the containershipSolongand tankerStena Immaculatehave been repatriated as the investigation into the incident continues. HM Coastguard gave its last daily update this morning, March 20, while a government minister traveled to the area to thank the brave first responders and civilian crews that saved the seafarers as the vessels were engulfed in flames.\nUK Transport Minister Mike Kane visited Grimsby Docks meeting with personnel from HM Coastguard as well as the teams from offshore wind operator RWE and Windcat which provides the crew transfer services from the port. He praised the actions of the commercial crews and thanked everyone for their efforts which saved the crews.\n\"As the minister for aviation, maritime, and security, I wanted to come as soon as humanly possible after the initial response to the incident to come and thank everybody involved,\" said Kane.  He called the efforts \"an astonishingly brilliant operation.\"\nKane highlighted that Windcat, contracted by RWE to assist with the transport of its technicians to RWE's Humber Gateway offshore wind farm, was first on the scene. The Windcat crew transfer vessel had completed taking technicians out to the wind farm and was 12 minutes away when the Mayday calls were issued.\nTheSolongcrew was in a lifeboat when the Windcat vessel arrived, took them aboard, and brought them ashore. A second vessel repeated the same process rescuing the crew ofStena Immaculatewhich had also abandoned the tanker aboard its lifeboat.\nThe 36 individuals were triaged at Grimsby Dock. They were treated on scene and one person who had been injured declined further medical assistance. Kane reported that the crews have now been repatriated. The UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch reported that it was conducting interviews and gathering information as part of its investigation into the incident.\n\n\nPhilippines released a picture reporting eight crewmembers had returned (DMW)\n\nThe Philippines’ Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) reported today, March 20, that eight crewmembers from theSolonghad returned to the country on March 18. It said it was in contact to provide financial assistance and ensure that all the necessary government assistance and support would be provided. Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac previously said the DMW is also mulling taking legal action against the manning agency of the Filipino seafarers. He said they were also assisting the family of the seafarer who was lost during the incident.\nThe other crewmembers from theSolongwere reported to include Russian nationals. There was no indication where they are or how many Russians were working on the containership.\nUK prosecutors confirmed that the captain of theSolong, Vladimir Motin, 59 years old, of Primorsky, St Petersburg, Russia, was charged with Gross Negligence Manslaughter on March 14. He is being held in jail waiting for his next court appearance in April.\nU.S. operator Crowley has also issued a statement expressing its “heartfelt thank you” to the 23 mariners from theStena Immaculatefor their bravery and quick action during the allision. It said that their actions helped safeguard lives, the vessel, and the environment.\nSalvage teams have now been aboard both vessels to conduct surveys and plan the next steps. At the same time, UK officials highlighted that counter pollution retrieval operations remain ongoing. HM Coastguard said that aerial surveillance flights continue to monitor both vessels and the retrieval operation.\n"

        "content": "The indictment of two former employees of the Colombian Navy has revealed an elaborate plot by one of the country’s most notorious drug gangs to use GPS devices to evade capture by Colombian warships. The details of the effort showing the depths of the efforts by the drug gang are contained in a new indictment filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Florida.\nThe U.S. extradited two former employees of Colombia’s Armada Nacional to Florida to stand trial for a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The U.S. contends there is “reasonable cause to believe” the cocaine would have been illegally imported into the United States.\nAccording to the indictment and news reports in Colombia, Alberto Alvarez Valenzuela, age 54, worked for Armada Nacional as a civil electromechanical engineer at a base in Uraba, Colombia until he retired in 2022. Luis Carlos Diaz Martinez, age 32, worked for the Colombian Navy until 2012, according to the newspaper USA Today. Both individuals arrived in the U.S. on March 13 to stand trial while the court filing indicates that other former Navy officials were also involved in the scheme. A sergeant, ensign, and other low-ranking officers were named in the indictment.\nThe U.S. contends that in exchange for money from the drug traffickers, the individuals recruited active-duty members of the Colombian Navy to plant GPS tracking devices on the navy’s vessels. It says that the frigate ARC Antioquia and three patrol boats, ARC Punta Espalda, ARC 11 de Noviembre, and ARC Toledo, were tracked by the drug cartel between November 2022 and March 2023. The vessels were used for patrols and interdictions.\nBy tracking the movements of the vessels, the drug traffickers hoped to route their vessels around the patrols and avoid detection. The tracking was going on while the vessels were in the Caribbean, including spots near Panama, and approaching Cartagena, Colombia.\nThe U.S. highlights that drug runners from Colombia move more than 1,000 metric tons of cocaine via the Caribbean and Pacific, often on go-fast semisubmersibles. This latest case illustrates the lengths the drug cartels are going to in moving the drugs to the United States. Previous reports said the cartels have also bribed fishermen to act as spies and report the movement of naval vessels.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s office reports the two individuals extradited to the U.S. will be prosecuted as part of the Organized Drug Enforcement Task Forces Strike Force Initiative. If convicted, both defendants face a maximum penalty of life in federal prison."

        "content": "\nA handful of advanced nations have the capability to cut subsea cables in ultradeep water, but the technology is usually a closely-held state secret. In a research paper published late last month, a Chinese scientist detailed a unique submersible diamond saw that can be used for \"marine resource development\" purposes at extreme depth and pressure.\n\"Enhancing marine resource development capabilities, advancing the blue economy and building China into a maritime powerhouse constitute critical components of realizing the Chinese dream,\" explained researcher Hu Haolong of the China Ship Scientific Research Centre (CSSRC), writing in the peer-reviewed journal Mechanical Engineer.\nThe device in question is a robotic arm-mounted circular saw, designed to operate in water depths of up to 4,000 meters - a typical depth for the Pacific abyssal plain. Dozens of subsea cables crisscross the Pacific, linking data customers in Asia's thriving business hubs with markets in the West. These cables - and others just like them around the world - handle about 95 percent of all international data traffic, including phone calls, internet data and private network data.\nAt water depths greater than about 2,000 meters, the cable lay industry does not typically bury subsea data cables, and avoids the cost and hassle of trenching by simply placing the cables on the seabed instead. These fiber-optic lines are thin and unobtrusive, just 20-60 mm in diameter, but they are comparatively strong, capable of withstanding a strain of up to 20-70 tonnes before breaking.\nHu's robotic device is titanium-clad to withstand the extreme pressures of 4,000 meters of depth, which happens to be the same depth range where unprotected subsea cables are found. With a six-inch diamond blade, the saw can cut through steel-armored cables of up to 60mm in lab testing (image at top).\nCSSRC is one of the research arms of state-owned giant CSSC, the world's largest shipbuilding company and the builder of the PLA Navy's fleet. In addition to traditional areas of focus like hydrodynamics, CSSRC has research expertise in militarily useful areas of nautical science, including shock and explosion resistance and underwater vehicles."

        "content": "A shadowy group of cyber hackers is claiming that it launched a massive attack and has successfully disabled communications for much of Iran’s merchant fleet. While the report cannot be independently verified, the group which calls itself Lab Dookhtegan is known and according to experts is credible in its attacks.\nThe report is gaining wide media attention including in Iran. Neither government officials nor the shipping companies, the National Iranian Tanker Company or Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Company, have publicly commented or denied the claims.\nLab Dookhteganposted messages on Telegram and X boasting of its accomplishments saying it was to celebrate the sixth anniversary of its operation. “In an unprecedented move, we successfully disrupted the communication network of two Iranian companies that, among various terrorist activities, are responsible for supplying munitions to Houthis,” the group wrote while also reposting links to reports from the Iranian media.\nIt claimed to have also timed the attack to coordinate with the U.S.’s current offensive against the Houthis and in parallel to the U.S. and European sanctions against Iranian shipping. It asserts that the communications for 50 ships belonging to the National Iranian Tanker Company and 66 ships operated by the Iran Shipping Lines have been disabled. Lab Dookhtegan reports it will take weeks to fully restore communications.\n\n?? ??????? ?? ?????? ????? ?????? ?????? ??? ? ?????? ????? ???? ?? ?? ?????? ???? ???? ??????? ???? ???????? ??? ?????

(NITC) ?? ??? ???!???? ?????? ??? ????????? ? ?????? ??????? ????? ?? ????? ???? ?? ????????!https://t.co/uV7wND3wltLab…pic.twitter.com/3G1YrwCrk2\n\n“Ship personnel can no longer communicate with one another, and their connection to the ports and outside world has been severed,” the group said in its online statements.\nSpeculation is that the communications would also impact the vessels' coordination with the Iranian military and other authorities. The Iranian media speculates the vessels use encrypted networks to speak with the military but likely depend on satellite communications systems such as VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) technology. They said it would be impacting the ability to coordinate operations, transmit data, and navigate.\nThe speculation is that the vessels might be limited to traditional radio systems with VHF and HF frequencies used for short-range communications, such as ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore.\nCyber security analysts at Cydomepublished an analysisof Lab Dookhtegan noting while there was no evidence of this attack or its results it was based on the previous credibility of the group. They said while the group does not disclose its exact tactics, they believe the group uses a search engine device that could locate ship satellite terminals. They speculate the group could have remotely compromised the terminals using factory-set passwords, giving it the ability to alter system settings or even upload malicious firmware.\nFurthermore, they believe there would have been a high degree of automation and coordination required to deliver malware or malicious commands to 116 vessels simultaneously.  They speculate it may have involved prior reconnaissance and required advanced capabilities.\nBased on this attack, Cydome is recommending that all shipping companies perform a comprehensive risk assessment. They cite the need to install a dedicated maritime cybersecurity solution that is independent of the communications devices.\nIf this attack is proven legitimate, it would not be the first time Iranian shipping has reportedly fallen vulnerable to cyberattacks. In 2024, unconfirmed reports from NBC News said the American forces carried out a cyberattacktargeting an Iranian spy ship. The vessel was thought to be playing a role in the targeting of merchant ships for the Houthi militants in Yemen.\nTop photo from Iran's Tasnim News Agency --CC BY 4.0"

        "content": "\nThe Australian Border Force is looking for members of the public to foster puppies that may eventually serve as sniffer dogs for maritime and border enforcement.\nThe puppies, available beginning at nine weeks of age, need temporary homes where they can develop and have opportunities for socialization, which is crucial for their future careers. Foster homes provide environments where the young Labradors can interact with new people, animals and settings early in life, border officials say. Owners agree to bring the dogs to busy locations so that they can get used to being around crowds and social stimulation.\nUnder the arrangement, the Border Force assumes financial responsibility for the puppies, covering costs for food, equipment and veterinary care. The agency also offers accommodation for the animals when foster families travel or take vacations, as well as 24/7 support as required.\n\"The relationship between our foster carers and the ABF represents a meaningful community partnership,\" said Bjorn Roberts, a commander with the agency. \"These carers fulfill an essential function in preparing future detector dogs for service with our organization or partner agencies.\"\nImage courtesy ABF\nThe Detector Dog Program forms a significant component of Australia's border security system. The program only uses Labrador Retrievers because of their work ethic, stable temperament and adaptability to varied environments.\nOnce trained, the dogs work at seaports, mail centers and other facilities throughout Australia. They are trained to detect narcotics, tobacco, firearms, explosives and currency.\nPrevious pet ownership experience is not required for potential foster carers, and the agency provides continuous support, including a 24-hour assistance service. Foster families are expected to help with the puppies' development by bringing them to busy locations such as shopping centers, sporting venues and playgrounds."

A further $82.7 million is currently being spent on vessels that are still in service.\n“These are a planned series of upkeep periods in order to maintain ship condition and to introduce, where appropriate, capability updates,” said Eagle.\nDespite the massive resources committed to the life extension refits on the aging frigates, which were built for the Royal Navy in the 1980s, at least half of them are no longer in service. Of the 16 Type 23 frigates, only eight remain in the Royal Navy after three were sold to the Chilean Navy and five were retired. The hulls of the Type 23s were built with thin plate in order to reduce weight, and were never intended to serve for so long,accordingto British defense outlet Navy Lookout.\nHMSSutherlandwas the final Type 23 frigate to receive the life extension upgrades at defense firm Babcock, which will allow her to continue in service into the mid-2030s alongside her sisters. The frigate underwent extensive modernization and extension refits and only returned to the sea in January this year for trials after four years at the dockyard.\nWhile the UK government has opted to keep some of the Type 23 frigates in active service before their replacements, the Type 26 and Type 31 frigates start entering service, it has also been forced to retire others due to the exorbitant costs being incurred in operational maintenance.\nAccording to Eagle, the eight Type 26 ships are expected to enter service between 2028 and 2035 while the five Type 31 ships are planned to be in service by the early 2030s.\nThe City-Class Type 26 frigates, which are being built at BAE Systems, are primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare but are also capable of supporting air defense and general-purpose operations. They have a displacement of approximately 6,900 tonnes, a length of 149.9 metres, and a beam of 20.8 metres. The Inspiration Class Type 31 ships are being built at Babcock, with the first three at different stages of construction."

Banana Port - located along the DRC’s narrow coastline of 22 miles on the Atlantic Ocean - is planned to be the single maritime gateway for containerized trade in the country. The port is located near the mouth of the Congo River, in Kongo Central province.\nAccording to DP World, the selection of Mota-Engil, a Portuguese engineering conglomerate, was informed by the company’s extensive experience in port development and logistics support in Africa. Currently, Mota-Engil is part of the consortium operating the Lobito Corridor, which is a railway route connecting DRC’s copper belt to Angola’s Lobito port. The Lobito Corridor has been hailed as one of Africa’s most important economic infrastructure projects, connecting the rich mineral regions of DRC and Zambia to global markets through Angola.\nDP World said Mota-Engil’s experience in African logistics aligns with its vision for Banana Port. “By partnering with Mota-Engil, we are ensuring that this world-class infrastructure is built to the highest standards, fostering economic growth. Banana Port is a transformative project that will reshape the trade and logistics landscape of the DRC,” said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, CEO of DP World. Besides Mota-Engil’s contract, the construction of the port will also include local enterprises, and will create about 85,000 jobs and $430 million annually in new economic output once in operation.\nBanana Port will be developed in phases. The first involves building a 600-meter quay with 18 meters of depth, which will enable the port to handle large container vessels. The port will have capacity for 450,000 TEU per year and also feature 30 hectares of storage area. The second phase will extend the quay by over two kilometers. The development of the port is supported with financing from DP World in partnership with British International Investment (BII), the UK’s development finance institution and impact investor. Last year, BII committed to investing up to $35 million towards the development of the first phase."

        "content": "\nDanish towage and marine services provider Svitzer is promising that its TRAnsverse tug design has the potential to become a game changer in harbor and terminal towage after trials by the inaugural vessel returned impressive results, even in extreme weather conditions.\nThe company has released a white paper on the functionalities of the new design after conducting live sea trials using the first TRAnsverse tug,Svitzer Taurus,that entered service at the Port of Amsterdam in October last year, the result of which was an average of 15 percent fuel efficiency gains.\nAs part of trials to determine that the new design is capable of performing towage jobs that standard ASD tugs of similar or larger sizes cannot do, an analysis of 200 jobs conducted by the 29-meterTaurushas also shown that the new design has significant fuel saving capabilities. Compared to the existing Svitzer fleet of tugs working alongside theTaurusin Amsterdam, the new design recorded an average fuel efficiency improvement of 15 percent.\nThe trials also showed that at speeds above 2-3 knots in dynamic modes, the TRAnsverse tug expands the operating envelope by around 50 percent compared to ASD tug designs. It can push and sidestep effectively in a full speed range up to 10 knots, has greater maneuverability and better usage of hydrodynamic forces during pulling and braking. The new design’s improved transition capability also means that the tug requires less power, time and fuel than other tugs.\nThe TRAnsverse tug design started in 2019 with the initial concept developed by Robert Allan. The company says that throughout the design process, the intention was to widen the operational envelope and challenge preconceptions about tug design.\nAmong the key elements of the TRAnsverse design is the towing staple, aimed at increasing stability in operation, improving its direct and indirect capabilities, and increasing maneuverability when connected to the ship - while also helping to avoid thruster-to-thruster interaction. Another element is the double-ended hull and propulsion. While the propulsion units are the well-known azimuth thrusters, the TRAnsverse provides higher slewing rates than the industry norm. Though currently powered by conventional diesel engines, plans are underway to integrate battery power.\nIn coming up with the design, Svitzer was responding to the fact that port congestion has become a major challenge in global shipping, causing delays, driving up costs, and creating ripple effects throughout supply chains. Vessels have become larger and larger, making it a daunting task getting them in and out of ports. While the towage industry has responded by building larger tugs, the company opted for a ‘smarter’ option.\n“We believe that the TRAnsverse tug has the potential to become a game changer in harbor and terminal towage. It can address common port pain points, including severe challenges with port congestion, larger vessels, and more extreme weather conditions,” said Kasper Karlsen, Svitzer Chief Operating Officer.\nAlready, eight TRAnsverse tugs are in operation or on order, with Svitzer expecting more orders after gathering data on the tug’s ability to solve most of the daily jobs faster and better than standard tug designs."

        "content": "The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers celebrating the opening of the Soo Locks on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula this morning, March 21, providing an earlier-than-anticipated start to the 2025 shipping season on the Upper Great Lakes. The lock is reported to be one of the busiest maritime locking systems in the world handling more than 4,500 vessels and 80 million tons of cargo each year.\nIt was a balmy 19 degrees F (-7 degrees C) this morning but it did not stop the festivities and the race to see which vessel would be first through the locks. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, reports the first vessel, an articulated barge and tug combo, actually arrived before 2:00 p.m. on March 20 to secure the first in line position. This morning by the time the lock opened at 8:00 a.m., they said three freighters were waiting to make their way into Lake Superior.\nThe lock is located at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan connecting Lake Superior and Lake Huron. The lock closes each winter for maintenance, this year running approximately 10 weeks. During that time, the Army Corps reports maintenance crews performed a variety of critical tasks on the Poe Lock, including fabricating and replacing anchorages on gate 3, commissioning the temporary dewatering system, filling in nonoperational ship arrestor recesses on the downstream end, flushing and cleaning the hydraulic systems for the rehabilitated ship arrestor systems, navigation button rehabilitation, removing underground storage tanks and repairing the winter work bridge recesses. The Poe Lock was not dewatered this year for the scheduled maintenance but contractors also used the time to complete upstream stop log recess repairs.\n\n\nFirst vessel honors for the 2025 season went to the tug-barge combo as the lock reopened to vessel traffic (USACE)\n\nHonors for the last vessel through the lock on January 16 went to theAmerican Mariner, a 730-foot freighter loaded with more than 20,000 tons of wheat. Through the Poe Lock this morning first was the tugClyde S.which is 130 feet in length and was working with theErie Tradera 740-foot barge. Both are owned by VanEnkevort Tug & Barge.\nThe Army Corps reports it opened the Poe Lock early in response to requests from the shipping community. It started the 2025 season giving shippers a head start before the St. Lawrence Seaway reopens on March 22. They expect an influx of Canadian vessels and international shipping when the full system is open for the season. The Army Corps was pleased to make it possible for the larger lock to begin operations early. However, the smaller MacArthur Lock will remain closed opening in April.\nTo ensure navigation would be possible, the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Mackinaw made its way through Soo Locks on March 19. It went to break ice in Whitefish Bay on the northern side of the lock where vessels enter Lake Superior.\nOnce completing the locking, the vessels are heading across Lake Superior to Duluth, Minnesota."

        "content": "DP World reports that it has gained the necessary permitting and is poised to begin work in just a matter of weeks on a planned expansion of its London Gateway. It represents a £1 billion (US$1.3 billion ) project which when completed will add 50 percent capacity to the UK’s logistics sector.\nWork is due to start in May, the DP World reports it will take four years to complete the expansion. The project will add two further 400-meter (1,300-foot) all-electric berths and a second rail terminal. It follows recent investments in new cranes and logistics capabilities. The expanded container port, part of the Thames Freeport, will be able to accommodate six of the world’s largest container ships, which will be served by Europe’s tallest quay cranes.\nDP World worked to gain regulatory approval for the investment, which was first announced in October 2024. Today, the chairman of DP World Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem hosted the UK Minister of State for Investment, Baroness Poppy Gustafsson, at London Gateway to discuss the investment, growth plans, and 400 new permanent jobs that will be created at the logistics hub.\n“This investment enhances London Gateway’s position at the heart of British trade, creating new capacity and new connections between the UK and the global economy,” said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. “DP World has invested more than £5 billion in its UK operations, providing more than 5,500 jobs, and is proud to be supporting national economic growth by enabling businesses to thrive and increasing resilience in the supply chain.”\nThe start of construction follows the agreement between DP World and the Gemini Cooperation (Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd) for Gemini’s Asia-Europe and Middle East-Europe services to call at London Gateway. The first ship arrived at London Gateway this week following DP World Southampton welcoming its first ship under the Gemini Cooperation on February 3. The cooperation is focusing on the DP facilities moving these routes to Felixstowe as Genimi seeks faster port turns and 90 percent schedule reliability.\n“DP World’s expansion in London Gateway will turbocharge the UK’s logistics sector and help?deliver the long-term, stable growth that supports skilled jobs and raises living standards across the UK,” said Baroness Poppy Gustafsson, Minister of State for Investment, said: “The UK is open for business and DP World’s major investment is the latest vote of confidence in our economy, delivering economic growth and showing our Plan for Change is working.”\nThe company reports the project will create over 1,000 construction jobs, plus 400 permanent new jobs at the port. The terminal opened its fourth berth in the fall of 2024, which DP World said was the first all-electric berth in the world. When this project is completed it will have reached the planned design with a total of six large berths for containerships.\nCombined DP World’s Gate and Southampton terminals handled approximately 3.6 million TEUs each year. The Thames Estuary hub opened in 2013 and last year handled approximately 2 million TEU. The company reported it was one of the fastest growing in its global portfolio achieving double-digit growth over 2023."

Crashes and capsizes are rare, but when they occur, they are high-impact events because of the speeds involved.\nHalfway through the series, the British, Australian and New Zealand boats are in the top three places, with the American boat still struggling to find form."

        "content": "\nFLNG developer Delfin has secured a long-sought license from the Maritime Administration to install a three-unit FLNG liquefaction hub in the U.S. Gulf, based around existing infrastructure.\nIts proposed Delfin LNG project centers on the UTOS pipeline, or U-T Offshore System. The pipeline runs from Cameron Parish out into the U.S. Gulf, and was originally built to bring gas from offshore wells back to land for processing and sale. Former owner Enbridge shut down the pipeline in 2011 as gas flows reduced to levels that were no longer commercially viable; Delfin bought it in 2014 and filed an application with the Department of Energy to use it as an export line for an FLNG complex.\nDelfin's plan is to reverse the direction of flow in the existing line and sell now-abundant supplies of U.S. natural gas to foreign buyers via a floating export terminal. At the seaward end would be as many as three anchored FLNGs, capable of up to 13 million tonnes per annum of output, and situated in water deep enough to accommodate fully laden LNG carriers alongside.\nDelfin has already arranged long-term offtake contracts with trading house Gunvor and with Chesapeake Energy, and has explored additional options with Chinese buyers. Two years ago, it entered into an agreement with Wison Offshore for the design and engineering of the FLNG units, and said that market conditions were prompting an acceleration of project plans. At the time, the objective was to be ready to begin construction on the first of the planned FLNG units by mid-2024.\nDelfin had applied for an operating license from MARAD in 2015, and MARAD confirmed Friday that this piece of the puzzle has now fallen into place after a 10-year review. The license is now in hand, and it lets Delfin own, build and operate a deepwater port for LNG export purposes. Paired with its Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval for exports to non-free trade agreement countries, it is now one step closer to moving forward.\nFor future expansion, Delfin has rights to a second, adjacent subsea gas pipeline system that could be used for a parallel development, Avocet LNG. It believes that permitting would be easier for this expansion because of the work previously done for MARAD's Delfin LNG approval.\nThe company is also a partner in the Haisla LNG project, a small-scale FLNG project with the Haisla Nation in British Columbia."

But it seems likely that all parties want to pause the talks for the present, while the United States is apparently considering whether it should make a direct bid for sovereignty for the 60 km2 tropical paradise itself, given both its defense utility and potential as a resort destination."

According to the news accounts, the vessel was first questioned in February just days after it was stopped by German federal police for an investigation related to cable damage in Sweden. Again, yesterday, March 20, the Irish authorities were tracking the ship as it was sailing in its coastal waters.\nThe ship which is registered in Antigua and Barbuda and managed from Latvia is now docked in the Irish port of Aughinish on the southwest coast near Limerick. Its AIS signal indicates it was coming from Spain where it had departed on March 15. The Air Corps tracked the vessel yesterday according to the newspapers in part due to a previous incident off the northeast coast of Ireland earlier this year.\nThe ship was identified as suspicious after German authoritiesreported stopping iton February 24 in Kiel. At the time the reports said it was missing its port-side anchor. Fears were running high after Sweden reported cable damage near Gotland, but after a three-hour investigation, the German authorities permitted the vessel to continue its voyage.\nThe Journal.ie reports that Irish authorities then detected the same ship off the northeast coast and the Air Corps was sent to investigate. According to the unconfirmed reports, the surveillance airplane filmed the vessel dropping its anchor. The Irish Defense Force reportedly contacted the ship ordering it to stop its anchoring and back away from the sensitive area with the cables.

It comes mounting evidence points to Russia building a supply chain to alleviate Syria’s ongoing energy crisis.\nIn a posting online, Syria reported the arrival on Thursday night, March 20, of the tankerAquatica(106,000 dwt) carrying nearly 100 million metric tons of crude oil. The report said the tanker would begin offloading at the oil terminal in Baniyas marking the first shipment to reach the country “since the liberation.” Media reports said it is critical fuel to be used for electric power generation.\nThe new government has been desperate to build fuel supplies to address a lack of domestic production and a suspension of imports. The Financial Times has reported that Syria was getting as much as 100,000 barrels a day from Iran before the fall of the Assad regime. Iran reportedly was supplying approximately 90 percent of Syria’s crude oil but cut it off when Assad fled the country.\nAquaticais registered in Barbados but databases list its management in Azerbaijan and ownership in the Seychelles. The tanker was added to the U.S. sanctions list in January 2025 and the European Union followed with its listing of the tanker in February.\nWhile it is the first reported crude oil tanker to arrive, according to TankerTrackers.com it is not the last. Theyreported onlineearlier this week that they are tracking another tanker,Sabina(158,000 dwt) registered in Barbados but owned and managed from Hong Kong. TankerTrackers.com says it is transporting one million barrels of Russian crude oil to Syria, where it is due to arrive in early April. Reuters is also reporting that a crude oil tanker namedSakina(157,000 dwt) also registered in Barbados with management and ownership in Hong Kong is heading toward Syria.

France 24published an exposéon March 20 tracking the growing number of tankers suddenly arriving in Syria. It believes the common link is Russia and quotes analysts speculating that Russia has made a deal to supply oil products in exchange for maintaining its military presence in Syria.\nThe Syrian Arab News Agency announced the first arrival of badly needed gas supplies into the country last week. It highlighted two gas tankers,Prosperity(40,000 dwt registered in Barbados) andGas Catalina(7,800 dwt registered in Palau) arriving around March 12. Reports said another gas carrier,Proxima(40,000 dwt registered in Barbados) was also bound for Syria.\nThe government reports said the first gas shipments brought 34,000 tons aboard theProsperityand another 4,000 tons onGas Catalina. Prosperity departed on March 14. Built in 2006, the vessel was formerly theNS Pridepart of the Sovcomflot fleet and is now linked to Fornex in Dubai which is known to be involved in the Russian energy trade.Prosperityhas also been sanctioned by the U.S. as well as the EU and UK."

The Canadian Coast Guard highlights the dangers remain, but that no pollution has been observed so far from the stranded vessel.\n“The tug and barge, contracted by MSC, were able to go alongside the MSC Baltic III to load some frac tanks and a containment boom onboard the vessel,” said the Canadian Coast Guard in its latest update. “The frac tanks will be used to store and offload the fuel.”\nThe containership blacked out and was driven ashore in a remote cove on Newfoundland’s western shore on February 15 not far from Corner Brook. The Coast Guard along with T&T Salvage have reported that the efforts however were complicated by the remote location and winter weather which has included high winds and ice in the cove.\nThe priority is the fuel and other potential contaminants aboard the vessel. The salvage teams after inspecting the 680-foot (207-meter) vessel reported that it was resting on the seabed but that the hull had experienced significant damage. They said there is water in the cargo holds and the engine room and that the vessel cannot be safely refloated at this time. Tank soundings confirmed approximately 1.7 million liters of heavy fuel and marine gas oil are onboard the vessel.\nThe Coast Guard reports that several containers that were carrying polymeric beads (plastic nurdles) which are considered dangerous goods have been removed from the vessel. MSC Mediterranean Shipping had previously said those containers had been secured to reduce the danger of the contents being released.\nThe fuel aboard the vessel will need to be heated before it can be pumped from the tanks. MSC and its salvage company have proposed several salvage options, including loading the fuel and containers onto barges or also using an access road onshore. However, the road requires upgrades to get the heavy equipment to the area where the ship came to rest.\nLocal news media reports that the efforts are ongoing and fishermen are hoping that it will make progress by the end of the month. The local fishing season opens on April 1 and the concern is for access to the areas as well as the continued danger from pollution."

The tanker,Nexus Victoria(75,000 dwt) is also reported to be the largest vessel to incorporate Value Marine’s SOx scrubber with advanced carbon capture technology.\nThe installation was recently completed in Singapore aboard the tanker, which is owned by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and registered in the Isle of Man. The tanker, which is managed by Synergy Maritime, was built in Japan and runs with a single two-stroke six-cylinder diesel engine from Mitsui Engineering.\n“This system represents a crucial step in decarbonizing vessels that cannot yet transition to next-generation fuels,” said Hiroyoshi Kubo, Executive Officer – Tanker Unit at MOL. “Together with Value Maritime, we are committed to advancing carbon capture solutions and building a CO2 value chain that contributes to a sustainable, carbon-neutral industry.”\nVM’s Filtree system is designed to filter sulfur, CO2, and (ultra) fine particulate matter from the vessel’s exhaust stream. The company was started in 2017 focusing on scrubbers but has now developed a system that combines the two functions. The system’s plug-and-play design includes onboard CO2 capture and storage capabilities, enabling captured CO2 to be offloaded onshore for reuse in greenhouse cultivation, methanol production, or the food industry.\nThe system consists of two elements, including a small prefabricated, pre-installed, “plug and play” gas cleaning system in a road transportable housing. This system filters the sulfur, 99 percent of the particulate matter (fine dust), and CO? from the exhaust gases of ships. The second stage is equipped with a filter that cleans the washing water. Oil residues and particulate matter are removed from the washing water and fed to the sludge tank.\nAccording to the company, its VM 15MW next-generation EGCS Filtree system will capture 10 percent of the tanker’s CO2 emissions. It is potentially scalable to 30 percent.\nThis project was agreed to in April 2024 as the company’s first in Japan. Value Maritime aims to expand its partnerships across Asia and enhance its carbon logistics.\nEastern Pacific Shipping installed onboard its MR tankerPacific Cobalta first-of-its-kind fully integrated carbon capture solution developed by Value Maritime in February 2023. At the time they reported the system would be capable of capturing up to 40 percent of CO2 emissions from the vessel’s main and auxiliary engines as well as 99 percent of SOx emissions. Ardmore Shipping in September 2023 also began fitting the first of nine systems aboard its tankers at a shipyard in China.\nThe shipping industry is showing increasing interest in the technology. It could become a key tool in addressing the emissions of the in-service fleet extending the life and financial performance of these vessels."

We found it’s really not,” said Michael Shields, Johns Hopkins associate professor and lead author. “In fact, it's something we should expect to happen every few years.”\nThe study suggests that the likelihood of ships alliding with bridges has been greatly underestimated, and that we should all expect to see more bridge strikes in our lifetimes. Owing to the dramatic increase in the size of ships, and the fact that most bridges are witnessing an unprecedented increase in vessel traffic, future allisions are virtually certain - though the severity will vary, and there are engineering interventions to reduce harm. For example, the group calculated that the Huey P. Long Bridge outside New Orleans and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge are likely to be hit by a ship within two decades.\nJohns Hopkins is releasing the preliminary findings of the study on the first anniversary of the Key Bridge collapse after it was struck by the boxshipDali, killing six people who were carrying out roadway repairs on the bridge deck. While investigations are still ongoing on the cause of the allision, the reality is that the chances of another similar incident are much higher. Ship strikes should be extremely rare, with bridge design standards stipulating that the annual chances of a bridge collapse from ship allisions should be less than 1 in 10,000 years. But after collecting, mining and analyzing 16 years of U.S. Coast Guard data, the team concluded the next allision could be in the pipeline. Notably, even iconic bridges like San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and Maryland's Chesapeake Bay Bridge are not immune to allisions.\nThe team based its study on AIS tracking, port data and bridge data from the National Bridge Inventory to determine which large ships passed under which bridges. Using the traffic data, along with average mishap rates from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the team was able to estimate the probability of very large ships hitting the piers of major bridges across the U.S. (Bridges without in-water piers were excluded from the study.)\nThe Key Bridge allision provided an unfortunate confirmation of their methods: the team predicted it would have likely been hit by a ship within 48 years. The bridge was 46 years old when it fell, having sustained a minor hit from a ship previously.\nThe study identifies the bridges facing the highest risks of allision over the next five decades or less. These include the Huey P. Long Bridge (17 years), the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (22 years), the Crescent City Connection in New Orleans (34 years) and the Beltway 8 Bridge in Houston (35 years). Others include the Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge west of New Orleans (37 years), Bayonne Bridge, N.Y./N.J (43 years) and Fred Hartman Bridge, Texas (47 years).\n“There's still a lot of uncertainty in predicting the frequency of ship collisions, even with the best data we have,” said Shields. “But the important point is not whether it will occur every 17 years or every 75 years. It's that it's happening way too often.”"

        "content": "Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines is moving forward to become one of the first of the major carriers to incorporate ammonia-fueled vessels into its fleet. MOL is joining with CMB.Tech which launched a project in 2023 to build the first ammonia-fueled large dry bulker carriers and will also expand ammonia as a fuel to its chemical tanker segment.\nMOL and CMB.Tech have agreed to joint ownership of three ammonia-fitted 210,000 dwt Newcastle bulk carriers. The vessels have already been ordered at Qingdao Beihai Shipyard due for delivery in 2026 and 2027. CMB.Tech launched the project in 2023 working with WinGD to develop a 72-bore ammonia-fueled engine. After nine months of work, they announced good progress as CSSC Qingdao-Beihai Shipbuilding and CSSC Engine Company joined the project.\nThe vessels which were being developed for CMB’s Bocimar and were anticipated to be the first large ammonia-fueled vessels in the commercial industry. Under the terms of the new agreement, CMB.Tech and MOL will jointly own the vessels. The Japanese company will charter the three vessels each for 12 years.\nThe companies are expanding ammonia-fueled installations reporting a new order with China Merchants Jinling Shipyard (Yangzhou) for a total of six chemical tankers. Two of the vessels will be ammonia-fitted on delivery and the other four will be built ammonia-ready. CMB.Tech will own the vessels, which are due for delivery in 2028 and 2029, and charter the two ammonia vessels to MOL Chemical Tankers for 10 years. The Japanese company will have 7-year charters on the ammonia-ready vessels.\nThe MOL Group reports it intends to adopt ammonia and integrate it into the corporate environmental vision initiative. MOL’s goal is to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\nWinGD has reported that it is making solid progress in the testing of its first ammonia-fueled engines. The company has said the first engines could be ready for delivery this year.\nWhile there is strong interest in ammonia due to its ability to eliminate carbon emissions, the shipping industry has been waiting for progress with the engines. DNV calculates that there are 31 vessels on order for delivery by 2027 that would be built for ammonia, but so far only three vessels have been retrofitted for ammonia operations. Australia’s Fortescue completed certification in Singapore for an offshore vessel while Japan’s NYK Group converted its LNG-fueled tugboat to operate with ammonia.\nAlexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.Tech has been a strong proponent of ammonia as one of the tools to decarbonize shipping. He noted with these orders, CMB.Tech has increased its contract backlog by $921 million to a total of $2.94 billion. He says it demonstrates the progress on their vision of fleet rejuvenation, decarbonization, and diversification."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nOn Monday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative held its first hearings on a plan to charge the owners of Chinese ships an additional fee for every port call in the U.S., ranging up to $3.5 million for each instance. If enacted as described, the fee structure would increase shipping costs, critics say - and the list of concerns continues to grow.\nThe proposed fee structure is steep, and the USTR's notice contains several policy alternatives. Each U.S. port call for any vessel operated by Chinese interests will be subject to a fee of up to $1 million; each U.S. port call for each vessel built in China will be subject to a fee of up to another $1 million, depending on the proportion of Chinese-built ships in that operator's fleet; and operators with newbuilds on order in China will face additional fees of up to another $1 million per port call. To support the American merchant fleet, the proposal contains discounts for operators who also have U.S.-built tonnage, and it has minimum-volume  requirements that mandate the use of increasing amounts of U.S.-flagged and U.S.-built tonnage for American exporters.\nCritics of the plan have previously raised many concerns, including the forced shutdown of a few American-based shipping lines that use Chinese-built ships; the increased export costs for U.S. ag and energy commodities, which will make American exporters less competitive compared to foreign alternatives; a possible reduction in growth for U.S. oil and gas production; and a reordering of liner trades to favor a handful of calls in major U.S. ports, increasing congestion at the main gateways while reducing business for secondary seaports.\nTwo new issues emerged Monday. The CEO of NYK Line, the Japanese shipowner that co-owns carrier ONE, told Reuters that Japanese and Korean shipyards are not in a position to expand the production of non-Chinese ships until at least 2028. Since there are few other competitors on the global market for oceangoing merchant vessels, this would mean that expanding the orderbook for no-fee tonnage would be delayed for at least another three years - even though the USTR's proposal would take effect on a much shorter timeline.\nThe World Shipping Council (WSC), which represents ocean carriers, added another concern: the possibility of litigation. Since USTR has said that it is partly motivated by a desire to grow the U.S. shipbuilding industry, WSC suggested that the proposed port call fees might not be legal.\n\"Generating demand for domestic products and raising government revenue – whether to support a domestic industry or for other purposes – are not permissible bases for actions under Section 301,\" said WSC CEO Joe Kramek in a statement, referring to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974.\nAs a practical matter, Kramek noted that the U.S. shipbuilding sector is already backlogged with U.S. Navy production and maintenance needs, and that \"labor shortages constrain the ability of U.S. shipyards to take on additional orders.\"\n\"The Administration should work with Congress on a forward-looking strategy that is constructively designed to revitalize the U.S. maritime industry,\" Kramek said."

The bulker attempted to pass in between the tugSadong 33and the bargeLCT Sea Asia.\nThe tug had a crew of eight aboard and capsized from the impact. The Coast Guard was able to recover six seafarers from the water while search teams later recovered the two deceased crewmembers. One is identified as the captain of the tug and the other was working as an oiler. The six were provided medical attention and reported not to be seriously injured.\nThe Coast Guard has placed oil booms around the tug as a precaution.

        "content": "The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Maersk’s APM Terminals have agreed to a 33-year lease extension for the port’s second-largest container terminal. The company plans to make significant investments in the terminal located in Elizabeth, New Jersey in support of the port’s long-term growth plan.\nAccording to the port, the lease extension which will be voted on by the Porth Authority’s board on March 27, takes a unique, nontraditional approach of incorporating performance, infrastructure, and sustainability requirements into the contract. The port says this will ensure steps are taken to enable the terminal to handle growing cargo volumes while prioritizing customer service and sustainability. The port has also recently reached similar long-term extensions with other terminal operators.\n“This lease extension secures transformative infrastructure and capacity enhancements at the second-largest container terminal in the East Coast’s busiest port,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “These commitments will enable the Port of New York and New Jersey to move more goods, create more jobs, and further cement its role as an essential driver of our region’s economy and our nation’s supply chain.”\nMaersk’s current lease was due to expire in December 2029. The extension extends the term through December 2062. APM Terminals highlights that the terminal currently handles over 25 percent of the annual container throughput in the port. The company has already been investing in the complex including four new gantry cranes which arrived in November 2024.\nAs part of the agreement, APM Terminals will invest over $500 million over the coming years to enhance cargo-handling capacity at its 350-acre terminal. APM Terminals has also committed to the replacement and maintenance of all wharf and berth structures. Additionally, the Port Authority and APM Terminals will expand the lease to include portions of an adjacent parcel of land to APM Terminals for enhanced productivity. APM Terminals has also committed to future capacity enhancements driven by demand.\nUnder the new agreement, APM Terminals will also invest in zero-emission cargo-handling equipment over the coming years. As a Port Authority lessee, the terminal operator is also subject to the Port Authority’s marine terminal tariff, which incentivizes the adoption of cleaner equipment as new technology becomes commercially available. It is in keeping with the Port Authority’s goal of reaching net zero agency-wide by 2050.\nAccording to the Port Authority, the investments covered under the new agreement are in keeping with its Port Master Plan 2050. The strategy anticipates cargo volumes doubling or tripling by mid-century."

The operation is expected later this week.\nAfter hitting the tanker which started fires aboard both ships,Solongwas abandoned and her crew was brought to shore by an offshore service vessel working at a wind farm in the area. One crewmember, a resident of the Philippines, was lost with reports saying he had been working near the bow of the vessel when it hit the tanker. HM Coastguard led an unsuccessful search to locate the missing seafarer.\nAfter initially drifting in the North Sea, salvage teams were able to attach a tow line to hold the still-burning vessel. It took more than a week for the fires to be put out.\n“Salvage of theSolonghas progressed to enable its relocation to the Port of Aberdeen for safe berthing,” Chief Coastguard Paddy O’Callaghan announced today. “Tug and tow are scheduled to arrive at Aberdeen later this week,” the Coastguard announced\nThe plan calls forSolongto be towed by one of the salvage tugs and accompanied by another tug. In addition, a vessel with counter pollution measures will be accompanying the tow. HM Coastguard said the pollution measures would be available if needed during the tow.\nAt the same time, the local authorities report the cleanup is continuing along the coastline as nurdles (plastic beads) have washed up following the incident. The Coastguard has said that it is likely that the nurdles entered the water at the point of collision, but the vessel’s owners through a spokesperson said that it believes no containers holding nurdles were thought to have been lost over the side of the ship. It speculates that some of the plastic beads were released during the fires which ruptured some of the containers.\nThe situation for theStena Immaculateremains unchanged with the tanker still at anchor. U.S. ship operator Crowley reported salvage teams determined only one of the tanks holding jet fuel had been ruptured and fed the fire. The remainder of the jet fuel is stable aboard the tanker. No details have been announced for the salvage which is being conducted by Boskalis’ SMIT group.\nThe crews from the two vessels were repatriated to the United States and the Philippines. However, the master of theSolongremains in a UK jail having been arrested on a count of gross negligent manslaughter. It came out in the initial court hearing that he had been on the bridge of the containership standing watch when it hit the tanker. His next hearing is scheduled for April 14 and the judge has set a tentative trial date of January 12, 2026.\n"

It is the latest in a series of incidents as tensions remain high and Taiwan has vowed to increase its monitoring of Chinese vessels entering restricted areas.\nThe alert went out early on Sunday morning, March 23, that an unidentified vessel had entered a restricted zone on the northwest coast of Taiwan. It was approximately 20 nautical miles north of the Yong’an District, near Kaohsiung.\nThe Coast Guard reports when it reached the area it tracked the unidentified vessel traveling 3 miles inside the restricted zone and ignoring repeated hails. When the Coast Guard broadcast for the vessel to stop for inspection, it reports the vessel started taking a zig-zag course attempting to avoid an intercept.\n\n\n\nWhen they boarded the vessel they reported the ship had no name visible and that it had been obscured or possibly painted over. In addition, the vessel did not have documents and a registration. There were six crewmembers aboard and none of them also had identification documents.\nThe Coast Guard reports the vessel had approximately 500,000 liters of fuel aboard and pipe equipment. The speculation is that the vessel was being used to fuel Chinese fishing boats which Taiwan also says are operating illegally in its waters.\n\n\nNameless fuel barge without documentation detained by the Taiwan Coast Guard\n\nThe barge was directed into the port near Taipei for further investigation.\nSince the start of 2025, officials have said Taiwan’s defense forces and the Coast Guard were coordinating efforts to track shipping acting suspiciously. They have been targeting foreign-registered, Chinese-owned ships loitering off Taiwan as well as vessels entering restricted zones.\nTaiwan in January accused a Chinese-owned vessel of damaging an undersea cable and in February the Coast Guard reported catching a vessel dragging its anchor and damaging other cables. Ten days ago, Taiwan chased away a Chinese research vessel sailing in a restricted zone and putting instruments into the water."

        "content": "\nSenior members of the Trump administration, including the secretary of defense, accidentally texted the Pentagon's future war plans for bombing strikes in Yemen to a journalist whom they had invited into a group chat. TheWhite House has confirmedthat the conversation was authentic, acknowledging that some of the most well-known names in the Trump administration leaked the positions and planned operations of U.S. Navy and Air Force servicemembers in Yemen to a reporter. In addition to the security implications of the leak itself, the use of an unauthorized commercial app for the highest levels of secret defense talks raises questions about operational security and the preservation of federal records: the app, Signal, is typically used on low-security commercial phones, and it was set to delete messages automatically after a predetermined period of time, thereby erasing any record of the conversation (if the reporter hadn't saved it).\nThe journalist who was inadvertently invited to the group chat - The Atlantic's managing editor, Jeffrey Goldberg - had the integrity not to publish the details of the war plans, since doing so could compromise the safety of American soldiers. He did, however, release screenshots and text of the group's deliberations the day before the strikes, including apparent skepticism by Vice President JD Vance about whether the U.S. should be involved in Yemen at all.\nIt started on March 13, when Goldberg received a Signal invite from Michael Waltz, Trump's national security advisor. He was invited to join a meeting called \"Houthi PC small group,\" inviting a list of extremely important personnel to join a \"principles group\" [sic] meeting about \"coordination on Houthis\" to follow up on discussions in the \"Sit Room.\" (A principals group is a gathering of executive branch leaders at the cabinet level.)\nIn the group chat, Signal users with the usernames MAR, JD Vance, TG, Scott B, Pete Hegseth and John Ratcliffe responded to the chat invite and nominated representatives to attend, all of whom were well-known aides to top officials. The White House has confirmed the authenticity of the texts, and from either context or verbatim language, the Signal usernames appear to correspond to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe (respectively). Other users present on the invite list were Susie Wiles, likely the White House Chief of Staff, and S M, likely senior Trump advisor Stephen Miller.\nJeffrey Goldberg's username was included in the group chat list as \"JG,\" bearing some accidental resemblance to \"JD,\" and no one questioned his presence. At this early stage, Goldberg suspected that the chat was fake, either a disinformation campaign or someone attempting to embarrass a media organization. \"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" he later wrote.\nThe meeting began at 0805 on March 14, all by Signal. The account \"JD Vance\" wrote in to say that he was busy that day in Michigan (he was) and added that he thought \"we are making a mistake\" by intervening in Yemen, since Europe is the primary beneficiary of Suez Canal trade. He suggested that the American public might not see the point of opening up the Red Sea to European navigation, except for the purpose of sending a message to foreign adversaries. \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this [Red Sea campaign] is with his message on Europe right now,\" the \"JD Vance\" account wrote. \"I just hate bailing Europeans out again.\"\nThe person with the \"Pete Hegseth\" account concurred with \"loathing for European free-loading,\" but voted for going ahead with strikes on the Houthis in order to reestablish deterrence, even if \"nobody knows who the Houthis are\" in America and the strikes might require certain political messaging to explain. The \"Michael Waltz\" account suggested that the costs of the strikes could be billed to Europe after the fact.\n\"S M\" concluded the conversation by saying that \"the president was clear: green light,\" though he emphasized that \"there needs to be some further economic gain extracted [from Europe and Egypt] in return.\"\nAt 1144 hours on March 15, Goldberg received a \"team update\" from the account labeled \"Pete Hegseth.\" It contained the secret operational details for imminent airstrikes on Yemen, including \"targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" with the first strikes scheduled to hit at 1345 hours. Since the details could be used to harm American personnel if they were indeed authentic, Goldberg did not publish them. However, he was quickly convinced that they were real: at 1355, right on time for the \"team update\" schedule, the first strikes were reported in Sanaa, Yemen.\nGoldberg then followed up with Waltz, Gabbard, Ratcliffe and Hegseth by email and Signal, asking if the thread was genuine. A spokesman for the National Security Council responded later that day, confirming that \"this appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.\"\nU.S. intelligence agencies and cybersecurity experts have warned for years that Signal can be hacked or bypassed, including with commercially-availablespyware. The app is a knowntargetfor Russia's GRU intelligence agency.\nA former defense official told CNN that in order to copy the detailed Yemen war plans from a classified platform into the Signal chat, the details would have had to be re-entered manually. A simple \"copy and paste\" is not possible with the Pentagon's secure communications systems. \"You would either have to print it out or type it up while looking at both screens. So he had to have done it or somebody would’ve had to have done it for him that way,\" the official said."

The project sought to leverage the experience and expertise of each yard to advance the design concepts for a vessel they are calling Bingo 42 (Beyond Innovation, Navigating Green Ocean).\nThe shipyards highlight that traditionally each yard undertakes all stages of design from basic design to production. They note it creates a substantial design workload which they expect will be further increased in the future as yards seek to develop and deliver alternative fuel vessels.\nBoth companies produce handy size bulkers. The Bingo 42 project sought to leverage shared experience, development ideas, and strategies based on each yard’s previous work. They focused on a 42,000 dwt dry bulk carrier. The goal was to enhance the productivity of the design process and to potentially increase market share through orders and construction under the same brand. The structural design, construction, and sales will be carried out independently by each company.\nOne of the key focuses of the project was to enhance each other’s conventional hull forms. Working together, the designers lengthened the conventional hull by 3 meters (nearly 10 feet). By optimizing the hull form they were able to improve cargo capacity and fuel efficiency with the design being incorporated into Onomichi and Tsuneishi’s standard dry bulk carrier designs.\nThe design also incorporates the MT-Fast energy-saving device first developed by MTI and NYK Group. It improves propulsion efficiency by up to four percent by regulating water flow through the installation of multiple fins in front of the propeller. It is designed to be a methanol0dual fueled vessel/\nThe companies report that Bingo 42 design has achieved a reduction of more than 35 percent from their reference line under the EEDI index established by the IMO."

The Saudi-hosted conversation in Riyadh lasted 12 hours, and the details of the results should be released tomorrow in a joint statement. Diplomats from most Black Sea nations were not present, but Ukrainian representatives gave their input to the U.S. delegation on Sunday and were on hand nearby for consultation on Monday.\nThe outlines of a ceasefire deal have begun to emerge, though so far it appears that most hostilities will be allowed to continue on shore, where Russia is making steady gains on the front line. On the ground, the ceasefire solely covers attacks on \"energy infrastructure,\" leaving ports and railways unprotected despite a Ukrainian proposal to include them. The details of the Black Sea ceasefire will likely be known Tuesday. Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy to Russia and Ukraine, spoke optimistically about the talks and told reporters there were signs of \"real progress.\"\nBulgarian and Romanian diplomats have expressed unease, according to the FT, as any deal is likely to provide a new military advantage to Russia after a year of comparatively peaceful navigation in the western Black Sea. Recent Russian attacks on Odesa have killed as many seafarers as the last year of Houthi violence in the Red Sea, but merchant vessels have recently enjoyed unhindered access to the ports of NATO's member states in the region (Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania). This was not always so: until Ukraine's missiles and suicide drone boats drove the Russian Navy out of the western Black Sea, mines and missile attacks were a near-constant threat.\nIn three years, Ukraine has yet to attack a foreign merchant ship in the Black Sea, though it has struck several civilian-crewed, Russian-flagged vessels used for military logistics. It has focused instead on the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and so far it has damaged, disabled or sunk about one third of the Russian Navy's warships in the region, including the fleet flagship Moskva and the Kilo-class attack sub Rostov-on-Don. The remainder of the fleet has been withdrawn to the relative safety of Novorossiysk and the northeastern Black Sea - but it could roam westward again if a temporary ceasefire were reached."

The claims could not be confirmed, but Houthi forces have exaggerated their attempted attacks in the past.\nHouthi forces claimed to have targeted \"several enemy destroyers, in addition to the aircraft carrier Truman,\" using a combination of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones.\n\"This combat, the second in 24 hours, lasted for several hours, during which an enemy air attack against our country was thwarted,\" said Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree.\nSaree also claimed that Houthi missile forces had targeted Israel's Ben Gurion Airport with another two ballistic missiles, the latest in a series of attempted attacks on Israeli territory.\nThe Truman and other assets in the Mideast have been carrying out heavy strikes on Houthi positions since March 15. U.S. national security leaders have told media that multiple Houthi decisionmakers have been killed in the airstrikes, and that the toll on the group's military capabilities has been substantial. \"We've hit their headquarters,\" National Security Advisor Michael Waltz told media on Sunday. \"We’ve hit communications nodes, weapons factories and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities.\"\nSaudi outlet Al-Hadath reports that another Houthi leader was killed on Sunday night. Houthi media sources have reported an airstrike on a residential block in Sanaa, resulting in a claimed casualty count of one dead and 15 wounded.\nBoth sides are working on improving operational security and comms. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Houthi leaders claim to have improved the encryption and security of their communications systems since the start of the strikes. U.S. officials are having similar discussions after the U.S. defense leadership team accidentallyleakeddetailed Yemen war plans to a journalist on a commercial messaging app."

Brent Sadler (USN) has been nominated to run the U.S. Maritime Administration, the unit of the Department of Transportation responsible for the Ready Reserve, the Maritime Security Program, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and several other maritime-related programs. MARAD has been without a nominated leader since former administrator Adm. Ann Phillips' resignation in mid-January.\nCapt. Sadler is a Navy veteran with 26 years of experience, and currently works as a researcher with the conservative Heritage Foundation. He is an engineer by training and a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, with multiple Indo-Pacific submarine tours on his resume. As a policy leader at Indo-Pacific Command, he helped pass a program for maritime security training for Southeast Asian partners in FY2016, and helped direct $12 billion in defense funding to the Asia-Pacific under the \"rebalance\" initiative in 2013-15.\nWhen confirmed, he will help lead the drafting of new legislation to create a \"strategic commercial fleet\" focused on ensuring \"adequate cubed footage,\" according to a White House draft executive order obtained by USNI. This unit of measurement applies to ro/ro capacity, the most frequently-discussed element of the U.S. strategic sealift fleet.\nWhen confirmed, Sadler will have wide latitude to remake MARAD or reduce its size, an administration priority across government. High staff turnover and high retirement eligibility have left MARAD with more than 100 vacant positions (as of last September). In the fall, the agency had openings for 12 percent of all authorized positions, according to GAO - long before the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) offered all federal employees a voluntary buyout. MARAD officials told GAO last year that the staff shortages made it hard to accomplish missions, and that the problem was worsening."

        "content": "\nA group of U.S. environmental NGOs are suing the Trump administration over the rollback of guidance that was intended to protect the endangered Rice's whale, an ultra-rare species found only in the U.S. Gulf. Only an estimated 50 individuals remain, and conservationists believe that without protection, it could become the first whale species ever to go extinct due to human activity - possibly even before the North Atlanticright whale.\n\"[Rice's whales] are on the brink of extinction and the few dozen left alive desperately need more protections from speeding vessels and other offshore oil drilling activity, not less,\" said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Centre for Biological Diversity.\nThe Rice's whale is a relative of the Bryde's whale, and was first identified as a separate species in 2021. In 2022, more than 100 marine scientists called for \"excluding leasing and other [oil and gas] activities from the whale's habitat.\"\nIn response, BOEM removed lease blocks in Rice's whale habitat areas from a federal lease auction, and it asked offshore oil and gas operators to incorporate whale-protection measures when transiting specific water depths, including all areas between the 100-400 meter depth contours - the areas where the whale is known to feed. Theseprotective measuresincluded a halt to nighttime OSV navigation and a 10-knot speed limit across the depth contour band.\nPushback from oil majors came swiftly, and a federal judge prohibited BOEM from incorporating the restrictions into the requirements of a 2023 lease auction. On February 20, 2025, BOEM rescinded the guidance altogether, citing the Interior Department's new guidance for \"Unleashing American Energy.\"\nIn a letter to BOEM this week, the NGOs Friends of the Earth, Centre for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club, and the Turtle Island Restoration Network said that they plan to sue to restore the recommendations. BOEM's guidance on Rice's whale protection never became mandatory, but the nonprofits want the agency to make it official policy once more.\n\"It cannot be overstated: Trump is dealing a death blow to the critically endangered Rice’s whale in the name of Big Oil handouts,\" said Hallie Templeton, legal director for Friends of the Earth."

        "content": "Swedish offshore wind developer Vattenfall announced that it has taken the final investment decision to proceed with the construction of Germany’s largest offshore wind farm. The announcement was seen as a vote of confidence for the sector and comes as Germany is embroiled in a political debate about its offshore wind policy.\nThe final investment decision for the Nordlicht 1 and 2 offshore wind farms signals that construction will begin on the first phase in 2026 with a capacity of 980 MW. The wind farm will be located approximately 53 miles north of Borkum in the German North Sea. The final investment decision for the second phase was made on a conditional basis pending the receipt of permits.\nAs part of the decision, Vattenfall has also agreed to re-acquire 49 percent ownership in the project from German chemical company BASF. It acquired the portion of the project in April 2024 but says it has decided to streamline its current portfolio of renewable power projects. BASF however secured an agreement for long-term supply of renewable electricity from the project.\n“The Nordlicht offshore wind cluster makes a significant milestone in the path to enabling fossil freedom,” said Helene Biström, Head of Business Area Wind at Vattenfall. “By accelerating Germany’s energy transition and supporting industrial decarbonization, it will provide clean, reliable energy while driving innovation and sustainability in the sector.”\nVattenfall also said it would use low-emission steel for the wind turbine towers at both wind farms to lower their carbon footprint by 16 percent. When completed the full project will produce more than 1.6 GW with the first phase expected to be operational in 2028.\nLast week, however, RWE’s CEO Markus Krebber called for Germany to lower its total target for offshore wind due to concerns about efficiency and rising grid connection costs. He expressed concerns about crowding and its impact on maximizing wind yields.\nGermany currently has approximately 9 MW installed but the government mapped out an ambitious plan to grow to 70GW by 2045 to ensure its economy achieves climate neutrality. Krebber called for a more realistic target of just over 50 GW but others in the industry quickly rejected his suggestions. It comes as Germany is looking to reinvigorate offshore development and drive the growth of the sector after years of slow growth."

The shipping company SC Group Holding later issued a statement confirming the vessel grounded at approximately 0225 on March 25. It was traveling between two ports in Thailand when it stranded in the south of the country in an area known as the Eastern Gulf Coast.\nThe vessel was built in 1991 and has been operating in Thailand since 2013. It is 100 meters (328 feet in length).\n\n\n\nThe shipping company reported that it has dispatched engineers to inspect the vessel and a tug to aid in its refloating. At the same time, it issued a statement saying the grounding was “due to the employee’s negligence in his duties.” The company said it accepted responsibility for the incident and promised to implement stricter “preventive measures.”\nOfficials report that the first survey showed possible damage to the ballast tanks. They said it is a double-hull vessel which prevented damage to the tanks."

        "content": "Inspired by Ukraine's success with unmanned drone boats in the Black Sea, Taiwan has built an unmanned attack boat of its own, with modifications.\nThe new \"Endeavor Manta\" drone is a fiberglass-hull trimaran measuring 28 feet long. In its prototype configuration, it is powered by two outboard motors, an unusual but economical choice for a military vessel. It displaces about five tonnes with weapons loadout and fuel, and it can make more than 35 knots, according to manufacturer CSBC. Its small size and light weight make it possible to launch from small ports or even unimproved beaches, making deployments harder to interdict.\nUkraine's drone boats are smaller monohull designs with inboard propulsion. Initially they were one-way attack drones only, designed to deliver an explosive warhead directly to the hull of a target ship and detonate by ramming. They have gradually evolved to include reusable variants that carry FPV drone aircraft and antiaircraft missiles, among other payloads.\nThe Taiwanese design is expected to carry and use lightweight torpedoes, allowing it to make more than one attack run in a surface warfare role. It is equipped for ramming and detonation as well.\nIn initial configuration, the Manta has a cockpit for a human crewmember; it is unknown whether this would be removed for the final version. According to CSBC, it is capable of autonomous navigation, and will be able to return to port on its own if its command-and-control connectivity is interrupted.\nThe prototype aligns with U.S. war planning for a Taiwan Strait conflict: U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. Sam Paparo has called for building the technology for a \"hellscape\" of unmanned systems in the strait, which could fend off a Chinese invasion force long enough for a conventional response."

The bank is under EU, UK and U.S. sanctions, and the agreement would require participation from European regulators to reconnect it to SWIFT.\nThe U.S. has agreed to help Russia restore its \"access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports,\" according to aWhite House readout, including ports, \"payment systems,\" and reduced maritime insurance costs. The White House did not describe any clear benefits for Ukraine.\nAfter the announcement, Ukraine's defense minister said that the success of the deal requires Russia to keep its military vessels in the eastern half of the Black Sea, continuing the status quo. Ukraine's military has damaged, destroyed or sunk about one third of the Russian Black Sea Fleet using missiles and drones, and as a practical matter, Russia's surviving warships have been largely confined to the safety of the eastern half the sea since last year. If the Russian Navy uses the ceasefire to transit near Ukraine's shores again, Ukraine will have \"full right to exercise right to self-defense,\" said Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov.\nThe three sides are still working out the details of the deal, along with a parallel agreement to stop attacks on \"energy infrastructure.\" Russia has had considerable success in destroying Ukraine's electrical grid with drones and missiles; for its part, Ukraine has been makingstridesin long-range suicide drone technology, and has been targeting oil refineries and pipelines deep within Russian territory. In talks with the White House last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin secured a U.S. agreement for an energy infrastructure ceasefire, which would allow Russia's refining industry time to recover from thedamage.\nLong-range sea drone and aerial drone attacks have been Ukraine's primary areas of success in the conflict over the past year, and these operations would cease under the twin agreements. Russia has gained a strong upper hand in front-line ground combat, which was not addressed in the talks and will continue as before. Even though the deal favors Russia's comparative military strengths, Ukrainian leaders expressed little certainty that the Kremlin would adhere to the terms.\n\"The behavior of the Russian Federation in the coming days will show a lot, if not everything,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \"If there are air alarms again, if there is military activity in the Black Sea again, if there are Russian manipulations and threats again, then we will have to take new measures - specifically against Moscow.\"\nThe details remain under discussion, and a full-spectrum pause in the fighting appears unlikely in the near term. Russian diplomats told The Moscow Times this week that the Kremlin's negotiators have been instructed tostall for timein meetings with the U.S. side so that Russian troops can continue to take more Ukrainian territory. \"These guys know the Ukraine talks inside and out. They’ve been tasked with nitpicking every comma,\" one source told Moscow Times. In an interview Tuesday, President Trump acknowledged the possibility that Russian negotiators could be \"dragging their feet,\" and noted that he had used stalling tactics himself earlier in his business career.\n\"Things are unfolding more according to Russia’s scenario. Whether this [Black Sea limited ceasefire] will happen is still unclear,” Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent pro-Russian journal editor, told Moscow Times. \"But even if it’s implemented, it won’t directly change the situation on the battlefield, where the initiative currently belongs to Russia.\""

The vessel was theBITU River, a Panama-flagged bitumen tanker operated by Rubis Asphalt, a company that sources bitumen at the refinery and distributes it across West and Central Africa. At the time, no details were released on the status of the crew.\nFamily members speaking to Indian newspapers revealed the attack took place around 1930 on March 17 while the tanker was approximately 40 nautical miles southeast of Santo Antonio do Príncipe, on the island of Príncipe in the island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe off the west coast of Central Africa. The 15,500 dwt vessel had departed the anchorage at Lomé, Togo, and was proceeding to Douala in Cameroon.\nThe crew retreated into the vessel’s citadel and others hid in the engine room with family members saying they had lost contact with the crew at around 2330. The crew reportedly surrendered when the pirates forcefully breached the citadel and broke into the engine room. Earlier it was said the pirates were armed and there were reports of gunfire when they boarded the vessel.\nA total of 10 crewmembers were kidnapped from the vessel, including seven from India and three from Romania. The remaining crew were threatened with violence and confined to a cabin on the tanker. Before leaving the vessel, the pirates also stole personal belongings from the crew including gold, phones, and a laptop.\nThe families said the company informed them of the kidnappings the following day while assuring them the crewmembers were unharmed. The families are appealing to the Indian government citing the need for swift diplomatic efforts. The authorities have not commented further on the situation.\nMDAT-GoG said the company’s safety officer had advised that after the pirates left the vessel, it was proceeding to Libreville in Gabon for refuge. The tanker’s AIS signal shows that it arrived in the Owendo Anchorage in Gabon on March 18 where it remains."

By comparison, there are 166 containerships fueled by LNG currently in service.\nHMM ordered its first methanol vessels in February 2023 with seven to be built by HD Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries and two additional vessels at HJ Shipbuilding & Construction. The deliveries are coming this year as part of the company’s expansion and environmental plans.\nThe first ship, namedHMM Greenwas delivered and is due to arrive in Busan on March 26. The vessels are 100,000 dwt with a capacity of 9,000 TEU. Their length is 274 meters (899 feet), which HMM highlights as a versatile class of ships. To maximize their ability to dock in ports around the world the company highlights a range of environmental technologies that were incorporated into the design. In addition to the methanol-fueled propulsion system, the vessel is equipped for shore power and has a ballast water treatment system.\nHMM reports the new vessel will bunker with bio-methanol at the port of Shanghai. The bio-methanol is derived from waste resources. The company reports it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 65 percent, eliminate sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions, and cut nitrogen oxide (Nox) emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional bunker fuel.\nThe new vessel will be deployed on HMM’s independently operated route between Far East Asia, India, and the Mediterranean. It is part of a drive by the company which expects to reach the 1 million TEU capacity mark later this year. HMM is currently the eighth largest container carrier with a capacity of approximately 922,000 TEU."

        "content": "The UK’s Maritime Minister, Mike Kane, outlined a new detailed plan for the next stages of the efforts toward maritime decarbonization. While the policy presented to the House of Commons in Parliament builds off the efforts of the International Maritime Organization, it also launches a focus on smaller vessels and targeted subsectors which it says must also participate to reach the goals.\nThe policy highlights that the UK domestic maritime sector produced around eight million tonnes of CO2 equivalents, on a full lifecycle basis, in 2019. The government has already launched a sweeping Plan for Change and now it looks to bring more parts of the maritime sector in line with the broader policies. Following the IMO’s lead, the UK is setting its goal for the domestic maritime sector aiming for zero fuel lifecycle GHG emissions by 2050. The interim steps are at least a 30 percent reduction by 2030 and an 80 percent reduction by 2040, relative to 2008 levels.\nThe elements of the strategy call for expanding the UK’s Emission Trading Scheme to include domestic UK maritime GHG emissions starting in 2026. At the same time, the UK says it will advocate at the IMO for the introduction in 2027 of global emission pricing. As part of this, the government says subject to further consultation next year, it will introduce domestic fuel regulations to drive the update of zero and net-zero GHG emission fuels and energy sources. It will also consider further actions at the port vessel to reduce at berth emissions.\nThe UK also looks to expand its policies to smaller vessels, i.e. sub-400 gross tons. It points out that it will be difficult for some sectors such as fishing vessels while others such as offshore wind support vessels could lead the sector. The government is issuing a call for evidence to begin this policy development.\nThe government will also launch a further exploration of the efforts at the port level. It will look at whether ports are planning decarbonization and the strategies for wider environmental considerations.\nWhile recognizing that the efforts will be challenging for the sector, the government also cites opportunities for investment and creating new economic opportunities. They note that conservative estimates show that decarbonization of the UK maritime sector could support £130 to £180 million (US$168 to $233 million) of gross value added and around 1,400 to 2,100 jobs in the UK on average each year to 2050.\nThe UK Chamber of Shipping hailed the release of the new strategy saying it welcomed the Government’s publication of the Maritime Decarbonization Strategy, as a much-needed successor to the 2019 Clean Maritime Plan.\n“The Government’s strategy must now be matched by delivering the regulatory framework, technology and infrastructure, including a shore power revolution, required to support the green transition for UK maritime, bringing benefits to maritime communities and the UK economy,” said UK Chamber CEO Rhett Hatcher.  “We look forward to working collaboratively alongside government to progress this important agenda and reach our shared goals of a cleaner, more resilient maritime sector in the UK.”"

Previous research in the Baltic has documented that some observed jamming capabilities exceed commercial grade equipment, and can fool ship GNSS receivers into delivering inaccurate position readings - inaccurate enough to cause a casualty if the false reading went undetected by the crew. At least one accident, thegroundingof theMeghna Princessin the Baltic last year, has been attributed to GPS jamming.\n\"The safety of seafarers and shipping relies on the resilience of systems to support safe navigation and communication. Interference with Global Navigation Satellite Systems poses a serious risk to shipping activities, which could cause collisions and grounding. I urge all Member States to act to protect these critical systems,\" said IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez.\nIMO Maritime Safety Committee has previously urged member states to \"minimize interference coming from their territory,\" or at least issue warning notices to shipping about any planned time periods and areas affected by \"known interferences.\"\nSatellite signal jamming also affects airborne navigation, often at different times and locations than surface-level GNSS jamming, indicating different settings, techniques or equipment for high-altitude effects.\nSome of the most effective sources of intentional interference may be space-based, according to Professor Todd Humphreys of the University of Texas. Chinese and Russian satellite-based electronic warfare systems may be able to imitate GPS and Galileo from orbit, creating disruption by sending false signals when desired, he said at apanellast year."

It is part of a larger vision for the “Harbor of the Future” announced in 2024 that calls for increasing capacity in the Port of New York and creating a new “blue highway” for freight and commerce in the city.\nNYCEDC reports it is committed to redeveloping the terminal and container port. As a first step, it signed contracts for the removal of four out-of-service cranes across Piers 9A and 10, and the purchase of a new electric Ship-to-Shore (STS) crane to serve the Red Hook Container Terminal at Pier 10. Additionally, Pier 10 will receive crucial fender repairs to protect the pier from future vessel damage.\n“After decades of disinvestment and inaction, now the real work begins with an initial $18 million investment bringing this maritime port into the 21st century,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams. “This is a significant step forward for this 122-acre site and represents early signs of what’s to come as we reimagine the Brooklyn Marine Terminal to its full potential.”\nIn May 2024, the mayor along with New York Governor Kathy Hochulmapped the future visionincluding an initial $95 million investment by the state and city. NYCEDC now is spending an initial $18 million. This includes $15 million for a new electric STS crane, $2 million for fender repairs to Pier 10, and $1 million for the demolition and removal of four out-of-service cranes.\nDemolition and removal of the four out-of-service cranes will take place from April to August 2025 by Atlantic Coast Dismantling (ACD). The two cranes on Pier 9A are diesel-operated, over 50 years old, and are inaccessible due to the unstable condition of Pier 9A. The two cranes on Pier 10 that will be removed were damaged during superstorm Sandy, a near hurricane-force storm that hit the area in October 2012. The removal of these cranes will provide space for a new electric crane and the 3,000 tons of steel from the four removed cranes will be recycled by ACD.\nLiebherr USA has been contracted to deliver the new all-electric ship-to-shore crane to serve the Red Hook Container Terminal at Pier 10. The crane will be designed, manufactured, and delivered from Irish-based Liebherr Container Cranes, taking approximately two years, making the new crane operational in Spring 2027. Pier 10 is also receiving a fender, fender pile, and chock and wale repairs and replacement to ensure the longevity of Pier 10 and protect the physical integrity of the pier from berthing ships and barges, repairs are anticipated to go from May to September 2025.\n“After decades of decay and disinvestment at the Brooklyn Marine Terminal, these contracts are a small but meaningful step toward delivering a modern, all-electric, maritime port that activates our Blue Highway network and advances New York City's Harbor of the Future,” said NYCEDC President & CEO Andrew Kimball.\nNYCEDC reports that over the past eight months, it has regularly engaged with the task force, advisory groups, and the community to build a shared vision for this site.\n“In the last nine months, NYCEDC has done more for this port than has been done for the last several decades,” said Red Hook Container Terminal President Mike Stamatis.\nIn the coming weeks, the Brooklyn Marine Terminal Task Force will vote on a Vision Plan outlining the future of the site, which will include reinvestment for a modernized maritime port and a vibrant mixed-use community to serve Red Hook and Columbia Street Waterfront District."

        "content": "A Taiwanese warship collided shortly after midnight local time on March 27 with a Chinese fishing trawler. The Navy Fleet Command issued a statement saying that no one was injured but it is the latest incident as Taiwan remains on high alert to Chinese incursions.\nThe Navy confirmed that one of its Chung Ho class tank landing ships (8,800 displacement tons) had made contact with the Chinese vesselMinlianyu 61756. It happened in a position 45 nautical miles away from Taichung on the northwestern shore of Taiwan. The statement said the vessels were nine nautical miles outside “restricted waters.”\nThe Coast Guard was immediately dispatched to investigate the situation and collect evidence. The Navy reports that the damaged part of the ship did not affect navigation safety.\nThe vessel which the Navy referred to as a Zhonghe-class tank landing ship is mainly responsible for carrying, transporting, and unloading Marine personnel, equipment, supplies and supporting amphibious assault missions. It is 561 feet (171 meters) in length with a reported top speed of 20 knots. They are armed with a 40mm gun and a Phalanx rapid-fire gun. The Navy did not say what the vessel was doing when it hit the fishing trawler.\nChinese fishing boats have frequently encroached on areas Taiwan said are sovereign and restricted. Speculation in the media raised the question of whether the fishing boat was being used to spy on the Navy’s vessels and their movements.\nA spokesperson from the PRC Defense Ministry said they needed further understanding of the incident to address questions. She however also dismissed the “malicious speculation” over the incident. A spokesperson from China’s state council condemned the “vile behavior” of Taiwan while saying they were investigating the incident.\nTaiwan reported at the beginning of the year it was increasing its efforts to track suspect vessels that were loitering off Taiwan as well as Chinese-owned foreign-registered vessels. There have been a few incidents in the area in recent years involving fishing boats.\nThis year Taiwan however has accused smaller Chinese-owned cargo ships of damaging undersea cables. Earlier this month Taiwan also chased away a Chinese research vessel which was seen deploying instruments in a restricted area of the sea. Earlier this week Taiwan detained a Chinese fuel barge it referred to as a “three nos” meaning it did not have a name, home port, or registration documentation. The Navy has said it is using its systems to identify and track vessels and would work with the Coast Guard to stop and search suspect vessels.\n"

        "content": "\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has determined the cause of an STS crane allision at North Charleston Terminal last year. A towboat mate failed to consider the horizontal extent of the STS crane when he made passing arrangements with a dredge in the channel, and his chosen course put his tow - a tall crane barge - in contact with the STS crane's lowered boom.\nOn the afternoon of January 4, 2024, the towboatRoyal Engineerand the crane bargeStevens 1471got under way from a terminal on the Cooper River for a berth at the Pierside Docks, a short three-hour trip downriver on the other side of the North Charleston Terminal. The crane was lowered, but its upper mast extended about 145 feet above deck level.\nAsRoyal Engineerapproached North Charleston Terminal, its passage was blocked by the dredgerBrunswick, which was working on dredging out the bottom just a few hundred feet off the terminal's pier. The dredge's floating discharge pipeline extended all the way across to the opposite side of the river, and was temporarily blocking all of the navigation channel. The only options for safe passage were to ask the dredge crew to stop work and move their floating pipeline so that traffic could get by, or to go through a narrow slot between the dredger and the pier, where the terminal's cranes were working cargo.\nRoyal Engineer'smate had the watch, and he contactedBrunswickabout an hour out to make timely passing arrangements. He planned to ask the dredger crew to move their pipeline and wanted to give them enough advance notice. TheBrunswickdid not respond to two calls.\nAt 1605,Royal EngineerapproachedBrunswick'swork area. A large boxship was moored at the terminal and an STS crane boom was lowered to move containers. The boom extended about 200 feet out over the channel, 100 feet beyond the beam of the boxship.\nAt this point,Royal Engineer'smate was able to reachBrunswick'scaptain over VHF, and he asked him to move the pipeline. The dredger's captain declined because his crew was busy and he already had his crew on a task and would \"have to stop them to go do something else.\" Instead, he suggested thatRoyal Engineercould safely go through the 300-foot slot betweenBrunswickand the pier, and he offered to turn the dredger to make this possible.\nRoyal Engineer'smate accepted this arrangement. Considering the narrowness of the gap, he posted a deckhand to watch for obstructions. He did not consider the barge's air draft and the STS crane's reach out into the channel until he began to passBrunswick. The deckhand thought it would clear, but he was mistaken. The mate reversed engines too late to avoid contact.\nThe STS crane operator was in his control booth aloft and was in harm's way. He saw the hazard coming and sounded his warning horn moments before impact, then braced himself. Immediately after, he fled the operator's cabin and ran down a ladderway to the pier.\nThe STS crane stayed upright, and even had enough strength to stopRoyal Engineer/Stevens 1471'sforward momentum.Royal Engineer'smate reversed away from the crane; theBrunswickdisconnected its dredge line and left the area in case the STS crane were to collapse; and the boxship got under way, headed away from the terminal.\nThe STS crane was badly damaged, and was determined to be structurally unstable. Torqued like a screw by impact at the far end of its boom, the STS crane's vertical frame was twisted, the gantry assemblies were \"wrecked,\" and the base was rotated off its rails. Remarkably, it was repairable, and it was restored within a year and put back into service. The overall cost of the repair came to just $4.5 million, and was the only significant charge; the crane onStevens 1471was virtually undamaged.\nNTSB concluded that the root cause was the towboat mate's failure to identify the STS crane as an overhead hazard.\n\"Ship-to-shore cranes, when conducting cargo operations on a vessel and in the lowered position, may extend considerably beyond the side of the vessel and become a hazard to vessels with high air drafts transiting nearby. Mariners should always consider their vessel and tow’s air draft when identifying hazards to navigation,\" NTSB advised."

        "content": "\nTwo years after previewing the Sea Zero project to develop the world’s most energy-efficient cruise ship, Hurtigruten and its partners report the design has been refined through a series of model tests. Hurtigruten wants to design a ship that can sail without emissions in normal operation on the Norwegian coast from around 2030.\nThe project reports it completed a new phase of rigorous testing using digital simulations and physical trials in Trondheim, at the Norwegian research institute SINTEF Ocean’s facilities. In addition, Vard Design, DNV, Brunvoll, Plug, Corvus Enegery, and others are also participating in the project. Involving the partners, the recent testing worked to evaluate large battery packs, retractable sails, air lubrication systems, contra-rotating propellers, and an energy-optimized hull.\n“We are learning a lot from these tests, and we now see that many of the ambitious goals in this project can also be implemented in practice,” said Gerry Larsson-Fedde, Chief Operating Officer at Hurtigruten.\nFollowing months of design work and testing, they report theship designhas been further refined. The ship is now eight meters longer (143.5 meters/471 feet total) and slightly wider than earlier versions of the concept. The height has also been reduced by one deck to among other things provide better stability. The design has been reduced from three to two retractable solar sails.\n\n\nModel testing is helping to refine the design (Hurtigruten)\n\nThe Sea Zero concept aims to cut energy between 40-50 percent compared to today’s ships. The companies report that the sails alone could reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent. With that reduction, they report that batteries charged with shore power connectivity in key ports could make emission-free operations possible.\"With the reduction in energy use we’re aiming for, it’s realistic to fit a battery system with enough energy to allow the ship to sail between charging ports under normal weather conditions,\" said Trond Johnsen, Project Manager for Sea Zero.\nCommitted to setting a higher standard for more sustainable travel initiatives, Hurtigruten highlights that its fleet currently includes four battery-hybrid powered ships, while it also prioritizes energy efficiency and responsible waste management. Through the ambitious Sea Zero project, Hurtigruten aims to develop its first ship that can sail emissions-free in normal operations on the Norwegian coast and in response to Norway’s tightening regulations for shipping emissions.\nNorway’s Parliament last yearfinalized rulessetting a phased-in schedule to move coastal shipping and vessels operating in the fjords to zero emissions. Cruise ships and ferries under 10,000 gross tons will have to operate with zero emissions by January 1, 2026. For the large ships, the implementation is scheduled for January 1, 2032."

        "content": "\nWhile it is only a little more than a month since the new alliances began to integrate into the operations of container shipping, the first results show the new organization has the potential to dramatically reshape the competition among carriers. Overall, the sector has struggled to claw back its schedule reliability after the surge in volumes and port congestion during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but according to new data from Sea-Intelligence, the new alliances have the potential to dramatically reshape the industry.\nMaersk and Hapag-Lloyd detailed a new model for their primary routes which will be operating in the new Gemini Cooperation. They highlighted a new approach wither fewer ports for the larger vessels being fed by more regional operations saying that the goal was to achieve at least 90 percent schedule reliability. Gemini has expressed confidence that as it rolls out and demonstrates the success of its strategy shippers will be willing to pay higher costs for the certainty that they can offer.\nFor all of 2024, the sector struggled to break out of a range in the low to mid-50 percent schedule reliability. Sea-Intelligence calculates the industry overall across 34 different trade lanes averaging just 53 percent schedule reliability. This was down nine percentage points from 2023 or 15 percent.\nThe report highlights that 2025 was following the same overall pattern. The average for the more than 60 carriers operating in the sector remained at 53 percent for the first two months of the year.\nGemini began its rollout on February 1 and the new Premier Alliance also began its rollout, while the former 2M between Maersk and MSC is winding down and the former The Alliance was reformulated with the departure of Hapag-Lloyd. In addition, MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, after amassing a strong lead in the number of vessels and capacity is mostly going it alone.\nSea-Intelligence calculates for February the Gemini Cooperation recorded 94.0 percent schedule reliability in origin ports in February 2025 for its first voyages, followed by MSC at 79.6 percent, and Premier Alliance at 60.4 percent. Ocean Alliance recorded 54.1 percent schedule reliability, while the outgoing THE Alliance scored 45.3 percent, and 2M achieved 44.2 percent.\n“It is important to stress that the new alliances are just in the beginning phase of their network roll-out, and they will only be fully rolled out in July 2025, and only then will it be possible to truly evaluate their performance. It is nevertheless an interesting data point, to see how they have performed on the initial origin arrivals,” said Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence.\nThe traditional February data further highlighted how the alliances are poised to reshape the sector. While global schedule reliability improved by 3.6 percentage points month over month, it was at only 54.9 percent for the sector. Murphy notes that it was the highest level recorded since May 2024 and that on a year-over-year basis, February 2025 was higher by 1.8 percentage points.\nOn a standalone basis for all its services, Maersk was the most reliable of the top-13 carriers in February 2025. It achieved a schedule reliability of 60.2 percent. MSC followed at 57.4 percent and Hapag-Lloyd at 57.3 percent.\nMaersk and Hapag-Lloyd in their financial reports highlighted forecasts for a down year in 2025 after strong results in 2024. Schedule reliability is poised to become an important selling tool for the alliances as they seek new competitive advances in what promises to be a challenging year."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAmerica's offshore vessel operators are pleased with the White House's proposal for steep fees on Chinese ships, and they would like the administration to go one step further - with a daily tax on Chinese-built vessels operating in U.S. waters.\nDespite the protections of the Jones Act for American shipping, the offshore vessel services industry is still exposed to low-cost foreign competition for certain tasks. Depending on the specifics of the work, a foreign offshore service vessel may not be covered by the Jones Act in U.S. waters. Crane ships, offshore wind turbine installation vessels, survey ships and other specialty service vessels can often compete for work on the U.S. continental shelf, so long as they do not move cargo between U.S. points. The definitions of \"move,\" \"cargo\" and \"U.S. points\" are often disputed, but foreign operators still regularly win charters for work in U.S. waters.\nLast month, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) announced a plan to impose steep multimillion-dollar charges on Chinese-owned and Chinese-built vessels for calls at American seaports - but the fees are only assessed once per visit, and only in port. Under USTR's fee structure, a Chinese-made offshore vessel could still work in U.S. waters without paying anything, so long as it avoided American port calls.\nTo offset the cost advantages of these foreign-built, foreign-crewed vessels, the Offshore Marine Services Association (OMSA) has asked USTR to include offshore work in its proposed schedule of fees for Chinese-built vessels.\n\"OMSA respectfully requests that the proposed actions be amended so that the service fees accrue on a daily basis for Chinese-built vessels working in U.S. sovereign waters on U.S. offshore energy projects. This clarification to the USTR proposed remedies will adequately ensure that the actions fully account for the harm that is being promulgated by Chinese-built vessels to U.S. shipyards, vessel owners, mariners, and other workers that engage or attempt to engage in U.S. offshore energy projects,\" said OMSA President and CEO Aaron Smith.\nSmith suggested that Chinese-built offshore vessels could easily be assessed a daily fee based on AIS data records showing their time in U.S. waters, or on their Coast Guard notice of arrival and departure paperwork. This would affect at least 10 foreign ships that have worked in the U.S. offshore wind industry, representing some the largest and most important foreign-flag competitors that U.S. service providers face in the sector.\n\"These vessels are coming into U.S. waters and staying—sometimes for years at a time—all the while taking opportunities from U.S. ships and shipyards,\" testified Smith.\nHe singled out one particular vessel as an example: Cadeler's brand new WTIV Wind Pace. The 20 MW-capable vessel formally delivered on Wednesday at COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry in Qidong, and will soon get under way for its maiden voyage to the U.S. East Coast. Wind Pace is a cutting-edge ship and is expected to outcompete previous generations of WTIVs on capacity, transit speed and efficiency, according to Cadeler. On arrival in U.S. waters, it will begin a long-term installation contract worth about $70-80 million - revenue that U.S. shipowners will not get.\nThe low, subsidized price of Chinese ships hurts American domestic competitors, but the sub-$100-per-day pay scale for foreign seafarers can be even more of a challenge, Smith said.\n\"U.S. offshore energy vessel owners can simply not compete with their foreign competitors because current U.S. law requires U.S.-owned companies to hire only U.S. citizens and permanent residents as mariners when its vessels work on U.S. offshore energy projects,\" said Smith. \"Conversely, U.S. law allows foreign-owned vessels to employ foreign mariners when conducting the same work. As foreign mariners command significantly less pay than their U.S. counterparts this gives foreign-crewed vessels a significant cost advantage.\""

        "content": "The troubled U.S. effort to build a new generation of Polar Security Cutters received an important boost with the U.S. Coast Guard awarding a $951.6 million contract modification to Bollinger Shipyards. The program has struggled to move forward with years of design delays and cost overruns with the builders now asserting that the project is on a solid path forward.\nThe shipyard reports it received the modification which advances the Detail Design and Construction phase of the first of the three vessels. They report it was structured as a Fixed-Price-Incentive-Firm Target (FPIF) contract modification reflecting the efforts to get the project on track. Congressional members and the independent Congressional Budget Office have been very critical of the project and poor management and organization. The failures of the project were cited among the reasons that the Trump administration dismissed Admiral Linda Fagan as Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard on the president’s first day in office in January.\n“Securing this contract modification has truly been a Herculean effort and underscores the incredible trust the U.S. Government has placed in Bollinger to build and deliver the first heavy polar icebreaker in half a century,” said Ben Bordelon, President and CEO of Bollinger Shipyards. He recognized the issues in the project saying, “hard work and dedication have successfully put the PSC program on a strong path forward after a rocky start under the previous, foreign-owned builder. We now look forward to receiving the green light to begin full production.”\nBollinger took over the project in 2022 when it acquired the VT Halter shipyard. A Congressional report found that the project which had begun in 2014 was deeply flawed with significant design issues with the vessel which it said Bollinger was working to address.\nSince acquiring the shipyard, Bollinger highlights that it has increased its Mississippi workforce by over 61 percent. Further, it says that production rolls at the Mississippi shipyard group have increased by more than 178 percent. It expects to continue to increase these roles as the project moves forward. The current contract modification primarily supports operations at Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding, with additional project contributions from facilities located in Massachusetts, Illinois, Virginia, Georgia, Louisiana, and other regions.\nBollinger now reports that completion of the first Polar Security Cutter is anticipated by May 2030. That places the project six years behind the originally anticipated schedule. The Congressional report on the project acknowledged the complexity of the project and the difficulties associated with building a heavy icebreaker and recognized that it was 50 years since the U.S. had built such a vessel.\nPoor organization and design issues were cited as key contributors to the cost overruns. Earlier estimates set the projected cost at $1.3 billion for the first vessel but the latest Congressional estimate targeted $1.9 billion, a nearly 40 percent increase over the Coast Guard’s projections. They however expected the project would realize cost synergies for the second and third vessels which CBO set at $1.6 billion each. The total cost for the project was last estimated at over $5 billion.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has been forced to scramble with life extension programs to keep its only large icebreakers in operation. It currently depends on thePolar Starwhich was commissioned in 1976, and recently marked its 49th mission to Antarctica.Healy, commissioned in 1999, had one of its engines replaced due to a failure and this year was temporarily sidelined by an engine room fire. Stretched to maintain the mission, the USCG acquired from Edison Chouest Offshore a polar class 3 icebreaker built in 2012 as an icebreaking anchor-handler. She will enter service by 2026 as the USCGCStoris.\nThe USCG and the Navy Integrated Program Office received approval in December 2024 to begin building the first of the new icebreakers, which will be calledPolar Sentinel. Bollinger in 2023 cut steel for a series of up to eight prototype modules as it sought to demonstrate the capabilities and advance the project. The contract modifications are an important step while Congressional members said it was also a sign of the urgency placed on the project."

        "content": "\nRussia's top diplomat said Wednesday that the U.S. could be willing to help Gazprom restart its giant subsea pipelines to Western Europe, which would slash energy costs in Europe and make U.S. LNG less competitive on the EU market. Gazprom's giant Nord Stream system has been shut down since 2022, but if repaired and restored to full service, it has the capacity to supply nearly a third of all EU demand.\n\"There is talk about Nord Stream. It will probably be interesting if the Americans use their influence on Europe and force it not to refuse Russian gas,\" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\nRussian pipeline gas is by far the cheapest natural gas source for Northern Europe, and its return would be welcomed by some European industrialists. When Russia invaded Ukraine and the EU responded with sanctions, Gazprom effectively cut off subsea and terrestrial pipeline gas deliveries to Western Europe - ending long-term contractual relationships that had existed since the Soviet era and hiking EU gas prices overnight.\nPoliticoreports that the concept under discussion would be to have an American operator buy the Nordstream system's pipeline infrastructure. To do this transaction legally would likely require lifting or waiving sanctions on Gazprom and Nord Stream 2. The American pipeline operator would then serve as a middleman, taking gas from Russia and selling it to European utilities.\nOne Nord Stream 2 pipeline is serviceable and could likely start if it gained European authorization, a politically difficult change. To reach full system capacity, the other three lines would have to be repaired to fix damage from a 2022 sabotage attack.\nIn his interview, Lavrov noted that U.S. businesses currently have an edge over Europe on energy costs because of low U.S. natural gas prices. He noted that most top EU leaders are firmly against resuming imports of cheap Russian gas; if Nord Stream were restarted with American involvement, it would lower the EU's energy costs and help European firms better compete with American industry.\nLess profitability for U.S. LNG\nWhen Gazprom cut off its supply to Western Europe in mid-2022, the EU replaced Russian volumes by buying more LNG from big suppliers, notably the United States. European sales have powered the U.S. LNG industry's growth: In 2022 and 2023, the U.S. was Europe's biggest LNG supplier, averaging about eight billion cubic feet per day. Europe bought more than half of all U.S. LNG exports last year, up from zero in 2015, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nIf cheap Russian pipeline gas returned to Europe at scale via the Nord Stream pipeline system, Russia would retake market share and regain its place as Europe's largest gas supplier, according to Dutch commercial bankING. Inexpensive Russian supply would cut EU gas market prices in half: European wholesale gas would likely plummet from $14 per MMbtu to about $6 per MMbtu, the minimum cost of production at American LNG plans."

        "content": "A new project launched by a consortium of Dutch companies and supported by the government is focusing on what they are calling the world’s first zero-emission general cargo ship powered by liquid hydrogen. According to the project organizers, this initiative is a key pillar of the Maritime Masterplan, setting a new standard for decarbonizing European maritime logistics.\nThe project which is being led by the Dutch Innovation Company (Nederlandse Innovatie Maatschappij or NIM) focuses on designing, constructing, and demonstrating a hydrogen-powered cargo vessel that will operate in the North Sea and beyond. Managed by Van Dam Shipping, the ship is designed to transport bulk goods, eliminating harmful emissions and redefining the future of sustainable shipping.\n“By integrating hydrogen technology with digital innovation, we are proving that zero-emission shipping is not just a vision—it is an achievable reality,” says Sander Roosjen, CTO at NIM.\nAt the heart of the H2ESTIA Project is its integrated approach to hydrogen-powered propulsion. The vessel will be equipped with a newly designed cryogenic hydrogen storage and bunkering system, enabling safe handling and storage of liquid hydrogen at extremely low temperatures. A hydrogen fuel cell system together with batteries will provide primary propulsion, delivering clean power.\nTo further enhance energy efficiency, the ship will incorporate wind-assisted propulsion and waste heat recovery solutions, reducing hydrogen consumption. Digital twin technology will create a virtual model of the ship, allowing for real-time monitoring, operational optimization, and enhanced safety measures.\nThe project the organizers said is set to demonstrate technological readiness and economic viability, ensuring such vessels can be commercially deployed. It also addresses major challenges such as the certification of hydrogen systems, risk management, and crew training, paving the way for the safe integration of hydrogen technology into maritime operations.\nThe H2ESTIA Project is supported by a consortium of leading maritime and technology firms, TNO, MARIN, the University of Twente, Cryovat, EnginX, Encontech, classification society RINA, and the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management."

        "content": "\nU.S. auto tariffs are taking a toll on the outlook for many foreign automakers, but are also having an effect on the companies that carry their goods to market - the pure car and truck carrier (PCTC) ro/ro operators.\nShare prices for the publicly-traded car carrier owners have taken a dive since the White House announced new 25 percent tariffs on Wednesday. Hoegh has fallen 10 percent since the start of the week; K Line is down by four percent; Wallenius Wilhelmsen is down nine percent; and Hyundai Glovis is down by nearly 10 percent. These firms have had solid financial success over the past few years thanks to booming exports out of China, but a contraction in the U.S. import market could weigh heavily on their prospects.\nTrade data shows that automakers appear to have anticipated new tariffs and frontloaded their shipments in the first quarter of 2025. According to ship tracking firm Esgian, five extra ro-ro shipments departed Europe for the U.S. in February, and eight extra out of East Asia in January (compared to the same periods last year).\nThe tariff threat would primarily affect seaborne trade lanes out of South Korea, Japan and Europe, the primary overseas sources of U.S. autos. China sells relatively few complete cars into the U.S. market, capturing a market share of less than two percent, and will be less affected by U.S. auto tariffs.\nBut foreign PCTC owners still have a tough road ahead in the Chinese market. The world's leading car exporter is building its own national car-carrier fleet to compete with longtime industry incumbents. According to Li Gang, Communist Party committee chair for China Citic Financial Leasing, the \"national vehicles and national transport\" strategy will reduce shipping costs and ensure capacity for Chinese automakers."

The South China Morning Post and Chinese-controlled newspapers are reporting that the target date of April 2 for the signing of definitive documentation will not proceed but also said this does not mean the deal is canceled.\nChinese officials later confirmed that the State Administration for Market Regulation would be reviewing the transaction. The South China Morning Post reports that the officials said the review was to “ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interests.” Bloomberg adds that the review will be looking for potential security or antitrust violations.\nHutchison on March 4 announced that it had reached principal agreements with a consortium of U.S.-led BlackRock and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company’s TiL group which owns and operates terminals. The total deal valued at $23 billion is for the sale of 80 percent interest in the 43 ports in 23 countries outside China operated by CK Hutchison. In a parallel agreement, Hutchison said it would sell 90 percent interest in the Panama company that operates the terminals in Balboa and Cristobal, Panama at each terminus of the Panama Canal.\nHutchison said that “fundamental and essential terms” of the two transactions had been agreed in principle, subject to definitive documentation. It reported that the definitive documentation for the Panama portion of the transaction was expected to be signed on or before April 2. It also entered into exclusive negotiation and non-disclosure arrangements with the BlackRock-TiL consortium.\nChinese officials reacted negatively to the news of the sale as they saw it as U.S. intervention and worried about threats to Chinese shipping and trade. According to the media reports, China has been increasing the pressure on CK Hutchison including reports this week that the government had ordered that there be no new deals with Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire who controls Hutchison, and his family.\nPanama which has also been under pressure from the United States announced that it would be reviewing the transaction. Previously Panama had moved to review the contract with Hutchison and the Panama government filed notice that it was withdrawing from China’s Belt & Road initiative.\nMedia reports in Asia suggested that behind-the-scenes talks were happening between the company and government officials in Hong Kong. Hutchison has declined to make public comments and also canceled a planned briefing with investors after its year-end financial report.\nTrump has hailed the deal for the Panama ports and took credit with BlackRock for making it happen. MSC has remained quiet about the deal letting BlackRock be the center of attention in the media reporting on the transaction."

        "content": "\nThe shipping industry faces its worst shortage  of crewmembers in nearly two decades, and could be 90,000 people short by next year. The Global Maritime Forum's \"All Aboard\" consortium has conducted extensive research on methods to improve life at sea and boost retention, and it has just released a report on real-world changes that could make the difference.\nSeafaring can be a hard life, and there have always been aspects that shoreside workers would find challenging, like fatigue, months-long work schedules, and (on some vessels) abusive work environments. Shipping has always had a certain amount of hazing and harassment under way, out of sight of the home office; the All Aboard Alliance found that this cultural phenomenon is a modern-day retention issue. 25 percent of study participants had experienced harassment and bullying in their careers, rising to more than 50 percent among female seafarers.\nWorking with 12 shipowners, the alliance came up with guidance to improve the crew experience, especially in abuse reduction. A positive work environment starts with setting clear policies and guidelines, then requires \"zero-tolerance\" enforcement for unacceptable behavior, the alliance advises.\nThe coalition also recommends clear guidelines for training and performance evaluations; avoiding discriminatory hiring practices; providing female-appropriate PPE and facilities on board; setting up a family leave policy; improving shore leave, a common point of friction since the COVID era; building onboard community; and providing timely relief at the end of a seafarer's contract, without involuntary extensions. The alliance advises a target of offboarding at least 85 percent of the crew on schedule at contract end, allowing them predictable time off for their personal lives.\n\"These guidelines serve as a roadmap for shipping companies striving to improve employee well-being, and will also help seafarers and other stakeholders identify companies that take sustainability and social responsibility seriously. They strike a strong balance between aspiration and realism, and we’re confident that they will improve outcomes for all workers in the maritime industry, ensuring that success is accessible to everyone — regardless of gender, race, sexuality, or background,\" said Mikael Skov, Chief Executive Officer at Hafnia and All Aboard Alliance Co-chair.\nThese inclusive, diversity-friendly HR policies may not be easy everywhere. Some overseas companies openly discriminate against female seafarers in hiring, or only hire personnel of certain nationalities, according to the study - and even for well-resourced Western companies, it can be hard to uphold \"zero-tolerance\" deterrence policies. Maersk, the number-two ocean carrier, has had torehireat least one officer who was previously dismissed for sexual harassment, and has noted that sexual offenders can return to work in its U.S. market. It will not provide numbers on the extent of any onboard abuse in its fleet, according to Danish business paperBerlingske."

It was done as part of a campaign by the well-known group against fossil fuels and the EU’s lack of progress on ending Russian and other gas imports.\nThe campaigners are urging Europe to become energy independent by transitioning to renewables. They said ending fossil gas imports is crucial for safety and security.\nThe group in its inflatable boats and supported by its mothershipArctic Sunrisefirst targeted the Marshall Islands-registered gas carrierMarvel Swallow. The 93,510 dwt vessel was recently placed in service by Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. It was coming from Louisiana in the United States with a shipment of gas bound for Zeebrugge, Belgium.\nThe group circled and ran alongside the gas carrier displaying banners for the photo ops. Among the banners they were displaying were ones reading “Their gas, your cash.” The group reports it briefly interrupted the voyage of the gas carrier but it later docked in Belgium.\n“Autocrats like Putin fund their wars with gas revenues, while political bullies like Trump use their dominance as gas suppliers to pressure European countries economically and politically. Meanwhile, families and communities struggle with soaring energy bills and extreme weather fueled by fossil gas,” said Joeri Thijs, spokesperson for Greenpeace Belgium speaking from aboard Arctic Sunrise. “This dependence leaves us all vulnerable. Energy sovereignty through renewables is no longer just an environmental necessity, it is a matter of security.”\nGreenpeace cited data from IEEFA (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis saying despite promises from EU politicians gas imports from Russia grew 18 percent in 2024 with the EU spending €21.9 billion on gas. It reports 45 percent of Europe’s gas supply is coming from the U.S. making America Europe’s largest supplier.\nHours later the group returned to the waterways targeting the Cyprus-flaggedFedor Litke. The 96,839 dwt gas carrier was inbound for Sabetta, Russia. It is operated by Dynagas of Greece.\nThe second protest was to call attention to the new EU sanctions implemented on March 26 that aim to restrict Russian gas imports. Greenpeace highlights that one of the goals is to stop carriers such as theFedor Litkecoming from Siberia and transferring gas at either Zeebrugge or Montoir-de-Bretagne, France as part of a transshipment program to deliver gas across Europe.\nThe group which is well known for these activities asserts the EU must stop the persistent delays in phasing out Russian fossil fuels imports. They note EU officials under pressure from Donald Trump are considering increasing US LNG imports.\nWith Europe’s LNG imports declining and gas demand down 20 percent since 2021, Greenpeace says the EU must accelerate its shift away from gas imports. Greenpeace is urging a full phase-out of fossil gas by 2035 and a commitment to clean, independent energy."

The rare deployment of seven B-2 stealth bombers at this remote airfield - a third of the entire inventory - has raised speculation about possible escalation against Houthi targets, or even against their sponsors in Iran.

        "content": "The United States is continuing its “maximum pressure” against the Iranian oil industry reporting it has filed a new civil forfeiture in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. to seize $47 million from the proceeds of oil sales. It is part of a long-running campaign by the U.S. targeting Triliance Petrochemical Co., a Hong Kong-based broker with branches in Iran, the United Arab Emirates, China, and Germany, that the U.S. says is a well-known Iranian front company supporting the Iranian regime’s petrochemical industry.\nTriliance was first sanctioned by the United States in January 2020 on charges that it helps to finance Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) and its terrorist proxies. The U.S. said it had traced transactions in 2019 shipping oil to the UAE and China and transferring millions of dollars to Iran from the sale of oil which Trilance worked to conceal the Iranian origin of these products.\nToday’s suit details an elaborate scheme between 2022 and 2024 to facilitate the shipment, storage, and sale of Iranian petroleum products. U.S. prosecutors contend Iran was working to increase the marketability of Iranian oil in Europe and create future demand from European buyers.\nU.S. Attorney Edward Martin said the suit was to show Iran that avoiding sanctions “is not as easy as playing a shell game with tankers.” The filing alleges in January 2022 Iran loaded approximately one million barrels of oil to a tanker that would later be sanctioned by the U.S.\nAfter leaving Iran, the U.S. traced the oil including through three ship-to-ship transfers before it was offloaded for storage in Croatia. The U.S. alleges companies working with Triliance falsified documents and manipulated tanker AIS signals to conceal the origins and claim the oil came from Malaysia. Further, it is alleged that the facilitators paid the storage fees in U.S. dollars through U.S. financial institutions that would have refused the transactions had they known they were associated with Iranian oil. The oil was ultimately sold with the U.S. reporting proceeds of $47 million which the U.S. is moving to seize.\nIt is not the first time the U.S. has targeted Trilance and the proceeds of sales. In November 2024, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., ordered the forfeiture of nearly $12 million connected with Triliance. Government lawyers highlighted a series of transactions and money transfers in 2020 linked to Triliance. In 2022, the U.S. had also gone after oil producers that it said were working with Triliance.\n"

The company obtained Approval in Principle (AiP) from ClassNK for the design of liquified CO2 carriers as well as the floating liquified storage facility that would work in conjunction with the vessels.\nWhile CCSU is expected to play a role in achieving carbon neutrality, the companies highlight that significant challenges remain to develop large-scale operations and lower the costs associated with the process. They highlight the issues that need to be addressed in developing the operations, including reducing overall costs and securing land for liquefaction and storage facilities.\nThe joint venture company was launched by Knutsen and NYK in January 2022 focusing on the commercial development of a liquefied CO2 marine transportation and storage business. To address the challenges, they are focusing on using the elevated pressure (EP) method to store and transport liquefied carbon dioxide (LCO2) at ambient temperature. Coupled with the vessels is the terminal concept with the companies saying by utilizing an FLSU (Floating Liquefied Storage Unit), the cost of CO2 liquefaction and the land area required onshore in the CCUS value chain can be reduced, expanding the possibilities for realizing CCUS.\nClassNK has carried out a design review of the ship which would use LCO2-EP Cargo Tank technology developed by Knutsen to transport LCO2 in a stable state. Since there is no need to cool LCO2 to cryogenic temperatures, Knutsen says it is easy to handle and potentially reduces energy and costs during liquefaction. It reports the LCO2-EP Cargo Tank has been developed to transport LCO2 at ambient temperatures and elevated pressures (0 to 10 degC / 34 to 45 barG). The companies reporting in December 2024 that theconstruction studieshad started for the vessel.\nNYK and KNCC also worked with ENEOS Xplora in developing the FLSU concept that combines the LCO2-EP Cargo Tank technology with the Isenthalpic Expansion Cooling & Liquefaction Process. According to the companies, this process has been researched and developed in collaboration among the three companies while ClassNK issued an AiP following a review.\nThey call the FLSU a pioneering concept explaining that it liquefies and temporarily stores CO2 that has been collected and transported as gas in an onshore facility making it ready for further transport by LCO2 carrier. By utilizing the features of the EP method, which has the potential to reduce the energy required for liquefaction, and adopting the process, which is expected to be simpler and more compact than conventional cooling methods, it has become possible to install a liquefaction plant on a floating structure.\nDevelopment of the concepts comes as the first commercial CO2 transport and storage operations, Northern Lights a joint venture between Shell, Equinor, and TotalEnergies is set to start operations this summer. It has taken delivery of two dedicated LCO2 carriers and today, March 27, reported it has also decided to proceed with an expansion raising capacity from 1.5 million to a minimum of 5 million tonnes of CO2 per year.\nOther projects are moving forward with both the UK and Denmark reporting a strong response to their offering potential storage sights. Royal Wandborg also reports it has reached a milestone in the construction of its EasyMax CO2 carrier as the hull sections are being assembled. It will be the first CO2 carrier built in Europe to serve the growing potential market."

        "content": "After an extended pressure campaign from the United States and activist groups such as UANI (United Against Nuclear Iran) the Panama Maritime Authority is poised to purge its registry of sanctioned tankers. Bloomberg is citing comments by the General Director of Merchant Maine for PMA, Ramon Franco made during a conference in Singapore.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Panama is poised to remove 128 ships from its registry. They are ships sanctioned by the U.S. or its allies. The new Trump administration has been moving to expand the sanctions against tankers in the Iranian trade following a sweeping move in the last days of the Biden administration targeting the shadow tanker fleet moving Russian oil and gas.\nBloomberg highlights the move by Panama was made possible by changes to the administration process and regulations making it easier to expel violators from Panama’s ship registry. The report says at least 70 tankers have already been removed but the administrators pledged to become more aggressive in their actions against sanctioned vessels and other violators.\nSeparately, Bloomberg is also reporting the Trump “maximum pressure” campaign appears to be having an effect on tanker movements and deliveries. The news outlet calculates that 11 tankers are currently idle or slow steaming in the area around Malaysia and Singapore. Bloomberg reports the tankers have 17 million barrels of oil loaded. Further, it says more than 20 tankers are anchored idle near Iran’s Kharg Island terminal.\nBloomberg’s report asserts that more than two-thirds of the tankers that handled Iranian crude in 2024 had been sanctioned as of late February. Analysts at TankerTracker.com taking the wider view however said early in March that the U.S. has “only blacklisted 234 (or 45 percent) of the 522 tankers involved in the Iran sanctions oil trade” as of the beginning of this month.\nUANI has long been critical of Panama with the NGO asserting that Panama has 18 percent (96 vessels) of the 510 the group has listed in its “Ghost Armada List” tracking vessels in the Iranian oil trade. The group notes its list has grown from just 70 vessels when it started the listing in November 2020. They currently list nine tankers registered in Panama as having been sanctioned.\nPanamanian officials have highlighted their efforts in recent years to clear the registry after a change in administration. As the largest ship registry by number of vessels, Panama has had a large number but a small percentage of violators in the registry.\nDespite the ongoing pressure effort, UANI reports Iran continues to ship large amounts of oil. The group cites data saying Iran shipped 1.7 million barrels in February up from 1.3 million the month before. China according to the data is the largest customer receiving nearly all the oil Iran ships."

Initial reports said three crewmembers were injured but it was later revised to a total of six, with two badly burned and the other four with more minor injuries.\nThe ship,Crystal Asia, is a refrigerated cargo ship built in 1993 and operating under the Russian flag since 2016. The ship is 8,000 dwt and operates from Vladivostok.\nThe Korean Coast Guard reports the vessel departed Busan with ballast at around 0700 local time. Shortly after, while it was approximately 5 miles from the port, smoke was seen billowing from the vessel. The Coast Guard said it was a presumed engine failure but it was working to determine if it was a smoke condition or a fire burning on the ship. Multiple rescue boats were dispatched.\nCrewmembers later told the Coast Guard that the smoke was coming from an engine failure. However, the Coast Guard said its initial inspection showed traces of an explosion inside the ship.\nThe rescue teams assisted with the firefighting. They removed the 23 crewmembers from the vessel and transported them to shore.\nA tug was later able to secure the vessel and moved it back to Busan Port where it is now docked."

        "content": "While remaining the largest customer for Russian oil, India has had a spotty relationship with the shadow fleet and several times cracked down or responded to Western sanctions. In the latest effort, however, India reportedly turned away a shadow fleet tanker over improper documentation.\nThe crude oil tankerAndaman Skies(111,000 dwt) is currently loitering in the Arabian Sea between India and Oman after being turned away from the oil terminal at Vadinar reports Reuters. In its reporting, it said the vessel which was due to arrive on Thursday, March 27, laden with approximately 100,000 metric tons of Russian crude would be turned away.\nBuilt in 2004, the vessel has now completed 20 years of service which is an important threshold under Indian regulations. Both Reuters and Bloomberg are reporting the vessel which is managed from India was turned away because it lacked seaworthiness certificates from a recognized source. India requires additional documentation from the older vessels.\nThe vessel was sold by Delta Tankers of Greece in 2023 with the ownership registered in India. The tanker had last called at an Indian port in December according to Bloomberg. Typical of a shadow fleet vessel, the Equasis database reports it was registered in 2023 in the Cook Islands but switched flags again in 2024. Equasis and Bloomberg report the ship is operating under the flag of Honduras while Reuters and Marine Traffic say it is now under the flag of Tanzania.\nBloomberg reports the tanker has P&I insurance from a Russian company, Soglasie, while Equasis lists its last surveys done in late 2024 by the China Classification Society but class was withdrawn in February 2025 for other reasons. Both news outlets report that Indian sources said the vessel is now being certified by the Dakar Class, which is not recognized in India.\nAndaman Skieshas been targeted by the West for its involvement in the Russian trade. Both the UK and EU have listed the vessel in their sanctions. However, the U.S. and the UN have not designated the vessel creating another loophole. India has promised not to import oil on sanctioned tankers but only recognizes the UN designations.\nReports indicate that as much as 35 percent of India’s overall crude oil imports came from Russia in 2024."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Coast Guard is investigating after an inspection team on Wednesday, March 26 discovered a tank containing hazardous anhydrous ammonia at the terminal in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The tank represents a violation of an order by the USCG issued last month concerning hazardous cargo due to safety concerns.\nLast month, the Puerto Nuevo Terminal (PNT) was slapped with an order tostop handling hazardous goodsamong them being anhydrous ammonia owing to the facility’s lack of adequate firefighting capability. Weeks later, a Sector San Juan inspections team discovered an anhydrous ammonia hazardous cargo shipment at the terminal, something they contend poses a significant threat to the safety and security of the facility.\nThe discovery of the hazardous cargo happened during a routine examination. The Coast Guard team conducting the inspection identified three tank containers, one of which was deemed to be a violation because it was holding more than 5,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia. It is a hazardous, highly toxic, and corrosive gas or colorless liquid which is flammable in high concentrations. The product is mainly used for various industrial applications including detergents, pesticides, and fertilizers, among others.\nFollowing the finding, an interagency team conducted a sweep of the facility, inspecting other containers. They were looking for other hazardous materials while nothing the current order does not prohibit the terminal from handling non-hazardous general cargo.\n\n#BreakingOn Wed.,@uscgSector San Juan personnel discovered a#HAZMATcargo shipment of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Puerto Nuevo Terminals (PNT) port facility in#PuertoRico. A#USCGinvestigation regarding the facility’s safety compliance is ongoing. ????????????https://t.co/kXwpVMw4LQpic.twitter.com/bbLjrdztr9\n\n“We will continue to devote all the necessary resources to ensure that HAZMAT is handled in compliance with federal laws and regulations to safeguard the local population and to prevent a catastrophic incident from impacting maritime industry operations,” said Capt. Robert E. Stiles, acting Coast Guard Sector San Juan commander and acting Captain of the Port.\nThe Coast Guard reports it has repeatedly raised concerns over the port facility’s inability to meet safety compliance measures regarding firefighting capability. After numerous concessions and repeated failures to comply with safety measures regarding the handling of hazardous cargo, the terminal was issued a prohibitive order on February 27.\nThe discovery of the dangerous cargo, which is a direct violation of the order, could result in PNT being fined about $120,000 for each occurrence and each day of violation. Willful and knowing violation of a Captain of the Port Order the Coast Guard also highlights is a Class D felony that is punishable by up to six years in prison or fines of up to $250,000 for an individual or $500,000 for an organization.\nPuerto Nuevo Terminal is a 50/50 joint venture between Luis Ayala Colon and Saltchuk-owned Puerto Rico Terminals. It is one of only two container terminals in San Juan.\n"

        "content": "\nThe world’s first commercial-use ammonia-fueled vessel,Sakigake, completed a three-month demonstration voyage. Engaged in tugboat operations in Tokyo Bay, NYK which owns the vessel reports it achieved a GHG-emission reduction of up to approximately 95 percent. They believe it illustrates the potential of ammonia as a maritime fuel.\nThe 272-ton tugSakigake, which was built in 2015 as Japan’s first LNG-fueled tug, was selected for the pioneering project. When it was introduced a decade ago, the tug which is 122 feet (37 meters) in length was viewed as a proof of concept for alternative fuel operations in the class. It is again taking that role for ammonia-fueled propulsion.\nThe conversion program for the vessel was completed by Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) and IHI Power Systems Co. on August 23, 2024. They worked in cooperation with Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK) as part of a Green Innovation Fund Project sponsored by Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).\nThe development project of this vessel started in October 2021 as part of NEDO’s Green Innovation Fund Project which provided for the “development of vessels equipped with domestically produced ammonia-fueled engines.” The companies worked together to develop the designs and ultimately removed the LNG-fueled propulsion system to replace it with the new ammonia-fueled propulsion.Sakigakebecame the world’s first commercial-use ammonia-fueled vessel following Fortescue which converted an offshore support vessel and completed certification for its ammonia system earlier in 2024.\nNYK Group company Shin-Nippon Kaiyosha operatedSakigakein a three-month demonstration voyage while conducting tugboat operations in Tokyo Bay. NYK and IPS analyzed the ammonia co-firing and GHG-reduction rates during vessel operations and confirmed it consistently exceeded 90 percent. Depending on engine load rates, they were also able to achieve a 95 percent reduction in GHG emissions.\nAfter having completed this first demonstration, the vessel will continue to be used for tugboat operations in Tokyo Bay. NYK reports it will continue to accumulate knowledge related to the development and operation of ammonia-fueled vessels.\nNYK, Japan Engine Corporation, IPS, and Nippon Shipyard Co. are working together to develop an ammonia-fueled ammonia gas carrier, which is scheduled to be delivered in November 2026. This project is also sponsored by NEDO’s Green Innovation Fund Project and is part of NYK’s efforts to develop and introduce next-generation fueled vessels."

        "content": "Carnival Cruise Line marked a new step for the brand as it completed the expansion of its operations in Australia taking over its former sister brand P&O Cruises Australia. With two P&O ships officially entering Carnival service on Saturday, March 29, the brand with 29 ships will have the largest fleet in its 53-year history.\nThe corporation announced last year its decision to sunset the P&O brand which had a long history with Australia. P&O (Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company) along with Orient Line traced their origins to the 1830s and the beginnings of liner service between England and Australia. The two companies initiated cruising from Australia in 1932. They merged in 1960, but Australia remained a key part of the operation including the transition into modern cruising in the 1970s.\nAfter acquiring P&O in 2003, Carnival Corporation sought to develop the Australian market transferring ships from its Carnival Cruise Line and other brands. The Carnival Cruise Line brand entered the Australian market in 2012 and positioned its first large ship,Carnival Splendor(113,300 gross tons) in the market in 2019. The corporation however cited higher operating and regulatory costs and the South Pacific’s small population as the reason to combine the P&O Australia and Carnival brands. P&O continues to operate its separate cruise operation from the UK.\nP&O Australia sailed its final cruises in February and the two cruise ships were sent to Melbourne, Australia where they spent the past 10 days undergoing overhauls and rebranding in a wet dock. Some structural alterations were made as well as redecorating with new carpet and adding new technology. They are also introducing Carnival’s signature entertainment programming to the ships.\nThe ships are now known asCarnival AdventureandCarnival Encounterafter having operated since 2022 for P&O Australia. Both ships were built by Fincantieri and entered service for the U.S.-based Princess Cruises asGrand PrincessandStar Princess. They are 108,865 gross tons with accommodations for 2,600 passengers.\n\"Our expansion in Australia demonstrates incredible enthusiasm for our brand and we’re grateful to our loyal guests who continue to drive our ongoing growth, solidifying Carnival as the world’s most popular cruise line,” said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line. “Doubling the fun in our Australia homeports enables us to deliver more sailing options, offer more variety, and deepen our partnerships in the Sydney and Brisbane communities.”\nCarnival Adventurearrived in Sydney, Australia on Friday morning, March 28, for events before her return to service on Saturday. She will be sailing year-round from Sydney whileCarnival Encounterarrives on Saturday to start her first cruise from Brisbane.\nCarnival Splendorcontinues to sail year-round from Sydney while the smallerCarnival Luminosa(92,720 gross tons) operates seasonally in Australia. With the four ships, Carnival Cruise Line reports it expects to sail more than 500,000 passengers from its Australian homeports this year.\n"

        "content": "\nWhile US forces continue to pummel Houthi targets in Yemen, primarily using aircraft launched from theUSS Harry S. TrumanCarrier Strike Group located in the Red Sea, tensions at sea are also rising in the Northern Indian Ocean. Signs of increased military readiness are evident both on the part of Iran and of the United States.\nIn comparison with the normal level of anti-American rhetoric seen on a daily basis in the Iranian online press, which is dominated by government-controlled websites, recent days have seen a dramatic increase in stories that imply that the Iranians feel they are under imminent threat. These stories are normally pitched as warnings to both America and Israel not to attack, brandishing Iran’s ability to counter-attack using its drone and ballistic missile forces. At times of tension, Iran often manufactures a display of some new missile capability, and in recent days has shown off what it claims is a new underground tunnel complex; in this instance, the story may be true, as similar tunneling, albeit with the normal complement of missiles on mobile launchers, has not been seen before.\n\n\nMajor General Mohammad Bagheri and Brigadier Amir Ali Hajizadeh tour the new ‘missile megacity’, March 25 (Press TV)\n\nIn an underwhelming display on March 27, the IRGC Navy (Nedsa) mounted a parade of old and unarmed dhows along the length of its coastline, which it said included vessels from Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen. A number of the trading vessels are likely to have been contracted by Nedsa’s Unit 190 in recent years to smuggle weapons to the Houthis and others. This somewhat pointless review, which was probably the ‘3000 boat event' originally planned for January 27, was led by the converted oil tankerShahid Bagheri(C110-4) and the Shahid Soleimani Class missile corvetteShahid Rais Ali Delvari(FS313-04).\nThe Regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) is adopting a slightly more relaxed posture during the Ramadan season. On March 28, satellite imagery of the main naval base at Bandar Abbas showed four Alvand/Moudge and one Bayandor frigates alongside. There was no sign in the harbor of the intelligence collection frigateIRINS Zagros(H313). A Kilo Class submarine was at its berth on the east side of the harbor, with a second Kilo seen in dry dock. The long-range logistic vesselIRINS Makran(K441) was at its normal pier in the outer harbor. The three operational Hengham Class amphibious ships were alongside, together implying that there are no long-range flotillas out of home waters at present, as these vessels normally provide logistic support for such deployments. It is not clear at present even if the Nedaja remains in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden area, a station which it has been maintaining continuously since 2008; if present, what would be the 101st Flotilla is maintaining an extremely low profile.\nWith the U.S. negotiating position outlined to Iran in a letter passed by President Trump through intermediaries to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, the Iranians understand they have limited room for maneuver and are under increasing pressure. At the same time, both the European Union and the United States have significantly tightened sanctions on the dark tanker fleet running sanctioned Iranian oil exports, which will have immediate detrimental effects on an Iranian economy already under very significant strains. On March 13, the US Treasury sanctioned an additional 30 tankers, in the third round of such sanctions. The EU’s 16th sanctions package listed an additional 73 Russian and Iranian tankers.\nOn the other side of the balance sheet, the United States is significantly reinforcing its strike capability in both the Red Sea and Northern Indian Ocean areas.\n\n\nImagery of Diego Garcia on March 25, sourced from @IndoPacWatch but reposted by @MenchOsint who is often sympathetic to Iran\n\nRecent satellite imagery shows at least seven B-2 Sprint strategic bombers on the British base at Diego Garcia. Nine KC-135 refueling aircraft are also visible on the southern-most ramp, with slots B1 and B2 on the ramp closed to other visiting military aircraft until the end of April. The KC-135 refuellers provide a significant payload and range boost, as they can refuel both the B-2 Sprints, the F-18 strike aircraft launching from the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, but also those from the USS Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group which is tracking west, and due to arrive in the area shortly.\nEarly on March 28, the MVJairan, the second of two sanctioned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) carrying sodium perchlorate from China, arrived in the Bandar Abbas anchorage. It can be expected to now move into the inner harbor and unload its cargo, to be processed into ammonium perchlorate which is the basis of the solid fuel which powers most of Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles."

        "content": "Japan celebrated the naming and launch of its first purpose-built ice-class Arctic research vessel, Mirai II. Construction on the vessel began in 2021 and it represents a significant step forward for the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), which will be responsible for the vessel’s operations.\nJapanese officials said as a country adjacent to and affected by the Arctic region, and as one of the world's leaders, Japan has a mission to contribute to resolving the various issues based on scientific evidence that impact the Arctic region. They noted that the Arctic is experiencing rapid environmental changes, such as a decrease in sea ice, which is resulting in increased economic activity in the region. They said that since the issues facing the Arctic are impacting the climate and weather on the entire planet they need to be viewed from a global perspective.\nJAMSTEC highlights the vessel will be equipped with equipment and facilities to enable a wide range of observations related to the atmosphere, weather, ocean, sea ice, and more. The design incorporates the maximum extent of Japan’s icebreaking construction technology. The new vessel will be Polar Class 4 capable of continuously breaking 1.2 meter (nearly 4 foot) of flat one-year ice at a speed of 3 knots.\n\n\nRendering of the completed research ship\n\nMirai II will be 13,000 tons with a length of 128 meters (420 feet). It will accommodate a total of 97 people, including 34 crewmembers and 63 researchers.\nConsidering the aging of the vessel, JAMSTEC reports it has decided to cease the operations of its current marine research vessel Mirai at the end of fiscal year 2025. The current vessel was launched in 1969 designed to become a nuclear-powered cargo ship. She was fueled in 1972, but two years later a controversy emerged due to questions over the vessel’s shielding for the nuclear reactor. It was used as a demonstration vessel and never entered commercial service before being retired in 1992. She was rebuilt as a diesel-powered ship and began operation as an oceanographic research ship in 1997.\nThe launching of the new vessel took place on March 19 at the Isogo Plant of Japan Marine United Corporation. Delivery is scheduled for November 2026.\nTo raise awareness of JAMSTEC’s activities and the new Arctic research vessel, the public was invited to submit names for the vessel. Using the public suggestions, the vessel’s workboat will be named Shirokuma, a common word used to describe polar bears, an animal that is being affected by environmental changes in the Arctic.\nJapanese officials said they expect once the vessel is in service it will make a significant contribution to advancing research into the global environment, including the Arctic region."

        "content": "After weeks of negotiations with the Kremlin, U.S. President Donald Trump is beginning to show impatience with Russia's continued aggression in Ukraine, and on Sunday he threatened to create a new penalty on Russian oil: \"secondary tariffs\" imposed on the nations that buy it. In practice, this would mean new U.S. tariffs on China, India and Turkey, the three nations that buy meaningful volumes of Russian crude.\nThe peace talks with the U.S. have produced valuable results for Russia, like a pledge of American assistance to help Russian ag exporters compete for more global market share - but there have been few if any benefits for Ukraine. Russian forces continue to bombard civilian infrastructure and to seize territory, advancing Russia's strategic interests while ignoring Trump's pleas for peace. On Russian state television, prominent commentators have mocked Trump's lead negotiator as an \"empty head\" for trusting the Kremlin's statements, and havecelebratedRussia's ability to \"fight America in war and win\" in Ukraine.\nOn Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the creation of a transitional caretaker government to replace Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has led the nation's defense since the start of the invasion three years ago. Putin also said that his troops would \"finish off\" Ukraine's army, which has been steadily losing ground for months.\n\"I was saying not so long ago: 'We will get them.' There are reasons to believe that we will finish them off, too,\" Putin said.\nIn an early morning call with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, Trump said that he was \"pissed off\" with Putin for the suggestion, and said that Putin's remarks were \"not going in the right direction.\"\n\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" Trump said. \"That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can’t do business in the United States.\"\nThe U.S., UK and EU banned imports of Russian oil in 2022 (with limited exceptions). Russia sells virtually all of its crude oil to China (47 percent), India (37 percent) and Turkey (six percent), and these three nations would be most affected by any \"secondary tariffs.\"\nRussian LNG, refined products and coal are exported to a broader pool of buyers, but it is unclear if these energy commodities would be targeted."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe scrutiny on the use of biofuels in Europe has intensified, with reports emerging last week that the EU is planning to suspend recognition of the ISCC certification of waste-based biofuels. The International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) has an EU certification scheme that verifies that biofuels entering the EU market are compliant with the bloc’s sustainability requirements, as set out in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) II.\nThe EU Committee on Sustainability of Biofuels, Bioliquids and Biomass Fuels had convened to discuss rising fraud cases of biofuels in the European market. While the deliberations of the committee are confidential, one of the outcomes reportedly is a proposal to the European Commission to suspend recognition of ISCC certifications for waste-based biofuels for 2.5 years. If the 27 member states approve the suspension, EU countries will have the discretion to accept or reject ISCC certificates.\nA surge of imports from South-East Asia has raised serious concerns on the compliance of these biofuels with EU market regulations. Market players blame this on lax verification procedures by ISCC, which is the largest feedstock accreditor. Data from fuel regulators in Europe estimate that 1.8 million tons of fraudulent ISCC-certified Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) entered the EU in 2023. POME is a byproduct of palm oil processing and is used as a feedstock in production of biodiesel. The biofuel is gaining widespread use in the shipping industry.\n“Based on European Commission data published in December, a third of the used cooking oil (UCO) is undoubtedly fake, most likely sourced directly from virgin palm oil,” James Cogan, EU Government Affairs, Industry& Policy Director at biotech firm ClonBio Group, told S&P Global. Virgin palm oil as a feedstock is ineligible for renewable energy incentives under the EU’s RED II initiative. This is based on its alleged contribution to deforestation abroad.\nIn addition, the EU proposal comes at a time when the shipping industry in Europe has started a journey on use of ISCC certified biofuels, as a measure towards a green transition.\nThe ISCC system said that it is aware of the EU Biofuels Committee’s discussions, noting that it was surprised by the suspension proposal.\nThis latest step from the EU adds to the growing pushback against use of biofuels in shipping. Next week, the IMO will be hosting MEPC 83 (Marine Environment Protection Committee 83) where a raft of mid-term measures on green shipping will be debated. In line with this, some shipping lines - including Hapag Lloyd and environmental NGOs - have come forward to warn about the widespread use of biofuels in shipping industry.\nNearly a third of global shipping could run on biofuels in 2030, up from less than one percent today. This would see close to 300 million bottles of vegetable oil (palm and soy) diverted to powering ships every day in 2030, according to a study by the transport NGO T&E. Unfortunately, vast amounts of farmlands - 3.4 million hectares, almost total area of Germany - would be needed to produce enough crops to meet biofuels demand for shipping, taking up resources that would otherwise be used to make food."

CNOOC assesses that it contains 750 million barrels equivalent of oil and gas (100 million tonnes). The test well produced minimal daily oil production and 2.4 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. It is a shallow-water field with a water depth of just 100 meters, but drilling the deep well of 5,400 meters was a technical challenge, said Xu Changgui, chief geologist for CNOOC.\n\"This discovery has confirmed the largest integrated clastic oilfield in the northern South China Sea in terms of original oil in place, breaking the traditional theoretical understanding, and demonstrating the enormous exploration potential of deep and ultra-deep plays in high-temperature and highly active basins offshore China,\" said Xu.\nThe find marks the second year in a row that CNOOC has found a resource this big. If commercialized and replicated at scale, it could help China reduce its dependence on foreign gas imports. China buys about 10 billion cubic feet of gas in the form of LNG every day - nearly three shiploads daily.\nClastic reservoirs like Huizhou 19-6 are a challenge for oil and gas development, and are more complex and less predictable than other plays. They are formed from deposits of geologic debris, like sand, rock fragments, clay and minerals, and often vary in composition throughout the formation.\nTop image:CNOOC headquarters, Beijing (Daniel Case / CC BY SA 3.0)"

The vessel run aground on March 22; though the cause is yet to be determined, harsh weather condition were reported in the area at the time.\nOn Friday, Fugro said that the vessel was safely towed back to port and is at a shipyard for inspection. The incident caused no injuries and no harm to the environment. A full review of the event is ongoing to determine what caused the vessel to run aground.\n“We are grateful to the Italian coastguard and our partners for their swift response in evacuating our crew and salvaging theFugro Mercator,” said Erik-Jan Bijvank, Group Director Europe and Africa.\nTheFugro Mercatorwas performing survey work for the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) as part of the Italian government’s Marine Ecosystem Restoration (MER) Project. The initiative is being carried out under the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan, which aims to restore marine habitats, update the national system for observing marine and coastal ecosystems, as well as map marine habitats across Italian waters.\nThe two-year project began in January and Furgo is working alongside Italian partners Poliservizi Srl and Prisma. In addition to the surveys, two seabed tsunami early-warning stations in the Sardinian Channel and the South Ionian Sea will be included.\nFugro has said that it working with the Italian government to ensure the survey work goes uninterrupted after the grounding incident. In this regard, Fugro has committed to dispatch another survey vessel,Fugro Helmert,which will sail to the Mediterranean to pick up theMercator’sproject. This will minimize the overall impact of the incident, added Fugro."

        "content": "\nThe Trump administration may be willing to help a Canadian company get a head start on seabed mining in the deep Pacific. Administration officials are in talks to use an obscure domestic law to bypass the International Seabed Authority and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), granting a foreign firm a U.S. seabed lease in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nThe Metals Company (TMC), a British Columbia-based mining firm with a strongESG focus, has been trying to obtain an ISA permit to collect manganese nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone for years. It had hoped to have ISA approvals in hand for a 2027 start, with support from the island nation of Nauru, but its push for the agency to craft regulations has recently been slowed down. Under the leadership of newly-elected ISA Secretary-General Leticia Carvalho, the agency has taken a deliberate pace towards passing final rules, and more than 30 nations, including the UK, France, Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark, want the industry to pause indefinitely until there is better science on its impact.\nThe CCZ is little-studied, and oceanographers warn that removing manganese nodules could do lasting damage to the ecosystem before it is even understood.Researchfinanced by TMC found that the nodules may be a previously-undiscovered source of dissolved oxygen at the bottom, a revolutionary discovery.\nTMC's CEO and chairman, Australian national Gerard Barron, hascriticizedISA's slow movement on crafting final regulations. In a statement Thursday, he said that the company might simply bypass the ISA and obtain a license from a single nation - the United States.\n“We believe we have sufficient knowledge to get started and prove we can manage environmental risks. What we need is a regulator with a robust regulatory regime, and who is willing to give our application a fair hearing. That’s why we’ve formally initiated the process of applying for licenses and permits under the existing U.S. seabed mining code,\" said Barron in a statement.\nThe U.S. code in question is the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA), a little-known law passed in 1980 that created a domestic licensing mechanism for seabed mining. It serves as a substitute for the provisions of UNCLOS, which the U.S. has not ratified.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) told the New York Times that an approval process for TMC's permit request could begin soon, to include interagency consultations and public comment periods. To secure approval under the statute, TMC would have to use a U.S.-flagged vessel for the mining operation. Its contracted mining support ship, the drillship conversionHidden Gem,is currently owned in India, managed in the Netherlands and flagged in Malta.\nThe company's proposal has attracted international opposition. On Friday, ISA Secretary-General Leticia Carvalho emphasized \"that the authority holds exclusive jurisdiction over all activities in the international seabed area, which is recognized as the common heritage of humankind under UNCLOS.\"\nMore than three dozen nations, including China, Russia, the UK, France and India, have condemned TMC's plan and registered their support for the ISA. If the U.S. decides to support TMC and bypass UNCLOS, other nations could follow suit without constraints.\nTMC faces the financial pressures familiar to any startup. It has lost about $70-80 million annually for the last two years, has no revenue, and has expended $630 million to date. In its 2024 earningstatement, it projected that it has the financial resources to cover another 12 months of obligations, with $25 million in loan support from Barron and from board member Andrei Karkar."

        "content": "\nThe geopolitics in the Horn of Africa have taken a new turn, with Somalia indicating that it is ready to offer the U.S exclusive control of it ports in the Gulf of Aden. This was revealed in a letter leaked last week, which appeared to have been written by Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and addressed to the U.S President Donald Trump. Theletteris dated March 16.\n“Somalia is prepared to offer the U.S exclusive operational control over the Balidogle and Berbera airbases, as well as the Port of Berbera and Bosaso. These strategically positioned assets provide an opportunity to bolster American engagement in the region, ensuring uninterrupted military and logistical access in this critical corridor,” reads part of the letter.\nPorts of Berbera and Bosaso have long attracted global interest due to their strategic location near the entrance of the Red Sea. The U.S operates a naval base in the neighboring Djibouti, whose lease is scheduled to expire in 2034, with an option for 10-year extension.\nHowever, the offer from Somalia promises to expand America’s footprint in the Gulf of Aden. The U.S military is currently leading efforts to secure Southern Red Sea from the ongoing Houthi attacks on merchant shipping.\nBut Somalia’s proposal to the U.S has been interpreted as a desperate move to stop recognition of its breakaway region, Somaliland, as a sovereign state. Early this month, the Financial Times reported that Washington was in the initial stages of negotiating with Somaliland. The discussions are about a possible deal to recognize the de facto state in exchange for rights to establish a military base near the Port of Berbera.\nIn a speech on Saturday, Somaliland’s President Abdirahman Irro dismissed Somalia’s offer to the U.S. “The leadership of Somaliland rests with me and my people. No one can claim or negotiate over the territory of Somaliland,” said Irro.\nBerbera sea port is controlled by Somaliland while Bosaso is owned by Puntland, an autonomous state of Somalia. Both the ports are operated by the UAE’s DP World, which is currently modernizing the terminals."

        "content": "Norwegian investigators have charged four people in connection with an alleged marine insurance fraud scheme linked to the Russian dark fleet, according to NRK.\nThe investigation centers on the activities of insurer Ro Marine AS, a company with a listed address in the prestigious Norwegian Shipowners Association building in Oslo. According to NRK and the shipowners' association, Ro Marine never had a presence in the building - and Norway's finance authority says that the company wasn't selling real insurance, either.\nA routine check of the insurer's paperwork revealed that it had sent clients a forged document that purported to be an approval letter from the Finanstilsynet, Norway's Financial Supervisory Authority. The seal was wrong; the signature was fake; and the document referred to nonexistent regulations, Finanstilsynet told NRK. The agency reported the apparent fraud to the police and on March 4, it instructed Ro Marine AS to cease operations immediately.\nFour people have been charged in connecton with the scheme: two Norwegians, who deny knowledge of any wrongdoing; one Bulgarian; and one Russian resident of St. Petersburg, who owns and manages the business. NRK contacted Ro Marine by email, and the company denied any violations of sanctions.\nThe firm's Russian owner is not in custody, and despite the instructions from Norwegian authorities, the company's website remains live. As of March 25, Finanstilsynet said that it was unable to reach the brokerage.\n\"Finanstilsynet warns against entering into agreements with Romarine AS and against using the services offered through the company's websites,\" the agency cautioned in a statement.\nThe new insurance inspection regime in the Baltic Sea turned up seven tankers that claimed to be covered by Ro Marine, authorities told Danwatch, including the dark fleet tanker Achilles. The false coverage documents passed muster at the time, given the Norwegian address and connections of Ro Marine, but had no actual insurance behind them. This left the tankers dangerously uncovered in the event of a casualty or a spill.\n\"False insurance is in direct violation of international conventions and increases the danger for everyone,\" Harvard sanctions expert Craig Kennedy told NRK. \"It violates a core principle of global shipping safety and should be of concern to all coastal states.\"\nThe Ro Marine case is one of many alternate insurance arrangements used by the \"dark fleet\" of Russia-linked tankers. These vessels cannot access Western insurance markets because of sanctions, and have turned to Russian and Indian insurers to plug the gap, with questionable results. It may be the most egregious example of a workaround, experts say.\n\"There have been isolated cases, but not on this scale and not this systematically. It’s outrageous. It completely undermines the system,” says Kristina Siig."

Initial reports indicated that three Chinese nationals had been kidnapped from the vessel but today, March 31, Chinese officials reported the crew are “physically safe.”\nThe incident took place Thursday evening, March 27, according to the report from Ghana. The fishing vesselMengxin 1, registered in Ghana, was at sea when it was approached and boarded by seven armed pirates. The Ghana Navy reports warning shots were fired and several crewmembers on the fishing vessel went into hiding.\nThe pirates assembled the crewmembers they could locate on deck and robbed the crew of their mobile phones. After about three hours the pirates left the vessel. MDAT-GoG (Maritime Domain Awareness Trade - Gulf of Guinea), the French – British effort for maritime situational awareness in the Gulf of Guinea reports the incident took place approximately 16 nautical miles southwest of the Ghanian capital of Accra.\nThe crewmembers in hiding reported they emerged to find the captain, chief mate, and chief engineer, all Chinese nationals, missing. Because there was no mobile network coverage out at sea it took some time for the incident to be reported until the remaining crew could get the vessel close enough to shore to gain a signal.\nThe Ghanaian Navy began a search. It also issued an alert to neighboring countries to be looking for the pirates. The fishing boat proceeded back to the port of Tema in Ghana.\nAsked about the incident, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had been in touch with the embassy and Ghanian officials.\n“The crew members are physically safe now. China will work with Ghana to earnestly protect the safety and security of Chinese nationals and institutions in Ghana,” responded spokesperson Guo Jiakun during the ministry’s daily press briefing in Beijing on March 31.\nIt is the second incident with a Chinese fishing vessel in recent months. In November, a Chinese fishing boat operating in the east off the Horn of Africa was boarded and held by pirates from Yemen. The Chinese embassy reported that the vessel had been released in January 2025 without providing details."

The suit alleges that 13 vessels either owned or chartered by the company were damaged due to faulty fuel supplied while they were in Houston, Texas.\nThe complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas reports between March and June 2023, CMA CGM took delivery of 33,628 metric tons of very low sulfur fuel oil for its vessels while they were docked in the Port of Houston. The company had a supply contract with GCC Supply & Trading for the manufacture, sale, supply, and delivery of maritime fuel.\n“Shortly after the fuel was supplied, the vessels encountered significant operational issues, including but not limited to fuel pump seizures, ICU leakages, loss of engine power and propulsion in some cases leading to blackouts. CMA CGM put GCC on notice of these issues as soon as they became known,” the complaint alleges. It goes on to state, “The vessels suffered physical damage to their fuel tanks, fuel purifiers, fuel systems, and their engines and engine components, causing CMA CGM damages.”\nThey are alleging that GCC should have known that it was delivering “contaminated, defective, off-specification, unfit for consumption,” fuel that would cause physical harm to the vessels. They contend the supplier failed to “employ reasonable practices and policies for testing and screening its product for harmful contaminants or components.”\nCMA CGM says it incurred disrupted and delayed operations, which caused operational cost increases, lost opportunities, demurrage, and further damages. They are suing for breach of contract, breach of warranties, negligence, and product liability.\nThe shipping company is demanding a jury trial. It asks the court to determine the final amount of damages and relief it will be granted.\nBunker fuel testing and advisory company VPS issued apublic report on the problemin July 2023 saying that it detected the presence of Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and associated isomers at significantly high levels in VLSFO bunker fuel deliveries in Houston. At the time, it said at least 11 vessels had been impacted but it caused widespread concern. Weeks earlier in March 2023 over 200 vessels reported issues after fueling in Singapore. Regulators later traded the problem back to the origin well and imposed significant penalties on the supplier."

The ruling unwinds a Biden-era policy decision that supported offshore oil and gas - but it conflicts even more deeply with the priorities of the Trump administration.\nDistrict of Columbia Judge Amit Mehta found that the March 2023 lease sales violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) because the agency \"failed to take a hard look\" at the CO2 emissions from the project. BOEM projected that the 2,500-square-mile lease areas would produce about 110 bcm of gas and 1.1 billion barrels of gas over the course of the next 50 years, resulting in foreseeable downstream CO2 emissions. However, BOEM's analysis concluded that leasing in the Gulf would lower global CO2e upstream emissions because of the comparatively low carbon footprint of drilling in the U.S. Gulf (relative to other international sources).\n“We are pleased the court recognized the serious hazards Lease Sale 259 would have inflicted upon Gulf coast communities, as well as the harms it would have caused to Gulf ecosystems and highly imperiled species like the endangered Rice’s whale,” said Devorah Ancel, Senior Attorney with Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, a plaintiff in the suit.\nThe American Petroleum Institute panned the judge's decision and accused environmental groups of \"weaponizing\" NEPA, according to the AP."

        "content": "\nDays after confirming that it was considering newbuilds for its UK cruise operation known as Marella Cruises, Germany’s TUI Group has entered into an agreement with Fincantieri for two cruise ships. They would mark the first newbuilds for the company’s UK operation and expand a relationship started with the Italian shipbuilder for the group’s Germany cruise joint venture Mein Schiff.\nThe group said it had entered into a Memorandum of Agreement for the two new cruise ships based on Fincantieri confirming building slots with tentative delivery dates in 2030 and 2032. Fincantieri reports the value of the order exceeds €2 billion (nearly US$2.2 billion). The deal is subject to financing and completion of binding shipbuilding contracts.\nNo details were announced on the size of the planned cruise ships. They noted the ships would be customized to the UK cruise market and continue the premium positioning of the brand.\nLast week, TUI outlined opportunities for its investors highlighting the UK cruise market as a growing segment of the business. The group said it expects the market will grow by 9 percent per year until 2030. In today’s announcement of the shipbuilding plan, the parent company TUI AG said the business case points to an EBIT of between €130 and €150 million (US$140 to $162 million) per ship per year and a Return on Invested Capital of 11 to 12 percent.\nThe cruise line started in the 1970s when Thomson, a UK tour operator, chartered an older ship for cruises. TUI restarted the operation in the 1990s based on the success of competing tour operators with the burgeoning cruise market in the UK. In October 2017, the operation was rebranded Marella Cruises. Its marketing is entirely in the UK and through a series of efforts it has been positioned in the premium segment of the market.\nMarella currently operates five cruise ships, between 70,000 and 77,000 gross tons each, with accommodations for approximately 2,000 passengers per ship built between 1995 and 1997. Two of the ships, operating asMarella DiscoveryandMarella Discovery 2, were acquired in 2016 and 2017 from Royal Caribbean Group which is TUI’s partner for the German cruise operations. Two more ships were acquired for Royal Caribbean’s Celebrity Cruises in 2018 and 2019 and operate asMarella ExplorerandMarella Explorer 2. The final ship,Marella Voyager, was added to the brand in 2023 coming from Mein Schiff, and built for Celebrity Cruises.\nTUI’s executives highlighted the challenges the brand faced with older ships that are also smaller versus competitors. Carnival’s P&O Cruises is the UK’s largest brand and has added new, large cruise ships, while Saga Cruises, a UK niche brand built two new ships. Fred. Olsen upgraded its fleet with second-hand ships acquired from Carnival’s Holland America Cruises during the pandemic.\nMarella said given the aging of its fleet it was exploring “re-fleeting” and was in discussions to secure newbuilding slots. It noted that Europe’s cruise shipbuilders are all fully committed till 2030. Cruise ship construction is specialized due to the vast network of subcontractors and suppliers involved in the projects and the complexity of the hotel operations integrated into the vessel.\nTUI has been working to rebuild the profitability of the group but emphasizes the strength of the UK cruise market. The group said in its release that it would also “continue to explore partnership options.” Mein Schiff was launched as a joint venture with Royal Caribbean and in 2020 the group sold Hapag-Lloyd Cruises to the joint venture.\nFincantieri highlights the addition of another brand to its orderbook, while it is completing the second cruise ship for TUI, Mein Schiff Flow, which will deliver in 2026. The shipyards also have large orders from Carnival Corporation, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas, Crystal Cruises, and Viking, as well as small, luxury ships for Four Seasons."

Officials for the Port of Antwerp-Bruges said the disruptions began on Sunday evening and were expected to last until Tuesday with it taking days to fully recover.\nThe European Transport Workers’ Federation announced it was standing in solidarity with the Belgium Trade Union Confederation which led the call for the 24-hour nationwide strike. The union cited planned cuts to pensions, reforms to the labor market, and cuts to the public service sector. The universal call across all the groups was to maintain pensions and fair working conditions.\n“Transport workers are particularly affected, facing drastic budget cuts, job insecurity, and the erosion of collective bargaining rights. At a time when Belgium should be investing in its workforce and public services, this government is taking the country in the wrong direction,” said the ETF in its statement of support.\nThe Port of Antwerp-Bruges which manages the country’s two busiest ports, Antwerp and Zeebrugge, reported “very strong obstacles for ships.” The delays and backlogs grew as the day progressed with the authority’s final update saying only about 10 ships had been able to enter and leave Antwerp all day on Monday. It said the backlog grew to about 50 ships. Three of Antwerp’s locks were closed.\n“The disruption will continue until tomorrow morning (Tuesday). Afterward, we will see how we can quickly and safely clear the backlog. This is expected to take one to two days,” the authority said in its update at 2015 Monday evening.\nZeebrugge reported there had been a complete blockage since 1100 saying it would continue until 0700 on Tuesday. No seagoing vessels entered or departed the port on Monday afternoon. Earlier it had reported that one ship had departed and two arrived, before the end of the day saying a backlog of 25 ships was waiting for the port to resume activity.\nThe problems were not limited to the seaports. Brussels Airport canceled all 244 outbound flights for Monday and said incoming traffic might also be impacted. Public services were reported to be at a standstill, including the post office and garbage services. Some schools also closed for the day and much of public transport around the country was disrupted.\nThe government which came to office in February has presented an austerity plan for the country. Today was the second round of major strikes against the planned sweeping cuts to all sectors of the economy."

The vessels are reportedly being taken to the Bushehr oil dock where the fuel will be unloaded under judicial order. The report says the tankers were identified through “intelligence monitoring” at the Bushehr port.\nThe action comes as tensions remain high in the region. Iranian officials said they are rejecting a letter from Donald Trump that demanded talks to resolve Iran’s nuclear program and threatened dire consequences. Trump reportedly said he could send long-range bombers to attack Iran.\nIran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy Commander, Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, threatened retaliation if Iran was attacked. He told reporters on Saturday if ordered he was prepared to close the Strait of Hormuz.\nReports indicated on Saturday, March 29, the second of two cargo ships carrying the base component forrocket fuelreached Iran after a trip from China. After processing, it could supply solid fuel for approximately 250 of Iran’s medium or short-range rockets."

Efforts to survey the hull were hampered by the high seas and the fact the vessel was sitting on the rocks.\n\n\n\nDetermining there was no significant damage visible to the vessel, local authorities determined that the crew would remain aboard their ship, but emergency accommodations were arranged if they had to be evacuated. The surveys determined there were 50 tons of diesel and 700 tons of heavy fuel aboard but no leaks were observed.\nChinese officials report a delegation visited the ship. They also met with the local officials to plan the salvage effort. A contract has been signed for the removal of the fuel to lighten the vessel. Russian officials said that an access road also had to be created to reach the vessel.\nNo timing was offered for when they expected to have the vessel afloat."

        "content": "\nA panel of senior cyber experts has called for more investment in maritime cybersecurity in order to ensure American military mobility in wartime. Most cyber analyses focus on the economic and commercial impact of cyber meddling, but this study is squarely focused on defense - specifically on defense against China, America's most sophisticated adversary in the cyber domain.\nIn its 2024 report, the U.S. intelligence community predicted that China could use \"aggressive cyber operations against U.S. critical infrastructure and military assets” and attempt to “interfere with the deployment of U.S. forces.\" China's hackers have also proven themselves capable of penetrating utilities, videocameras, routers and the deep infrastructure of American telecom companies - giving Beijing a birds-eye view of American logistics, including military logistics.\n\"The nation can no longer afford to waste time debating the immediacy of the threat. Washington must identify and resource solutions now,\" wrote Annie Fixler, RADM Mark Montgomery (USN, ret'd) and Rory lane for the Cybersecurity Solarium Commission (CSC 2.0).\nThe threats affect all modes of transport - rail, road, air and maritime. Sealift may be the most important link in the chain, as it carries 90 percent of the cargo when America goes to war overseas. It is also vulnerable, as U.S. sealift capacity is already strained, reliant on aging tonnage and uncertain mariner availability. \"The nation’s lack of excess sealift capacity means that the U.S. military’s ability to mobilize forces could be severely degraded by any cyber or physical incident,\" the panel warned.\nThe authors singled out known vulnerabilities in Chinese port equipment, including unexploited security vulnerabilities in cranes built by ZPMC; likely logistics spying activity in China's free-to-use LOGINK container tracking platform; and low performance of a Chinese-made cargo inspection device that is marketed for detecting nuclear materials.\nThe Biden administration gave the Coast Guard more authority to directly regulate port and maritime cybersecurity, and USCG captains of the port are following up with stakeholders. However, \"the Coast Guard has no funding specifically designated for work with the private sector to improve the cyber resiliency of America’s port infrastructure,\" the panel warned. It remains to be seen if the Trump administration will prioritize cyber vulnerabilities in its next budget."

Today, it is home to a Chinese-operated resort complex, along with the ruins of U.S.-built Fort Wint.\nThe five Chinese suspects were posing as recreational fishermen and tourists, according to the NBI, and were accompanied by one Cambodian national and one Filipino guard. (Initial reports appear to have misidentified the Cambodian suspect as a sixth Chinese national.)\n\"We have identified this group as the one flying drones during the day and night under the guise of sending fishing bait out to sea,\" NBI cybercrime official Van Angluben said at a press conference. \"These drones are actually being used for surveillance . . . of the U.S. Asiatic [Indo-Pacific] fleet.\"\nThe NBI recovered photos and videos of Philippine and US ships from gadgets of suspected spies arrested in Subic. Karen de Guzman reports.#DatelinePhilippinespic.twitter.com/p4exIV5EHG\nThe men had multiple photos of American warships on their personal devices, according to NBI, along with images of shipments of military cargo. The police also recovered a handwritten document marked in Chinese characters, which described the date, time and ID of vessels coming and going from Subic Bay.\nImmigration records show that the foreign nationals entered and exited the Philippines frequently, the agency said.\nThe Chinese suspects declined to comment, but the Filipino man who was arrested with them - identified as Melvin Aguillon - told media that he was not aware of the alleged spying activity. \"I'm just the driver,\" he told ANC. He was in possession of an illegal firearm at the time of his arrest, according to the NBI.\nThe Chinese resort operator's lease on the island is now under review, according to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA)."

The company reported it is buying three under-construction dual-fuel methanol containerships from Japanese leasing company Shoei Kisen Kaisha.\nThe three vessels are reported to already be on order with Imabari Shipbuilding. They are scheduled for delivery in 2028 and 2029 and each will have a capacity of 8,000 TEU. The report says they will be equipped with energy-efficient main engines to maintain flexibility for the future adoption of alternative fuels. It also plans to pursue digitalization and smart technologies.\nYang Ming, which is currently number 10 on Alphaliner’s sector ranking with a capacity of just over 700,000 TEU, has said it is committed to strengthening its core business. The group is part of the reworked Premier Alliance that launched in February 2025 along with HMM and Once Network Express (ONE). The new five-year alliance agreement calls for the expansion of services to make up for the loss of Hapag-Lloyd in the former The Alliance. Yang Ming has already announced its new 2025 Transpacific trade service and Transatlantic routes. It said it plans to strengthen its regional services to broaden its service portfolio.\nAs reported two weeks ago, the company's financial results for 2024 achieved consolidated revenues of $6.9 billion. It reported a new profit of nearly $2 billion, while still highlighting the challenges in 2024. It cited supply growth outpacing demand last year while expressing long-term confidence in the sector.\nThe fleet optimization plan calls for replacing its over 20-year-old vessels with between 5,500 and 6,500 TEU capacity. The group plans the addition of 13 new vessels, including up to six 8,000 TEU dual-fuel-ready vessels. It is also planning seven 15,000 TEU LNG dual-fuel vessels.\nNo timing was announced for the fleet optimization program but the company reports it is a key part of the business strategy."

Norges Bank Investment Management will invest $1.5 billion for 49 percent stakes in the projects RWE is developing in Denmark and Germany.\nRWE has been dealing with activist shareholders who have been demanding the company take steps such as share buyback to generate more value for investors. The company during its year-end financial report said it would be exploring partners for more of its wind farm while also cutting €10 billion (US$10.8 billion) from its planned green technology investments.\nNorges expects to close on the transactions in the third quarter of 2025 acquiring stakes in the Nordsecluster in Germany and the Tho project in Denmark. RWE has also said it would seek a 50 percent partner for a project in the UK in 2026. The company reports work is progressing on the two projects in today’s agreement as well as a new wind farm in the UK and another for the Netherlands. RWE currently operates 19 offshore wind farms.\nThe projects in Germany and Denmark have the potential to provide more than 2.6 GW. Nordseecluster, located approximately 50 km (30 miles) north of the island of Juist in Germany, is being built in two phases, with Nordseecluster A with 660 MW scheduled for commissioning in 2027 and Nordseecluster B with 900 MW, scheduled for full commissioning in 2029. Thor wind farm is Denmark’s largest offshore wind farm to date. Located approximately 22 km (14 miles) off the west coast of Jutland, it will have a capacity of 1,080 MW, and full commissioning is planned for 2027.\nNorges is reported to be the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund driven by the country’s oil and gas sector. It has been an investor in renewable energy since 2021 starting with a Dutch wind farm. Last year it invested in wind energy assets in the UK and solar power in Spain."

Without slowing or maneuvering,Solongrammed the port side of the anchored product tankerStena Immaculate, penetrating two tanks.\nStena Immaculatethird mate Jeffrey Griffin told SIU that he was working out on deck at the time of the accident.\n“All I could see was something big and blue heading toward us. I immediately knew, it’s not going to miss us,\" Griffin said. \"I was front and center when it allided between the seven port and six port cargo tanks. There was a great big loud crunching noise. That was followed by a whole lot of fire.\"\nAt first, the crew responded with shock and amazement. Those inside the deckhouse and belowdecks felt the vibration and knew something was wrong.\n\"It wasn't a huge jolt. I remember looking through the fog and . . . I could faintly see the white outline of the house of the other ship. And then that first fireball happened,\" recalled OS Benjamin Brown.\nThe crew ran out hoses and began to lay down foam to suppress the flames on deck. Two officers remained forward on the bow, and the firefighting efforts were successful enough that they could slip past and get back to the deckhouse.\nAfter half an hour of battling the fire, the master instructed the crew to abandon ship. \"I won't say we were close to putting out the fire, but we were doing well,\" Griffin said. \"I was about to do a muster when we heard the words, forget the muster, abandon ship.\nThe crew mustered at the lifeboat, and after the second mate confirmed all were aboard, they gravity-launched into the water and motored off. The bosun noted that there was burning fuel on the water surface during their escape. Despite fumes from the fire and heavy smoke, they were unharmed, and were quickly rescued by nearby good Samaritan vessels.\nGriffin said that he was already prepared to ship out again. \"I’m a little shaken but I’m ready to go back to work. The fire – it happened. The abandon ship – it happened. We trained for it, we prepared for it, and everybody survived, so we obviously are doing something right,\" he told SIU.\nStena Immaculate'scargo will be pumped off for safety, and the ship will be towed to Newcastle for a port of refuge. One crewmember of the boxshipSolongis missing and presumed dead; the master of theSolonghas been arrested on negligent manslaughter charges, and Stena and operator Crowley have sued the Solong's owner for damages.\nThe owner, a subsidiary of Ernst Russ, is setting up a claims fund in the UK as proceedings begin. The firm has brought a limitation of liability case in UK admiralty court, which would limit the total claims amount to the value of the ship and her cargo."

        "content": "\nSmart shipowners are getting prepared to pass any extra U.S. fees for Chinese ships onwards to their charterers, insulating the owner from the impact of millions of dollars in extra regulatory cost per port call. Special new charter party clauses will ensure that U.S. exporters and importers - not shipowners - will bear the extra near-term cost, says Genco CEO John Wobensmith.\nGenco is the largest U.S.-headquartered bulker operator, and has a substantial number of Chinese-built vessels in its fleet. As such, it is exposed to the proposed port fees on Chinese tonnage, written by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). If the fee structure is adopted as written, Chinese-built ships - and any global operators who use Chinese-built ships elsewhere - would have to pay millions of dollars for every port call in the United States. Exporters would also be required to ship an increasing percentage of their goods on U.S.-flagged tonnage, and eventually on scarce U.S.-built tonnage, raising costs for export shipments and creating new employment options for U.S. mariners.\nMultiple shipowners have described deep changes to their business if the fees go into effect. U.S.-based ro/ro liner ACL says that it will go out of business in the United States, and multiple ocean carriers have said that they will narrow their port calls down to a few major gateways to minimize fees. Genco's Wobensmith told Bloomberg that he shares USTR's goal of strengthening American shipping, but in the near term, his firm has two options: exit the U.S. market and focus on the rest of the world, which accounts for 90 percent of its business; or pass the extra U.S. costs on to the end user.\nIt's already using the latter strategy. To ensure that it does not get caught bearing unexpected new costs, Genco's charter parties now include clauses that require the charterer to pay for any new U.S. port charges, whatever they happen to be.\nIn reality, these two strategies (leave or pass on charges) are closely linked. The extra expense of the port fees will make some ag commodities \"uncompetive\" compared to foreign producers, Wobensmith said, as American farming interests have previously warned. Soy exports \"will come almost to a grinding halt,\" he said. For these cargoes, the extra pass-on charges may end the market, requiring shipowners with Chinese tonnage to leave.\nTop image courtesyBernard Spragg / public domain"

They received reports of six incidents between March 28 and 30 prompting the continued caution based on the increase in activity so far in 2025.\nAs with the incidents earlier this year, the perpetrators seem more brazen in their efforts but during the last incidents there was no direct interaction and none of the crewmembers were attacked. Other incidents in 2025 have included crewmembers being assaulted and tied up, but as with the prior incidents in several of the cases in the past few days, the boarders appeared to be armed.\nThree vessels were boarded in a period of one and a half hours on March 30, between 0125 and 0255 all in the Phillip Channel in the eastbound lane in the Singapore Strait. This area has seen a concentration of piracy activity in 2025.\nAmong the ships boarded was the containershipKota Halus(18,872 dwt with a capacity of 1,080 TEU) which is operating for Pacific International Line (PIL). Three perpetrators were seen aboard the vessel, but they jumped overboard into a small boat when discovered. A search showed that they had entered an air conditioning room and a portable welding machine was missing.\nIn the other two incidents on March 30, bulkers were boarded,Junior(92,995 dwt) andAndreas Petrakis(76,000 dwt), in each case by a single perpetrator. In both cases, the person fled when discovered and the ships reported nothing was stolen.\nFour perpetrators were sighted aboard theWan Hai 327(37,160 dwt) containership on March 29. They were moving between a small boat and the stern of the ship but also fled. Nothing was stolen. About an hour earlier that same day, five perpetrators were seen aboard a VLCC tanker,Agneta Pallas III(319,000 dwt). They also fled without taking anything from the ship.\nThe containership Selatan Damai (8,150 dwt with a capacity of 28 TEU) was boarded on March 28. The vessel, which also operates for PIL, reported four individuals were sighted going to the engine room. They escaped from the ship but the crew said that some engine spares were stolen.\n\n\n\nReCAAP emphasizes that there have now been 35 incidents reported in 2025 in the area around the Straits of Malacca and Singapore versus just 11 in 2024. A total of 18 incidents were in March, while 12 took place in February.\nShips are being told to intensify vigilance and maintain a sharp lookout while transiting the area. ReCAAP has also repeated its urging for the littoral states to increase patrols and surveillance in their waters."

        "content": "\nThe offshore wind energy industry in the United States continues to face challenges with four project developers each filing in the past few days to pause their state-level regulatory reviews. The developers are reported to be citing “uncertainties” in the U.S. market or seeking to create protections based on potential future actions by the Trump administration.\nDonald Trump placed the industry under review after returning to the White House. He has repeatedly spoken against the industry citing assertions that it was not economically viable. He ordered the Department of the Interior to review the process and ordered a halt to future permitting during the review. This came after the Biden administration completed the review of several projects late in 2024 and early 2025.\nMassachusetts officials confirmed that negotiations with both Avangrid’s New England Wind 1 and SouthCoast Wind which is being developed by a partnership between EDP Renewables and ENGIE had not yet completed their power purchase agreements. The deadline was March 31, but for the third time they have failed to complete the deals, twice since Trump returned to the presidency. The companies have set a new deadline of June 30 with a target for late August to present the deals to Massachusetts.\nBoth projects are working to set new agreements after the developers in 2023 canceled prior purchase agreements due to changing costs. The joint venture OceanWinds paid a fine of $60 million while Avangrid paid $42 million to terminate the power purchase agreements.\nMedia reports indicate the companies are seeking to build protections into the new agreements against potential changes in policy from the Trump administration. The media is writing that state officials have said Trump’s opposition is “making it difficult” to complete the power purchase agreements. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved the construction plan for New England 1 in July 2024 and SouthCoast in January 2025. Massachusetts reselected both projects in September 2024 for power agreements.\nAdditional uncertainty came as the town of Nantucket filed an appeal against BOEM’s approval for SouthCoast. They filed a suit in U.S. District Court claiming that the review did not consider the full impact and how the project would hurt the town’s tourism industry. Additionally, a local activist group is challenging the Environmental Protection Agency calling for a reassessment of permits for New England Wind 1 as well as other projects.\nThe New Jersey Board of Public Utilities last week also withdrew consideration for Attentive Wind’s project planned for 42 miles off the central New Jersey coast. The Press of Atlantic City newspaper is reporting the development. The indication is that developer Attentive Wind is seeking a one-year extension for a $37.3 million payment as part of the state approval process.\nMaine’s Public Utilities Commission last week also reported that it was suspending negotiations with Mitsubishi which is working on the Pine Tree Offshore Wind project. It is part of a research project to develop a floating offshore wind array for the Gulf of Maine. The commission wrote in its order that Mitsubishi requested the pause citing “recent shifts in the energy landscape that have in particular caused uncertainty in the offshore wind industry.”\nAnxiety over the status of the U.S. industry was further increased when in March a court permitted the EPA to withdraw a permit for the Atlantic Shores project in New Jersey.  The permit related to the installation of the offshore wind farm and the move reversed actions by the Biden administration to clear the project for construction.\nSeveral other U.S. projects that were already underway are continuing despite the uncertainties created by the Trump administration."

        "content": "Norway marked a milestone in its efforts to be a leader in green shipping with the introduction of the first of two vessels that will be powered with bio-methanol. The containerships which are operating in a partnership between North Sea Container Line and MPC Container Ships will expand Norway’s trade with Europe while also lowering emissions.\nNCL Vestlandis the first of the two vessels and today, April 1, they celebrated the naming and entry into service of the ship, with her sister shipNCL Nordlandto follow. The ships wereorderedin 2023 under a program in part sponsored by the Norwegian government to advance green shipping. The project received NOK 13.7 million (US$1.3 million) in funding from Enova SF, the state enterprise owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, and NOK 60 million (US$5.7 million) from the NOx fund (Næringslivets NOx-fond), the Norwegian business sector’s fund to reduce emissions.\nThe ships were built by China’s Taizhou Sanfu Ship Engineering and are fitted with dual-fuel engines capable of operating on conventional fuel or green methanol. The newbuilds will reduce NCL’s overall CO2 emissions by 50 percent, compared to the existing NCL fleet, when operating on diesel. In 2025, NCL will operate the vessels with a 5 percent blend of bio-methanol and the strategy is to gradually increase the bio-methanol going forward. NCL has signed an agreement with Equinor for the sourcing of the methanol and the vessels will be bunkering in Norway.\nThe hull, which is 149 meters (489 feet) in length, along with the propellers, and onboard systems are designed for maximum energy efficiency. The ships are each equipped with a 250 kWh battery pack and the capability to use shore power. Each ship has a capacity of 1,300 TEU. They feature an \"Open Top\" design which the companies highlight minimizes the need for crew on deck, further enhancing safety. The electric cranes on deck are designed to enhance efficiency when in port, independent of onshore infrastructure providing increased flexibility in the ports they can access.\nThe plan calls for three older vessels to be replaced by the two new ships, each of which has a 40 percent greater container capacity compared to the ships currently operating the feeder service. As such, NCL reports that the vessels will achieve a 63 percent reduction in energy capacity per TEU per nautical mile.\nThe ships are operating under a 15-year chart to NCL and have long-term contracts for transportation from Norway including with Elkem, a provider of silicon-based materials. With stops at key industry hubs in Norway, Elkem says they will enable larger weekly shipments of its silicon products to European customers in sectors such as automotive manufacturing, construction, renewable energy, and the defense industry, and enable growth and jobs along the Norwegian coast.\n“These state-of-the-art vessels will play a significant role in transporting Norwegian goods and strategic silicon metals and materials to the continent, cementing Norway’s position as an important and reliable supplier of critical inputs for European industries,” said Morten Viga, CFO of Elkem.\nThe vessel will operate between Stokmarknes and Rotterdam, Bremerhaven, calling at Salten, Mo i Rana, Orkanger, Averøy, Ålesund, Svelgen, Bergen, Haugesund, and Tananger. It will supply Europe with strategically important minerals, fish food, and other commodities via the ports of Bremerhaven and Rotterdam.\nNCL highlights this is the first of three zero-emission capable vessels it will be introducing. In addition to the two methanol-fueled feeders, NCL will operate the world’sfirst ammonia-powered container vesselin a project with ammonia-producer Yara International and its subsidiary Yara Clean Energy and the support of the Norwegian Government through its Enova investment fund. The ammonia-powered feeder project was announced in 2023 with a target of starting operations in 2026."

        "content": "The Australian government confirmed it is tracking the movements of a Chinese research vessel that many believe is also a spy ship as it sails along the Southern Coast. While the vessel has done nothing considered improper, it is drawing wide attention in the Australian media which prompted Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to tell reporters, “I would prefer that it wasn’t there.”\nThe Tan Suo Yi Haodeparted Wellington, New Zealand on March 23 and its AIS signal shows it is bound for Sanya, China where it is due on April 30. However, instead of taking a northern course, the vessel transited the Tasman Sea, between New Zealand and Australia, crossed the Bass Strait, and is now traveling along the southern coast of Australia.  It has not requested a port stop in Australia.\nThe media was quick to highlight that it is the same route that Chinese warships took last month after conducting live-fire exercises that also raised concern in Australia. Concerns over the vessel’s purpose were further increased when China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun largely declined to respond to a question when asked during his regular briefing for the media.\n“I would like to emphasize that China has always carried out normal maritime activities in relevant waters in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I hope the Australian side will view it correctly and not be suspicious or make unwarranted speculations,” said Guo. He directed the question to the relevant authorities.\nThe vessel operates as one of three ships for China’s Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering (IDSSE) within the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It was built in 1984 as an offshore supply vessel and converted between 2014 to 2016 to its role as a research ship. China reports the vessel, which is 5,000 gross tons, has 11 research labs and supports two submersibles, one capable of nearly 15,000 feet (4,500 meters) and the other going to 32,800 feet (10,000 meters).\nIn 2016, it carried out China's first 10,000-meter and deepest exploration along the Mariana Trench. It again set a depth record on the Mariana Trench in 2020 of 10,900 meters.\nAlbanese told reporters that they were aware of the vessel’s presence. He said he was confident in the Australian Defense Force which was tracking the ship’s movements. The media reports note the presence of undersea cables in the area where the vessel is sailing as well as other critical infrastructure in the region.\n“It’s been in New Zealand on a joint research operation and this isn’t the first time that a similar vessel has been around the Australian coast. It occurred in 2020, just to give one example. Australia, as you would expect, is monitoring this,” Albanese said in response to reporter’s questions on Monday."

According to the Japan Self Defense Force, the task force was spotted east of Taiwan, positioned to interdict vessels arriving from the Pacific and the Philippine Sea.\nPolitical science professor Ja Ian Ching of the National University of Singapore told Bloomberg that the political objective of China's drills is to \"weaken confidence in U.S. deterrence\" and display how far the Chinese military can go in operating near Taiwan.\n\"The Taiwan question is purely China’s internal affairs that brook no external interference,\" asserted Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun in a press conference Tuesday. \"The DPP authorities are hellbent on seeking 'Taiwan independence,' and attempt to solicit external support for that agenda . . . The historical trend that China will and must achieve reunification is unstoppable.\""

        "content": "\nThe Ningbo Maritime Safety Administration confirmed that one seafarer died and three others were injured last weekend when a domestic container ship and a domestic dry bulk carrier collided. The collision happened overnight in the early morning hours of March 29 in a busy area near the Ningbo port complex.\nThe report indicates that the collision took place between a brand new containership,Ningyuan Beilun(15,000 dwt) which had been delivered at the end of February to Ningbo Ocean Shipping. The vessel is part of the domestic feeder carrier’s expansion efforts. The open-hatch containership was departing Ningbo carrying 934 TEU.\nIt collided with the dry bulk carrierJianghai Zhida 66(14,000 dwt). The vessel entered service in May 2023. It is unclear if it was loaded when the collision occurred. It had a crew of 13 aboard.\nThe bulker immediately began taking on water and according to the reports sank in just five minutes. The Safety Administration reports the rescue operation lasted four hours to locate the crewmembers from the water. Nine were recovered uninjured and three were taken to a hospital. One person was deceased when they recovered the body.\nDamage to the containership is reported to be minor. The vessel is being held in the Zhoushan Anchorage pending the investigation.\nNingbo Ocean had just celebrated the entry of the new vessel into service highlighting with its delivery its fleet reached a new level. The company said its total capacity now exceeds 50,000 TEU. It is one of eight ships in this class, each with a length of 136 meters (446 feet). The company said they have a higher transportation efficiency, larger loading capacity, and provide better energy-savings. The company is now operating a total of over 100 ships owned or chartered and serving 40 routes."

        "content": "\nJapan’s NYK Group highlights that it has become one of the largest operators of LPG carriers as part of its growth strategy. The company last year agreed to take over the shipping business from ENEOS and reports it completed the acquisition on schedule, today April 1, for an estimated cost of just over $500 million.\nIt was a two-stage transaction that first saw ENEOS, a Japanese petroleum company, transfer its LPG carriers, chemical and product tankers, and cargo ships into a newly formed subsidiary ENEOS Ocean. That represented the bulk of its shipping operations but excluded the company’s 12 crude oil tankers which it retains. In the second stage of the transaction, NYK acquired 80 percent ownership of ENEOS Ocean which was rebranded today as NYK Energy Ocean (NEO). ENEOS retains 20 percent ownership.\nWhen the agreement was announced in July 2024, ENEOS cited the “increasing burden of investment driven by the rising cost of vessels, complicated by global environmental regulations.” It highlighted the focus on reducing CO2 emissions as well as the need for a digital transformation to improve both safety and operational efficiency.\n“We are convinced that conducting business under a new owner better equipped to devise a growth strategy in the global shipping sector will be optimal,” ENEOS said explaining the reasoning for the sale. NYK has cited its pursuit of growth including a strategy focusing on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance). In its energy transportation business, NYK Group reports it will be strengthening its LNG/LPG carrier business as a growth business and is aiming to fulfill its responsibility for stable energy transportation as an infrastructure company.\nNEO now operates 47 vessels, including 18 LPG carriers, 18 chemical and product tankers, and 11 cargo ships, all taken over from ENEOS Ocean. Together with the 16 LPG carriers currently operated by NYK, the NYK Group has become one of the world's largest operators of LPG carriers.\nThe NYK Group is also expanding its operations in LNG carriers. It is part of the expansion with QatarEnergy with a contract for five 174,000 cbm LNG carriers building at China’s Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding with deliveries starting in 2025. The company also struck a new deal with JERA and in December 2024 took delivery on a new LNG carrier it is operating for a subsidiary of Kyushu Electric Power Co.\nIn its last annual report (March 2024), NYK reported it was operating nearly 200 vessels owned or chartered in its energy group. Over half its fleet of 824 vessels operates in dry bulk."

        "content": "\nResearchers from the University of Manchester have discovered astonishing quantities of microplastics in the organs of loggerhead sea turtles, particularly in the reproductive organs of males. It is the first study of its kind, and if representative of the condition of the population at large, the results suggest serious potential effects on reproduction and vitality for the iconic species.\nThe team obtained the remains of ten loggerheads that were caught up as bycatch in fishing nets in the Mediterranean. Musculature and vital organs in both male and female examples contained high levels of microplastics, including the liver, kidney and heart. 98.8 percent of all tested samples contained foreign particles, and 70 percent contained microplastics.\nThe ultra-tiny particles measured about 15 microns, and researchers were surprised to find so many of these solid contaminants migrating from the turtles' gut into all kinds of soft tissue.  The majority of particles came from the kinds of plastic used to make synthetic clothing and packaging, notably plastic bags, which the turtles often mistake for jellyfish and consume by accident. Plastics can stay in a turtle's gut from 40-120 days, depending on the turtle's activity level and whether there are blockages caused by the plastic. The turtles may also have picked up microplastics by rooting in contaminated bottom sediment, inhaling sea air containing plastic fibers, or consuming prey that already contained contaminants.\nReproductive organs contained an average of 15 particles per gram, ranging as high as 25. Heart tissue contained up to seven particles per gram.\n\"Exposure to MPs in reproductive organs can cause reproductive toxicity, and be vectors for contaminants and additives that can disrupt the endocrine system (EDCs), such as bisphenol A and PCBs and phthalates,\" the researchers noted. \"Microplastics accumulation can lead to a suite of sublethal physiological impacts that are likely to be far less conspicuous, and harder to detect at both the individual and population level.\""

Earlier this year they announced plans to rebrand away from Resorts World Cruises back to the traditional brand names as part of the future growth strategy for the company.\nStar Cruises was launched 30 years ago and became known as one of the pioneers of modern cruising in Asia. The brand went on to build cruise ships at Meyer Werft in Germany and in 2000 acquired the faltering Norwegian Cruise Line which had been one of the pioneers in North America. After rehabilitating Norwegian including the introduction of “freestyle cruising” (cruising without schedules or assigned dining arrangements) the company also launched Dream Cruises in Asia as a premium brand.\nThe 2022 bankruptcy of the German shipyard owned by the company, MV Werften, caused the collapse of the parent company and its cruise lines. The ships were sold but Genting was able to reestablish the business as Resorts World Cruises with two of its former ships. Last year, the company acquired the 77,400 gross tons built in 1997 by Fincantieri and operates as P&O Cruises Australia’sPacific Explorer.\nRenamedStar Voyagerand having completed a $50 million refit, the cruise ship returned to service on March 26 in Singapore and March 29 in Indonesia. The ship will be sailing a circuit between Singapore, Jakarta, Melaka, and Ho Chi Minh City officially relaunching the brand as StarCruises. She is joined by the rechristenedStar Navigator(77,300 gross tons), introduced in 1999 asSuperStar Virgo. She resumed sailing in 2023 asResorts World Oneand operates seasonally from Singapore and Taiwan.\n“We are thrilled and honored to return to our roots with the launch of the revitalized StarCruises and Dream Cruises brands, offering an enhanced cruising experience,\" said Michael Goh, President of StarCruises and Dream Cruises. “To celebrate this milestone, we are also excited to introduce theStar Voyager, as she embarks on her maiden voyage from Singapore, exploring the wonders of Southeast Asia.”\nStarCruises will be positioned as an affordable cruise brand with the two ships. The group says its focus will be on ships with accommodations for approximately 2,000 passengers.\nDream Cruises was also restarted as the premium brand within the group. It will continue to operate theGenting Dream(150,600 gross tons). The ship was built for the company by Meyer Werft and entered service in 2016. It sails year-round from Singapore."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Denmark's A.P. Moller Holding (APMH), an investment company and the parent company of the A.P. Moller Group, believes that tug and towing company Svitzer has failed to gain a proper valuation from the investment community. A year after the company was spun off from Maersk, the parent company now wants to take Svitzer private in a deal valued at about 9 billion kroner ($1.3 billion).\nSvitzer, which had been part of A.P. Moller-Maersk for 45 years, demerged from the shipping giant last year in a move that was described as a “natural next chapter” for the towage company’s growth journey. Listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, APMH is currently the largest shareholder in Svitzer with a 47 percent stake and it is offering a 31.3 percent premium compared to the three-month volume-weighted average price for the remaining shares, or DKK 285 (approximately $41.25) per share.\nAPMH says that the listing has done little to create the desired platform for growth that is essential for maintaining Svitzer’s market position in a competitive and fragmented industry undergoing consolidation. If the status quo is maintained, it says this could have detrimental effects in terms of limiting Svitzer’s ability to pursue opportunities in the market.\n“Since Svitzer was listed, the company has consistently delivered results above expectations. However, we have not seen this reflected in the valuation of the share, which means that the listing has not offered a foundation from which Svitzer can grow,” said Martin Larsen, APMH's chief finance officer.\nHe added that Svitzer would be better supported through private ownership and that, with the financial support of APMH, the company would be better positioned to strengthen its market position and capitalize on the opportunities in the market.\nSvitzer’s independent directors agreed announcing they supported the cash offer after carefully considering the offer and alternative options for the shareholders. They highlighted the offer is a 42.5 percent premium compared to the opening price on the first day of trading after the spin-off. APMH reports it has already secured support for the offer from other shareholders, meaning it now has control of 61 percent of Svitzer’s share capital. APMH requires approval from 90 percent of Svitzer’s shareholders to complete the transaction and delist Svitzer. They are targeting the beginning of May to complete the transaction.\n“We aim to secure Svitzer's market position and growth and are offering an attractive price above the highest historical closing price and well above current trading, reflecting Svitzer’s strong performance,” noted Larsen.\nUpon completion of the deal, Svitzer will remain an independent firm with its current management and strategy. Svitzer recorded another solid year in its financial performance last year. Revenues rose by 8.9 percent to 6.3 billion kroner ($911 million) from 5.7 billion kroner ($824.2 million) in 2023. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased to 1.8 billion kroner ($260.3 million) from 1.6 billion kroner ($231.4 million).\nSvitzer reported today that during the first two months of 2025, its revenues were up 2.6 percent while EBITDA earnings declined by approximately 1 percent. The financial performance it reported was driven mainly by positive development in the Americas operating segment, while harbor towage overall decreased by 4.8 percent. In March, Svitzer reported that it expects revenues in 2025 to grow by around 1-5 percent and that EBITDA earnings would grow by around 0-7 percent compared to 2024. Svitzer was founded in 1833 and serves approximately 2,000 customers in more than 140 ports and 40 terminals across 37 countries and said it expects to invest up to $190 million CAPEX in 2025."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Stena Line, one of Europe's leading ferry companies and a pioneer with advanced designs, presented its latest thinking for Stena Futuro, a RoRo that would reduce energy usage by 20 percent or more. The company’s goal is an overall 30 percent reduction in its CO2 emissions by 2030.\n“The mission is to develop the most efficient and competitive vessel possible for a specific cargo capacity, using today’s available technology. The goal is for the vessel to have the lowest fuel consumption on the market,” says Nicolas Bathfield, Project Manager at Stena Teknik, who has been involved in developing the concept.\nStena Futuro would be a 240-meter (787-foot) long RoRo vessel intended for transporting semi-trailers and cars. Stena Teknik, a resource within the group for all its business units, is exploring the full range of technologies to advance the efficiency of this next-generation vessel. The group is focused on newbuilds as well as the energy and digital transformation mostly in the maritime sectors.\n\n\n\nStena Line's latest concept for the new generation of vessels uses a low and streamlined design to reach its ambitions. The hull and superstructure have been optimized to achieve the most efficient use of cargo space possible. At the same time, low weight and optimized hydro- and aerodynamics are central to achieving low fuel consumption. The hull of Stena Futuro would also be equipped with an air lubrication system.\nThe concept for Stena Futuro also includes four 40-meter (131-foot) tall wing sails, which can be retracted when needed — for example, when passing under a bridge. Recently, Stena’s developers, together with the Swedish research institute RISE, have conducted tests and simulations of the sails’ usage to document both energy savings and how the sails affect the ship’s maneuverability and safety.\n\n\n\n“The tests showed that Stena Futuro’s sails could potentially result in as much as 15 percent fuel savings. We also confirmed that the vessel meets all requirements for stability and maneuverability in scenarios such as sudden wind shifts or quick course changes,” says Bathfield.\nThe vessel would also have hybrid propulsion, batteries, and engines with low fuel consumption that can run on several different fuels. The battery system makes it ready to partly operate the vessel on electricity alone, for example, when entering and leaving ports. Solar panels will also contribute to the ship’s electricity needs. A waste heat recovery system will make it possible to reuse the hot exhaust gases from the ship’s engines to meet other onboard heating needs as well as supporting electric power generation.\nStena says the ship design will play a vital part in its future tonnage planning in the coming years. Currently, however, there is no finalized plan for the production of Stena Futuro."

He was 115 days into his latest record-setting adventure when the support team advised that based on damages and equipment malfunctions on the rowboat, he needed to abandon the attempt to cross the Indian Ocean to Australia.\nKobyakov, who holds previous records including crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat in 46 days and the best 24-hour distance (110 miles), had set out from Patagonia in South America on December 5. He covered approximately 11,000 km (6,835 miles) crossing the South Atlantic in 68 days. He was south of Madagascar and nearing Reunion Island, 5,000 km (3,100 miles) from Australia with the team saying it would have conservatively taken two more months to complete the trip. They also emphasized that he would have reached Australia in winter adding to the difficulties of the journey. At 115 days it was not his longest trip, which is reported at 154 days in the Pacific.\nThe 73-year-old was reluctant as he had never before abandoned one of his boats. Consulting with his support team he however confirmed the weather conditions had proved extreme with cold and waves up to 40 feet resulting in the vessel experiencing multiple capsizes. His autopilot unit had stopped working, the four onboard wind indicators had failed, and his main desalination unit had failed leaving him on a backup unit.\n\n\nKonyukhov in February 2025 as he was crossing the South Atlantic to Africa\n\nWorking with the National Sea Rescue Institute of South Africa, the team determined the Chinese-owned bulkerOre Hong Kongwas 400 miles away from his position and agreed to undertake the rescue. When the vessel approached his position from the AIS signal, they were able to establish radio contact with Kobyakov.\nThe challenge remained to get him aboard the massive bulk carrier. They maneuvered the vessel close and tried a net. Then they fired a towline and Kobyakov was able to tie it to his rowboat. They pulled his boat under the stern of the dry cargo carrier and dropped a storm ladder meaning he had to climb at least 22 meters (72 feet) in his weather suit and boots. The crew also dropped lines to pull his personal effects and radio equipment on the vessel.\n\n\nKonyukhov was rescued by Ore Hong Kong (Telegram posting)\n\nKonyukhov reported it was a challenging climb even for a man who twice surmounted Mt. Everest. He got the rhythm and made it safely aboard. He was taken to the infirmary for the first days and now is in a cabin on the vessel. The bulker was sailing from Brazil to China and now Kobyakov has to wait till April 20 till the vessel reaches the port of Qingdao, China. He reports he is being well treated, getting his first nights in a bed with sheets, but the Asian food is spicy.\nHe was forced to abandon his rowboat. They sealed the vessel’s hatches and left the AIS transmitter going. The support team reports they are tracking the vessel as it drifts eastward toward Australia."

        "content": "\nAs the security situation in the Baltic grows more complex, Denmark plans to bulk up its navy with two dozen new vessels and an array of unmanned systems.\n\"The naval battlefield is characterized by a more complex risk and threat picture than before, rapid technological development and a Russia that has become more willing to escalate its course towards the West. Therefore, with the naval plan, we are initiating several urgent acquisitions that address specific challenges and threats that we face now and in the coming years,\" said Minister of Defense Troels Lund Poulsen.\nThe \"urgent\" track includes acquirting drones, unmanned units and equipment for subsea infrastructure monitoring. The risk of covert attacks on the seabed is real: NATO nations in the Baltic have experienced repeated subsea cable damage from merchant vessel anchor-dragging, some of which is believed to be deliberate. In addition, unidentified suspects blew up three of the four Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic in 2022, an unprecedented maritime security breach.\nThe order list includes four multipurpose ships that can be used for maritime surveillance, pollution response and mine laying. Denmark's existing pollution-prevention vessels are nearing end of life, and \"it is common sense that the [replacement] vessels can assist with naval military tasks such as maritime surveillance, monitoring of critical underwater infrastructure and mine laying in light of the security policy situation,\" said Minister of Public Security Torsten Schack Pedersen.\nThe Danish Navy's Home Guard will also get 21 new vessels for patrol duties. Down the road, the newbuild program includes options for buying a new class of frigates and vessels for open-ocean operation in the Arctic and the North Atlantic.\nGiven recent tensions over Danish-controlled Greenland, U.S. weapons systems appear unlikely to make the naval procurement list. The chairman of Denmark's parliamentary defense committee said last month that he regretted buying $3 billion worth of American-made F-35 fighters, because the U.S. could potentially shut off the parts supply chain for leverage.\n\"Buying American weapons is a security risk that we cannot run. We will make enormous investments in air defense, fighter jets, artillery, and other weapons in the coming years, and we must avoid American weapons if at all possible,\" said Rasmus Jarlov of the Conservative People's Party."

In a press conference Wednesday, Trump said that the U.S. would impose a tariff equal to half of each nation's rate on U.S. goods, as a \"kind\" discounted reciprocal charge.\nMost of the nations facing the steepest U.S. tariff hikes are developing countries in the Indo-Pacific, including Cambodia (49 percent), Laos, Madagascar, Vietnam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand (36 percent). Vietnam and Thailand have relevance for American industry, as they have become hubs for Chinesemanufacturerslooking to source inexpensive labor and evade American tariffs.\nChina is the most important trade partner on the list, and will be subject to a rate of 34 percent, higher than many analysts predicted. The new tariff stacks on top of a previously-declared 20 percent rate on Chinese goods, so it will bump the net rate on China's exports to a total of 54 percent.\nTaiwan - which supplies most of the advanced semiconductors used in the U.S. market - will be subject to a rate of 32 percent. European goods will be subject to a flat 20 percent rate for all member states, from Hungary to Germany.\nLIBERATION DAY RECIPROCAL TARIFFS ????????pic.twitter.com/ODckbUWKvO\nCanada and Mexico will be treated separately from the rest of the global list, and are still subject to previously-announced 25 percent tariffs, according to the Wall Street Journal. Likewise, Russia, Cuba, Belarus and North Korea are not covered; a White House spokesperson told Axios that they were left off because they already face significant sanctions and barriers to U.S. trade.\nSome commodities will be treated differently. The new country-by-country tariff schedule does not apply to copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, bullion, and \"energy and other certain minerals.\" The semiconductor exclusion will be of particular relief for Taiwan and for U.S. tech companies.\nA separate new tariff of 25 percent on all foreign-built autos takes effect immediately, with repercussions for ro/ro carriers. The administration's 25 percent tariff on foreign steel and aluminum also remains in effect.\nThe new tariffs take full effect on April 9, giving time for bilateral talks with affected nations. \"The silver lining for investors could be that this is only a starting point for negotiations with other countries and ultimately tariff rates will come down across the board,\" Northlight Asset Management chief investment officer Chris Zaccarelli told the Wall Street Journal.\nSome anomalies on the initial public list have attracted attention. Lesotho, a small landlocked nation surrounded by South Africa, was hit with the highest U.S. tariff rate on the schedule, 50 percent. France's island territories of Reunion, Saint Pierre and Miquelon received elevated tariffs of 37 percent and 50 percent, respectively. The list released by the White House also imposed a 10 percent tariff on the Heard and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian territory in Antarctic waters. The formallistattached to the executive order is shorter, and it omits these entries."

        "content": "The only heavy icebreaker in the U.S. Coast Guard fleet USCGPolar Stararrived back in San Francisco completing her annual deployment to Antarctica and now she is preparing for the final phase of her ongoing life extension. Commissioned in 1976, the USCG needs to keep her operation until at least 2030 when the much-delayed next-generation heavy icebreaker is anticipated to be delivered.\nPolar Stardeparted Seattle bound for Antarctica on November 22, 2024. She traveled over 25,000 miles through the North Pacific, South Pacific, and Southern Oceans returning to San Francisco on March 30. It was a 128-day deployment to Antarctica in support of Operation Deep Freeze (ODF) 2025, the annual joint military service mission to resupply and maintain the United States Antarctic Stations.\nThe vessel provides heavy icebreaking capabilities to facilitate sealift, seaport access, bulk fuel supply, and cargo handling for two of three permanent U.S. research stations in Antarctica, with NSF McMurdo Station being the largest. The cutter’s icebreaking capabilities enable the safe delivery of critical supplies to sustain year-round operations and support international partnerships in the harsh Antarctic environment.\nIn Antarctica, this year the cutter encountered 14 miles of fast ice up to six feet thick. At a length of 399 feet,Polar Staris 13,500 tons and has six diesel and three gas turbine engines producing up to 75,000 hp. This gives her the capability of breaking through ice up to 21 feet (6.4 meters) thick and can steam continuously through 6 feet (1.8 meters) of ice at 3 knots.\n\n\nThe only USCG heavy icebreaker, 49-year-old Polar Star will start the final phase of her life extension program (USCG)\n\nDuring this year’s deployment,Polar Starcreated a navigable route and cleared Winter Quarters Bay for two cargo vessels and HMNZSAotearoato reach NSF McMurdo Station. While operating in McMurdo Sound,Polar Star, andAotearoaconducted an at-sea crew exchange to build a shared understanding of each vessel’s unique capabilities in the polar regions.\nAt the conclusion of vessel operations at McMurdo Station, the cutter departed the Antarctic region on March 3 after 60 days.Polar Starmade two logistical stops in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Sydney en route to Antarctica. On its journey back to the United States,Polar Starmoored in French Polynesia for a community relations stopover.\n“But our work isn’t done,\" said Capt. Jeff Rasnake,Polar Star’s commanding officer. “As we wrap up ODF 25, we must quickly transition to the first phase of ODF 26 – heavy depot maintenance. There’s no time to waste as we work to ensurePolar Staris ready to roll into her 50th year of service.”\nPolar Starwill enter the final phase of its five-year Service Life Extension Project which is being conducted at Mare Island Dry Dock in Vallejo, California. It calls for recapitalizing targeted systems, including the cutter’s propulsion, communication, machinery control, and auxiliary systems, and conducting significant maintenance to extend the cutter’s service life. Each phase of the life extension has been coordinated so that operational commitments, like Operation Deep Freeze missions in Antarctica, would still be met.\nAccording to the Coast Guard, “Completing SLEP will significantly mitigate the risk of lost operational days due to unplanned maintenance or system failures by replacing obsolete, unsupportable, or maintenance-intensive equipment.”\nNext year’s Operation Deep Freeze will bePolar Star’s 29th and will coincide with 50th anniversary of her commissioning."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "As part of the “Zero Emission Ships Project” sponsored by The Nippon Foundation, Japan last week launched its first hydrogen dual-fuel tug. The vessel is pioneering using a high-power internal combustion engine with the industry seeking to develop expertise in the emerging sector.\nThe new tug was launched by Tsuneishi Shipbuilding on March 28 and is the first vessel in Japan to be equipped with a high-power output hydrogen dual-fuel internal combustion engine. It also has a high-pressure hydrogen gas storage system with a large capacity. With facilities to store approximately 250kg of high-pressure hydrogen gas, Tsuneishi says it will be possible to maintain the same operational performance as when using conventional fuel while also making use of hydrogen fuel. In the unlikely event of failure of the hydrogen fuel system, the vessel can operate with only traditional marine fuels, thus ensuring the same level of safety as conventional vessels.\n“We have successfully launched our first hydrogen-fuelled tugboat. We will utilize the know-how and design processes we have developed in the construction of hydrogen-fuelled tugboats, which require high power, in the construction of further new fuel vessels,” said Nishijima Takanori, General Manager of the Design Division and Managing Executive Officer of Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co.\n\n\nJapan's first hydrogen dual-fuel tug with an internal combustion engine (Tsuneishi Shipbuilding)\n\nThe shipbuilding notes that one of the challenges for tugboats is the need to be highly maneuverable and have high engine output to assist in berthing and opera operations of large vessels. This tugboat is installed with twin 12-cylinder hydrogen-blended engines (4,400 horsepower class), which will give it the needed capabilities. The vessel will be less than 300 gross tons with a length of 38 meters (125 feet).\nThe plan calls for operating with hydrogen in combination with traditional marine fuels. They are targeting reducing carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 60 percent compared to conventional tugboats that use traditional marine fuels.\nTo further enhance the project’s overall sustainability Tsuneishi is also incorporating “JGreeX” produced by JFE Steel Corporation, It is a green steel product that was used for all of its steel plates.Many projects are focusing on hydrogen fuel cells instead of internal combustion engines as hydrogen remains a technology in development as a marine fuel. The Port of Antwerp-Bruges and the Savery family’s CMB.TECH launched what they said was thefirst hydrogen-fueled tugin 2023.Hydrotug 1was also reported to be the largest vessel currently capable of operating solely on hydrogen. It is operating demonstrations in the port of Antwerp while CMB.TECH has developed other vessels including a crew transfer vessel using hydrogen."

        "content": "As part of Donald Trump’s vow to stop the “really bad people,” through his campaign of maximum pressure, the U.S. today, April 2, imposed sanctions on Russian businessmen sending aid to the Houthis. Among the activities the U.S. is citing is the stealing of Ukrainian grain from Crimea and shipping it to Yemen and it included the captains of the vessel among the sanctions.\n“The Houthis remain reliant on Sa’id al-Jamal and his network to procure critical goods to supply the group’s terrorist war machine,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “Today’s action underscores our commitment to degrading the Houthis’ ability to threaten the region through their destabilizing activities.”\nThe Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took action against a network of Houthi financial facilitators and procurement operatives working in coordination with Sa’id al-Jamal, a senior Houthi financial official backed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF). This network OFAC reports has procured tens of millions of dollars worth of commodities from Russia, including weapons and sensitive goods, as well as stolen Ukrainian grain, for onward shipment to Houthi-controlled Yemen.\nIn one effort, the U.S. reports in the summer and fall of 2024 at least two shipments of stolen Ukrainian grain were involved. They report it was loaded in Crimea on board the Russia-flaggedAM Theseus, also known as theZafar, and shipped to Yemen. The vessel which is 37,300 dwt and built in 2015 was acquired in 2023 by Hong Kong-based AM Asia M6 and has switched between flags in Russia and Palau and back to Russia.\nThe U.S. reports these shipments as well as other support were being orchestrated by Russia-based Afghan businessman Hushang Ghairat (Hushang) and his brother, Russia-based Afghan businessman Sohrab Ghairat (Sohrab) assisting Sa’id al-Jamal with Houthi commercial initiatives in Russia, including arms procurement. Hushang and Sohrab, at Sa’id al-Jamal’s direction, the U.S. says orchestrated the grain shipments.\nIn addition to the ship manager, the U.S. is also sanctioning Russian national Vyacheslav Vladimirovich Vidanov (Vidanov) who served as the captain of theAM Theseusduring some of the 2024 voyages between Crimea and Yemen, and Russian national Yuri Vladimirovich Belyakov (Belyakov) served as the vessel’s captain through the end of 2024.\nThe vessel was also listed and OFAC has also identified eight digital asset wallets used by the Houthis to transfer funds associated with their activities. Hushang, Sohrab, and Sa’id al-Jamal they report use financial facilitators to conduct financial transactions in support of the Houthis’ trade ventures involving Russia. Turkey-based Iranian money launderer Hassan Jafari (Jafari) has worked with Hushang and Sa’id al-Jamal to launder dollars on behalf of Sa’id al-Jamal’s network, enabling the network’s sanctions evasion schemes.  Jafari also arranged payments worth millions of dollars in support of shipments benefiting the Houthis.\nThe sanctions were announced as U.S. Central Command continues to report attacks on Houthi positions in Yemen. The last attack they highlighted was on March 31 more than two weeks after Trump launched the new campaign."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nRussia has shut down two out of three of the loading moorings at the Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal near Novorossiysk, on Russia's Black Sea coastline. The CPC pipeline handles 80 percent of Kazakhstan's oil exports, including volumes produced by American oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil, and it accounts for about one percent of all global oil supply.\nLast month, Russia's Federal Agency for Transport Supervision inspected two older moorings at the pipeline's offshore loading terminal. The snap inspection resulted in unspecified \"violations,\" according to CPC.\nRussian authorities ordered the two buoys taken out of service on April 1, reducing CPC export volume from 1.4 million barrels a day to about 700,000 barrels. There are no restrictions on the pipeline itself, and the third mooring at the terminal continues to operate as normal.\nThe decision hasn't had an immediate effect on production within Kazakhstan, but as storage begins to fill up, operators at the Caspian's prolific oilfields will likely have to begin shutting in production. The giant Tengiz field, operated by Chevron-led Tengizchevroil, is responsible for 700,000 barrels a day of Kazakh production and could be affected.\nChevron is investing a staggering $48 billion in expanding production at Tengiz. If successful, the program could boost output to nearly one million barrels a day by mid-2025 - if the CPC pipeline comes back online. The prolific output at the field has pushed Kazakhstan's annual production past its OPEC limits, and March set a new all-time record for Kazakh oilfields. If the terminal had not been partially shut down, the CPC pipeline would have exported about 1.7 million barrels per day in April.\n"

        "content": "In a first for Maersk’s operations, the group’s terminal company APM reports it acquired the 47-mile-long Panama Canal Railway Company from Canadian Pacific Kansas City and Lanco Group. While it is the first railroad operation in the company, executives highlighted that it is in keeping with Maersk’s intermodal logistics focus.\nNo price was cited for the railroad which is reported to generate revenues of $77 million and EBITDA earnings of $36 million annually. The railroad was rehabilitated in the early 2000s and reports it has a capacity for trains per day and 500,000 container moves annually while it was targeting expansion to a capacity of 2 million boxes. Reprots indicate it currently moves about 300,000 boxes annually, but its volume was up 20 percent in 2023 - 2024 when the drought reduced ship transits. It also operates passenger service between Colon and Panama City.\n“The Panama Canal Railway Company represents an attractive infrastructure investment in the region aligned to our core services of intermodal container movement,” said Keith Svendsen, CEO of APM Terminals.\nMaersk hadworked with the railroadin 2024 when it began sending containers across the isthmus by rail during the water shortage in the canal. Maersk separated one of its routes having ships exchanging boxes in Panama instead of making the transit. Some large containerships due to draft restrictions were also required to offload boxes for transit by rail during this time.\nThe railroad dates back to the 1850s and provided a vital cargo route long before the construction of the canal. It passed to the Panama Canal Company when the U.S. built the canal but by the 1970s was in decline. The lack of investment continued into the 1990s when it was reported the railroad was losing $4 million annually.\nKansas City Southern and Mi-Jack Products acquired the rights to the railroad in 1998 and began an $80 revitalization to relaunch the operations. They created a modern railway, but today the company calls it a non-core asset as it focuses on operations in North America after the merger with Canadian Pacific.\nThe sale of the railway comes as the transaction for control of the terminals at each end of the canal remains in doubt. Today, April 2, was CK Hutchison’s target date for completing the definitive deal with BlackRock and MSC’s TiL group. China confirmed it is reviewing the deal while media reports are indicating Hutchison may be reconsidering the sale after pressure from the Communist Chinese government.\nDonald Trump has continued to vow the U.S. will take control of the Panama Canal to remove Chinese influence over the operation. The railroad while separate is a vital part of the overall operation and could play a vital role as an alternate route similar to the efforts in 2024 during the drought."

It will open a key market for Canada as it launched the LNG industry shipping gas to Asia in competition with the U.S. and Australia which have been the traditional large suppliers.\nThe project calls itself the largest private sector investment in Canadian history. Construction began on the project in 2019 with an initial two trains and two docks to handle LNG carriers. The terminal will process up to 2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), representing approximately 11 percent of current Canadian gas output, or a total annual capacity of 14 million tonnes annually, and designed to potentially expand with two additional trains.LNG Canada is a joint venture company comprised of Shell, PETRONAS, PetroChina, Mitsubishi Corporation, and KOGAS. It is also the start of an industry that is expected to develop over the second half of this decade.\n\n\nCooldown cargo arrived from Australia as testing proceeds at the new facility in British Columbia (LNG Canada)\n\n“We’re pleased to announce that today, in a well-coordinated effort with HaiSea Marine personnel and tugboats, British Columbia Coast Pilots and Pacific Pilotage Authority Canada, with support from the Canadian Coast Guard and Canada Border Services Agency, our marine team welcomed for the first time an LNG carrier to the LNG Canada facility in Kitimat,” the company wrote online. Careful planning has gone into the process of moving the vessels along a 159-nautical mile route from an initial point near Prince Rupert to the terminal.\nThe initial LNG cargo arrived from Gladstone, Australia aboard theMaran Gas Roxana(95,194 dwt). It will be offloaded and used to test the systems during this phase of commissioning. It will cool down the pipes and storage tanks under cryogenic conditions preparing them for operations. LNG Canada reports it will only require this cargo and that this phase of testing and commissioning should last three to four weeks.\nAfter the vessel is offloaded, the pilots will complete their testing process navigating the vessel back to the Pacific. HalSea Marine also completed the commissioning of its tugs which are being used to escort the vessels during the trip to and from the terminal. Canadian authorities are requiring as a precaution escorts for all the LNG carriers.\nThe project is close to realizing its key milestones as production and shipments begin after years of planning and construction."

The port bow of the cruise ship was torn open, leaving a gaping hole measuring about 200 square feet in area. Remarkably, none of the 140 passengers and crewmembers on board were harmed, and no injuries were reported aboard the cargo vessel.\nAll of the hull damage was above the waterline, and both vessels remained able to transit safely.

        "content": "\nThe UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch released initial results from its ongoing investigation into the “very serious marine casualty” resulting from the containershipSolonghitting the anchored tankerStena Immaculate. While many of the details have already leaked in the media, it confirmed the now-arrested master of theSolongwas alone on the bridge despite the presence of fog in the area and functioning with no more than approximately seven hours of sleep between watches.\nThe Portuguese-flagged containership was moving at a speed of 16 knots having departed the prior evening from Grangemouth, Scotland, and on a planned passage to Rotterdam following a route the ship had used in the past. The master of the containership, Vladimir Motin, was on the bridge when the ship departed around 2000 on March 9, handed over the bridge at around 2400 to the second officer, and returned to the bridge at 0700 to assume the watch. He was the lone watchkeeper, despite requirements for a lookout at night and in foggy conditions, a violation that MAIB has emphasized in previous collision reports.\n“The visibility in the area north of the Humber light float was reported to be patchy and varying between 0.25 nautical miles (nm) and 2.0nm. NeitherSolongnorStena Immaculatehad a dedicated lookout on the bridge. At 0947,Solongcollided with the anchoredStena Immaculate’s port side on a heading (HDG) of 150° and speed over the ground (SOG) of about 16 knots (kts),” MAIB states in its interim report. It also says there was a slight swell of 1 meter.\nCrowley responded to the report with a statement highlighting, “It is important to note that watch requirements for vessels at anchor are different from ships that are underway. The Stena Immaculate was operating in compliance with applicable watch-standing safety regulations and Crowley company policies for an anchored vessel. We are confident that the forthcoming comprehensive investigation report will clarify the facts and circumstances of the incident, demonstrating that Crowley exercised appropriate vigilance.”\nThe report states that the tanker’s second officer was on watch. Crowley says the officer began a 12-hour lookout shift just before midnight.\nMAIB emphasizes in thereportthat the findings are preliminary and that the investigation into the accident is ongoing. It states among the factors it will be exploring are “the navigation and watchkeeping practices on board both vessels, manning, and fatigue management.”\nOther issues that will be considered in preparing the report include the use of the offshore area as an anchorage for vessels waiting to enter the Humber Estuary and the environmental conditions at the time of the allision. MAIB is also reviewing the condition and maintenance of the vessels.\nIt highlights that both vessels were above their minimum safe manning level and the efforts of the crews in managing the fires after impact. MAIB says the aviation fuel from theStena Immacualte’s damaged number 7 tank was released into the sea on the bow of theSolong. The heat generated by the force of the collision ignited the fires which spread to the contents of the containers on theSolong. It notes the severity of the fire hampered the efforts to find the missing seafarer on the containership and the efforts to control the situation before both ships were abandoned.\nIt had come out in court that the captain was alone on the bridge of the containership when he was formally charged with gross negligent manslaughter. He is due for another appearance in court this month with a tentative date of January 2026 set for the trial.\nThe release of the report comes as salvage efforts continue. Local officials from Lincolnshire on the east coast of England said this week they so far have retrieved approximately 11 tonnes of plastic pellets that washed up on the beaches mostly in burnt clumps. The priority has been on the clumps, but they expect there are large quantities still to be recovered.\nCrowley reported that the tankerFure Vyle(17,950 dwt) has been hired and was anchored near theStena Immaculateto begin the lightering of the remaining 202,485 barrels of Jet-A1 cargo from the damaged tanker. It will be shuttled to its original destination of Killingholme in the UK for the U.S. military while theStena Immaculatewill be towed to Newcastle upon Tyne for further inspection. Two ocean-going tugs appear to be working at theStena Immaculatewith theFure Vylestill standing by as of April 3.\nTheSolongarrived in Scotland on March 28. She was tied up in Aberdeen where she is being inspected.\n\n\nImages from the CCTV on Stena Immaculate from Crowley showing the impact released by MAIB\n"

The yard employs more than 500 people.\n\n\n\n\nThe fire was reported at 0950 local time on April 3 with the media indicating it was likely started by two welders working near spilled fuel. They were in one of the building sheds which is 1,500 square meters (more than 16,000 square feet). Some reports are saying it was one of the new facilities being prepared for automation and digital operations.\nResidents reported hearing explosions, which the Ministry is saying were gas canisters used at the shipbuilder. In one of the videos posted on Telegram, someone is heard yelling “get out” to the workers.\nThe Ministry said that two victims suffered burns to the upper respiratory tract and smoke inhalation and were hospitalized. A third person received medical care at the scene.\nLocal officials later told the media the fire had been contained by 1130 and extinguished by 1200. They said a cooling operation was underway."

With involvements from leaders across the segments of the industry, the project leaders believe it is a key step in decarbonization that provides critical insights into the feasibility of retrofit projects.\nThe project, which aimed to assess the techno-economic feasibility of a retrofit from fuel oil to dual-fuel methanol, has been granted an Approval in Principle (AiP) by Japan’s ClassNK, which also contributed regulatory advice and facilitated safety risk assessments.\nThe Center highlights that Kamsarmax bulk carriers represent a significant share of the existing fleet. It believes that developing a general retrofit package could drive low-emission solutions across the maritime industry. Additionally, the project sheds light on the challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed when deciding to retrofit a bulk carrier.\nThe retrofit project was based on a standard Kamsarmax design developed by Tsuneishi Shipbuilding which worked along the Center as a lead in the project. They explored the technical and operational challenges and opportunities of converting vessels to dual-fuel methanol. The retrofit design and technological solutions were developed in close cooperation with MAN ES, which provided the main engine and FuelTech expertise on design reviews and HAZID processes (Hazard Identification). Cargill offered operational and technical insights bringing in the charterer’s perspective, while the Danish Maritime Administration participated as an observer.\n“With the medium-sized bulk carrier segment representing a substantial share of the industry, this modular retrofit solution paves the way for an accelerated transition to methanol and other sustainable fuels,” said Evangelos Fragkoulis, Head of Ship Design for the Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping. “It demonstrates a paradigm shift towards non-intrusive, safe, and agile solutions that enable the integration of green fuels without compromising safety.”\nThe Kamsarmax is an 80,000 to 84,000 dwt dry bulk carrier which is very popular in the industry with the first vessel of the class delivered in 2005. Tsuneishi alone reports having built over 300 of the vessels, and the number one market share in the category, which generally measure approximately 230 meters (755 feet) in length making it a versatile and economical design. Tsuneishi highlights with a lifespan of 20 to 30 years, it is a critical segment of the industry that will significantly impact maritime decarbonization efforts.\nThe project generated multiple design solutions, including novel and modular fuel handling onboard, as well as methanol storage and integration options that optimize safety, capacity and ultimately reduce cost and conversion lead times. Additionally, the project has developed general design principles for methanol retrofit aimed at ship designers, shipyards and operators, providing a navigational framework through key design decisions.\nThe Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping reports that it will be releasing a comprehensive case study on the design. The guidelines developed during the project will also be released late this year."

        "content": "\nA new residential cruise line, Cresent Seas, has secured its second cruise ship just a month after announcing its brand. The company is presenting itself as a new concept in residential ships as it reconditions popular small luxury cruise ships into residencies.\nThey announced today an agreement with Oceania Cruises, one of the brands of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, to take over the cruise shipInsigniain late 2027 and convert her into a residency cruise ship. Cresent Seas will be marketing the residencies while Norwegian will continue to own the cruise ship and the well-known cruise management and hospitality services company The Apollo Group will manage all onboard hospitality and culinary offerings. Crescent Seas emphasizes that its ships will be staffed by their existing onboard service provider to ensure continuity in the product.\nTheInsignia(30,000 gross tons) was one of the first cruise ships used in 2002 to launch Oceania Cruises. The ship was built in 1998 by Chantiers de l’Atlantique for a cruise company called Renaissance Cruises, which was an early entrant in the small ship luxury cruise segment.Insigniawas introduced asR One, the first of a new class that called for eight cruise ships, but the line went bankrupt in 2001. Oceania was launched as the successor brand and today operates four of the cruise ships with competitor Azama Cruises now operating the other four.\nJason Montague, Chief Luxury Officer for Oceania, wrote in a letter to the cruise line’s loyalty club, thatInsignia’s departure is “bittersweet news” saying we are “sad to seeInsigniadepart the fleet.” He noted her pioneering role for the company while highlighting she is being replaced by the addition of the newAllura(67,000 gross tons) in the summer of 2025 and a new class of ships currently called “Quattro” which is being built by Fincantieri and launching in 2027. Oceania is planning a “Farewell Tour” forInsignia.\n\n\nInsignia will be converted to residential cruising late in 2027 (Crescent Seas)\n\nCrescent Seas reports she will undergo a more than $50 million comprehensive revitalization reducing her current 333 staterooms to 290 residences. The ship, which is 593 feet (181 meters) in length currently accommodates 670 passengers (double occupancy) and is considered small by current industry standards.\nThe company reports residencies will be priced between $650,000 to $10 million aboardInsignia. She will return to service with an inaugural voyage for New Year's 2027-2028. Sales will begin in the late summer of 2025.\nCresent Seas is a part of GFO Investments, a company managed by Russell Galbut, a lawyer and real estate developer who was on the board of Oceania and later chairman of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. His company Cresent Heights is a developer of luxury urban projects including in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City.\nThe cruise line was announced in March 2025 with anagreementwith Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings to assume theSeven Seas Navigatorfrom sister brand Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Navigator is due to start sales this month with residencies priced between $750,000 and $8 million. She will enter service in December 2026.\nCresent Seas highlights that it will maintain the luxury of the ships. Among the onboard features will be butler service, gourmet dining, Starlink Internet connections, and more. The company promotes that its ships will provide extended stays in global destinations. They plan to spend two or three nights or up to five days in each port of call.\nCresent Seas says that it plans to announce three more luxury residence ships over the next five years. The segment was pioneered byThe World, which entered service over 20 years ago, and another start-up launched theVilla Vie Odysseyrebuilt from a 30-year-old cruise ship as a residency in September 2024. With the growth in high-end luxury cruising, several firms are looking to leverage interest in cruising to expand residential cruise ship offerings."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Navy air strike campaign against Yemen's Houthi rebels is producing results, according to officials in Iran and the United States. The Iranian military is pulling personnel out of Yemen in order to reduce the risk of casualties or escalation, a senior Iranian official told the Telegraph - a significant victory for the Trump administration's policy. The strikes have also forced the Houthis to slow the pace of their missile attacks on Israel and on U.S. forces in the Red Sea. However, American officials told the New York Times, the Houthis still retain large weapons stockpiles in hardened bunkers, and the U.S. has yet to deploy the capabilities required to reach them.\nOn Wednesday, a senior Iranian official told The Telegraph that the Trump administration's military campaign is now the center of discussion in Tehran, and the regime's many proxy groups - Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Shia militias in Iraq - have taken a back seat. Hezbollah and Hamas have both been dealt serious blows in combat with Israel, and Tehran sees the Houthis as another losing force, the official claimed.\n\"The view here is that the Houthis will not be able to survive and are living their final months or even days, so there is no point in keeping them on our list,\" the Iranian official said. \"They were part of a chain that relied on [assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah and [former Syrian dictator Bashar] Assad, and keeping only one part of that chain for the future makes no sense.\"\nThree U.S. officials told the New York Times that the U.S. Navy airstrikes on Yemen have been more intense than publicly reported. The Institute for the Study of War, a nonpartisan research group, identified 28 airstrikes on April 2-3 alone. This campaign will likely intensify: a second U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is under way to join USSHarry S. Trumanin the Red Sea, doubling the available firepower. The bombardment could go on for months, the officials said - an indication that the resumption of Red Sea merchant traffic may not come until later in the year.\nA Pentagon spokesperson strenuously denied that the timeline for the bombing campaign is months long, saying only that it was \"on track\" for future phases.\nLocal U.S. Navy commands now have control over targeting decisions, the Times reports, and as the pace picks up, the task force is consuming a meaningful number of precision munitions. The Houthis still have air defenses, and Navy pilots are using a combination of glide bombs and cruise missiles to achieve mission success without entering the Houthis' weapons envelope. The cost of these weapons so far is comparatively small for a regional war, about $1 billion, but Pentagon planners are more concerned about the low rate of stockpile replenishment. The U.S. supply chain for precision air-launched munitions is limited, andwar gamingfor a Taiwan Strait conflict suggests that U.S. success against China hinges on an adequate supply of these high-tech weapons."

        "content": "\nThe French cooperative Windcoop completed the construction order for its revolutionary open-hatch sail-powered cargo ship, the first of what the group envisions will be a pioneering fleet of ships. The order was placed with Turkey’s RMK Marine, which is also building the sail-powered RoRoNeoliner Origin.\nThe group reports it has had to overcome major technical and logistic challenges to integrate a wind-powered propulsion system while also ensuring efficient container handling. This was in part solved with asymmetrical sails, the open-hatch design, and the placement of cranes on the opposite from the sails. It helps to provide stability and balance while also giving the vessel total autonomy for loading and unloading.\nThe vessel will be 91.3 meters (approximately 300 feet) in length with a capacity for 210 TEU and 40 reefer plugs. The three wingsails designed by Computer Wingsails (CWS) are each 350 square meters (approximately 3,800 square feet) or a total sail area of 1,050 square meters (11,300 square feet). The vessel is projected to have an average sailing speed of 9 knots.\n\n\n\n“After four years of development, we are finally taking decisive steps toward realizing what was once considered an audacious dream,” said Matthieu Brunet, Chairman of Windcoop. The effort was started in 2022. Based in Lorient, France, Windcoop was created through the collaboration of Zéphyr & Borée, Enercoop and Arcadie.\nThe project with RMK calls for orders to the subcontractors including the sails and engines and finalization of the studies and tank tests for the vessel this year. Construction is due to begin in 2026 and trials, delivery, and commissioning in May 2027.\nThe total construction cost is set at €28.5 million ($31.5 million). Windcoop reports it has secured financing of €28.5 million structured by Crédit Maritime Grand Ouest – Banque Populaire, with a counter-guarantee from Bpifrance. The financing includes €6.8 million ($7.5 million) raised through the cooperative. This involved 1,600 citizens, committed shippers (Arcadie, Valrhona, Prova, Lobodis, Ethicable, Cafés Richard, Demad, Arawak), and institutional investors (La Nef, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, SIDI, Mer Invest, Inddigo, Bretagne Capital Solidaire). It is the first cargo ship of this size to include cooperative funding.\n\nThe first service route was selected to focus on secondary ports that are traditionally neglected because they lack the capacity or equipment to load goods. The group says it aims to “rebalance the logistics network” while also reducing carbon emissions by limiting land transport. The vessel will be registered in France and sail a route between France and Madagascar, connecting Marseille to the ports of Tamatave, Diego Suarez, and Majunga, without transshipment and including transits of the Suez Canal. They project a transit time of 31 days.\nFrom Madagascar, they will carry cargo including aquaculture, cocoa, vanilla, spices, essential oils, and textiles. While they expect to export from France to Madagascar retail goods, glassware, paramedical products, and textiles.\nWindcoop has ambitious plans. It aims to secure financing and rapidly build a second vessel to ensure a monthly service on the Madagascar-France route. At the same time, Windcoop plans to expand its fleet by launching new maritime routes designed to meet the needs of the shippers and the territories involved. A regional line in the Indian Ocean, a transatlantic connection as well as a direct link to West Africa are currently in the planning stages."

Their boat, theBruma, capsized early Sunday morning in a crowded area in calm conditions, and an inquiry is under way to determine whether they may have been hit by another vessel.\nThe captain of the port for Coronel, Osvaldo Cuadra, told local media that a coordinated search was under way, assisted by a merchant ship, civilian aircraft and multiple fishing vessels. TheBruma'slifeboat is also missing, raising the possibility that the crew may have abandoned ship and could be adrift somewhere else.\nComienzan a aparecer más restos de la embarcación Bruma en la cuadra de búsqueda cercano a la Isla Santa María.

Given the current state of theBruma, this is certainly a collision,\" said local fishermens' association president Claudia Urrutia.\nA larger steel-hulled fishing vessel, theCobra, has been accused of colliding with theBruma. The crew of theCobradenies involvement, but the Cobra's hull shows signs of minor damage at the bow. The possible impact zone is being assessed by the authorities, and if the wreck can be accessed, it may be possible to verify if the paint corresponds to any traces onBruma'swreckage.\n\"Accusing a ship [Cobra] with 18 crew members, also severely affected, is unthinkable. I trust their word, that they, at least, didn't detect anything,\" owner Gerardo Balbontín told local media.\nCoronel's prosecutor has dispatched a team to examineCobrain detail, including a forensic examination of the bridge and a review of the vessel's security camera footage. The crew has been questioned as well, but for now no charges have been brought.\n\"There are indications,there are elements that allow us to suspect, let's say, involvement[of theCobra], but until we have conclusive proof of it, it's not possible to state it categorically,\" saidCoronel's chief prosecutor, Hugo Cuevas.\nFamilies of the missing men have called on the Chilean Navy to deploy an ROV to the site and search the wreckage. TheBruma'swreck sits in 400 meters of water, beyond the reach of standard diving techniques but within range for an ROV. Balbontín, the owner of theCobra, has offered the use of his vessels to host small ROV equipment for the investigation.\nSearch efforts continue, aided by multiple government vessels, continued support from the fishing community, shore patrols and an aerial search with three Chilean Navy aircraft."

Moller – Maersk investing $100 million in C2X, the green methanol developer launched in 2023 by A.P. Moller Holding. The proceeds will primarily be used to fund the final development of a Louisiana project to produce green methanol as well as to advance C2X’s current efforts in the U.S., Spain, and Egypt to build green methanol production for the shipping, aviation, and chemical sectors.\nC2X reports the investment is a critical step to advance the development of the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy project in Louisiana to FID, which is being developed with SunGas Renewables. The project will use SunGas’ S-1000 gasification technology system to convert biomass into low-carbon methanol. The project will also capture and permanently sequester approximately 1 million tonnes per year of surplus biogenic CO2 from the gasification process, generating carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits.\nThe multibillion-dollar project aims to start construction in the second half of 2026. Once operational, which is targeted for the end of 2028, it will produce over 500,000 tonnes of green methanol annually. C2X reports it is also in discussions to secure long-term offtake agreements from Maersk and other customers in its targeted shipping, chemicals, and industrial sectors.\nThe Beaver Lake facility is the first of several facilities planned by SunGas and C2X to supply green methanol. It would repurpose a former International Paper site in Rapides Parish, Louisiana that closed in 2009. SunGas has estimated the facility would be valued at $2.4 billion.\nSunGas and C2X announced a strategic partnership and C2X’s investment in SunGas in May 2024. ENEOS’ new investment is accompanied by a strategic partnership with C2X, which considers methanol offtake and the application of SunGas’ gasification technology into its system portfolio.\nAP Moller launched C2X to help expedite the process of developing a global production and supply chain for methanol. The company has previously announced projects in Spain, Egypt, and the United States. With the new commitment from ENEOS, Maersk, and APM, it looks to continue to accelerate the development of its portfolio of projects."

American seaports and importers are bracing for the effects of a 20 percent tariff on the EU, a cumulative 54 percent tariff on China, and 40 percent-plus tariffs on Southeast Asian nations.\nAt the twin ports in San Pedro Bay, any decline in trade volume will be acutely felt. More than 60 percent of Port of Long Beach's imports come from China, and at neighboring Port of LA, the Chinese share is about 40 percent. Hundreds of thousands of jobs in the vast warehousing districts around LA - where containers are unstuffed and the contents loaded for delivery around the U.S. - will be directly affected.\n\"If we have reduced container volume and more specifically imports, be it from China or Southeast Asia, it would have an impact on jobs,\" said Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, speaking to CBS.\nLA and Long Beach have been booming over the past few months as importers raced to beat the tariff deadline. Port of LA posted its second-best February ever, driven by strong import volume. That boom may be followed by a bust cycle, Port of LA CEO Gene Seroka has cautioned.\n\"Given the substantial inventory already here and the uncertainty of tariffs, it’s possible we can see a 10% drop in volume in the second half of this year,\" Seroka said at a press conference in March.\nSmaller import-dependent businesses may be the most affected by the new tariffs, and smallcap stocks have now fallen by more than 20 percent since before the election. \"They’re not like large corporations. They operate on very thin profit margins,\" Bank of America Institue economist Taylor Bowley told Politico. \"Frankly, they just don’t have the bandwidth or operating expenses to do that.\""

        "content": "South Korea’s shipbuilding industry is highlighting a rebound in orders in March after a slow start to the year. It comes as the industry looks for ways to benefit from the proposed U.S. fees on Chinese-built ships.\nTo combat the growing Chinese domination of shipbuilding, South Korea’s strategy has included a focus on high-value ships and larger, more technologically advanced ships. This includes all forms of gas carriers where South Korea continues to lead the orders despite China’s growth in LNG tankers. In the long term, South Korea looks toward ammonia carriers, ammonia-fueled ships, automation, and other technologies.\nReports are the strategy worked in March 2025 with the South Korean yards garnering 55 percent of the orders based on tonnage according to data from Clarkson Research Service. South Korea recorded orders for 820,000 compensated gross tons (CGT) compared to the Chinese yards booking 520,000 CGT in March. By the number of vessels, however, China continued its lead booking 31 ship orders compared to South Korea’s 17 ships.\nThis is a strong rebound from February when China booked 70 percent of the orders by tonnage. South Korea’s yards booked just nine percent of the tonnage ordered in February. The reports highlighted that the Korean yards historically have lagged behind the Chinese in the first quarter of the year while also noting that last year South Korea only received 16 percent of the orders for the year versus 70 percent booked in China.\nChina also continues to hold a strong overall lead in the sector, Clarkson’s data shows Chinese yards have an order backlog of nearly 94 million CGT which is 59 percent of the global total. South Korea’s yards while ranking second have a backlog of just over 36 million CGT or 23 percent of the total.\nThe South Korean industry is looking toward the U.S. to help drive future business. In February it was reported that the U.S. Trade Representative was proposing fees for Chinese-built ships calling in U.S. ports. The Trump administration has latched on to the concept as part of its plan to rebuild U.S. shipbuilding.\nThe Korean news outlet CHOSUNBIZ reports fears of the pending fees might already be impacting future shipbuilding plans. Citing reports from Daishin Securities it writes that ExxonMobil canceled orders for two liquefied natural gas bunkering vessels (LNGBVs) intended for China.\nHD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, South Korea’s largest shipbuilder, reported yesterday, April 3, that it had booked an additional order for an LNG carrier valued at approximately $263 million. The group said it has now received orders for a total of 24 ships worth $4.07 billion, achieving 22.6 percent of its annual order target of $18.05 billion. By ship type, the company has received orders in 2025 for an LNG carrier, four LNG bunkering vessels, an LPG/ammonia carrier,  and two ethane carriers, as well as 12 containerships, and four tankers.\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative held public hearings on March 24 and March 26, regarding the proposed actions in the Section 301 investigation on China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance. It also accepted written comments and for seven days afterward was also accepting rebuttal comments. No timeline was released for completing the review but it is expected the office will issue its final recommendations which Trump will incorporate into the overall plan for U.S. shipbuilding.  Combined with the new tariffs, many have warned it could have a chilling effect on global trade and the shipping industry."

TheAndaman Skieshas been stuck holding off Mumbai reports say for two weeks since it wasrefused entryinto the port. Both Reuters and Bloomberg are citing sources in India saying that the approximately 100,000 metric tons of Russian crude is being transshipped to the second tanker and will be landed at the terminal in the coming days.\nIndia has continued to be one of Russia’s largest oil customers with as much as 35 percent of its crude imports coming from Russia in 2024. Reuters points out that the seller is responsible for the delivery of the crude including the vessel and its insurance. Reports indicate the cargo which is nearly 800,000 barrels was purchased from Lukoil, loaded near Murmansk, Russia, and is going to the Indian Oil Corp. terminal at Vandinar, India.\nTheAndaman Skiesbuilt in 2004 had been making the run from Russia but ran afoul of Indian regulations when it passed the 20-year mark this year. Regulations require older vessels to have seaworthiness and safety certificates from a recognized class society, which the Andaman Skies reportedly does not have available leading port officials to say it could not dock and unload its cargo.\nThe vessel was sold by Delta Tankers in 2023 and entered the shadow fleet with reports it is being managed from India. The Equasis database and others including Bloomberg report the vessel is registered in Honduras, while others including Reuters say it is registered in Tanzania. The European Union and UK added it to the sanctions list but it has not been cited by the U.S. or the UN.\nComing to its rescue is the equally shadowyOzanno, but built in 2008 it is under the 20-year mark. It is also listed as being under Indian management and currently reports registry as São Tomé and Príncipe. Equasis however lists that as a false flag. In 2024 the vessel reported registry in Barbados and in 2023 in the Cook Islands. It, too, is sanctioned by the EU and UK.\nIndia asserts it follows international regulations in the purchase and shipping of oil. However, it only recognizes the sanctions from the United States and the United Nations, permitting these tankers to continue in the trade."

        "content": "\nThe latest Chinese port operation to come under pressure is Australia’s Port of Darwin which is now a headline issue in the upcoming federal elections. Today, April 4, Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared during a radio interview that Darwin “should be in Australian hands.” Concerns have been brewing over the now decade-old deal that ceded control of the port to a Chinese company.\nLocated on Australia’s north central coast the port while small in scope is seen as a strategic asset. It is Australia’s closest port to Asia and is playing an increasingly significant role in Australia’s expanding offshore oil and gas sector. In the port’s last fiscal year ended in 2024, it reported imports of more than 1 million kiloliters of petroleum products, handling over 280,000 head of cattle and being a major RoRo import operator for cars. It is a base to U.S. Marines and also a popular cruise ship destination.\nFaced with financial difficulties, the government of Australia’s Northern Territories put out a public tender in 2014 and the following year concluded a deal with a Chinese company Landbridge. The operator gained a 99-year lease for the port and promised to make investments. Reports indicate that the U.S. with then-President Barack Obama voiced concerns over the Chinese deal.\nAccusations have been raised about the operations with the Australian opposition party contending that Landbridge has failed to make the promised investments. In 2024 there were questions when Landbridge’s parent company went into default on an A$107 million (US$65 million) bond.\nThe company said in November 2024 that the “underlying operations of Darwin Port have improved significantly,” while reporting a nearly 50 percent increase in EBITDA earnings for FY 24. It blamed non-cash charges for an A$34 million (US$21 million) loss before taxes and said “Darwin Port remains a key asset of the group.”\nPrime Minister Albanese announced the federal government is in talks with private pension fund investors on a possible deal to take over the operational lease for the port. He said the options were private investment or the federal government taking over the port. When asked in 2023, Albanese had ruled out a similar move to regain control of the port.\nOpposition leaders have already spoken publicly about the need for the federal government to take control back from the Chinese. Media reports indicate they were going to make a formal public statement this coming Sunday, April 6, ahead of the May 3 federal elections.\nMedia reports said in March the federal government had discussions with the new government of the Northern Territory over possible steps. This came after Federal Labor MP Luke Gosling also made a public statement saying the federal government wanted to “return the port to Australian hands.”\nResponding to the statements and media speculation, Terry O’Connor, Non-Executive Director for Landbridge in Australia, issued a statement in March calling the minister’s statement “a surprise,” and he asserted “Landbridge and Darwin Port have not been involved in any discussions on the matter.” He said they would engage with the Northern Territory government but the “port is not for sale.”\nA local news outlet, NT News, however early in March reported Landbridge “could be willing to sell the port’s lease, but was asking A$1.3 billion (US$795 million). Reports indicate that is nearly A$800 million (approximately US$490 million) more than it paid in 2015 for the 99-year lease."

The exact time was not reported, but it was said to happen in a cocktail lounge called “On The Rocks,” a venue Virgin Voyages bills as a martini and cocktail bar on Deck 6. On its website Virgin Voyages writes, “On the Rocks is the perfect place to make bold choices.”\nA passenger only identified by initials in the complaint reportedly was on the bar dancing when Nichol DeGiorgio, made a remark to the order of “Look, we are all grown-ups here – can you put your shoes on?”  The irony of course is that the cruise line is associated with Sir Richard Branson, famous for dancing on furniture, and other antics.\nThe unidentified passenger reportedly responded making crude remarks and an obscene hand gesture to Ms. DeGiorgio. This was later confirmed by the ship’s closed-circuit security cameras with the video handed over to the FBI as evidence.\nAccording to the FBI statement and the complaint filed in the court in Puerto Rico, Kenneth DeGiorgio, age 53, CEO of First American Financial Corporation, confronted the individual who he did not know. He put his hands around the man’s neck and reportedly said he was going to kill the man.\nThe cruise ship’s captain later confined DeGiorgio to his cabin and handed the matter over to the FBI when the ship reached Puerto Rico. Crimes aboard cruise ships fall under federal jurisdiction.\nThe reports go on to say that DeGiorgio refused to answer questions from the FBI and requested a lawyer. In a statement, the lawyers are now asserting that he was responding to the actions of an individual who harassed his wife, making her feel threatened and intimidated.\nDeGiorgio was charged with a simple misdemeanor. However, if convicted of assault, The New York Times reports he faces up to one year in prison. His lawyers said DeGiorgio “looks forward to being absolved of any wrongdoing.”"

        "content": "The Royal New Zealand Navy released the final results of its Court of Inquiry into the shockingOctober 2023 lossof its survey vessel HMNZSManawanui, the first vessel lost by the Navy since World War II. While the preliminary report released in November 2024 identified human error issues including failing to disengage the autopilot, the final report delves deeper to identify the underlying issues that they believe contributed to the loss of the vessel.\nThe interim Court of Inquiry focused on the direct issues, and it put the blame squarely onmistakes made by the crew. Failing to turn off the autopilot, the bridge crew attempted to maneuver the vessel. When the vessel did not respond they failed to check if they had manual control with it taking more than 10 minutes to regain control. The vessel however had grounded and the following morning after the 75 people on board were rescued the ship foundered.\nIn the final report, the court identified 12 additional issues that it says contributed to the grounding and sinking. Key among them were training issues and the qualifications of the ship’s personnel, as well as planning, instructions and procedures, supervision, haste, leadership, distraction, and interruptions. All these factors they believe made the loss more likely.\nThe court thanks the officers and crew of the vessel recognizing their braveness as well as their willingness to provide detailed testimony. The result was a120-page reportthat was released online for public review.\n“The Court found deficiencies in the training and qualifications of key ship’s personnel involved in the incident, risks related to the survey task were not sufficiently identified, discussed, and mitigated, and instructions or procedures were lacking,” said the Court of Inquiry president Commodore Melissa Ross. It also found leadership was inadequate in some areas, supervision was not at expected levels, and time pressure influenced the way the survey task was conducted.\nChief of the Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding accepted the report acknowledging that it illustrated a gap between work as imagined on shore by command and work as done on the vessel.\n“Fundamentally we need to do things differently. We need to adapt to new technologies, change the way we approach what we do, and find new ways to continue to deliver on what is expected of us,” he said.\nThe Court issued nine recommendations ranging from risk management to training. It cited the process around orders, instruction, and procedures as well as the experience of the crew.\nAdmiral Golding said the Navy has already moved forward in some areas, such as reviews of risk management, oversight, and documentation. He said among the audits was a review of the state of training. However, he recognized that some of the issues would be more complex and time-consuming to resolve.\n“Ultimately, there are a range of issues, including the lack of commonality across the fleet, which means our people need to constantly adapt to new procedures each time they change ships,” said the admiral. He called for embarking on a transformation program that seeks to reform the approach to operating the Navy."

        "content": "\nCarnival Corporation and Fincantieri signed the group’s first new order for cruise ship construction for its AIDA brand since the pause in operations in 2020. It also marks the corporation’s efforts to resume shipbuilding and expansion of its brands outside the U.S. after focusing on its Carnival Cruise Line.\nSpeaking with the media on Sunday, April 6, CEO Josh Weinstein hinted that the corporation was planning to move forward with the expansion of its brands based on demand in the different segments of the market. He highlighted the corporation’s success in reducing debt accumulated during the pandemic and growth in demand globally for cruising. In FY 2024, the corporation reported a 40 percent increase in its EBITDA earnings ($6.1 billion). It nearly doubled operating income for the recently reported first quarter on $5.8 billion in revenues.\nCarnival Corporation had previously said it would add new cruise ships at the rate of approximately one per year across its nine brands. The corporation in 2024 ordered seven cruise ships for Carnival Cruise Line due between 2027 and 2033, split between Meyer Werft in Germany and Fincantieri in Italy. It also has one legacy order from before the pandemic due for delivery this year for Princess Cruises.\nFincantieri termed today’s order “very important,” reporting that it represents a value exceeding €2 billion ($2.2 billion). They will be the first cruise ships Fincantieri will build for AIDA. Except for two cruise ships built a decade ago in Japan by Mitsubishi, AIDA has worked with Meyer Werft for its fleet.\nAIDA has elected to build two midsized cruise ships between the size of its largest cruise ships Helios Class (183,900 gross tons with 2,732 passenger cabins) and the Hyperion Class (125,572 gross tons with 1,643 passenger cabins). No details were released on the new ships other than they would have 2,100 passenger cabins. Delivery is scheduled for early 2030 and late 2031.\nThe new ships will be equipped with multi-fuel engines which Fincantieri reports will be capable of operating on LNG, bio-diesel, and future sustainable fuels. AIDA has prided itself on being at the forefront of sustainability. The two Japanese-built cruise ships,AIDAprimaandAIDAperla, were the first to be outfitted with engines to use LNG dockside, and theAIDANovacommissioned in 2018 was the first cruise ship capable of sailing on LNG. The company has also adopted shore power and other energy-saving technologies.\nAIDA’s President Felix Eichhorn notes the brand will reach 13 ships with the addition of the new order. He said the ships will have new features and experiences without providing details.\nThe cruise line has also launched a revitalization program for three cruise ships in its fleet. The program started last month withAIDAdivaand will improve technology and refurbish passenger areas. They are adding new restaurants, including a maritime-themed cafe, French and Asia restaurants, and a Tapas Bar. TheAIDAlunaandAIDAbellawill follow in 2025 and 2026.\nAIDA has been one of the strongest-performing brands in the portfolio. It focuses on the German-speaking market."

        "content": "\nA new fuel slick has been spotted on the surface near the Kerch Strait, the Russian-controlled waterway between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, according to a Russian environmental scientist. The pollution is near the site where two aging tankers broke up and sank in December - but Russian officials deny that any additional pollution from the disaster has been observed.\nOn March 31, ecologist Georgy Kavanosyan released a synthetic aperture radar image of the Kerch Strait on social media, showing what appeared to be a long slick at the entrance to the strait. The site corresponds to the location of the bow section ofVolgoneft-239,one of the two lost tankers. A second environmental scientist, Igor Shkradyuk, told Russian investigative reporting outlet Agentstva that the leak is likely in the range of hundreds of liters per day - and that it will likely continue through the warm months of the year as the fuel cargo heats up and seeps out.\n\"Unfortunately, government agencies are not telling us what is happening with the spilled fuel oil. They are pretending that none of this is happening,\" Shkradyuk said.\nRussia's Ministry of Emergency Situations says that it continues to monitor the wreck sites daily, and it claims that no additional fuel leaks from the tankers have been recorded. \"The sunken fragments of the tankers are constantly being examined by divers, the bottom is being monitored in a kilometer-long zone from the coast using remotely controlled vehicles, space monitoring technologies, drones, and patrol groups of rescuers on boats are being used to monitor the situation in the water area,\" ministry chief Alexander Kurenkov said Friday.\nRussia's environment ministry (Rosprirodnadzor) has filed a new claim for compensation for damages against the owners ofVolgoneft-239andVolgoneft-212.The two riverine tankers were operating in the open waters of the Black Sea in wintertime, beyond the limits of their design parameters, and the ministry laid blame on the captains and on their employers.\nThe total claim comes to about 85 billion rubles ($1 billion), split between Kama Shipping and Volgatransneft CFC. The two firms have one month to pay for the damages, after which the ministry will initiate a lawsuit, said Svetlana Radionova, head of Rosprirodnadzor."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nOn Sunday, Japan’s Defense Ministry launched a new military unit, the Maritime Transport Group. The unit is expected to improve Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) maritime logistics, allowing swift deployment of ground troops and equipment to front-line bases. The inauguration ceremony was held at Kure naval base in Hiroshima Prefecture.\nThe plan for a specialized maritime transport unit for the JSDF was initially announced in 2018. The aim was enhancing JSDF ability to transport troops to remote islands - especially the islands west of Okinawa, a response to China’s maritime expansion in the region and the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\nThe new Maritime Transport Group is part of the Japanese government's strategy to strengthen its island defense system, and will be managed by Japan's army (Japan Ground Self Defense Force, or JGSDF). This command structure is similar to the United States' landing craft fleet, which is housed within the U.S. Army Watercraft Systems division.\nThe Maritime Transport Group consists of about 100 members, drawn from the three branches of JSDF including the Ground, Maritime and Air Self Defense Forces. For the operations of the unit, the ministry plans to procure 10 vessels by March 2028. The vessels include two LSVs (Logistics Support Vessel), four LCUs (Landing Craft Utility) and four maneuver support vessels. They will be based at Kure base and the Hanshin base in Kobe city. There are also plans to prepare wharfs on the island of Amami-Oshima in Kagoshima Prefecture. Two vessels have already been launched.\nThe LCUNihonbarelaunched in October last year at the Naikai Zosen shipyard in Onomichi City of Hiroshima. The LCU is about 80 meters long, has a draft of 3 meters and displacement of about 2,400 tons. It has a crew capacity of 30 and it can transport a dozen twenty-foot containers. In addition, the LCU has beaching capabilities that allow it to load and unload on sandy areas.\nA month later, the LSVYokowas launched at the same shipyard. The LSV is about 120 meters, has a draft of 4 meters and a displacement of 3,500 tons. It can load and unload vehicles and supplies through a side ramp on the starboard side. However, Yoko does not have beaching capabilities like Nihonbare.\nThe strengthening of Japan’s military transport capabilities comes at a time China has become more assertive in the East China Sea. The two countries have a long-standing maritime dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which Japan controls. In the past year, China has sent a record number of heavily armed ships to patrol the islands.\nAccording to data by Japan Coast Guard (JCG), Chinese government vessels entered the contiguous zone of the Islands (12 to 24 nautical miles from the coast) on 355 out of 366 days in 2024. This set a record for the highest number of days since 2008, when Chinese vessels were officially confirmed patrolling the Islands."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nSince the introduction of a global sulfur cap in marine fuel oil by IMO (International Maritime Organization) in 2020, there has been uncertainty on the environmental impacts of scrubbers for vessels using heavy fuel oil (HFO). But a newstudyreleased last week claims that the environmental impacts of burning HFO with scrubbers could be equivalent, and in some scenarios, outperform use of low-sulfur fuels for large bulk carriers.\nThe study includes researchers from MIT and Georgia Tech, with partial support from Oldendorff Carriers. The bulk carrierHedwig Oldendorffwas selected for onboard emission measurements and collection of scrubber wash water samples.\nWhile multiple studies have monitored marine fuel emissions and the effects of scrubbers, the researchers said that the existing lifecycle assessments (LCAs) lack onboard measurements or focus on specific impact categories, such as climate change. For this study, the scientists claimed to have developed a robust assessment of the environmental impacts of using scrubbers with HFO versus low-sulfur fuels. This involved conducting a comprehensive Well-to-Wake (WtW) LCA, accounting for the impacts from fuel sourcing, production, conversion, transport, distribution, and eventual use onboard the vessel.\nIn considering this entire supply chain, burning heavy fuel oil with scrubbers was found to be the least harmful option in terms of nearly all 10 environmental impact factors that were studied. Some of these factors include greenhouse gas emissions, terrestrial acidification and ozone formation.\n“Claims about environmental hazards and policies to mitigate them should be backed by science. You need to see data, be objective, and design studies that take into account the full picture to be able to compare different options,” said lead author Patricia Stathatou, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech.\nAccording to data by Clarksons Research, the use of scrubbers has been on the rise in the past two decades. The number of scrubber-fitted ships increased from 243 in 2020 to more than 7,400 at the start of 2025. The majority of these vessels utilize wet, open-loop marine scrubbers, which consists of a huge vertical tank installed in a ship’s exhaust stack above the engines. Inside, seawater drawn from the ocean is sprayed through a series of nozzles, washing the hot exhaust gases as they exit the engines. But the scrubber wastewater contains compounds that may be toxic for the marine environment. In fact, many countries across the world have restricted scrubber discharge within ports and harbors.\nIn exploring this concern in the study, Stathatou and her colleagues agree that scrubber discharge is toxic, but its impact is less than burning low-sulfur fuels, when considered from a holistic point of view. Producing low-sulfur fuel requires extra processing steps in the refinery, causing additional emissions of greenhouse gases and particulate matter.\n“If we just look at everything that happens before the fuel is bunkered onboard the vessel, heavy fuel oil is significantly more low-impact, environmentally, than low-sulfur fuels. If you consider that the scrubber has a lifetime of about 20 years, the environmental impacts of producing the scrubber over its lifetime are negligible compared to producing heavy fuel oil,” added Stathatou."

(These allegations could not be immediately verified, but his audience applauded.) \"I tell you what, if you guys had been at West Point or the U.S. Naval Academy . . . they would have quit a long time ago,\" he said.\nDuffy called the condition of USMMA a bipartisan issue, and he was accompanied on his visit by a Democratic member of Congress, Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-NY). Four representatives from Long Island, including Suozzi, have introduced a bill to invest $1 billion in federal funding for infrastructure improvements at the USMMA campus over 10 years.\nThe secretary declined to endorse any specific figure, but he pledged to support USMMA's efforts to find funding for improvements. He told Newsday that the academy needs to be rebuilt much more quickly than 10 years.\nDuffy said that part of his rationale for boosting USMMA is the need to counter China on the high seas. He pointed to China's increasing dominance in shipping and shipbuilding as a cause for concern, noting that CSSC built more tonnage in 2024 than the entire production of every American yard since WWII. \"That is going to change . . . and you all are part of that change,\" he told the audience."

It is part of a strategy that has also seen the publicly traded parent company, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, charter two other ships from its luxury brands to launch a new residential cruise line.\nIndia’s Cordelia Cruises, the only dedicated cruise line in India, will be taking theNorwegian Skyon charter in 2026 and theNorwegian Sunthe following year in 2027. The company was started post-pandemic with a single ship but recently reported it waslooking to expandits operation.\nThe cruise shipsNorwegian Sky(77,104 gross tons) andNorwegian Sun(78,309 gross tons) were the company’s first effort at modernization in the late 1990s. Started in 1965, the brand had failed to keep pace with competitors and due to financial difficulties had not added new cruise ships at the same pace as Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International in the 1990s.\nTheNorwegian Skyhad been ordered by Costa Cruises as a sistership to theCosta Victoriaand was under construction in Germany at Bremer Vulkan when the yard experienced financial difficulties in 1996 and construction was suspended. Norwegian acquired the incomplete ship and finished it at Lloyd Werft introducing it in 1999. It has accommodations for approximately 2,000 passengers and sailed for the cruise line in the Caribbean and a brief period in Hawaii as thePride of Alohabetween 2004 and 2008.\nNorwegian decided to build a sistership which becameNorwegian Sunin 2001. The company had also planned a third sister but did not go forward with the order.\nThe smallest ships in the fleet they also predated Norwegian’s open cruise concept without assigned dining and multiple restaurants. The ships were adapted to the concept but lacked the space to have the full amenities of what the company markets as “Freestyle Cruising.”\nCEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Harry Sommer called the decision to charter a total of four ships from the fleet part of a “disciplined approach to fleet optimization.” Norwegian this week is introducing the third cruise ship in its new series,Norwegian Aqua, and Sommers notes it has a total of seven cruise ships ordered for the brand, including a new class of 200,000-gross ton plus ships.\nCordelia Cruises in its announcement said it would be “unlocking new destinations, introducing longer itineraries, and reimagining what cruising means for India and beyond.” The company to date has operated short cruises on theEmpressacquired from Royal Caribbean International. The renamed Cordelia Sky will enter service from Mumbai in August 2026. The company has not announced itineraries for the Sun which will be leaving Norwegian in the fourth quarter of 2027.\nNorwegian has also chartered theSeven Seas Navigatorfrom Regent Seven Seas Cruises and theInsigniafrom Oceania Cruises to Crescent Seas, a residential cruise line. These charters are scheduled to begin in 2026 and 2027.  The company has three new cruise ships on order for Oceania Cruises, and two cruise ships for Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

The terminal has been under construction since 2022, almost a year after the Adani Group signed the port deal.\nCWIT was developed by a consortium consisting of APSEZ, the Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) under a 35-year Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) agreement.\nThe $800 million CWIT project features a 1,400-meter quay length and 20-meter depth, allowing the terminal to handle approximately 3.2 million TEU annually. This capacity will elevate the status of Colombo port as a key transshipment hub in South Asia. According to APSEZ, CWIT is the first deep-water terminal to be fully automated in Colombo, improving cargo handling and vessel turnaround time.\n“The commencement of operations at CWIT marks a momentous milestone in regional cooperation between India and Sri Lanka. The opening is also a proud moment for Sri Lanka, placing it firmly on the global maritime map,” said Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group.\nLast year, the CWIT project was subjected to scrutiny after U.S prosecutors indicted Gautam Adani for an alleged bribery scheme. Adani has denied these allegations, but some countries - including Kenya - had to cancel deals associated with his companies.\nAlthough the CWIT project progressed, it proceeded without a $500 million loan guarantee from the U.S government. In November 2023, the U.S International Development Finance Corporation announced a loan providing support for the CWIT project. The financing had not been processed by the time Adani Group withdrew from the loan deal in December. At the time, Adani Group said it would finance the terminal through the company’s internal accruals and capital management plan.\nWith CWIT now open, it has to compete for cargo business with other major terminals in Colombo. The China-backed Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) controls the largest share of containers passing through the port. Last year, CICT handled 3.3 million TEUs. Two of SLPA’s controlled terminals - Jaye Container Terminal and the deep-water East Container Terminal - handled 2.4 million TEU. South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) operated by John Keells Holdings handled 2 million TEU. In total, Colombo port handled 7.7 million TEUs, up 12.3 percent compared to 2023."

Shipping's carbon is regulated by IMO, outside of the framework of the Paris Climate Agreement, and MEPC has repeatedly deferred the question of how to achieve a target of a 50 percent emissions cut by 2050.

I urge Danish government and shipping firms to keep the course, and push others to follow.\"\n\"This week’s talks at the IMO have been a rollercoaster, with no clear path toward securing an ambitious universal GHG pricing mechanism,\" agreed Anaïs Rios, Shipping Policy Officer at Seas At Risk. \"A universal GHG pricing mechanism isn’t just one of many tools; it’s the only viable way to decarbonize shipping fairly and effectively, ensuring no one is left behind.\"\nIf it were passed, a strong MEPC bunker levy would be a major win for the clean-shipping sector and a major setback for opponents of climate action. It would be more than just a new shipping regulation: the levy would be the first international carbon tax, implemented and overseen by the United Nations.\n\"It would represent a huge moment of solidarity in the fight to tackle climate change,\" said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at Opportunity Green, speaking to the AP. \"For the first time, we will have, hopefully, an effective global framework tackling this international issue. Most emissions are tackled domestically.\"\nClimate researchers and advocate groups have long maintained that a strong, global carbon levy is the only way to provide shipping with an economic incentive to reduce its emissions to meet IMO targets. Green fuels are not commercially competitive with bunker fuel, the lowest-value residual fuel product from oil refining. Reversing this equation would require regulatory action to distort market prices for all players at once, making bunker fuel more expensive (with a levy) and green fuel less expensive (with a subsidy). Independent estimates for an effective bunker levy come to at least $150 per tonne of carbon emitted, which would nearly double the price of HFO."

        "content": "\nThe California-based Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) is hoping to propel oceanographic research to the next level after taking delivery of its newest research vessel, a project that has taken over a decade to actualize.\nMBARI announced that R/VDavid Packardhas arrived at its headquarters in Moss Landing after completing a 59-day transit from Spain’s Freire Shipyard, where she was built at a cost of $50 million. The new ship is named after the institute’s founder, the late Silicon Valley innovator and ocean philanthropist David Packard.\nPlanning forDavid Packard,which was funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, began in 2009 when the institute engaged U.S naval architecture and marine engineering firm Glosten to design the vessel. In 2021, the construction contract was awarded to Freire, a well-known specialty yard that also built the Schmidt Ocean Institute's R/VFalkor (Too).\nThe ship is a major addition to MBARI’s capabilities in ocean exploration. At 50 meters long, 12.8 meters wide with a draft of 3.7 meters, the new ship is bigger than its predecessor. The larger size will expand the institute’s ability to study marine life across the West Coast, from the Pacific Northwest to Baja California.\nTheDavid Packardwill replace MBARI’s flagship research vessel, theWestern Flyer,which was retired in 2022 and which was the institute’s workhorse for two and half decades. It now joinsRachel CarsonandParagonin MBARI’s fleet of research vessels.\nHaving arrived in Moss Landing, MBARI’s marine operations team is expected to take on the lengthy process of installing custom equipment and systems for oceanographic research. Also planned is a period in dry dock for maintenance and regulatory inspections before she can return to Moss Landing.\nScience missions aboardDavid Packard,which can accommodate up to 12 crew members and 18 scientists for voyages lasting up to 10 days, will begin later this year.\n“The ship will not only support advanced technology developed by the MBARI team but also promote collaboration across the marine science and technology community. Together, it’s all hands on deck to understand our changing ocean,” said Kaya Johnson, MBARI Director of Marine Operations.\nThe new ship boasts cutting edge technologies. It will serve as the command center for the institute’s remotely operated vehicle, Doc Ricketts, a robotic submersible that can dive up to 4,000 meters underwater.David Packardcan also support the launch and recovery of autonomous technologies, including underwater vehicles that can map the seafloor, conduct visual surveys of the midwater, and monitor ocean health."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nWorld markets are still trying to adjust to the reality of a U.S. market with steep tariffs, and U.S. consumers are weighing the impact of rising prices for foreign goods. Luckily for consumers, those price hikes will likely be tempered by two things: cheaper oil, thanks to an OPEC production hike and a weakening economic outlook; and falling costs for ocean freight, thanks to reduced demand for shipping.\nAccording to UK-based Pantheon Macroeconomics, a drop in oil prices and shipping costs will offset about one quarter of the expected inflation effects of the White House's tariffs. The consultancy's base case forecast is a one percent additional increase to consumer prices due to the tariff schedule.\nSpot rates for freight to and from the U.S. have been falling since December, and the core Shanghai-LA route is now half the price that it was at the beginning of the year ($2,700 per FEU today vs. $5,500 in early January). Pantheon predicts that less expensive ocean freight will offset tariff hikes, and will take about 0.15 percent off of a key measurement of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index.\nEnergy is also getting cheaper. West Texas Intermediate has fallen from $72 per barrel last week to $61 per barrel on Monday. \"The drop [in oil prices] mostly reflects expectations that global demand will wither due to tariffs, but prices also fell after OPEC unexpectedly announced last week a bigger increase in output,\" explained Pantheon's chief economist Samuel Tombs in a research note.\nThe drop in oil prices means that domestic fuel prices will likely drop by about 14 percent, offsetting tariffs and knocking another 0.1 percent off of inflation.\nOPEC's oil production decision comes after repeated lobbying from the White House. President Donald Trump has been asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers to export more oil and lower the global cost of energy since his first week in office, citing a desire to reduce Russian oil revenue.\n\"[It's] his clear intention to use energy as leverage over Russia to end the war in Ukraine. That said, lower oil prices will certainly not incentivise US oil producers to 'drill, baby, drill' – particularly in high-cost Alaska,\" said David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, speaking to BBC after the inauguration."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has released the results of an investigation into the death of an engineer aboard the OSVRed Stagin Port Fourchon, Louisiana in 2023. The crewmember was electrocuted after opening a high voltage electrical panel without authorization.\nOn the afternoon of October 13, 2023,Red Stagwas moored alongside at the Adriatic Marine dock in Port Fourchon, and was preparing for its next charter. At about 2000 hours, the vessel's first engineer adjusted ballast by activating the vessel's mud pump system, turning it on and off using the emergency stop button on the aft deck rather than the control panel belowdecks. When finished, he left the e-stop in the \"off\" position. This is normal practice, according to the Coast Guard.\nAt 2330 hours, the crew conducted a watch change. The oncoming engineering watchstander, the \"unqualified engineer,\" was tasked with cleaning the engine room.\nAt about 0530 hours, the unqualified engineer asked the deckhand where he could find a voltage meter. The deckhand did not know, and didn't know why his crewmate needed it. This was the last time that anyone saw the unqualified engineer alive.\nSometime thereafter, the unqualified engineer opened up the 480-volt electrical panel for the mud pump system. His body was found in front of the panel at about 0640, and his fingerprints were later found on a high voltage conductor inside the open panel door.\nThe master called emergency medical services on his cell, and the crew started CPR. The man could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 0740. His death was ruled accidental by the county coroner.\nAccording to the Coast Guard, the unqualified engineer was training for his engineering license but was not qualified to access and work on the 480-volt panel for the mud pump. It is unknown why he opened the panel, but the Coast Guard suspects that he was unaware that the pump e-stop on deck was turned off. He then bypassed company safety policies and attempted to troubleshoot it himself.\n\"It is reasonable to assume that if the Unqualified Engineer was more experienced with the operation of the mud pump system, he may have verified the status of the pump’s emergency stop and de-activated it, preventing him from having to open the 480 volt panel and prevented the incident from occurring,\" the Coast Guard concluded.\nThe investigators also noted thatRed Staglacked some form of an indicator to show that the e-stop was activated; if an indicator had been present, the engineer might have realized that the system was already working as designed. Likewise, a lock on the cabinet would have prevented unauthorized access.\nThe operating company initiated a fleetwide safety stand-down after the fatality to review policies with all crewmembers. The Coast Guard found no regulatory breaches, and made no additional recommendations."

        "content": "\nAustralian oil and gas company Woodside Energy is selling down its equity stake in its Louisiana LNG project, starting with the sale of a 40 percent stake to U.S.-based investment firm Stonepeak.\nWoodside is getting near to a final investment decision on the LNG production and export project, which it acquired in a $900 million takeover of developer Tellurian last October. The cost of implementing the entire five-train facility near Lake Charles, Louisiana is estimated at $27 billion.\nThe Australian company says that the sale of the 40 percent stake to Stonepeak is timely. Stonepeak is expected to inject $5.7 billion in capital expenditure into the project, covering 75 percent of the project’s capital needs in both 2025 and 2026.\nWoodside says that the stake sale reduces its capital expenditure profile and brings the project one step closer to a FID. Talks continue with other potential partners as Woodside aims to sell another 10 percent stake in the project. Its aim is to retain a 50 percent operating stake in the megaproject, which will produce 27.6 million metric tons per annum (MTPA) when complete.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to a positive FID and the needed regulatory, legal, and other approvals. At that point, Stonepeak is expected to make available $2 billion as part of its capex contribution.\nThe Louisiana LNG project is being built in four phases. Phase I includes two trains with a capacity to produce 11 MTPA, while Phase II has one train with a capacity of 5.5 MTPA. In December last year, Bechtel was awarded the contract for phases one and two, which are estimated to cost $900 to $960 per tonne of capacity. Construction is already well under way, ahead of a final investment decision.\n“The project represents a compelling opportunity to invest in a newbuild LNG export facility nearing FID approval with an attractive risk-return profile and best-in-class partners in both Bechtel and Woodside to construct and operate the asset,” said James Wyper, Stonepeak Senior Managing Director and Head of US Private Equity.\nHe added the significant additional capacity from the Louisiana LNG project will be central in further propelling the status of the U.S as a leading LNG exporter. The country exported 11.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG in 2024, remaining the world’s largest exporter."

With the termination of the “ineffective” program, the agency is expected to save $32.7 million, funds that have already been appropriated and which will now be redirected to address emerging needs.\nCG-LIMS was among the nearly 500 IT systems that the Coast Guard has invested millions to procure to help execute its various missions. Expected to begin operating in 2027 before reaching full capability in 2031, the CG-LIMS had been marketed as a system that leverages modern and cloud-based technology to deliver an integrated capability.\nIn particular, the system would have allowed the agency to better track its supply needs, ease the logistics burden on field units, provide a modern IT tool for maintenance teams and offer better cybersecurity than current systems. The system was also expected to support maintenance and supply of aircraft, vessels, and shore based assets besides managing asset configuration, supply, maintenance and technical data for capital assets in a single unit.\nThe Coast Guard intended to utilize the system on 245 cutters, 200 aircraft, 1,800 boats, shore-based systems, aids to navigation equipment and command, control, communications, computers, cyber, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment.\nHowever, with DOGE now determining that the program is ineffective, the Coast Guard is expected to stop any acquisition activities and reassign CG-LIMS personnel to fill other critical personnel shortages within the agency.\n“Another win for government efficiency,” said Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security. “$32 million in taxpayer savings thanks to the Coast Guard eliminating an ineffective IT program. I’m proud of the men and women of the Coast Guard, who continue to deliver on the President's agenda and deliver efficiency while securing our borders and maritime approaches.”"

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAs China and South Korea celebrate continued dominance in global shipping, Turkey has recorded a decline for another consecutive year in a sector that was once lucrative for the country. Recent data from the Turkish Exporters Assembly (TIM) indicate that shipyard exports in the first quarter decreased by 27.5 percent to $328 million.In March alone, the exports plunged 40 percent to $86 million compared to the same period last year. As a result, shipbuilding was the worst performing industrial export sector in the first quarter.\nThe decline has been attributed to rising operational costs and difficulties in accessing financing. According to the data, production costs have reached almost the same levels as Norway, which is a key export market for ships built in Turkey. This has seen major Turkish shipyards invest abroad, reportedly to counter declining market conditions back home.\nIn 2023, Tersan Shipyard, a leading shipbuilding company based in Altinova, Turkey, acquired Havyard Leirvik Shipyard in Norway. Tersan said that acquisition is part of its strategy to strengthen its position in Northern Europe and in the global shipbuilding market. During the same year, another Turkish shipbuilding company - Hicri Ercili - acquired Norden Shipyard in Netherlands.\n“Decrease in new orders continue to persist, and we foresee a contraction of over 15 percent in the sector’s exports by the end of the year. The weakening of the Turkish currency has also added new problems to the sector, causing a surge in foreign currency loan interest rates,” chairman of the Ship, Yacht and Services Exporters’ Association (GYHIB) Cem Seven told Ekonomim news.\nLost employment is also now a major concern. The data shows that across over 80 active shipyards in Turkey, employment fell nearly 10 percent in the last seven months. The last time the Turkish shipbuilding sector posted a positive outlook was in 2023, with exports rising 33 percent to $1.94 billion. During that year, the sector surpassed China in tugboat manufacturing and held a global lead in fishing boat construction."

Both are leased and operated by CK Hutchison, a private Hong Kong-based firm with extensive holdings around the world. The review found potential irregularities, and it could delay or jeopardize the sale of the two terminals to U.S. private equity firm BlackRock - an undesirable outcome for the Trump administration, which supports the sale and wants to see the terminals in American hands.\nIn his review, controller general Anel Flores concluded that CK Hutchison's local subsidiary underpaid Panama by about $300 million, and he claimed that the firm had not properly renewed its contract to operate the two terminals. According to Flores, the renewal was negotiated on terms that were lopsided in favor of CK Hutchison, and he claimed that the resulting deal was never approved by the controller general's office. \"There must be something else going on here, because everyone [at the Panama Canal Authority] negotiated in favor of the company. Nobody wore the Panama jersey,\" Flores alleged.\nFlores plans to submit a complaint with specific charges to prosecutors within days, and Panama's attorney general has already started an ex officio investigation.\nThe decision raises questions about whether Panama will recognize CK Hutchison's right to sell the leases to BlackRock or any other buyer; if the renewal is invalidated, Panama could in theory nationalize the terminals and auction off operating rights to a new concessionaire, Johns Hopkins Latin America expert Benjamin Gedan told the New York Times.\nIt is the latest in a series of setbacks for BlackRock. China's government is strongly opposed to the sale, and has pressured CK Hutchison to delay or cancel it for patriotic reasons. Chinese state-owned ports operators are said to be in talks with Hutchison executives about possible offers to take over the firm's network if the BlackRock deal falls through.\nThe total global value of the Hutchison-BlackRock deal comes to $22.8 billion, and includes dozens of other terminals around the world. The alleged $300 million payment shortfall at Hutchison's Panama subsidiary is equal to little more than one percent of the value of the overall transaction."

It is a money-saving technological milestone, and marks the first use of unmanned aircraft for replenishment and stores transfer between ships in the task force.\nThe drone squadron will operate alongside the F35B stealth jets and naval helicopters on HMSPrince of Wales, handling deliveries of food, personal packages, and engineering parts weighing up to 68 kilos (150 pounds). The Royal Navy says that this will take helicopter flight hours off of cargo missions and allow the helicopter aircrews to focus on their primary protective missions.\n\"95 percent of stores transferred weigh less than 50kg,\" said Lieutenant Matt Parfitt, drone flight commander with 700X Naval Air Squadron. \"In the past we'd have used a helicopter if a part was urgently needed on another ship. This time we're going to use a remotely-piloted, uncrewed system instead.\"\nThe Malloy T-150 drones used on the deployment have eight two-foot rotor blades and can fly at speeds up to 50 knots, with an endurance of 20-40 minutes. Each drone requires a two-person team - a remote pilot and a command unit monitor - and the unmanned systems can be flown manually or programmed to follow designated waypoints.\nThe drone systems were acquired in August, leaving the Navy with limited time to develop operational procedures, training, and integration with crewed aircraft operations. Lieutenant Parfitt noted the challenges of adapting the primarily land-based systems for maritime use.\n\"These systems have only really been used over land before, so we're also having to understand how we can operate and maintain them in the maritime environment,\" he said.\nThe 700X Naval Air Squadron has assembled a team of 12 sailors to operate the nine drones, initially from three ships in the group. The squadron includes personnel from various naval branches who have been retrained as drone operators.\nAmong them is Able Rate Michael Page, who transitioned from aircraft handling to become a remote pilot qualified on both the Malloy and smaller fixed-wing Puma drones. \"You've got a lot more responsibility in this role and they don't just need to look at your rank, instead they look at your level of skill,\" Page said.\nThe drones were developed through a Ministry of Defence research project aimed at accelerating the adoption of new technology. The Royal Navy's experimental 700X Naval Air Squadron trialed a far larger Malloy T-600 rotary wing drone at RNAS Culdrose in 2022, alongside a Windracers Autonomous Systems Ultra fixed-wing drone.\nThe Ultra is a twin-engine, aluminum-bodied unmanned plane that can drop a payload onto a carrier-sized landing pad at a range of more than 500 nautical miles - but it can't do ship-to-ship vertical replenishment runs, the day-to-day logistics workload of a carrier strike group at sea."

        "content": "\nThe cruise industry enters 2025 in one of its strongest positions ever as the executives of the cruise lines discussed the near-term challenges looming for the economy and global instability. Speaking at the Opening General Season of the industry trade show Seatrade Cruise Global 2025 they highlighted the industry’s history of resilience and ability to adapt in the face of growing economic and political instability.\nAsked about the current economic climate and how it was impacting the cruise industry, Josh Weinstein, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation, admitted that the industry’s much ballyhooed “wave season” this year was inconsistent and “choppy.” He said Carnival Corp., like most of the industry companies, started 2025 heavily booked with a long duration stretching out to cruises in 2026 and 2027, but consumers have quickly pulled back in the face of the emerging uncertainties.\n“Bookings slowed,” said Weinstein as “people adjusted to the new conditions.” He however believes consumers adjust and the value proposition of cruising will put the industry in a better position. The executives avoided saying “recession,” but it is clearly on everyone’s mind. Weinstein admitted cruising “is not immune from a recession.”\nTariffs and the emerging trade war however they dismissed as having little impact on the cruise industry. The CEOs of Carnival Corp., MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, and Royal Caribbean Group all pointed to the industry’s local supply chains and ability to adjust to avoid tariffs. Pierfrancesco Vago, Executive Chairman of MSC Cruises, also noted that they continue to see Americans traveling to Europe and Europeans booking travel to the United States.\nThe new President and CEO of CLIA (Cruise Lines International Association), Bud Darr who left MSC to run the trade group, highlighted that about a third of the world’s democracies held elections in 2024, acknowledging a global “mood change in policy.” He noted a cyclical nature of policy while saying cruising would be an “evolving industry in an evolving world.”\n“We are not changing our strategy after two days,” said Harry Sommer, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, referencing the launch of Trump’s tariffs and the collapse in global stock markets.\nThe executives pointed to the continuing investments being announced for new ships. At least six cruise ship orders have been announced to coincide with the start of the conference.\n“We have great confidence in the long-term and are managing for the long-term,” said Jason Liberty, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean Group. He noted the lack of building slots at the four European shipyards that build large cruise ships noting the companies were managing construction for the long term.\nWhile CLIA calculates there are 60 cruise ships on order, it was noted that half are under 100,000 gross tons. They said however that cruise ships are getting larger in part to provide space for new and future technologies.\n“We are not building bigger for the sake of bigger,” said Weinstein. He acknowledges the economics of new cruise ships but said they design ships to provide different experiences for people looking for different options. Vago agreed pointing to the ability of smaller cruise ships to go “off the beaten track.”\nThe executives each highlighted that they remained optimistic while there was also a call for more collaboration. They said the industry needs to continue to educate elected officials and others of its value and contribution as well as working with local authorities to address concerns before they become a problem.\nThe conversation with the executives kicked off the three-day trade show. Organizers noted that the conference is marking milestones, including its 40th anniversary with 12,000 attendees. CLIA highlighted its expectations that cruising will continue to grow releasing its projection that 37 million people will cruise in 2025 and better than 13 percent growth to reach 42 million passengers by 2028."

The Clemencau 25 Carrier Strike Group (CSG) now appears to be heading home to Toulon, and it probably includes a nuclear attack submarine, which has not been identified.\nAs the French return home, UK CSG 25 is preparing to set sail from Portsmouth for an eight-month round trip to the Yokosuka naval base in Japan, involving an outward and inward transit of the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. The CSG 25 flagship HMSPrince of Wales(R09) has completed Exercise Tamber Shield in the North Sea, a 20-day work-up in preparation for the deployment, and has loaded up from an ammunition depot in Scotland. A detailed timetable has not been issued for the deployment, but the CSG is scheduled to depart on April 22.\nBased on a similar deployment to the Pacific by its sister ship HMSQueen Elizabeth(R08) in 2021, the Prince of Wales CSG is likely to transit the Red Sea in May and to return in November. It is unclear whether this plan has been coordinated with the United States, for whom simultaneously maintaining two aircraft carriers in the CENTCOM area places a strain on resources.\nThe United Kingdom has previously participated in strikes on Houthi positions inside Yemen, rather than restricting activities to the defense of merchant shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Hence a precedent has been set politically for the UK CSG to supplement the current campaign against the Houthis, should this be desired, and to linger in the Red Sea. However, this would then impact planned engagements in the Indo-Pacific area, including with the navies of Australia, Japan and the United States.\nOn board HMS Prince of Wales will be two F-35B squadrons, 809 Naval Air Squadron and 617 “The Dambusters” Squadron RAF, Wildcat attack helicopters from 815 Naval Air Squadron, Merlin helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron and a number of Chinooks, as well as Royal Marines unit. It is unclear as yet if a US Marine Corps F-35B squadron will also be embarked, as it was during the similar 2021 deployment, but there will be no US Navy escorts for the CSG.\nOther ships in the UK CSG will include Daring Class destroyer HMSDauntless(D33), Royal Norwegian Navy Nansen Class frigate HNoMSRoald Amundsen(F311), Type 23 anti-submarine frigate HMSRichmond(F239), an Astute Class nuclear attack submarine and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels. Canadian and Spanish ships will also join the CSG for parts of the deployment."

Airline operators and cruise ship companies that operate to and from American locations have experienced a decline in customers from Canada, most of whom are planning to travel domestically. Canadian-owned and Canadian-registered cruise vessel operators who sail to and from Canadian locations have experienced an increase in bookings.\nCruise ships sailing from Europe and the UK to the North American Great Lakes have attracted an increasing number of customers over the last several years. The recent imposition of American tariffs on European and British products has potential to affect European and British tourism to North American destinations. Cruise ships sailing between the North Atlantic and Lake Ontario need to transit through American navigation locks located on the Upper St. Lawrence River, where American border patrol officials have the authority to check documents. Cruise ship operators have the option to arrange to have tourists bypass the American navigation locks.\nBypassing the Locks\nA dock capable of berthing Seawaymax size cruise ships is located at the former Port of Cornwall, which might need to be reactivated for the cruise industry. Cruise companies that sail vessels from Toronto and Kingston to locations that include Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City and ocean coastal locations, might consider sailing from Port of Cornwall. Likewise, cruise ship operators that sail from Europe and Britain to the Great Lakes also have the option of sailing to the Port of Cornwall, to transfer their guests to motor coaches for transportation to Port of Johnstown.\nDespite the Port of Johnstown being a bulk freight terminal, passenger cruise vessels have stopped there to transfer passengers to tour buses that carried tourists to and from nearby tourist attractions. There is potential for cruise vessel operators to keep a few vessels on the Canadian side of the Great Lakes, to sail from Port of Johnstown to Georgian Bay, via Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron with stopovers at Kingston, Toronto and Niagara Falls region.\nCanadian Cruising\nA 120-feet length mini cruise vessel dubbedKawartha Voyageurhas clearance to sail from Kingston at the northeast corner of Lake Ontario, through the navigation locks of the Rideau Canal that connects to Ottawa, with additional clearance to sail the Ottawa River to Montreal. The vessel does on occasion sail to Quebec City. A slightly larger vessel with 35 cabins, dubbedCanadian Empress,is cleared to sail the Ottawa River between Montreal and Ottawa. It regularly sails along the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City.\nWhile the dimensions ofCanadian Empressare slightly smaller than the navigation locks along the Rideau Canal, it usually sails along the Upper St. Lawrence River from Kingston to Montreal and the Ottawa river to and from Ottawa. Due to the imposition of American tariffs and a crackdown on foreign nationals in the USA, the operator has the option to divert guests around American customs at the navigation lock. The vessel is able to berth at Canadian marinas located on both sides of the navigation lock, potentially allowing guests to travel a short distance by bus between marinas.\nWestern and Northern Cruises\nSeveral Vancouver–area companies that own small cruise vessels offer the equivalent of river cruises by sailing the Inside Passage from Vancouver and into scenic inlets that connect to the Strait of Georgia. While not a tourist ship, a Canadian passenger ferry service sails the scenic route from Vancouver to small communities located along Canada’s Pacific coast. Canadian small – cruise vessel companies that sail from the Port of Vancouver aim their services at a different market than mega-scale cruise vessels.\nThe small vessels carry anywhere from 6 to over 50 guests and offer a very different itinerary to mega-scale vessels, which are unable to turn around within the limited width of the scenic inlets. Unlike cruise ships that make brief stopovers, the small vessels make extended duration stops at small coastal villages, to the delight of many of their guests. Summertime Arctic cruises are becoming popular. One multiday Arctic cruise sails from Port of Churchill on Hudson Bay with ports of call extending to Western Greenland. It interconnects with a passenger train from Winnipeg.\nConclusions\nAmerican tariffs have elicited a response from Canadian citizens who previously flocked to American tourist destinations and boarded cruise vessels at American ports. Tariffs have begun to hit the tourist industry. Canadians - along with guests from numerous overseas origins - are becoming selective when booking passage aboard cruise vessels."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe Nordic Association of Marine Insurers (Cefor) has released its 2024 hull and machinery coverage report, shining a spotlight on emerging trends in the marine insurance market. Cefor has a coverage share of about 56 percent of the world fleet above 20,000 gross tonnage (GT).\nA major highlight in the report is the rising claim cost per vessel since the pandemic. While the major claims impact was benign in the period from 2015 to 2022, with only an occasional claim exceeding $30 million, both 2023 and 2024 saw claims above $50 million. In 2023 and 2024, the claim cost per vessel was 22 percent higher than the average of the period 2017-2019. Cefor attributes this to the shipping trend towards larger and more valuable vessels, which somewhat heightens the probability of very large losses.\n“Machinery damage showed a substantial increase in recent years, which should be seen in the context of an aging fleet. Among the largest losses, fires and collisions dominate,” said Cefor Actuary Astrid Seltmann.\nCefor predicts that a silver tsunami is in the offing, with many vessels delivered in the years after the financial crises (2008-2012) now getting old (13-17 years). These vessels are prone to fires, machinery claims and consequential damages. Machinery claims accounted for 56% of the claims cost for these vessels compared to a 35% share on vessels built in later years.\nLast year, eleven machinery claims above $5 million were reported. This compares to seven such claims in 2023 and nine in 2022. The majority of machinery claims represent damage to the main engine, followed by auxiliary engines and propeller shafts.\nAgain, fires and collisions represented the costliest claims in 2024. Since 2019, the number of fires in container vessels has increased, raising concerns in the shipping industry. In 2023, the two largest losses above $50 million were fires, and four out of eight losses above $10 million were fires. In 2024, four out of nine losses above $10 million were fires; the two largest were collisions.\nChristian Irgens, chair of Cefor’s Statistics Forum, also highlighted an increase in heavy weather losses, which might be linked to vessel rerouting through more weather-exposed areas. Weather-related casualties from the end of 2023 through the second quarter of 2024 showed a steady increase exceeding the seasonal variation of the preceding years. Increased exposure to weather events on the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope might have had an impact on the occurrence of weather-related damage."

        "content": "\nSaudi-backed media outlet Al Hadath has reported the death of the Houthi intelligence chief, Abdul Nasser Al-Kamali, in an American airstrike. It is the latest reported fatality among the Houthis' leadership ranks from the intensified U.S. bombing campaign, which is now in its fourth week.\nWhite House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz claimed last week that a U.S. strike took out an unnamed Houthi missile expert, without providing further details. The Pentagon has not confirmed the claim.\n“It’s been a bad three weeks for the Houthis, and it’s about to get worse,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday.\nThe group continues to hit back, albeit at a slower pace than before the airstrike campaign. On Monday, a Houthi spokesman said that the group launched an attack on Tel Aviv with a drone, along with an attempted strike on two U.S. Navy destroyers. The Israeli Defense Force said in a statement that the drone was shot down before it crossed into Israeli airspace, and that no air raid alerts were required.\nThe Houthis have routinely launched strikes on Israeli and American targets, with limited success; the group has yet to land a confirmed hit on a U.S. Navy vessel, and it only managed to sink two merchant ships in more than 100 attempts in 2024. Both sinkings required repeated follow-up attacks.\nStockpile effects\nThe cost of the Trump administration's intensified bombing campaign on Yemen is approaching $1 billion, according to the New York Times, raising concerns about the effects on U.S. guided weapons stockpiles. Officials say that Navy pilots have to use standoff weapons to hit Houthi targets, consuming part of the inventory of slow-to-replace advanced munitions.\nOver the longer course of the conflict, the steady stream of incoming Houthi drones and missiles has also drained the U.S. Navy's stockpile of advanced interceptors, including the SM-class missiles it needs to shoot down high-end cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. In any future conflict with China, these missiles would be an essential ingredient for the defense of the surface fleet and shoreside installations.\nThe U.S. Navy's top officer, acting chief of naval operations Adm. James Kilby, said Tuesday that he regrets not pursuing modest laser weapons to take down drone-sized objects. The Navy fielded an anti-drone laser on a deployed warship as early as 2014, but fleetwide use has yet to materialize after 11 years of R&D. In the Red Sea battle environment, the lack of a laser means using up multi-million-dollar missiles on $2,000 inbound drones. Destroyer crews have used up about 200 SM-class missiles defending themselves and nearby shipping from Houthi munitions, and Kilby told Fox that the lack of \"better ways to more economically attrit the threat\" was a problem.\nUnder Adm. Kilby's watch as the former deputy commander of Fleet Forces Command, the Navy tried to develop exquisite high-end lasers in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 megawatts, \"and I have regret for that,\" Kilby told Fox. He said that the Navy is hard at work now on low-cost ways to counter autonomous threats, and he called on munitions manufacturers to speed up production."

The U.S. has also reportedly withdrawn its delegation from the talks, effective Wednesday.\nThe response is in line with the administration's combative rhetoric towards carbon regulations and other international agreements, but it is a stark departure from the neutral tone that U.S. negotiators previously maintained. It is unclear whether senior White House leadership was involved in formulating the moreaccommodatingU.S. negotiating position that American representatives projected in the runup to this week's MEPC meeting in London, which ends Friday.\n\"Should such a blatantly unfair measure go forward, our government will consider reciprocal measures so as to offset any fees charged to U.S. ships and compensate the American people for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures,\" the White House wrote in a last-minute warning to other national delegations. \"We must be clear the U.S. rejects any and all efforts to impose economic measures against its ships based on GHG emissions or fuel choice.\"\nAny participation in a tax on shipping's GHG emissions - the first global carbon levy of any kind - would have been in deep conflict with White House policy on climate change. President Donald Trump campaigned against climate action and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement on the first day of his second term, and he has promoted the production and use of all fossil fuels - including the renewed use of coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel.\nAn IMO bunker levy would also boost shipbuilding activity in East Asia, which would undercut White House policy goals. The Trump administration wants to reduce the power of Chinese shipyards, which lead the market and would stand to benefit from any IMO incentives for green retrofits and newbuilds. China's state-owned CSSC is the world's largest commercial shipbuilder, and any additional merchant vessel orders wouldcross-subsidizeits warship deliveries for the PLA Navy, the U.S. Navy's pacing threat.\nSome environmental advocates have suggested that action at MEPC is still possible, despite U.S. threats of retaliation (and rumored opposition from certain oil-producing member states).\n\"Let’s not get dazzled by the drama — this isn’t the United States of Shipping,\" Seas at Risk shipping policy officer Anais Rios told Politico. \"There are 175 countries in the room, and delegates are rolling up their sleeves to find the best path forward.

        "content": "\nInfested boats are aiding the transportation of invasive termites across the globe, spreading insect species that cause economic damages running into the billions of dollars, a new study reveals.\nThe study by researchers at the University of Florida concludes that recreational vessels - yachts, cabin cruisers, sailboats and similar personal craft - have become the main means of transportation for termite stowaways.\nAided by maritime transportation, the damage caused by the invasive termite species like the Formosan subterranean, Asian subterranean and West Indian drywood is significant and continues to rise. Since 2010, termite infestations have been linked to an annual economic impact exceeding $40 billion globally, with the Formosan subterranean alone causing an estimated $20 to $30 billion in damage.\nAlthough historically termites have been suspected of being able to travel long distances on floating debris after natural disasters like hurricanes, tsunamis or landslides, private boats have made it much easier for termites to spread. The fact that recreational boats are not routinely checked for termites has allowed small vessels to become mobile breeding grounds for colonies, with the end result being unchecked spread.\n“Instead of a few termites accidentally crossing oceans once in a million years, we now have a high probability of them traveling on infested boats every year, dramatically increasing their spread potential,” said Thomas Chouvenc, lead researcher.\nIn the study published in the ScienceDirect journal, researchers summarized a combination of field surveys, genetic analysis and historical data to make a compelling case that boats, particularly those used for recreation, are a major cause for the spread of termites across continents. In fact, owing to the fact that termite pests are excellent at associating with human activity, boats provide an ideal environment for them to travel far beyond their native habitats.\nThe study states that most termites remain within their native regions, unable to thrive in urban environments. However, the species responsible for the most damage have adapted to urban climates.\nOnce an infestation is established in a boat, it can easily spread onshore. The termites, often carried in hidden colonies aboard boats, can spread to other on shore regions when flying termites are attracted to city lights. Once colonies are established on land, the species continue to spread, creating new infestations in other boats and urban areas.\nA case in point is South Florida, popularly known as the \"yachting capital of the world,\" which has also become a hot spot for invasive termite species - thanks to the many discoveries of termite colonies in recreational boats.\nData by the National Marine Manufacturers Association show that Florida is the top state in the U.S when it comes to recreational boating, boasting more than one million registered boats with an annual economic impact of $31.3 billion.\n“In Florida and many other tropical regions, the risk is high because recreational boating is so prevalent,” warned Chouvenc. “Boats in these areas are likely to be infested, but unless owners take proactive steps, the spread of termites will continue unchecked.”\nBy becoming the preferred means of transportation for termite stowaways, boats are aiding in their economic destruction - particularly for homeowners and businesses due to their tendencies to damage wood in structures and infest trees.\nChouvenc says that regular inspection of vessels for signs of infestation is one of the main ways to curb the spread of invasive termites."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union finalized a new regulation aimed at reducing microplastic pollution caused by plastic pellets. Representatives from the European Parliament and the EU Council agreed to provisional terms on measures designed to improve handling practices across the entire plastic pellet supply chain, both on land and at sea.\n\"Microplastics, including plastic pellets are now found everywhere — in our oceans, seas and even in the food we eat. Each year, the equivalent of up to 7,300 truckloads of plastic pellets are lost to the environment. Today, the EU has taken a landmark step toward reducing pellet pollution by adopting measures to tackle losses and ensure correct handling, including in maritime transport,\" said Paulina Hennig-Kloska, Poland's Minister for Climate and Environment.\nThe legislation lays out mandatory requirements for both European and non-European operators. The framework outlines clear responsibilities in cases of accidental spills, emphasizing immediate cleanup operations. Every facility handling plastic pellets will be required to develop a risk management strategy addressing packaging methods, loading and unloading procedures, employee training programs, and essential equipment specifications.\nTo ensure equal standards apply to all parties involved in pellet transportation, non-EU carriers must designate an authorized representative within European Union borders, promoting accountability and operational transparency.\nThe agreement takes a tiered approach. Large companies processing over 1,500 tonnes of pellets per year must obtain verification from independent third-party auditors. Smaller operations exceeding the same volume threshold will benefit from simplified requirements, including a one-time certification valid for five years following implementation. Microenterprises and those handling under 1,500 tonnes yearly will only need to provide a self-declaration of compliance.\nThe environmental impact of pellet contamination in aquatic ecosystems can last decade, since these materials resist natural biodegradation processes. With maritime shipping accounting for nearly 38% of all pellet transportation within the EU in 2022, the agreement also establishes specific maritime protocols. These include packaging requirements and mandatory disclosure of transport and cargo information, aligning with International Maritime Organisation guidelines.\nBefore final adoption, both the Council and Parliament must formally endorse the provisional agreement. Following legal and linguistic refinement, the regulation will be published in the EU's Official Journal, coming into force two years afterward. Maritime-specific provisions will receive an additional year for implementation to allow for industry adjustment.\nAccording to the EU, between 52,140 and 184,290 tonnes of plastic pellets entered Europe's environment in 2019 alone. Leakage occurs at multiple points throughout the production and distribution chain. Currently, no specific EU legislation addresses plastic pellet pollution, despite their ranking as the third largest source of unintentional microplastic releases after paint particles and tire fragments.\nA recent incident highlighted the ongoing threat. In March, half-burned plastic nurdles washed ashore along England's east coast after the allision of the boxshipSolongwith the tankerStena Immaculate.While not directly toxic, these plastic resin balls pose risks to wildlife if ingested, according to HM Coastguard.\nResearch has shown that pellets comprise about 70 percent of the plastic eaten by seabirds, with small plastic particles being found in the stomachs of 63 of the world’s approximately 250 species of seabirds."

Only China remains subject to the White House's steep nation-by-nation tariff schedule, and its exporters now face a crippling levy of 125 percent. Most trade with other nations - including favored new locations for Chinese manufacturers, likeVietnam- will only be subject to a 10 percent levy.\nInvestors responded positively as soon as the White House announced the 90-day delay. The Dow shot up eight percent; the S&P 500 rebounded nearly 10 percent; and the Nasdaq soared upwards 12 percent.\nIn Asia, the Nikkei jumped up eight percent and Singapore's STI benchmark rose by five percent in early trading Thursday morning. Even the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hang Seng index ticked upwards, despite the extreme U.S. tariff rates facing Chinese manufacturers.\nBuoyed by positive predictions for economic growth in the U.S., cruise stocks were some of the biggest winners. Carnival Cruise Line's stock - a benchmark for the travel and leisure industry - soared by more than 17 percent. Royal Caribbean jumped by 16 percent, and Norwegian Cruise Line went up by 18 percent. In one day of trading, all three regained almost all of the losses they had sustained since April 2, the day that the White House first announced the new tariff regime.\nA parallel rebound in oil prices triggered some signs of share price recovery in the offshore segment. The rig leader Transocean rose by 10 percent, offsetting the massive 35 percent drop it suffered last week. OSV giant Tidewater also began to recover, posting a 10 percent jump. Tanker stocks have also done well, if not yet enough to reverse earlier declines: CMB.Tech rose six percent; Teekay rose five percent; and Scorpio rose by three percent.\nIn the liner segment, almost all players saw substantial single-digit gains, led by Yang Ming (up nearly 10 percent). Chinese operators face a more challenging picture, given continued tariffs and the threat of new port fees on Chinese vessels. COSCO Shipping Holdings, the publicly-listed component of state-owned giant China COSCO, edged down by one percent early Thursday.\nThe trade landscape could still change rapidly. The reciprocal-tariff suspension will last for 90 days, according to the White House, and will give time for nations to negotiate with the Trump administration in talks led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent."

        "content": "\nItaly’s short-sea transportation company Grimaldi Group is accelerating investments in a younger and more efficient fleet of eco-friendly ro-pax carriers, committing $1.3 billion for nine newbuilds at China Merchants Jinling Shipyard (Weihai).\nThe company says that the nine pioneering vessels, which are part of its fleet expansion and renewal program, will be equipped with engines capable of running on methanol and will be designed to move rolling cargo and passengers in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea.\nThe newbuilds will be delivered between 2028 and 2030, and will be used by the group’s three brands - Grimaldi Lines, Minoan Lines and Finnlines. Four will be operated under the Grimaldi Lines brand sailing under the Italian flag, while two will be for Minoan Lines, under the Greek flag. These six, belonging to the “Next Generation Med” class, will serve routes in the Mediterranean. The other three, which debuts as the “Hansa Superstar” class, will be delivered to Finnlines to serve routes in the Baltic Sea.\nAt a length of 229 meters, the Mediterranean ro-pax vessels will have a cargo capacity of 3,300 lane meters for rolling freight and over 300 cars and up to 2,500 passengers. The Baltic Sea newbuilds will be 240 meters long with a cargo capacity of 5,100 lane meters for rolling freight plus 90 cars and up to 1,100 passengers.\nGrimaldi has a long relationship with China Merchants, and the new orders extend that partnership with the introduction of fuel-efficient technology. The new vessels will have optimized hull and propeller designs, energy-efficient onboard power management systems, shore power readiness and the application of silicon-based hull coatings. They will reduce CO? emissions per transported cargo unit by more than 50 percent compared to vessels currently operating on the same routes, Grimaldi says.\n“The new Next Generation Med and Hansa Superstar classes are the result of a thorough study of our customers’ needs and, more broadly, those of shipping. Today more than ever, the latter requires quality, efficiency and environmental sustainability to remain a key mode of national and international freight and passenger transport,” said Emanuele Grimaldi, Grimaldi Group Managing Director.\nHe added that the performance in CO? emission reduction and the use of methanol are critical components in the company’s net zero goals. Grimaldi is working to achieve zero emissions by 2050.\nThe new order comes just weeks after the company took delivery of the last of 14 hybrid ro-ro ships of its \"fifth generation\" class, built at China Merchants Jinling shipyard in Nanjing. This year and next year, the company also expects to start taking delivery of five new pure car and truck carriers from China Merchants."

        "content": "\nWith India vying for a larger global shipbuilding market, two of the country’s major shipyards have partnered to maximize output. This week, Swan Defense and Heavy Industries Limited, the company that runs Pipavav Shipyard in Gujarat, signed an MoU with the state-run Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineering Ltd (GRSE). The partnership will see the two shipyards jointly pursue opportunities in the construction of commercial vessels and offshore structures.\nPipavav has the largest dry dock in India, measuring 662 meters by 65 meters, and a working space spanning 500 acres. Unfortunately, even with a big dock capacity, it has not attracted substantial orders after resuming operations in December.\nOn the other hand, the Ministry of Defense- controlled GRSE has built a legacy in naval construction. However, it is looking to expand into the commercial shipbuilding segment. This has started to take shape with GRSE last year getting an order for four multi-purpose cargo vessels from the German shipping company Carsten Rehder.\nAccording to industry analysts, the MoU could see GRSE utilize Pipavav’s facilities, especially in executing its commercial orders. On the defense side, GRSE has seen a surge in naval shipbuilding contracts. Currently, the shipyard has orders for about 40 naval platforms. Based on this rising demand, GRSE in a recent earnings call said that it has increased its annual capacity to 24 ships this year, with plans for a greenfield facility in the next 3-5 years.\nMeanwhile, GRSE this week announced receiving a letter of award (LoA) worth over $50 million from the government of India. This will go into the construction and delivery of two coastal research vessels for the Geological Survey of India. The projected is expected to be complete within 36 months from the signing of the contract."

        "content": "\nIran Islamic Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) Navy (Nedsa) has seized another small tanker suspected of smuggling fuel within the Gulf, Nedsa reported on April 8.\nThe vessel was not identified, but would have been a small tanker, as it had a crew of six and was carrying 100,000 liters of fuel.  The ship was apprehended by patrol craft from the Nedsa’s Second Naval District, and was then taken to the district's home port of Bushehr.\nTwo other small tankers, with a total of 25 crew and carrying three million liters of diesel, were also seized and taken to Bushehr on March 31, also by patrol craft from the Nedsa Second Naval District.\nIranian seizures of small tankers carrying refined fuels, whether petrol or diesel, have been commonplace in the Gulf for years.  This smuggling occurs to exploit the arbitrage between heavily subsidized refined fuels sold in Iran, and higher fuel prices prevailing elsewhere in the Gulf.\nThe principal smuggling route is from Iran to Iraq, an attractive destination for smugglers because of endemic corruption amongst coastguard, police and customs personnel. The biggest differential between Iranian selling prices and pump prices for fuel are in the Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, where subsidies have been largely removed and the price of fuel is fixed monthly depending on market movements. Customs interceptions in Bahrain and the UAE are relatively efficient, so smugglers often have to resort to transshipment to smaller craft at sea in order to avoid detection. Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia still subsidies fuel prices, making these countries of lesser attraction to smugglers.\nSeizures of such tankers are often portrayed as being part of Iran’s campaign to expand its regional influence, or a reprisal for some form of anti-Iranian action. But the reality is that this is a local issue, with Iran and the GCC having common cause in clamping down on the smuggling carried out by these small tankers. Subsidies paid out in Iran are a huge drain on the government budget. Within the GCC, VAT, sales and corporation taxes, depending on the country concerned, are effectively avoided by purchasing smuggled fuels sold on the black market.\nMany of the smuggling operations are bankrolled by Gulf businessmen, just as pirate expeditions were centuries ago. The enterprises often employ stateless captains and crews, and vessels that are incorrectly registered or were apparently scrapped years ago.  When Iran seizes an unregistered tanker that previously called in a GCC port, the GCC country concerned is often keen not to be identified and is reluctant to intervene on behalf of those detained.\nBeyond fuel, there is a thriving industry of small-boat smuggling across the Gulf. The flow of goods is determined by subsidy arbitrage, but also by the fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, all determined by market forces.  In one month, trader boats from Iran can be bringing out pistachio nuts and returning with appliances. In the next month it will be live sheep being taken south and cigarettes heading north."

Duffy in a statement. “We will ensure the United States remains the premier maritime power and an economic powerhouse. And to the young Americans from all over the country who are interested in a maritime career – know that this administration has your back and believes you are a worthwhile investment in the prosperity of America.”"

MSC became the second cruise company to reach the mark with this class after Royal Caribbean International. Later this year, Disney Cruise Line will also deploy Disney Adventure which will be 208,000 gross tons, and both Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line have ordered ships that will exceed this size threshold being built by Fincantieri.\n\n\nArrival in PortMiami on Monday, April 7 (courtesy PortMiami)\n\nMSC World Americais 1,094 feet in length (333 meters) with 2,614 passenger cabins. The ship accommodates 6,762 passengers and has 2,138 crew. Like all modern cruise ships, it offers a wide array of amenities, including 19 dining venues and 18 bars and lounges. There is an outdoor water park with an over-water swing and ropes course, as well as both interior and exterior promenades with bars, cafes, and shops. The line highlights the additions of a sports bar, comedy club, and an outdoor family entertainment area among the efforts to tailor the ship to the American market.\nThe naming celebration included appearances by music stars Mark Anthony, Gloria Estefan, and Kimberly Davis. At the naming ceremony Drew Barrymore and Orlando Bloom, who are in MSC’s new branding advertisement “Lets Holiday” appeared and Barrymore was the ship’s godmother.

The ship starts commercial service on Saturday, April 12, sailing year-round from Miami.\n\n\nDuring Miami drone show (Allan Jordan)\n\nThe ship is the latest in the cruise line’s expansion in the North American market. MSC is using four homeports, Miami, Port Canaveral, Galveston, and New York, plus scheduling its first cruises to Alaska from Seattle. The 2026-2027 season will include a total of seven ships cruising in North America.\nAs another part of the expansion, the group officially opened what they are calling the world’s largest cruise terminal in PortMiami with nearly 500,000 square feet and the ability to process 36,000 passengers per day. Designed by Arquitectonia and built by Fincantieri Infrastructure at a cost reported between $400 and $500 million (including $186 million from PortMiami), it can handle three large cruise ships at one time and will be the terminal for both MSC Cruises and its luxury brand Explora Journeys. Among the advanced technologies in use will be biometrics to speed up the handling of passengers.\n\n\n(courtesy MSC Cruises)\n\nMSC Cruises highlights thatMSC World Americais the company’s 23rd cruise ship. In approximately 20 years, the group has built 19 cruise ships at Chantiers de l’Atlantique and Fincantieri using five prototypes. In addition to the two ships under construction in France, MSC’s Explora brand has four cruise ships being built in Italy.

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAs markets continue to fall on the news of a 145 percent tariff on all Chinese goods, the White House has quietly signaled that it will soften its plans for multimillion-dollar port fees on Chinese ships - fees that U.S. oil companies, exporters and farmers strongly opposed.\nSix sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the White House may delay or reduce the fees proposed by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). The head of the office, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, confirmed Tuesday that some of the fees might not be put into action and might not be added together.\nThe fees - which could have cost up to $3.5 million per port call for Chinese-built ships, under the original plan - drew protests from major domestic industries. The fees would have raised the cost of shipping for exporting oil, grain, machinery and other goods, making them less competitive or pricing them out of the global market, with broader effects on the U.S. economy. Some smaller U.S.-based carriers like Atlantic Container Line (ACL) warned that they would have to shut down American operations, and at least one major U.S. shipowner - Genco - said that it might cease calling in U.S. ports. Energy Products Partners, a leading U.S. midstream firm, warned that the fees would also have a devastating impact on oil and gas exports. If the fees take effect, \"there will be no ‘drill baby drill’ [and] the ‘liquid gold’ under our feet would stay in the ground,\" EPP told Lloyd's List.\nReuters' sources said that USTR had not considered all types and sizes of ships when it formulated the port fees. The multimillion-dollar flat-fee structure was designed only with the largest container ships in mind; the impacts on tankers, bulkers, ro/ros and smaller boxships were not taken into account before the policy proposal was released. Now that USTR is looking at the broader effects on shipping, the fee structure will likely be recalibrated based on vessel size, making it proportional to the amount of cargo carried.\nThe administration's new executive order on revitalizing American maritime - a policy directive signed Tuesday - could be used as an alternative way to pursue USTR's domestic  objectives, instead of penalizing foreign-flag shipowners with fees on Chinese ships, according to World Shipping Council President & CEO Joe Kramek.\n\"The Executive Order outlines several encouraging elements that reflect a serious focus on rebuilding the American maritime industry,\" Kramek said Thursday. \"Measures to impose retroactive port fees would disadvantage all aspects of the supply chain - from consumers to farmers, from energy producers to manufacturers.\"\nWSC previously raised the possibility of a legal challenge to USTR's fees. Last month, Kramek suggested that USTR's action was a plan to boost U.S. domestic shipbuilding, rather than a proposal to counter unfair trade practices. \"Generating demand for domestic products and raising government revenue – whether to support a domestic industry or for other purposes – are not permissible bases for actions under Section 301,\" said Kramek in a statement last month, referring to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974."

The Level 1 AiP was given by Bureau Veritas Marine& Offshore. This brings the groundbreaking Service Operation Vessel (SOV) design closer to reality.\nThe 100% hydrogen-powered SOV will be able to operate 95 percent of the time with zero carbon emissions during standard operations. This will lead in a reduction of an estimated 4,000 tonnes of annual CO2 emissions. The vessel will have capacity to accommodate up to 90 technicians for up to 14 days at sea, eliminating the need for additional offshore infrastructure. Refueling has been streamlined, as bunkering can be completed in six hours using trailers, eliminating the need for high-cost port facilities.\nLDA introduced the hydrogen SOV concept design back in March 2024, in cooperation with Norwegian naval architecture company Salt Ship.\n“We believe in developing purpose-built SOVs tailored to specific projects and needs. We are already offering alternative fuel options such as full electric and dual-fuel methanol. We firmly believe that hydrogen will be one of the options in the near future. This AiP represents a key step in making hydrogen-powered maritime operations a reality,” said LDA.\nOther projects working to develop liquid hydrogen-powered vessels include the H2ESTIA Project, led by the Dutch innovation company NIM and supported by the Dutch government. The project launched last month, and aims to design, construct and demonstrate a hydrogen-powered bulk vessel to operate in the North Sea and beyond. The short-sea and inland shipping company Van Dam Shipping will manage the vessel.\nHowever, in its bi-annual 2025 Hydrogen Market Outlook report this week, BloombergNEF indicated that the hydrogen sector has been in decline. “Costs have remained high and demand stayed low as a result. Policy has failed to bridge the gap between prices suppliers need to build viable projects and the prices buyers need to get justifiable business case. As a result, investments in the sector fell in 2024, with developers canceling projects,” said Martin Tengler, Head of Hydrogen Research, BloombergNEF.\nBut Tengler believes a rebound could be expected in places such as Europe, China, Japan and South Korea, where there are incentives offering developers opportunities for investment."

Maersk is committed to modernizing Pakistan’s port logistics and equipping them with advanced technology to establish a major maritime trade hub in the region,” said Robert Maersk.\nMaersk also emphasized that his company has a long history in the region, with the first Maersk ship arriving in Pakistan in 1924. Maersk is reportedly exploring options of developing a deep-water container terminal, with a focus on Karachi and Port Qasim.\nThe investment from Maersk coincides with reforms in Pakistan port sector announced by the Prime Minister’s Office on Monday. A maritime taskforce is already in place tasked with the responsibility of reviving Pakistan’s maritime economy. Some of the recommendations by the taskforce include setting up a National Dredging Company, which will oversee dredging of all ports in the country. In addition, a plan of action has been prepared for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) through a public-private partnership for the next 25 years.\n“The pace of installing the latest scanners at all ports should be accelerated. Trade tariffs should be reviewed to bring the country’s ports to a competitive standard,” Sharif said in a meeting with the taskforce.\nTop image: Port Qasim, Pakistan (Sana Sneha / CC BY SA 4.0)"

Dan Sullivan (R-AK). An unnamed Chinese shipping company has also reached out to the current landowner to express interest in negotiating a lease, Sullivan said at a Senate Armed Services CommitteehearingThursday.\nAdak was a key naval base throughout the Cold War, providing a logistics and surveillance hub near Russia's eastern shores. After the Base Realignment and Closure Commission process in the mid-1990s, it was shut down, and it ceased operations in 1997. The land is now held by the native Aleut Corporation.\nThe port's remoteness and austerity are hard to overstate: at 1,000 nautical miles west of Anchorage, it is closer to the capital of Russia's Kamchatka region than it is Alaska's main city. It is the second-rainiest place in the United States, and is subject to extreme winds, including hurricane-force North Pacific winter storms. As of 2022 it had a population of about 150 people, down from 6,000 at its peak.\nThe U.S. military still holds occasional exercises at Adak, and talk of reviving the base has circulated since at least2021. The regional security situation is changing: Over the last three years, Russian and Chinese forces have begun operating jointly in the North Pacific and Bering Sea, sometimes crossing over into the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. These transits have received considerable attention, and Adak would be a natural location for an enhanced U.S. deterrent presence, Sen. Sullivan said Thursday.\nAdm. Sam Paparo, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told the committee that he also favors reactivating Adak. \"It is a further western point which would enable . . . [gaining] time and distance on any force capability that's looking to penetrate,\" Paparo said. \"It would enable up to 10x the maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft coverage of that key and increasingly contested space.\"\nSullivan suggested that Adak should be reactivated as a matter of urgency, as the U.S. Navy is not the only prospective tenant.\n\"The Aleut Corporation, these are great patriotic Americans. Alaska Natives serve at higher rates in the military than any other ethnic group in the country. They would love to do a deal with the Navy for a 99 year lease or something like that. But you know who checks in with them once a year?\" Sullivan asked. \"It's a Chinese shipping company that is, certainly, in my view, a front company for the [Chinese military]. So how embarrassing would it be to the Pentagon or the Navy . . . if somehow they signed 100 year lease with a quote 'Chinese shipping company' that always is out there looking at Adak?\"\nSullivan emphasized that the Aleut Corporation would never sign a port lease with a Chinese firm, but asked Paparo his opinion all the same.\n\"I think it would be bad, because this is the modus operandi in [China's] Belt and Road Initiative,\" Paparo replied.\nNorthern Command and Indo-Pacific Command are working on a set of options to reactivate the base, Sullivan said, and he pressed for a final report before the end of the month."

Thomas Rodzewicz, commanding officer ofJames.\nAlmost all of the busts occurred on the high seas off Ecuador and Peru.James' embarked unmanned aerial systems crew did much of the legwork in detecting smuggling craft, many of which were found up to 300 nautical miles offshore. An embarked HITRON helicopter aircrew helped ensure the suspect vessels' compliance on multiple occasions, using \"airborne use of force tactics\" to make sure that the target came to a halt. (When authorized, HITRON crews may fire warning shots to deter smugglers, and can shoot out suspect boats' engines if noncompliance continues.)\nThe biggest bust occurred on January 6, whenJameswas operating about 280 miles off Ecuador. The cutter intercepted a set of three go-fast vessels at once, and with help from the HITRON aircrew,James' boarding teams intercepted and captured all three boats. Nine suspects were detained, and the cutter crew seized nearly 14,000 pounds (6.3 tonnes) of cocaine.\nJamesalso worked with the smaller cutterMohawkto interdict a fleeing go-fast vessel on January 18. Mohawk worked to recover packages that the smugglers had tossed over the side, whileJames' small pursuit boat chased down the suspect vessel from 60 nautical miles away. Three suspects were detained and about 6,000 pounds of cocaine were seized.\nIn all, the cutter racked up nine intercept events in January and February, including a three-day run of back-to-back busts that resulted in the capture of seven vessels.\n\n\"Over a remarkable 72-hour period, our crews interdicted six go-fast vessels and one low-profile vessel across the vast ocean, culminating in the extraordinary seizure of over 24,000 pounds of cocaine and 15 suspected narco-traffickers. We delivered a substantial blow to narco-terrorism organizations, sending those attempting to bring drugs to our border to face federal prosecution,\" said Capt. Rodzewicz."

        "content": "\nAmerican importers are beginning to delay or cancel orders in China due to the White House's new 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods - and some U.S. firms may even abandon import cargo on the dock because they can't afford to pay the extra duties, though the White House has promised an exemption for goods already in transit.\nEven before the latest hike, Chinese manufacturers faced a tariff of 20 percent from earlier White House actions. Many have already discounted their goods to the lowest profitable price in order to offset the effects. \"It is a deal breaker,\" toy factory owner Chen Qingxin told the Wall Street Journal. \"No room for doing business anymore, for both sides.\"\nGiven the effective doubling of their wholesale costs, American retailers are already beginning to cancel or defer orders. E-commerce giant Amazon began to revoke orders this week, according to Bloomberg, and has already canceled shipments of summer goods like air conditioners, beach chairs and scooters.\nExporters in China are also adapting to a new reality. \"All factory orders are suspended. Any goods that have not been loaded will be cancelled and goods that are already at sea will be re-priced,\" one manufacturing executive told SCMP. \"The loss on each container we ship is now greater than the profit we used to make on two containers.\" He added that his firm has heard from at least one U.S. client that the goods would be abandoned on the dock when they arrived because the tariffs make them too expensive to sell.\n\"The major trend we see is shippers looking to not accept their freight,\" supply chain consultant Joseph Esteves told CNBC. \"A lot of these companies are levered financially. They don’t have the working capital requirements and they don’t have the cash. So they simply cannot just take on this [tariff] and hope to see what happens.\"\nThe steep tariff on China may force U.S. importers to diversify their supply chains to other alternatives, like Cambodia and Vietnam, already popular options for the \"China plus one\" diversified sourcing strategy. But there is little chance that more low-end consumer goods will end up being produced in America, some in the supply chain business say.\n\"They’re absolutely not going to go back to the United States,\" said Casey Barnett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, told CNBC. \"I can’t imagine that Americans want to sit down and sew a pair of sweatpants for long hours of the day.\"\nChina has also imposed its own retaliatory tariff of 84 percent on U.S. goods, and the increased cost is expected to hit agricultural interests hard, particularly soybean farmers. U.S. manufacturers may also feel the effects of a slowdown. In California, a leading maker of CNC industrial machine tools - Haas Automation - has announced that it is scaling back hiring, production and overtime because of a \"dramatic decrease in demand for our machine tools from both domestic and foreign customers.\""

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAfter 10 years of deliberation, IMO member nations have agreed to implement the first global carbon fee for shipping. It is the first UN-administered carbon revenue system of any kind.\nAt the final day of talks for the Marine Environment Protection Committee's 83rd meeting, delegates agreed to a set of binding targets for shipping's greenhouse gas emissions, including intermediate objectives of a 20-30 percent greenhouse emission reduction by 2030, a 70-80 percent reduction by 2040, and net-zero by or around 2050.\nAccompanying the targets, delegates passed a set of long-debated technical and economic measures that are intended to incentivize compliance. Rather than an across-the-board carbon levy on all emissions, it is a tiered system of fees and compliance levels, and not all emissions will be taxed.\nThe core of the plan is a penalty of $380 per tonne of CO2 that ships will have to pay if they exceed a maximum level of emissions intensity, which will get stricter every few years on a set schedule. Ships that stay under this intensity standard will still have to pay a fine of $100 per tonne of CO2 for emissions in excess of a second \"direct compliance\" level. Ships that emit even less than the \"direct compliance\" standard get carbon credits for outperforming the requirements, which can banked or sold to underperforming ships.\nThe fee structure means that only emissions above a certain limit are subject to a penalty; emissions under the limit will be untaxed. And all ships under 5,000 GT - coastal vessels and workboats - are exempt.\nThe framework also leaves room for operators to use any alternative fuels that meet emissions criteria, including first-generation biofuels made from food crops like palm and soybean oil. These are the cheapest \"green\" fuels available, but they come with a significant environmental cost, as large-scale increases in production require more land-clearing.\n\"The IMO deal creates a momentum for alternative marine fuels, but unfortunately it is the forest-destroying first generation biofuels that will get the biggest push for the next decade,\" said Faig Abbasov, shipping program director for Transport & Environment (T&E).\nClimate advocates and industry groups agreed that the fee structure falls short of what would be needed to compel an industry-wide transition to high-cost green methanol and green ammonia in the near term. However, based on ananalysis by T&E, the IMO's schedule will result in a substantial reduction in emissions from about 2030 onward - a profound cut compared to the increases expected under a no-regulation, business-as-usual scenario. The schedule suggests that the industry will not reach net zero until some years after 2050.\nCourtesy T&E\n\"This adoption is a first step in the right direction, with now a part – although small – of shipping emissions being subject to what is effectively a global levy. However, with an expected fall in emissions of around 10% by 2030 compared to 2008, the level of ambition is largely insufficient to meet the IMO target of emission reduction, let alone to meet a 1.5 C trajectory,\" said Dr. Marie Fricaudet, a senior research fellow at UCL Energy Institute.\nAdvocates of a stricter emissions regime blamed longtime opponents of climate action for the outcome; the Trump administration, which registered itsoppositionto any carbon fees earlier this week, also attracted criticism. \"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5°C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Minister Ralph Regenvanu of Vanuatu, a proponent of ambitious climate measures at IMO.\nIndustry groups praised the MEPC outcome as a step in the right direction, if not a full resolution.\n\"We recognize that this may not be the agreement which all sections of the industry would have preferred, and we are concerned that this may not yet go far enough in providing the necessary certainty. But it is a framework which we can build upon,\" the International Chamber of Shipping's Guy Platten said in a statement.\n“This is a major milestone for climate policy and a turning point for shipping. Our industry has long been labelled as ‘hard to abate,’ but record industry investment and a new global measure can turn the tide on that,” said Joe Kramek, WSC President & CEO.\nUCL cautioned that without a high-revenue IMO levy powering multibillion-dollar investments in green fuel, national-level capital flows will now determine who wins from shipping's green transition - much as China has done with its investments in solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, EVs and shipbuilding. \"A significant risk now exists that the future of shipping will, like renewable energy and battery electric vehicles, be significantly owned and driven by nations with strong industrial policy,\" warned UCL."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nOn April 11, Lebanese Judge Tarek Bitar resumed his investigation into the 2020 explosion in Beirut Port with the subpoenaed testimony of two former senior state officials implicated in the affair, Maj Gen Abbas Ibrahim (ex-Director General of General Security) and Maj Gen Tony Saliba (ex-Director General State Security).\nThe explosion in the port’s quayside Warehouse 12 on August 4, 2020 killed 218, injured thousands and devastated a wide area of central Beirut. The blast was heard in Syria and 125 miles away in Cyprus.\nJudge Tarik was appointed to his role in 2021. His predecessor had named a number of ministers and senior officials as suspects in the inquiry, who then had managed to remove him. The same indicted ministers and senior officials, working with a President and Prime Minister and others aligned with the Hezbollah, Amal and Free Patriotic Movement, used court cases and noncooperation to shut down Judge Tariq’s enquiry. But with a new President and Prime Minister, both dedicated to supporting the independence of state institutions, the Judge has resumed his work - notwithstanding numerous death threats and warnings of ‘chaos’ from Hezbollah-aligned senior Shi’a cleric Mufti Ahmad Kabalan. The new Prime Minister, Nawaf Salam, was (until his recent appointment) President of the International Court of Justice in The Hague.\nIn Lebanon’s highly divided and contested political landscape, the course of such inquiries never runs smooth. It took 11 years for the international tribunal investigating the assassination of Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2005 to issue its verdict – ineffectively, and from the safety of The Hague.\nMultiple conspiracy theories and suggestions of Israeli involvement were circulated in the aftermath of the explosion, most designed to put investigators off the scent and to protect the guilty. The cause of the explosion is clear. 2,750 tons of explosives-grade ammonium nitrate were offloaded from the impounded MVRhosus, which had been declared unseaworthy and detained while enroute from Georgia to Mozambique.\nThehigh densityammonium nitrate was stored in Warehouse 12, the location where customs-confiscated goods were normally impounded. On its own, ammonium nitrate is relatively inert, and even the blasting grade found in the warehouse becomes an explosive only when it is mixed with fuel oil or other more volatile explosives. Nonetheless, ammonium nitrate on its own is a potentially volatile substance, and has causedcountlessdeadly explosions over the last century. It is normally subject to dangerous goods safeguards.\nOn August 4, 2020, the ambient temperature - reinforced by storage in an unventilated warehouse - would have been at or near the annual peak for Beirut. The ammonium nitrate was being stored alongside a consignment of customs-confiscated fireworks. Apparently, a repair team was conducting welding repairs to the doors of Warehouse 12. A fire crew – Platoon 5 from the Beirut Fire Brigade – was called out to deal with a fire in the warehouse created by the welding activity, and before all perished in the subsequent two explosions, they reported they were dealing with a fire in the confiscated fireworks. There was an initial explosion in the fireworks at 1807 hours, before the catastrophic explosion occurred some 30 seconds later. The conditions and the sequence of events, plus the reporting of those at the scene before they subsequently were killed, make it absolutely clear that the initial firework fire provided sufficient shock, heat and detonating effect to ignite the ammonium nitrate - which because of the storage conditions was already unstable.\nWARNING THIS IS SHOCKING: Here is a live shot of the explosion today in Beirut via@jenanmoussashowing the moment the blast happens.pic.twitter.com/5KvOc1I2sE\nBeirut ???????? Roofs on nearby buildings flew away due to the blast . Reports suggesting it’s non nuclear .https://t.co/6tJRymjTei\nSpeculation that the explosion was the secondary effect of an Israeli attack on a nearby Hezbollah arms store was an attractive hypothesis to many. Video footage from multiple cameras showed no missile tracks, only seagulls flying above the seat of the explosion. The pattern of attacks in both Lebanon and Syria in preceding years suggested that any Israeli attack would need to be accompanied by an imminent and direct threat to Israeli safety and security, which was never evident in this instance.\nWhilst it became clear early on that the explosion had not been initiated by an external attack, many questions remain unanswered.\nFBI analysissuggested that only 552 tons exploded on 4 August, less than a fifth of 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate originally consigned to the warehouse. ‘Shrinkage’ in dockside warehouses worldwide is common, but who might have benefitted from this 2000 ton seepage in stocks, beyond any customs officers paid to turn a blind eye? Agricultural fertilizer merchants would have been interested in using the material. But also at this time, the Syrian government was in the throes of civil war, and its capacity domestically to produce ammonium nitrate for use in the manufacture of explosives for barrel bombsfellfrom nearly 90,000 tons in 2004 to 16,000 tons in 2013, when demand was increasing. A cheap supply from Warehouse 12 may have been a more attractive alternative to circumventing sanctions and ramping up domestic production.\nThe value of the slowly degrading ammonium nitrate in Warehouse 12 may have been the reason why it stayed put, despite some Port officials demanding that the material should be moved for safety reasons. Customs officials sent six chaser letters to the courts which had ordered the seizure of the ammonium nitrate. None of these follow-ups resulted in any action. This suggested a conspiracy between those pilfering the ammonium nitrate, and officials using their positions to facilitate this, whether for political purpose or for financial gain.\nJudge Tarik’s list of suspects is focused on officials who may have facilitated pilfering, rather than on the black market pilferers themselves. The dangers posed by the increasingly unstable ammonium nitrate appear to have been correctly identified by the responsible Port safety officials; neither their competence, nor that of the brave firemen from Platoon 5 from the Beirut Fire Brigade, is being pursued as a line of investigation.\nThe course of Judge Tarik’s inquiry still has some way to run. The fall of the Assad regime may help by freeing up some information sources in Syria. But whilst Hezbollah’s influence within the machinery of the state in Lebanon is much reduced, the militant group still has some bite in its capacity to disrupt proceedings.\nWafiq Safa(left,Mehr / CC BY 4.0), Hezbollah’s Head of Security and a prominent organizer of anti-Judge Tariq protests in 2020-21, remains an influential figure within the Port of Beirut. Thus in the rebuilding of the authority of the Lebanese state, it is morale-inspiring that the inquiry has not been offshored to the safety of the Hague. Convictions flowing from the inquiry will do much to create confidence in the government - and to give the relatives of the 218 killed some closure. Best of all, Judge Tarik remains in his post and pursuing the case."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nWith the European wind sector facing competitiveness and security challenges, wind developers in the region have issued European governments a new call to action to protect the lifeline of the industry.\nWith EU targeting wind to contribute 35% of its electricity by 2035, countries across the region are making strides in expanding renewable energy capacity, especially in the offshore wind sector. But developers are concerned that the build-out has slowed in the past few years with the offshore sector facing increased risk and uncertainty. Some of the factors contributing to this include cost inflation, declining commercial viability and lower investor confidence.\nTo reverse the downward trend, developers at this year’s WindEurope summit want EU governments to auction at least 100GW worth of Contracts for Difference (CfDs) over ten years. Through the auction, the governments should guarantee fixed price and indexed contracts to create bankable projects.\nIn addition, wind farm developers want governments to plan the commissioning deadlines of the 100GW evenly, with 10GW annually from 2031-2040. This will help create market predictability, while ensuring there is sufficient time for investments. These measures - backed by power purchase agreements - will help the European offshore wind industry achieve 15GW installations annually by the 2030s.\n“Wind energy is already driving industrial growth and energy independence across Europe, we just need to scale up. This calls for increasing viable demand for wind energy, and strengthening wind’s market environment,” said Henrik Andersen, WindEurope Chairman.\nOne of the notable challenges identified for competitiveness is the high electricity price in some European countries. In its report released this week, WindEurope said that the high electricity prices are driven by taxes and levies, slowing renewables-based electrification and undermining use in the industrial sector.\n“Electricity is overburdened with taxes and charges compared with gas. In Spain for instance, electricity charges for households are 19 times higher than gas charges,” reveals the report."

        "content": "\nInternal budget documents leaked to the media Friday suggest that the Trump White House wants to cut funding for NOAA's National Ocean Service in half, move the National Marine Fisheries Service to the Department of the Interior, end the Sea Grant program for oceanographic research and education, and \"eliminate all funding for climate, weather, and ocean laboratories and cooperative institutes\" - effectively ending NOAA's weather and ocean research program.\nCurrent and former NOAA staffers gave copies of the OMB budget for NOAA to Science, Politico and the New York Times this week. Among other items, the programs to be eliminated would include:\n- The Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), NOAA's core research division- The National Oceanographic Partnership Program and Sea Grant program- The National Marine Fisheries Service, to be folded into Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Agency- The National Ocean Service's Integrated Ocean Observing System Regional Observations, Competitive Research and Coastal Zone Management Grants- The National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science\nOverall, the OMB's plan would cut NOAA's top line by $1.7 billion. OAR would be the hardest hit division. Its budget would be cut by $315 million, and the remaining $170 million would be repurposed for other programs. “At this funding level, O.A.R. is eliminated as a line office,” the OMB proposal suggests.\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) FY2026 budget is formally a suggestion to Congress; in theory, any final numbers would have to pass the House and Senate.\n“I think it’s step one in the deconstruction of the agency,” former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told Politico after reading the plan. “Any one of these are by themselves destructive enough. But taken together they foretell a much more calamitous outcome.”\nSome of the biggest cuts were long foreseen: The dismantling of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research echoes the Heritage Foundation's well-knownProject 2025report, which described OAR as \"one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,\" proposed consolidating the office, and recommended \"breaking up\" NOAA altogether. OMB's top-line budget cut is also similar in scope to an earlierplanpublished in 2023 by the Center for Renewing America, founded by Project 2025 coauthor and current OMB director Russell Vought.\nThe OMB plan also includes specific cuts to NOAA's next-generation weather satellites, due to launch in the 2030s. OMB proposes eliminating individual sensors that (if installed) would track ocean color, atmospheric temperature, pollution levels and moisture content. Some of these factors are useful for storm prediction, but the data could also be repurposed to produce climate science. At the same time, parallel cuts that OMB proposes at NASA (reported Friday byArs Technica) could eliminate a large swath of existing earth science satellite sensing capabilities as well.\nThe OMB's reported cuts also align with recent administration orders thatcanceledoffice leases for certain NOAA departments, heavily focused on the National Marine Fisheries Service. The lease cancelations affect local NMFS port offices in Alaska, California, Florida, Guam, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Louisiana, Oregon, Washington and elsewhere, and many take effect in FY2025.\nInside NOAA, staffers told Axios that some operations have already been slowed by a requirement to have every contract approved by Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick. NOAA is one part of his portfolio, but the secretary is also a key architect of President Trump's global tariff policy, and the Wall Street Journal reports that Lutnick has beenoccupiedat the White House for much of his tenure to date. Dozens of NOAA contracts were awaiting his approval as of April 1, according toAxios."

        "content": "\nThe re-ordering of global trade, escalated by the astronomical tariffs between the U.S and China, has left some countries with significant export advantages. Brazil is already showing signs as an early winner, with its port sector reporting increased demand. A strong preference for the Brazilian soybean has started to appear in China, historically a large-scale buyer of American soy.\nAccording to Reuters, China is expected to receive about 3 million tons of U.S soybeans in April-May, which its state stockpiler Sinograin purchased earlier this year. However, due to China’s new 125 percent tariffs on American goods, the shipment is likely to attract higher duties and possibly sell at a discount due to cheap competition from beans from Brazil.\n“The pressure of the soy crushing margins on Chinese industries will likely change the country’s import dynamics. As these margins come under negative pressure, China tends to slow down the pace of imports and rely on domestic stockpiles- as seen in the previous trade war in 2018,” said the Brazilian National Association of Cereal Exporters (Anec) in its monthly report this week.\nAnec predicts a potential export boom for the Brazilian soy this year of up to 110 million tons, representing a historic record for Brazil. In the first quarter of 2025, Brazil has already recorded shipments of about 27 million tons, a four percent increase compared to last year. Currently, China accounts for 77 percent of Brazilian soy exports.\nThe uptick in export volumes is also visible in the port sector data, with Brazilian ports moving 12.4 million tons of containers in February- the highest volume ever recorded, according to the National Agency for Waterway Transportation (Antaq). This figure represents a 9.26 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024. Of the total, around 70 percent (8.6 million tons) was from long-haul shipping, while the remaining 30 percent (3.7 million tons) was from coastal shipping (cabotage). Some of the major commodities behind the increase include corn, bauxite and fertilizers. Other shipments which rose by a significant measure include poultry products. Brazil’s exports of fresh and processed poultry reached 476,000 tons in March, up 19 percent from a year earlier, according to the Brazilian Animal Protein Association (ABPA).\nIn anticipating higher export volumes, some ports are already investing in additional capacity as well as diversifying operations. Porto do Acu, located in the state of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil’s top oil export port, has said that the tariff-induced distortions in global trade has given the port an incentive to expand facilities for agricultural and mineral commodities.\n“When threats started, demand started to rise. We are in a really good position here,” João Braz, the port’s logistics director told Bloomberg.\nBrazil’s agricultural shipments are also a factor in China’s interests in the Panama Canal. Chinese economist Li Xunlei hascalledfor improving government ties in the Central American country in order to ensure strategic access to the waterway for China’s food shipments; 90 percent of the Brazil-to-China soy trade passes through the canal, he said in a recent paper.\nTop image: Port of Santos (Agencia CNT / CC BY 2.0)"

        "content": "Reported to be the most successful brand in the Carnival Corporation portfolio, Carnival Cruise Line has an aggressive five-year plan for growth. The line has a strong orderbook and will also be looking to grow its private ports while continuing its focus on U.S. cruising with the widest assortment of homeports.\n“Since our inception in 1972, we have defined and led the modern cruise industry and our plans for the next five years and beyond are no different,” said line’s President Christine Duffy. “Having just integrated two ships into the Carnival fleet in Australia, we now stand at 29 ships, the largest global fleet in our history.”\nThe line has two additional LNG-fueled cruise ships on order from Meyer Werft and it revealed they will continue the naming pattern of the class which has celebrated the history of the now 53-year-old line. The next ships will be Carnival Festivale debuting in the spring of 2027 sailing week-long cruises from Port Canaveral, Florida. In 2028, it will introduce Carnival Tropicale. The line is planning new innovations including an expanded outdoor area and water park that will for the first time also host evening deck parties on some nights with music and activities for families. Carnival reports it carries more than one million children per year and it is expanding its accommodations for families on the new ships.\n\n\nExpanded water park will open some evenings for family deck parties (CCL)\n\nCarnival reports that half of the U.S. population lives within 5-hour driving distance to one of its homeports and it will expand its short cruise programs. Already half of its cruises are in the short duration category and in 2027, theMardi Graswill begin short cruises from Port Canaveral, the first time the line has used one of its largest ships on short cruises.As part of its strategy, Carnival says it will also return to year-round operations in Mobile, Alabama beginning in spring 2027. In addition, Carnival is exploring moving a larger Conquest class ship to Baltimore in 2027 that can accommodate about 1,000 more guests thanCarnival Pride, the Spirit class ship currently deployed from Baltimore.\nLike all the large cruise lines, Carnival is also increasing its focus on private destinations. In July 2025 it opens Celebration Key on Grand Bahama Island, which will have a capability in its first phase to handle 13,000 passengers a day. The line plans further expansion in Phase 2 while noting that 20 Carnival ships from 10 U.S. homeports on more than 1,400 sailings are already scheduled to visit Celebration Key in 2027.\n\n\nCelebration Key is being developed on Grand Bahama Island as a private destination for the cruise line's passengers (CCL)\n\nIt is also launching an expanded and renamed operation in the Bahamas, RelaxAway, Half Moon Cay, which it shares with Holland America Line. The new features including a dock for two of its largest cruise ship will open at the private island in 2026. At the same time, Mahogany Bay, Carnival’s destination in Roatan, Honduras, will be renamed Isla Tropicale and will be expanded to include a pool with a swim up bar and cabanas.\nThis expansion follows the growth of Carnival Cruise Line in Australia taking over two 109,000 gross ton ships and merged in the P&O Australia cruise operation. In the past few years, it also took over three ships from sister brand Costa Cruises giving Carnival Cruise Line a total 34 percent increase in capacity.\nLonger term, the brand also highlights it order with Fincantieri for three LNG-powered cruise ships which will be approximately 230,000 gross tons, the largest ships ever built by Fincantieri and an Italian shipyard. Called Project Ace, they will be delivered in 2029, 2031, and 2033 and have over 3,000 guest cabins, and a capacity of almost 8,000 passengers.\nWith strong advance booking and a strong increase in onboard revenue, Carnival Cruise Line points to strong momentum from the brand achieved over the past few years. The growth strategy looks to leverage the brands strengths for the future."

        "content": "Italy’s Guardia di Finanza and the Ministry of the Interior reported a major cocaine seizure in what they termed “an important anti-drug operation.” The seizure happened in March but was just announced after reports in the Italian media last week.\nThe containershipMersin Express(37,000 dwt) was the latest target of a South American-based cartel with the Italian authorities reporting a focused effort involving multiple agencies to interrupt the smuggling. The official announcement did not report the date but the media indicates the seizure took place in early March in the port of Livorno.\nThe vessel was carrying a shipment of cocoa power which was concealing two tons of cocaine in approximately 1,800 blocks. The street value was estimated at over €500 million (more than $560 million).\nThe voyage originated in Guayaquil, Ecuador where they believe the cocaine was loaded onto the ship for retrieval once it reached Europe. However, the vessel also made intermediary stops in Colon, Panama, and again in Cartagena, Colombia. The vessel then made stops in Vigo, Malaga, and Valencia in Spain and Genoa, Italy where the drugs went undetected. It was finally intercepted in Livorno.\nAuthorities point out that the shipment while common was not in refrigerated cargo where they typically find large quantities of cocaine and other drugs concealed coming from South America. Italian media, InfoLibes, highlights that 1,400 tons of bananas and pineapples were offloaded from the same vessel on March 12 in Vigo.\nThe vessel is registered in Malta but owned and operated by a Turkish-based company. Built in 2017 it has a capacity of 2,586 TEU.\nThe same shipping company, which maintains regular service between South America and Europe, has beentargeted by other smuggling operations. The company’s vesselIzmit Express(37,000 dwt with a capacity of 2,586 TEU) reported locating “suspicious packages” in a hard-to-reach area of its cargo holds when it reached Spain in November 2024. Spanish authorities retrieved 23 kilos of cocaine and continued to inspect 100 containers carrying bananas. With the proper tools, the authorities cut into the containers and found 432 packages of cocaine with a total weight is over 500 kilos.\nRefrigerated containers have regularly been targeted by smugglers. Ports ranging from Spain and Italy to Rotterdam and Belgium have all reported large drug seizures found concealed with fruit shipments from South America."

        "content": "\nThe first test steps were undertaken at the Port of Rotterdam to test the port’s capabilities for future ammonia bunkering operations. Rotterdam is the world’s second-largest bunker port and expects that ammonia-fueled vessels requiring bunkering will begin in 2026 or 2027. It looks to build on its existing efforts for LNG bunkering and now methanol to prepare for the future alternative fuel.\nThe port highlights that the safety protocol levels were raised to prepare for the test. The port has already implemented assessment tools so that it is fully ready for LNG and now methanol. Port officials said the raised levels and testing of the process will ensure it is prepared for bunkering of the first ammonia-fueled vessels.\nThe pilot on April 12 involved transferring 800 cubic meters of liquid, cold ammonia at -33 degrees Celsius between two ships. It took about 2.5 hours and was conducted alongside a new quay at the Maasvlakte 2 APM terminal. For this test grey ammonia was used but the port anticipates that clean (low carbon) ammonia will be used when the bunkering operations begin. They noted that the gray ammonia shares the same chemical properties as the future clean product helping to test the protocols.\n\n\n\nVarious parties collaborated on the pilot, facilitated by the Port of Rotterdam Authority. OCI, owner and operator of the port’s ammonia terminal, partnered with Trammo, which supplied the two tankers carrying OCI’s ammonia. James Fisher Fendercare provided equipment and expertise to ensure the safe execution of the ship-to-ship transfer at the berth location provided by APM Terminal. Bunker barge operator Victrol shared its bunkering expertise during the preparation of the pilot. The DCMR Environmental Protection Agency, Rijnmond Safety Region (VRR), and the Joint Fire Service (GB) were involved to ensure the pilot was conducted safely and smoothly.\nRotterdam’s test followed a similar testing process that was carried out last year in Singapore. Fortescue’s converted offshore support vessel received thefirst bunkeringas the Maritime and Port Authority tested its protocols and certified the vessel. In Japan, they are using tanker trucks to fuel the world’s first tugboat using ammonia. Demonstrations of the tug have been undergoing in Tokyo Bay with it supporting ship traffic after having operated for a decade as an LNG-fueled tug.\nDNV calculates that there are currently 33 vessels on order due for delivery in the next four years that will be capable of sailing using ammonia as a fuel. CMB.TECH and Fortescue announced a deal today, April 14, for the Australian mining company to use one of the Belgian company’s first ammonia-fueled Newcastlemax bulkers due for delivery in 2026. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines has also announced that it will co-own and operate three of the 210,000 dwt ammonia-fueled bulkers.\nDeveloping the infrastructure for bunkering is a critical step. Last year, Fortescue complained that it could not demonstrate its vessel on ammonia due to a lack of infrastructure and enable regulations. The companies look at their current efforts as pioneering and contributing to the development of the infrastructure needed to encourage the industry to accelerate the conversion to ammonia as one of the alternative fuels."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "Cyanergy",
        "content": "\nShipowners, governments, and labor unions agreed to a sweeping series of changes to the master agreement known as the Maritime Labour Convention, a global agreement that establishes minimum standards for the working and living conditions of seafarers. The updates, which are being called groundbreaking for the industry, come as the modern MLC prepares to mark its 20th anniversary after the consolidation of 37 conventions into the MLC in 2006.\nMany of the issues that were presented during the meeting in Geneva last week emerged during the pandemic when seafarers were trapped at sea. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) took the lead in representing seafarers during the negotiations after being at the forefront as an advocate during the pandemic to get seafarers designated as key workers and create greater freedom for shore leave, crew changes, and travel.\nUnder the auspices of the International Labour Organization, the Special Tripartite Committee on the MLC meets every three years to review the master contract. The ILO’s maritime tripartite regulatory structure brings together national governments, alongside a global shipowners group co-ordinated by ICS and a global seafarers group co-ordinated by ITF. It is highlighted that the ILO is the only tripartite UN agency through which national governments alongside sectoral social partners (employer and worker representatives) establish labor standards and policies, through open debates and negotiations.\n“We have been able to deliver some significant improvements to seafarers’ rights in collaboration with our government and social partners,” said Tim Springett, Chair of the ICS Labour Affairs Committee and Spokesperson for the Shipowners’ Group at the ILO meeting. “The accomplishments of STC prove that – whatever the issue facing our industry – when we come together, we can work it out.”\nAmong the amendments agreed to improve the working and living conditions of seafarers on board ships were provisions for seafarers to be designated as key workers. They also agreed to strengthen requirements to support seafarer repatriation, new mandatory measures to ensure that seafarers have access to shore leave without needing a visa or special permit, and enhanced protections against bullying and harassment.\nTHE ICS says recognizing that seafarers are among the most isolated people on earth when it comes to medical care, the ILO also approved new MLC provisions recommending carriage of the ICS International Medical Guide for Seafarers and Fishers on board ships. The first edition of the International Medical Guide for Seafarers and Fishers was published in March 2023 and is specifically designed for use by those responsible for medical care on board ships, rather than shore-based professionals. The guide was developed through a collaborative effort led by the ICS, with the support of the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) and the International Maritime Health Association (IMHA).\nThe meeting also agreed to a package of complementary resolutions, one of which established a framework for a future joint meeting between the ILO tripartite partners and Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to review and potentially align overlapping seafarer hours of work and rest provisions, within the remit of conventions overseen by both organizations.\nThe new measures adopted by the ILO are expected to be rubberstamped in Geneva, during the 113th Session of ILO’s International Labour Conference in June. They are then expected to enter into effect two years later in December 2027.\nThe text of MLC amendments as adopted can beaccessed online. The next STC meeting is set to take place in April 2028."

        "content": "\nOn Friday, the Estonian Navy boarded and detained a sanctioned tanker in the Baltic for allegedly flying a false flag. The vessel was flying the flag of Djibouti, but the Djiboutian register of shipping said that the tanker - the 18-year-oldKiwala- had already been deregistered. International databases suggest thatKiwala'sDjiboutian flag service was canceled on January 1, 2025.\n\"During a routine inspection, there was reason to suspect the ship lacked a flag state and valid insurance. The vessel is also subject to sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland,\" said Cmdr. Ivo Vark, the head of the Estonian Navy.\nEstonian inspectors found 40 deficiencies aboard the aging vessel, and have detained it until repairs and improvements are made. The majority of the issues are related to documentation, including its flag. It is an example of NATO member states' newly-strengthened efforts to police tanker traffic in the Baltic, outside of the 12-mile limit of territorial seas: the interdiction was initiated in international waters and the crew was asked to divert into Estonian jurisdiction.\nKiwala(IMO 9332810, ex namePacific Apollo / Virgo Sun / P. Fos / Odysseus / Varuna) is a 115,000 dwt crude tanker built in 2007. Like many \"shadow fleet vessels,\" she has flag-hopped extensively: previous flags in the last three years include St. Kitts, Mongolia and Gabon. She is currently managed by a Chinese company, crewed by Chinese officers, and owned by an anonymous firm in Mauritius. Her ultimate beneficial owner is not known, but she was once part of the well-knownGatik Ship Management fleet.\nKiwala and gray-market vessels like her may face a new source of competition. Western tanker owners and insurers can now legitimately do business in the Russian oil market, thanks to the falling cost of crude. Due to steep U.S. tariffs on trading partners and investor concerns about the state of the global economy, oil prices have slid, and the Russian Urals grade has begun fetching less than $60 per barrel - the price cap set by the G7 in 2022 for Western shipping services."

        "author": "Cyanergy",
        "content": "The IMO'snew greenhouse gas feeis not quite a full-scale carbon levy, since it is only charged on some emissions, and not quite a green-fuel mandate, as it allows a long economic runway for biofuels. It is a compromise measure, and passed with less consensus than usually found at IMO: 63 nations voted for it, with 16 opposed and 24 abstaining. The U.S. delegation walked out midway through the talks, and threatened retaliation against any levy that would raise costs for American shipping.\nIMO secretary general Arsenio Dominguez noted that for all its compromises, the draft agreement is still a remarkable breakthrough. As the world's first industry-wide tax on carbon, it will significantly reduce shipping's emissions in the long run - assuming that the administrative details are worked out and that enough nations sign the final draft at the next MEPC meeting.\n\"The approval of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI mandating the IMO net-zero framework represents another significant step in our collective efforts to combat climate change, to modernize shipping and demonstrates that IMO delivers on its commitments,\" said Dominguez in a statement.\nMany participants - opponents, proponents, and brokers who helped craft the agreement, including Dominguez - expect that it will be revisited and strengthened in the future.\n\"We are not done. We will be back,\" said Ambassador Albon Ishoda of the Marshall Islands, an advocate of a much stricter levy. \"Still standing. Still steering.\"\n\"The work is not over, with much detail on emissions calculation methods and how near-zero emissions fuels will be rewarded needed before and after formal adoption of these measures in October to ensure a level playing field for green fuels,\" noted Green Hydrogen Organization CEO Jonas Moberg.\nMany climate activists were appalled by the comparatively lowfee structureand the five-year time gap before emissions will begin to decline. John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s leader at IMO, called the deal \"a total shipwreck.\" Transport & Environment's Faig Abbasov suggested that it is now time for nation-states and regional blocs to bypass IMO and begin implementing their own carbon rules, as the EU has done.\nThe Pacific island states - along with allies in the Caribbean, Africa, the Seychelles, Great Britain and Central America - had proposed a universal levy on all GHG emissions from shipping, the solution proposed by most climate researchers and analysts (including Maersk and bunker trader Trafigura). In a joint statement, island state negotiators said that MEPC's deal was \"too little, too late to cut shipping emissions.\" They expressed their disappointment by abstaining from the vote.\n\"We came as climate vulnerable countries — with the greatest need and the clearest solution. And what did we face? Weak alternatives from the world’s biggest economies — alternatives that won’t get us on a pathway to the 1.5 degrees C temperature limit,\" said Simon Kofe, Minister for Transport of the Solomon Islands. \"They asked us to settle for less, while we are the ones losing the most. We will not negotiate away our future.\"\n“Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5°C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn. These countries – and others – failed to support a set of measures that would have gotten the shipping industry onto a 1.5 degree C pathway. And they turned away a proposal for a reliable source of revenue for those of us in dire need of finance to help with climate impacts,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, Minister of Energy and Climate Change Adaptation for Vanuatu.\nIf anyone stands to do well from the agreement, shipbuilders can expect to benefit. Han Seung-han, a research analyst at SK Securities, told South Korean media that East Asian yards will probably see a boost in clean-ship orders sooner rather than later because of the timeline for construction. \"Currently, the order backlog at shipyards worldwide is around 3 years and 8 months. Even if orders for new builds are placed immediately, the earliest delivery will be in at least 3 years,\" he said.\nThough it went nearly unnoticed in the fierce debate about carbon, MEPC 83 also passed an agreement to create the world's largest emissions control area (ECA). The new Northeast Atlantic zone will extend from Portugal to the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel, North Sea and the GIUK Gap - bigger than any other ECA yet designated. Once implemented, it will cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 82 percent and particulate matter emissions by 64 percent, improving health-related air quality in Northern Europe.\nTop image: Cyprien Hauser / CC BY ND 2.0"

Fortescue will deploy one of the fleet of 210,000 dwt ammonia-fueled bulkers currently being built by CMB.TECH.\nBocimar, the bulker operator under the CMB.TECH umbrella reported in 2023 that it was working with WinGD toco-develop large ammonia-fuelled engines. The companies said they were aiming to install the ammonia dual-fuel X72DF engine on a series of 10 bulk carriers to be built at a Chinese shipyard in 2025 and 2026. By the end of 2023, they had progressed in announcing an agreement with CSSC Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding (QBS) to build the vessels and engine builder CSSC Engine Co (CSE) to construct China’s first ammonia dual-fuel engines.\nThe project was based on WinGD’s X92B engine, which they said would be an ideal starting point for developing large-bore ammonia-fueled engines. The design was for a 72-bore ammonia engine operating using high-pressure fuel injection with a small portion of pilot fuel.\n“Our landmark agreement with Bocimar sends a clear signal to the market – now is the time for shipowners to invest in green ammonia-powered ships. The days of ships operating on dirty bunker fuel, which is responsible for three percent of global carbon emissions, are numbered,” said Dino Otranto, CEO of Fortescue Metals. “We will continue to work with like-minded companies like Bocimar to transition our fleet to low and zero-emissions vessels and help accelerate the widespread adoption of green ammonia as a marine fuel.”\nThe vessel is expected to be delivered by the end of 2026. Will be a dual-fuel Newcastle bulker. It will be employed to transport iron ore from the Pilbara region of Australia to customers in China and around the world.\nAlander Saverys who is a strong advocate for decarbonization and at the forefront for ammonia and hydrogen-fueled vessels called the deal the “beginning of an exciting journey to build more ammonia-powered ships.” He believes that it will “stimulate more green ammonia production projects.”\nFortescue launched the first ammonia dual-fuel vessel last year with a converted offshore support vessel which also conducted the first ammonia bunkering operation in Singapore. The vessel went through extensive testing as part of a certification progress in Singapore. The vessel sailed to London in early March to call attention to ammonia ahead of the recent IMO meetings and according to the company will soon embark on a tour of global ports.\nThe agreement with Fortescue follows a deal between CMB.TECH and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines announced in March that the Japanese shipping company wouldjointly ownthree of the 210,000 dwt bulk carriers. It will take the three vessels on a long-term charter for operations and also plans to build six chemical tankers. Two of the vessels will be ammonia-fitted on delivery and the other four will be built ammonia-ready with delivery between 2028 and 2029."

        "content": "\nThe NTSB has determined that the tankerHafnia Amessistruck a pier on the Cooper River last year because the pilot let the vessel get too close to the riverbank. The combination of bank effect and current overwhelmed the force of the tanker's rudder and propulsion, sending it into the end of the pier - much like the tanker Bow Triumph, which hit the same pier under similar circumstances in 2022.\n\"Bank effect can have an undesired effect on vessels, even for the most experienced ship handlers. Pilots, masters, and other vessel operators should consider the risks in areas known for shoaling when planning transits,\" cautioned NTSB. \"Where appropriate, employ additional measures to mitigate the risk, including use of tugboats, reducing or increasing speed, and/or delaying the transit until more favorable conditions exist.\"\nOn the morning of January 14, 2024,Hafnia Amessifinished offloading at a terminal on the Cooper River in Wando, South Carolina. The vessel prepared to get under way on a ballast voyage to Texas City, Texas. A local marine pilot with 25 years' experience and 5,000 transits - including more than 20 on this stretch of river - boarded to guide the outbound transit. Because the pilot was aware of the Bow Triumph's allision with Naval Weapons Station Pier B two years before, he instructed the escort tug to take a position on the starboard side and accompanyHafnia Amessidown the river as a precaution. \"This order was a direct result of what I had learned from the Bow Triumph incident in 2022,\" he told NTSB.\nHafnia Amessigot under way. At 1000, nearing a river bend at buoy 80, the pilot noted an extreme flood current rushing past the buoy - strong enough to reduce the tanker's speed to just five knots.\nThe pilot lined up to take the next bend, a hard 90-degree turn to port that would take the tanker past Pier B. The pilot aimed for the east side of the channel, expecting that the strong current would setHafnia Amessifurther out towards the center. That did not occur, and the tanker ended up passing tight against the eastern bank, a maneuver that the pilot had not intended. The eastern bank had a ledge that tended to shoal rapidly with silt, and it had to be dredged every few years.\nAt 1016:27, the pilot ordered hard to port, but the rudder order had no effect on the rate of turn. At 1017:23, the ship's echo sounder read zero feet, indicating shallow water. Pier B was dead ahead, and the pilot ordered full ahead to push more water over the rudder. He also directed the escort tug to push on the starboard bow with \"all she's got.\"\nCourtesy NTSB\nThe last-minute maneuvers were not enough to avert an allision, andHafnia Amessihit the end of the pier at six knots. The impact dented in the tanker's hull plating up to three inches and buckled three transverse bulkheads inward by about 1-2 inches, causing about $30,000 in damage. The end of the pier sustained about $8 million in damage to dolphins, pilings and concrete, in addition to the previous damage caused by Bow Triumph. (There was no disruption to cargo operations at the pier, as it was already out of service because of the earlier accident.)\nAccording to NTSB, bank effect from a known shoal on the eastern channel edge likely pulledHafnia Amessi'sstern to port. Meanwhile, the strong flood current pushed her bow to starboard. The effects were strong enough to neutralize the force ofHafnia Amessi'srudder, even hard over to port with engine full ahead.\nNTSB noted thatBow Triumph'sallision with the same pier happened under very similar circumstances: theTriumphpassed too close to the east side of the channel, suffered bank suction, lost effective control of her heading and destroyed a 300-foot section of the pier.\nThe shoal was a known hazard, and the Coast Guard had previously scheduled the installation of a buoy to mark the danger zone at the bend. The buoy was installed on the planned date, three days afterHafnia Amessihit the pier. \"If this Buoy 72A had been there [during the transit] . . . that would have given me the tools to come more to the right and the information that I needed to avoid that spot,\" the pilot told NTSB after the casualty.\nAfter two allisions in two years, the Coast Guard Captain of the Port issued a standing order requiring all vessels over 10,000 GT or drawing more than 25 feet to use a tethered, two-tug escort when transiting through this challenging section of the river.\n\n"

        "content": "\nShares in Canadian mining firm The Metals Company (TMC) soared Monday on news that President Donald Trump will likely order the creation of a federal \"stockpile\" of rare-earth minerals retrieved from the seabed. TMC - together with Swiss maritime engineering goliath Allseas - is the only company in the West with a purpose-built ship and a fully-tested deep sea mining capability.\nThe U.S. interest in seabed-sourced rare earths is strategic, and has recently become urgent. China supplies nearly 70 percent of the world's rare earth ores, and it dominates processing capacity for most of the rest. On April 4, in response to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese-made goods, Beijing restricted all exports of seven \"heavy\" rare earth elements and the products that contain them - not just to the U.S., but to any third country. These substances are used in high-strength magnets, high-temperature metal alloys, and other components that are critical for electronics, EVs, defense manufacturing and aerospace applications. When current stockpiles run out, U.S. manufacturers that need heavy rare earths will have few alternatives without a reliable Chinese supply.\nAccording to the Financial Times, the White House plans to issue an order to create a government-owned \"strategic reserve\" for critical rare earth minerals, creating a large-scale market for the new seabed-sourced product. The goal, FT's sources said, would be to \"create large quantities ready and available on US territory to be used in the future.\"\nThe Trump administration has already reportedly held talks with TMC about granting the company an American license to extract critical minerals in international waters, bypassing environmental concerns and ongoing regulatory talks at the International Seabed Commission.\nThe manganese nodules targeted by TMC's mining process grow on a timescale measured in hundreds of millions of years, according to researchers, and may play a central role in the little-understood abyssal ecosystem of the mid-Pacific. From preliminary studies, it appears possible that these polymetallic lumps can electrolytically split seawater into H2 and oxygen gas; if accurate, they would be the first known non-biological generators of O2 on Earth."

        "content": "Italian prosecutors moved last week to seize three ferries in the fleet of Tirrenia-Compagnia Italiana di Navigazione on charges the company falsified documents regarding the environmental performance of its ships and presented the class society and registers with counterfeit documents. Today, April 14, the media is reporting that the investigation has expanded to widespread bribery of government officials, police officers, and other officials receiving illegal gifts including free travel.\nAccording to media reports, approximately 40 officials are under investigation in a case that will begin presentation to a panel of judges on Wednesday, April 16. Prosecutors asked for two individuals to be placed under house arrest and 11 others to be suspended from their roles pending the outcome of the investigation. The accusations are that the company was giving out “gold cards” which provided free travel and making other gifts to the officials.\nThis builds on the investigation in which it is being charged that the ferry company tampered with vessels operating on its route between Genoa and Porto Torres. Tirrena has a government contract to provide the service and receives government payments for critical ferry operations.\nThe allegations include that Tirrena was concealing non-compliance by its vessels by making false reports to the registers or by counterfeiting public authentication on documents used to obtain and maintain certification for the vessels. The company is alleged to have been embezzling public funds by operating ships that were not meeting regulations.\nThe investigation reportedly revealed that “Components of the main engines and diesel generators had been tampered with, altered, or replaced with non-original spare parts.” As such, the vessels were reported to be non-compliant but kept in service with counterfeit and false documents.\nThree ships were placed under arrest under “precautionary custody” to protect public funds. The company however was permitted to continue to operate them to ensure consistency of service. The prosecutors were seeking to protect more than €64 million (nearly $77 million) in public funds that could be involved in the fraud case.\nThe shipping company responded through its lawyers saying it was “astonished” over the allegations. They said the company has faced significant expenses and made large investments to conform with regulations on pollution.\nProsecutors said the investigation into the vessels began in 2023 and dated back to issues in 2021. They believe since then Tirrenia has rectified the compliance issues on its ships. The bribery of officials with free trips is believed to be widespread involving police, magistrates, and other regional officials.\n"

        "author": "Cyanergy",
        "content": "Prosecutors in Taiwan filed charges against a Chinese captain from the mainland alleging he deliberately instructed his crew to anchor above a key undersea communications cable. According to the Taiwan Tainan District Prosecutors Office, the captain was aware that he was in a restricted area and used the claw of his anchor to snag and damage the cable.\nThe captain who was only identified by the surname of Wong is reported to be facing a prison sentence of one to seven years and a fine of approximately $300,000 if convicted. Prosecutors said he denied the crime, refused to reveal the name of the vessel’s owner, and had “a bad attitude” after the crime.\nThe incident began in late February when the vessel which was alternately identifying itself asHongtai 168orHongtai 58and registered in Togo was observed loitering off the coast of Taiwan. Government officials from the island had earlier announced a new monitoring program for suspect vessels including a concentration on ships they believed were owned by the Chinese but under flags such as Togo.\nAfter sitting offshore from February 22 to 25, the vessel was observed dropping anchor in a restricted zone approximately 5 nautical miles offshore and then sailing in a zigzag pattern. Chunghwa Telecom reported an interruption of service on one of its cables for communications and data that connects Taiwan and Penghu.\nThe Coast Guard said it had attempted to contact the vessel seven times telling it that it was in a restricted area and needed to move without reply. After the cable damage was reported, the Coast Guardintercepted the vesseland directed it to a port of investigation.\nProsecutors report the investigation has been concluded, and they determined the captain was “fully aware” of the position of the cable from the electronic charts on his ship. Further, he was aware it was a restricted zone that prohibited anchoring.\n“With the intention of destroying the submarine cable, he instructed the crew to release the anchor… and drove the ship” over the cable, said the prosecutors. Initial reports in February had said it was possibly an accident.\nThere were eight Chinese crewmembers aboard the vessel and when questioned they said the ship wasHongtai 168and that name was painted on the hull. However, the AIS signal wasHongtai 58. Coast Guard officials called the vessel a “makeshift ship,” but they believe it is backed by Chinese capital.\nProsecutors decided not to charge the other seven crewmembers saying there was insufficient suspicion of committing a crime. However, they are being detained and will be deported.\nWhile this is the first time Taiwan has prosecuted a Chinese captain on charges of sabotage, the Navy and Coast Guard earlier this year announced a new effort to track suspicious vessels. This came after another cargo ship was accused of damaging a cable and numerous provocations by China. The Chinese Navy was recently observed practicing what analysts believe was for the invasion of Taiwan. Chinese officials have vowed to reunite the nationalist island with the communist government."

        "content": "\nWith two US Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) now operating in the area, it appears that the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) has withdrawn from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden station.\nThe Nedaja has maintained a continuous presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden area since 2008.  Typically, deployments have consisted of a Moudge or Bayandor Class frigate, supported by a Bandar Abbas logistics vessel, or a Hengham Class landing ship operating in a logistics role.  Deployments have usually been of 90 days duration, sometimes either shorter or longer, and have often involved a port call in Salalah on the way home.  Returns to port have usually been greeted by a senior Nedaja commander and a press announcement, with details given of the flotilla that has deployed to replace the incoming vessels.\nSince the 99th Flotilla, comprised of IRINSDena(F75) and IRINSBushehr(K422), completed its deployment at the end of last year, the 100th Flotilla may have visited the Gulf of Aden.  But the primary mission of the 100th Flotilla was to take 200 cadets from the Imam Khomeini Naval University on their annual winter training cruise, and in this role the flotilla made a port call to Mumbai in late February.\nThere has been now been no word of Nedaja ships in the Red Sea or Gulf of Aden for several months, so it appears that after over 80 flotillas having successively deployed to the area, the Nedaja has at least temporarily withdrawn its presence.  What should have been the Nedaja’s 101st Flotilla has not been seen in the area.  If the Nedaja has cunningly succeeded in evading surveillance, it would only have been able to do so by withdrawing from the shipping lanes which hitherto had been its responsibility to patrol, or by redesigning its presence strategy.\nThe hypothesis that the Nedaja has pulled back is supported by the higher than normal numbers of frigates and support vessels seen in recent months alongside in the Naval Dockyard in Bandar Abbas.  For example, on March 18, five frigates plus the intelligence collector IRINSZagros(H313) were alongside.  On March 28, imagery identified four Alvand/Moudge and one Bayandor frigates, together with all three operational Hengham Class landing ships were alongside, together implying that there were no long-range flotillas out of home waters at that point.\nRecent satellite imagery has also shown that two of the Nedaja’s three Kilo Class submarines are in dry dock in the Bandar Abbas harbour; the one remaining operational Kilo is not, as of this morning and on the basis of poor quality imagery, at its normal berth.  The Kilo could be expected to be attempting to shadow the Carl Vinson CSG in the Gulf of Oman, and IRINSZagros(H313) with other vessels are likely also to be attempting a similar mission.\nIf confirmed, the withdrawal of the Nedaja from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden waters would be of significance.  The Houthis are known to have relied on the Nedaja and ships of the IRGC Navy to provide intelligence to support their anti-shipping campaign.  The Nedaja appears to have withdrawn when the Houthi need for support, under airstrikes mounted from the two US CSGs, is at its most acute.\nTop image: Moudge-class frigate IRIS Dena (file image courtesyFars Media / CC BY 4.0)"

If it is attempted, the ground offensive could result in fighting over the port city of Hodeidah, a focal point for back-and-forth struggles for control throughout the country's long civil war.\nDr. Abdulaziz Sager, head of the Saudi-based Gulf Research Center,tolda recent Chatham House panel that the Houthis have been hit hard by recent U.S. strikes, and that the internationally-recognized government of Yemen is making preparations to retake the country. While still hopeful for a political agreement, Dr.  Sager suggested that a military solution may be near at hand.\n\"To my best knowledge, there is a preparation of almost 80,000 Yemeni soldiers from the legitimate government in preparation in different locations to move toward taking over. That will be . . . supported by the drone surveillance and by the air coverage by the US side. There has been some serious discussion in that one and I can see that happening,\" Dr. Sager said. \"I think we might be on the stage of counting down to the end of the [Houthis], and they pushed it to this.\"\nThere appears to be preparation for renewed ground combat in the north, near Al Jawf and Sada, and in the south near Taiz, suggested Chatham House research fellow Farea al-Muslimi. \"That is the front lines that the [Saudi and UAE] coalition is arming, in preparation for possibility of resuming ground troops over the next few weeks, and I think that is most likely what will happen,\" said al-Muslimi. \"The current military discussions are moving unfortunately as if the [ground] war is to actually resume in the next hours, not just in the next weeks.\"\nThe Houthis have fought for this coastal strip before, but this time, their ability to defend territory will be limited because of U.S. control over shipping in and out of the port of Hodeidah, al-Muslimi said. The seaport is the main entry point for fuel in western Yemen.\nContinued operations in the Red Sea\nOn Sunday, Houthi sources reported six dead and 30 wounded from U.S. bombing attacks in Yemen. The group calculates the total death toll of the campaign to date at 120 people, including both combatants and civilians.\nThe group also claimed the downing of another American MQ-9 Reaper drone, which U.S. Central Command declined to confirm or deny. The Houthis possess short range surface-to-air missiles that have proven capable of shooting down Reaper drones before.\nCentral Command says that its assets are striking Houthi positions around the clock, but has released limited information about specific targets or individuals hit by the campaign.\nUSS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) living up to its motto: \"Vis Per Mare,\" which means “Strength from the Sea” in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility…pic.twitter.com/4t964ihhbg"

Shipping giant NYK is moving to expand its niche cruise operations with the addition of the newAsuka IIIwhile rival Mitsui O.S.K. Lines is expanding its cruise operations through the purchase of secondhand luxury cruise ships.\nAsuka IIIdeparted Emden, Germany on April 12 for her long delivery run to Japan before her maiden voyage on July 20. At 52,265 gross tons, she is small by international standards but represents a major step forward for the domestic cruise market. Built in Germany by Meyer Werft, it is highlighted that the ship which has accommodations for 740 passengers features a special design that combines open spaces with traditional Japanese aesthetics.\nNYK Cruises highlights that the ship will offer a variety of dining, entertainment, and wellness venues. She will also display Japanese art. The ship has 381 passenger cabins and will have a crew of approximately 470. She is 755 feet (230 meters) in length and joins theAsuka II(50,000 gross tons built in 1990 in Japan asCrystal Harmony) cruising from Yokohama and other Japanese ports. She will call at more than 30 destinations in Japan during her inaugural season, which includes a 12-night Japan Circumnavigation Cruise.\n\n\nInterior design of the ship combines modern elements with traditional Japanese aesthetics (Meyer Werft)\n\nThe order for the new ship was placed in March 2021 becoming the first cruise ship ordered since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the prior year. It was seen as an important demonstration of the future of the cruise industry. She is also one of the first smaller cruise ships to be powered by LNG.\nConstruction ofAsuka IIIbegan in September 2023 with the ceremonial first steel cutting. The first block, a 345-tonne 80-foot (24.6-meter) section, was lowered into the dry dock on December 12, 2023. Float out of the ship took place in January followed by her conveyance at the beginning of March. Sea trials were completed in mid-March.\nIt had been anticipated that NYK would use the ship as a replacement for its current cruise ship. The company however has announced additional itineraries for both ships as it seeks to expand the Japanese cruise market. Similarly, MOL recently acquired a second cruise ship from Carnival Corporation planning to expand to three cruise ships in 2027. It has also announced that it is studying new construction to further expand its cruise operations."

        "content": "The Aponte family-owned ports operator Terminal Investment Limited (TIL) is in the running to take over the vast majority of CK Hutchison's global container terminal portfolio after adealled by BlackRock hit snags in Beijing. According to the South China Morning Post and Bloomberg, the restructured proposal would see BlackRock keep a 51 percent stake in Hutchison's two terminals in Panama - the sites of greatest interest to the U.S. government - while TIL would take over all 41 other sites around the world.\nIf completed, the transaction would cost TIL about $23 billion, including $19 billion in cash, a source close to the agreement told SCMP on Monday.\nThe accuracy of the reports could not be verified, and may reflect a negotiation in flux. In aninterviewwith Italy's ShipNews conducted Friday or Saturday, while MSCWorld Americawas at Ocean Cay, Aponte family top executive Diego Aponte laid out a much different deal: a three-way global split that would see ownership shared 70% for MSC, 20% for Blackrock, and 10% for CK Hutchison. It was unclear whether this version was still current as of Monday, as it contradicts other reporting.\nWhichever structure prevails, it would be among the biggest business deals in shipping in decades, so long as it can pass muster with authorities in China.\nState-linked media outlets in Hong Kong have publiclyslammedCK Hutchison for its initial attempt to sell the full portfolio to BlackRock, asserting that a mega-deal with an American company would be unpatriotic and would undermine Chinese security interests. According to Bloomberg, Beijing has retaliated by threatening to withhold government business and domestic regulatory approvals from CH Hutchison's family owners, who also have extensive business interests in mainland China.\nBlackRock's bid has heavy diplomatic support from the White House, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to \"take back\" the entire Panama Canal in order to counter alleged Chinese influence on the waterway. Following these maximalist threats, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently suggested that the U.S. has secured a more modest concession from Panama: local cooperation on reducing China's footprint.\nDespite apparent progress on the diplomatic front, Blackrock's attempt to buy the Panamanian terminals has run into a local hurdle. Panama's comptroller generalallegesthat CK Hutchison's most recent lease renewal was never fully approved, and that the Panamanian government has been underpaid by hundreds of million dollars in fees. (CK Hutchison's Panama subsidiary denies any wrongdoing.) If substantiated, the investigation has the potential to slow down BlackRock's portion of the deal.\nBy splitting off the other 41 terminals in the Hutchison portfolio and selling them to TIL, the revised deal would allow Hutchison to complete the majority of its ports divestment without waiting for a Panamanian review - so long as Chinese authorities approve of TIL as a buyer. That might not happen, according to local experts.\n\"Beijing doesn’t have to read the news before knowing who Hutchison is selling the assets to,\" Lau Siu-kai of the pro-government Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies told SCMP. \"Whether it is Italy or any other Western country taking control of the ports, Beijing still opposes the deal because these countries are vulnerable to pressure from the US.\"\nSpeaking with ShipNews, Diego Aponte appeared confident that the transaction would eventually go through. \"I am calm. There are discussions underway, but I believe that in a short time everything will be clarified with the various parties involved. Including the Chinese. To mutual satisfaction,\" he said."

The Department of Transportation which oversees the Academy along with the New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) entered into a long-term agreement to upgrade the facilities.\nJust over a week ago, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffypledgedto help find the resources needed to restore the institution's infrastructure. During a speech to the midshipmen, he said he was astonished to hear about the conditions in housing and other areas of the campus.\n“Merchant marine cadets have answered the call to serve our country, and it’s our duty to deliver an institution worthy of their sacrifice,” said Duffy. “Our mariners are critical to President Trump’s agenda to make American shipbuilding great again, and more importantly protecting our national security.”\nUnder the terms of the agreement, signed on April 11, the Army Corps will lead the efforts. The initial agreement runs for 10 years. The USACE’s New York District highlights that it already is responsible for a diverse range of engineering projects and services in the New York and New Jersey region, including managing water resources, improving public spaces, conducting environmental restoration, and providing critical infrastructure development.\n“We are looking forward to rehabilitating and modernizing the campus infrastructure at the USMMA,” said Col. Alexander Young, Commander USACE New York District. “It is necessary to ensure current and future generations of midshipmen receive a first-class education. We hope this partnership will serve as a building block for additional collaboration both short and long-term.”\nOne of the nation’s five federal service academies, USMMA ‘s campus was established in the 1940s around the former Long Island North Shore mansion of Walter P. Chrysler. Most of the facilities at USMMA date back to the academy’s founding in the early 1940s, and have not been modernized since. According to the statements during the signing of the new agreement, the facilities are not conducive to the immersive training and demanding coursework today’s midshipmen are required to complete.  The Academy's website reports the Regiment of Midshipmen numbers approximately 950 young men and women.\nA 2021 report mandated by the U.S. Congress cited along list of problemsat the Academy. It cited a lack of investment in the infrastructure and the poor condition of many of the facilities. The report was also critical of the management of the academy.\nVADM Joanna M. Nunan, after a 35-year U.S. Coast Guard career, became the 14th Superintendent of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in December 2022 with a focus on reforming the operations. Earlier this month, USMMA named its first-ever permanent Director of Facilities and Infrastructure, John T. Shea (USMMA’89). He is responsible for overseeing the long-term planning, maintenance, and modernization of the academy’s physical plant and infrastructure and will be working closely with USACE to implement the revitalization and modernization."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nLess than a year after becoming the first port in Europe to offer shore power for large containerships, Hamburg, Germany is on track to complete the installation of shore power capabilities at all its terminals for large containerships. Testing commenced last week at the third of the port’s container terminals with officials saying they remain on track to provide shore power at all the large containership terminals by the end of this year.\nThe port is well ahead of the EU mandate requiring the use of shore power. Regulations mandating shore power be phased in starting in 2030 for containerships and passenger vessels over 5,000 gross tons. By 2035, all EU ports are required to have an on-shore power supply or alternative zero-emission technologies.\nLast week, a further important milestone for the sustainable development of the Port of Hamburg was reached as the shore-side power station of the Hamburg Port Authority at HHLA Container Terminal Altenwerder (CTA) completed its first practical test. The first “ship integration test” was conducted and in the coming weeks, the terminal will continue to increase its power. Further test runs have already been planned to integrate the supply of shore-side power for containerships into regular operations in the Port of Hamburg.\nThe testing was done with theMSC Athens(110,853 dwt). It is one of the company’s smaller vessels with a capacity of 8,800 TEU but is a stepping stone to the larger vessels.\n“Every successful ship integration test brings us one step closer to integrating the power stations into regular operations,” said Friedrich Stuhrmann, Chief Commercial Officer of HPA.\nWith the power station at CTA, the third shore-side power station for containerships in the Port of Hamburg is now in the transitional phase leading up to regular operations. Additionally, the power station at HHLA Container Terminal Burchardkai is expected to be ready this year. The 18,000 TEU box shipCMA CGM Vasco de Gamabecame the first vessel to plug into shore power at the Container Terminal Hamburg in May 2024.\nTo facilitate shore power connections to box ships, Hamburg began investments in 2022 for the necessary infrastructure culminating in a plant that will operate at the container terminal providing connections for three mega-ship berths. Each has a connection capacity of 7.5 MVA. The plant will supply the ships with renewable energy from the public grid. Half of the funding for the shore power installation at Container Terminal Hamburg came from the German government through the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection.\nMSC announced in June 2024 that it had agreed to work with Hamburg to install shore power for its terminal. Later last year MSC became the lead investor in the port operator along with the City of Hamburg.\n“The integration of shore power into our fleet is an important step towards sustainable shipping,” saidNils Kahn, Managing Director, MSC Germany. The shipping company reports it owns approximately 40 vessels that can be charged with shore-side electricity. The number continues to grow as it takes delivery of its newbuilds."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nIn a hearing Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board approved final conclusions from the investigation of the fire aboard the ro/roGrande Costa D'Avorioat Newark in 2023. The investigators confirmed that the fire started when the Jeep Wrangler that longshoremen used as a pusher vehicle overheated and burned inside the cargo bay, catching other nearby vehicles on fire.\nGrimaldi ro/ros likeGrande Costa D'Avoriocarry thousands of used cars from the U.S. to Africa, including \"forklift\" cars that are so damaged that they won't roll and \"non-runner\" vehicles that have to be pushed aboard. Terminal operator Ports America's local unit in Newark was in the practice of using ordinary passenger vehicles as pusher trucks to shove non-running but still-rolling cars up the loading ramp and up the interior ramps inside the ro/ro.\nThe pusher that caught fire was a Jeep Wrangler, and NTSB noted that it was in use in an \"industrial application for which it was not intended.\" This particular vehicle model was subject to a recall notice because its transmission had a tendency to overheat under extreme offroad use. Overheating would cause the transmission fluid to boil out of the housing and contact hot engine parts or exhaust piping, where it would catch fire. To address this known problem, the recall required installing an audible hot oil alarm and a warning light on the dashboard; the Jeep had had this service done - but the alarm was just a warning, not a shutoff.\nOn the day of the fire,Grande Costa D'Avoriowas loading 920 used cars for export, including nonrunners. At about 2100 hours, a longshoreman was driving the Wrangler on his 38th push run of the day up the ro/ro's interior ramps - a far heavier task than the offroading conditions addressed by Jeep's recall. He was shoving a nonrunner ahead when he heard a clunk, and he saw \"fireballs\" dripping from underneath the vehicle.\n\nSecurity camera footage shows the Jeep Wrangler making its final run as a pusher vehicle (USCG)\nBased on the recall notice, the evidence from the scene and the extreme duty cycle imposed on the Jeep, NTSB concluded that the casualty was caused by the decision to use a vehicle that wasn't designed for the application - resulting in its transmission oil boiling over and catching fire on hot engine parts.\nThe Jeep operator was not able to get the fire out with an extinguisher, and the ship's fire alarm system went off, alerting the crew. 22 minutes after the fire was discovered, the master ordered the space sealed off and the fixed CO2 firefighting system discharged. However, the crew could not close the Deck 12 garage door because there was no external control to operate it. In order to close it, one crewmember would have had to stand inside the burning space, hold an actuator button down to shut themselves in with the smoke and fire, then make their way 120 feet aft to a ladder well on the port side - between tightly parked cars. (The lack of a button on the ramp side of the door was a SOLAS violation, according to NTSB, but the class society told the agency that it was acceptable because the door stays closed while at sea and does not need to be operated under way - only in port.)\nThe remains of the pusher Jeep, showing its retrofitted channel steel bumper (NTSB)\nThe captain agreed that closing the door with crewmembers on the fire side would be unsafe, so the garage door stayed open. The CO2 system was discharged anyways with the door still fully open; an ATF study performed after the fact found that if the crew had had a practical way to close the door, the CO2 would have put out the fire.\nWhen firefighters arrived on scene, the incident commander ordered a squad into the space to attack the fire. The local fire department's decision to open and close other compartment boundaries for moving personnel in and out further reduced the CO2 concentration and the fixed firefighting system's effectiveness, NTSB concluded, \"ultimately increasing the severity of the fire.\" NTSB noted that this decision was contrary to normal marine firefighting practice.\nTwo firefighters went missing in the space and a SAR effort began. The compartment's ventilation system was turned on to clear smoke - removing the rest of the CO2 and introducing fresh oxygen. The two missing mentragically lost their livesinside the space, and the fire burned for days.\nNTSB believes that the two firefighters were exposed to unnecessary risk when they were ordered into the CO2 flooding zone without being informed that it had been activated. The incident commander did not communicate the fact that the CO2 system had been discharged to the personnel entering the ship; at one point, a fire battalion chief even climbed a ladder well and opened a hatch to look in, despite the risk of asphyxiation on the other side. \"His breath was taken away,\" said NTSB investigator Bart Barnum.\nNTSB found that most of the local first responders had not recently taken marine firefighting classes, and they were not familiar with the vessel's fire control plan or with CO2 flooding systems. \"Lack of marine vessel firefighting training left the land based firefighters unprepared to respond to a vessel fire, resulting in an ineffective response that contributed to the fire's spread, vessel damage and led to the firefighters' casualties,\" NTSB concluded.\nUltimately, NTSB's staff believes that local Newark firefighters should never have entered the space to fight the fire. \"The best method to extinguish that fire was to work with the crew to close the Deck 12 door and allow the CO2 to function,\" said Barnum.\nThe NTSB has issued a recommendation to AAPA to inform all port authorities of the risks of the dangerous misuse of passenger trucks as pusher vehicles. It also asked seaports to help out their local fire departments to increase awareness, adopt basic vessel familiarization and firefighter training among first responders.\nNTSB also recommended that theGrande Costa D'Avorio'sclass society should change its guidelines to require SOLAS fire doors to be closeable from both sides."

        "content": "\nFollowing a period of website service outages last month, the U.S. Coast Guard has officially \"retired\" the Homeport site - its centralized web portal for regional safety alerts, mariner credentialing information, port security announcements and regulatory compliance tools. These functions will now be handled by temporary \"workarounds,\" the service said, until the same functions are transferred to new \"secure information systems.\"\n“We recognize that Homeport has been a trusted tool for mariners and the broader maritime community,” said Rear Adm. Wayne Arguin, Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy. “We are committed to keeping these users informed and providing alternatives to the functions and information Homeport provided as we transition.”\nHomeport was developed to comply with the post-9/11 Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, and while dated, it was widely utilized by industry for everyday tasks. In addition to administrative forms and regulatory guidance, it included a full list of Captain of the Port (COTP) zones, and users could find all harbor status and navigation advisories from every COTP during hurricanes or emergencies. It also had tools that employers could use to confirm the validity of mariners' credentials and that mariners could use to track the status of credential applications.\nThe Coast Guard cited \"increased costs and system obsolescence\" for the shutdown. It plans to replace Homeport with a new version of the site within 12-18 months, and the new tool will \"provide users with the information they need in a more focused and secure format.\"\nFor now, Homeport's functions will be handled by temporary workarounds, according to USCG 7th District. Merchant mariner credentialing queries will be handled directly by the National Maritime Center (NMC).\nOther important Coast Guard legacy sites - like the portals for vessel inspection data, Coast Guard personnel wages, transfer requests, and fee payments - remain online.\nThe Coast Guard's planned investment for an internal logistics and parts-tracking database upgrade,CG-LIMS, has recently been canceled to save costs. The service said that the \"ineffective\" CG-LIMS program's $33 million in funding will be redirected to address \"emerging needs.\""

        "content": "Chinese officials touted the new class of CMA CGM containerships as the “world’s largest dual-fuel powered” containerships as the naming and delivery took place of the new CMA CGM Seine (220,000 dwt). They highlighted the advancements in design and speed of construction for a vessel they are calling a “sea giant” and a “green cargo king.”\nThe CMA CGM Seine has the same dimensions as the five-year-old CMA CGM Jacques Saade class but greatly improves on efficiency. The ship, which is 399 meters (1,309 feet) in length and has a beam of 61.3 meters (201 feet), is reported will reduce emissions by 20 percent and nearly eliminate SOx and particulate matter. It has increased efficiency in its LNG-fueled engines and an 18,600 cbm MARK III LNG tank to give it a range of 19,500 nautical miles. The ship is also fully IMP Tier III compliant.\nCargo handling efficiency was also improved with an increase of approximately 764 TEU to a total of 23,876 TEU. This includes 2,200 reefer slots. Boxes can be stacked 24 layers. The fire safety systems for cargo operations were also improved. The ship rivals the first 24,000-plus TEU capacity vessels also built in China.\n“From the start of construction to undocking at the pier, the time has been compressed to 4–5 months, significantly ahead of the original construction cycle,” Liu Xuedong, deputy general manager of Hudong-Zhonghua Changxing Shipbuilding, told the Chinese media. “This ship was delivered more than six months early, with cycle control at a leading level in the shipbuilding industry.”\n\n\n\nThe naming and delivery took place on April 15 in Shanghai. The vessel will be joining the line’s Far East to Europe route.\nIt is the first of four new vessels being built for CMA CGM in this ultra large class. Shipbuilder Hudong-Zhonghau reports it has now delivered 17 containerships to CMA CGM, including 12 LNG-fueled vessels. Overall, the yard reports it currently has 20 vessels under construction and a total orderbook reaching 2029 and valued at $19.6 billion.\nThis new class is the latest step in CMA CGM’s effort with the company reporting it has invested nearly $20 billion to order LNG and methanol-powered ships. In 2024, the group took delivery of 12 new LNG-fueled vessels and says that by 2029 it will have 153 ships capable of using low-carbon energies (biogas, biomethanol, and synthetic fuels) in its fleet. CMA CGM is reported to have a total fleet currently of approximately 670 vessels with orders of 100 additional ships."

A vessel of this class would be smaller and less capable than the Coast Guard's medium icebreaker, USCGCHealy, or the service's long-delayed Polar Security Cutter (PSC).\nThe RFI indicates that the Coast Guard has an interest in moving swiftly, as it is seeking a yard that can deliver within three years of a contract award. This would require a rapid wind-up at a capable yard or an open slot on a hot production line. Only a few shipyards in the world have recent experience producing thick-hulled icebreaking vessels, and all are located outside of the United States.\nThe RFI could align with the goals of the ICE Pact, the joint icebreaker construction agreement that the Biden administration signed with Canada and Finland in 2024. In parallel with the ICE Pact, Canadian shipbuilder Davie proposed to use its expertise to open a yard in the United States to build icebreaking vessels - though this plan would require a longer timetable than the RFI's three-year maximum."

The group issued its statement targeting a transshipment of containers coming from the United States set to be transferred at Morocco’s Tanger Med Port this weekend.\nMaersk has repeatedly denied the allegations that it is transporting weapons to Israel during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The issue had been dogging the company and even became a topic at its annual shareholder meeting earlier this year. Shareholdersvoted downan activist investor resolution that would have banned the company from shipping arms to Israel.\nA spokesperson for Maersk told media in Morocco that the current claims were coming from activist groups and are “false and misleading.” The company said the claims it was transporting weapons or in this case, spare parts to the Israeli military are “unfounded claims based on assumptions made by activist groups.”\nThe latest accusations are that a container loaded with spare parts for U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets was loaded on theMaersk Detroit(84,626 dwt vessel with a capacity of 6,200 TEU) which is currently inbound for the Moroccan port. According to the reports that have been circulating for days, the container will be offloaded and transferred to theNexoe Maersk(31,500 dwt with a capacity of 2,250 TEU) for transshipment to Israel.\nThe Moroccan Union of Port Workers, affiliated with the Moroccan Labor Union, issued a statement calling on workers, employees, and executives of companies operating the port to boycott the shipNexoe Maersk. It cited the reports from the activists that the ship would be carrying the F-35 parts and other military equipment to Israel.\nTheDetroit Maersksailing under the U.S. flag is operated by Maersk Line, Limited, which participates in the U.S. Maritime Security Program (MSP) program and carries cargoes, including the military assistance shipments, which are reported to be a “critical element of U.S. foreign policy.” The line has been targeted by activists for previous boycotts due to its support of the U.S. government.\nTheNexoe Maersk, flagged in Hong Kong, is a feeder ship for the company. It operates a route that includes calls in the Mediterranean.\nWhile denying the allegations, a Maersk spokesperson noted when they carry F-35 parts they would be going to suppliers and not the military. They would also only be going to countries participating in the F-35 program.\nMaersk has repeatedly said it has a strict policy against transporting weapons or ammunition to conflict zones. The spokesperson said there are stringent controls in place.\nActivists have repeatedly targeted ships operated by Maersk Line, LTD. for its role in carrying U.S. cargoes. Last November, in Spain a group focused on two ships with reports the vessels woulddivertto Morocco due to the protests. Maersk operates the terminal in Tanger Med where the reports said the current transshipment will take place.\n\nTop photo ofNexoe Maerskin 2023 byFarid Mernissi(CC BY 4.0)"

        "content": "\nThe ICC International Maritime Bureau (IMB) issued its quarterly report on global piracy warning of a rise in global piracy and armed robbery incidents driven by a spike in attacks in the Singapore Straits. Southeast Asia, and specifically the regions around the Singapore Strait has become the global hotspot warns the report while the figures show that globally piracy continues to decline.\nThe UK-based group which is often referred to as the anti-crime arm of the International Chamber of Commerce, added its voice to that of ReCAAP in Asia and private security firms which have all sounded an alarm about the spike in robberies on ships transiting the Singapore Strait. IMB calculates that 31 of the total of 45 incidents during the first quarter happened in Southeast Asia. The Q1 report highlights that 27 incidents were reported in the Singapore Straits compared to seven for the same period in 2024.\n“The reported rise of incidents in the Singapore Straits is concerning,” said IMB Director Michael Howlett highlighting the urgent need to protect the safety of seafarers navigating these waters. “Ensuring the security of these vital routes is essential and all necessary measures must be taken to safeguard crew members.”\nRaising additional concern is the fact that 92 percent of all vessels targeted in the Singapore Straits were successfully boarded. IMB says this includes nine bulk carriers and tankers over 100,000 deadweight tonnage in size. Further, it highlights that while most incidents were considered low-level opportunistic crimes, crewmembers were at great risk with guns reported in 14 incidents. In 2024, guns were reported in 26 incidents globally. Ten crew members were taken hostage in six separate incidents, two were threatened and one was reported injured.\nGlobally during the first quarter, IMB calculates 37 vessels were boarded, four were hijacked and four had attempted attacks. The threat to crew safety remains high with 37 crew members taken hostage, 13 kidnapped, two threatened and one injured. Also in three-quarters of the incidents (35), the ships were underway when the attacks took place.\nWhile incidents are rising in Southeast Asia, the data also highlights that the number of reported incidents within the Gulf of Guinea continues to be at its lowest in nearly two decades.\nIMB however warns the danger off West Africa is not over. All 13 crewmembers reported kidnapped during the quarter were taken in these waters. Two separate attacks resulted in kidnappings and a total of six incidents were reported in the first quarter of the year. In March, pirates hijacked a bitumen tanker southeast of Santo Antonio, in Sao Tome and Principe, kidnapping 10 crew members, while a fishing vessel south of Accra, Ghana, was boarded by armed pirates who kidnapped three crew members.\n“While we welcome the reduction of incidents, the safety of crew members in the Gulf of Guinea remains at greater risk,” said Howlett. “It is essential to maintain a strong regional and international naval presence to address these incidents and ensure the protection of seafarers.”\nSimilarly, off the East Coast of Africa, the threat of Somali piracy also remains. Between February 7 and March 16, two fishing vessels and a dhow were hijacked off the coast of Somalia. In these incidents, 26 crew members were taken hostage, demonstrating the continued capabilities of Somali pirates. Reports indicate all crew have been released along with the vessels."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe Swedish Maritime Accident Investigation Board released the details of its observations aboard a Chinese bulker accused of damaging undersea cables saying it cannot determine sabotage. The agency participated in the ongoing efforts to investigate theYi Peng 3(75,121 dwt bulker registered in China) which was linked to thedamageto two undersea communications cables.\nThe government agency that investigates accidents and incidents states that it “cannot be determined with certainty whether a Chinese ship intentionally damaged data cables in the Baltic Sea in November 2024.” It however also notes that its assessment does not prevent the Swedish Public Prosecutor’s Office from conducting a preliminary investigation into a suspected crime and that law enforcement authorities in several affected states are conducting criminal investigations into the incident.\nIn an 18-page presentation (online in Swedish) the board details its observations aboard the vessel. It however notes the limitations it was working under saying that the flag state normally leads the investigation and that the Chinese limited its access. They were not given an opportunity to access electronic evidence such as the surveillance images from the Voyage Data Recorder and limited crew interviews with interpreters and authorities present in the room.\nThe board concludes that there are “two alternative scenarios for the incident, one of which is that the ship deliberately released the anchor to cause damage to the bottom infrastructure during the voyage in the Baltic Sea. … The other alternative is that the anchor came loose because it was poorly secured or not at all.”\nThe crew asserted during the interviews that the release of the anchor was unintentional. Investigators pointed out that the vessel dragged its port anchor for 1.5 days or approximately 180 nautical miles. Among the points they highlight supporting a possible accidental release is weather conditions, which according to the logs on the ship were slightly worse than the Swedish authorities had believed. In an oncoming sea the report notes with extra force from the ship’s speed and bow hitting the sea, “could be sufficient to cause the anchor to start running out.”\nThey note the ship did not slow down saying it would have been natural to reduce speed to prevent risking damage to the ship or endangering the crew during the release. They also determined the anchor and a section of chain hit the seafloor leaving a mark. It then dragged and bounced across the floor.\nDuring the examination of the ship, they noted a number of conditions such as the lack of marks on the windlass to indicate the brake had been applied. They could not determine if the anchor had been fully secured after the vessel departed Russia, but also noted a lack of damage to elements that might have been expected if the anchor broke free. They also noted that elements such as equipment covers might have been changed before they were permitted to board the ship.\nIt is not the first time the authorities have failed to find specific evidence of sabotage after the series of incidents in the Baltic region. In February 2025, the Swedish Prosecutor’s Office released the Navibulgar bulkerVezhenalso saying it couldnot find evidenceof sabotage. A commercial fishing trawler was also detained after another incident but released after only a few hours.\nBaltic nations remain on high alert after a series of incidents and were successful in getting NATO to increase its assets in the region. Patrols have been increased while the nations plot new steps to safeguard their undersea infrastructure which they believe has become a target in a new style of war."

Out of 476 people aboard, 304 were killed in the sinking, most of them high school students. The master of the vessel abandoned ship early without joining in the rescue, and he instructed the crew to tell passengers to stay in their cabins, potentially increasing the death toll. He was later convicted of murder by omission and is serving a life term in a Korean prison. Other members of the crew and one Korea Coast Guard officer were convicted of lesser offenses.\nIn an attempt to recover all human remains from the wreckage and investigate the cause of the disaster, Korean authorities hired Shanghai Salvage to raise theSewolin one piece and move it to shore - the deepest wreck raising ever attempted. The recovery effort gave investigators unrivalled access to a sunken ship, intact, dry and resting on its side on a seaport quay.\nIn the latest review of the much-studied accident, the Korea Maritime Safety Tribunal determined that there was no evidence of an external collision, and it focused on factors internal to the vessel. Previous inquiries have already determined that the vessel was heavily overloaded, and that it was intrinsically topheavy due to owner-initiated modifications on the upper decks.\nIn a conclusion similar to a 2018 investigation, the panel determined that a solenoid valve failed on the No. 2 steering pump, causing a malfunction. The resulting hard turn causedSewolto heel over; because the cargo aboard the vessel was not properly secured, it shifted to one side, adding to the heeling moment. The vessel lacked enough GM to overcome it, downflooded through hull penetrations, and capsized."

An American-assisted forensic review of the devices shows that they were designed to collect data that could be used for \"underwater warfare,\" according to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\nIn a press conference Tuesday, AFP spokesman Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad said that the devices were found in locations that are \"important strategically in the defence and security not only of the country, but for international maritime navigation.\" Three were in the Taiwan Strait off Luzon; one was found off Masbate, near the center of the Philippines' internal waters; and one was found off Mindanao, the southern end of the archipelago. \"Most likely, these were dropped by a mothership,\" he said.\nTrinidad said that they were capable of collecting data \"beyond navigation.\" The sensor package aboard could be used to measure bathymetry, water depth, salinity and temperature - all essential data for operating or hunting submarines. Jonathan Malaya, a member of the National Task Force for the Philippine Sea, told media that the drones were \"in all likelihood deployed by China to map the Philippines' underwater terrain.\"\nOut of the five drones, at least one had sent signals to China, based on a forensics exam of a cell SIM card found aboard the drone. \"The last contact of the card was in mainland China,\" Trinidad said. Two drones also had Chinese markings.\nBased on the evidence, Trinidad put the probability that the drones belong to China at about 55-80 percent. Malaya went further, and said that the forensic data \"allowed us to conclusively determine that they are of Chinese origin.\"\nFew nations make seaglider drones, and images of some of the devices displayed Tuesday appear similar to the Chinese-built \"Sea Wing\" (Haiyi) UUV developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, previously found in sensitive waterways in Indonesia in 2019-20. The AFP also displayed photos of an unusual all-black glider, fitted with larger protrusions fore and aft.\n\n\nThe reveal of the new forensic evidence comes just days ahead of the launch of annual U.S.-Philippine Balikatan defense drills. This year, 14,000 troops will participate, the majority from the United States. \"It’s a defense plan being tested,\" Philippine Army Brigadier General Michael Logico told media.\nIn time for the exercise, Google Maps has adopted the Philippines' name for waters in its western exclusive economic zone, an area that is also claimed by China. Users of the Maps app will now find a marginal sea with a Philippine sovereign name - the West Philippine Sea - just off the coast of Luzon and Palawan. The decision has angered Chinese commentators, who would prefer to continue the use of the name \"South China Sea\" for the entire region."

Fires can spread rapidly within enclosed ro/ro decks, and EV fires are even harder to put out.New industry guidancecalls for operators to respond with evacuation, ventilation shutdown and initiation of CO2 flooding very early in the firefighting process - before the fire can spread or injure anyone.\nAt about 1500 hours, a fire broke out aboard the ro/ro cargo vesselDelphineat the CLdN terminal in Zeebrugge. The blaze started on the third deck, which contained 60 electric vehicles and 40 conventional cars. The captain opted to fully evacuate the ship's 26-member crew, but stayed aboard to coordinate as firefighters and other first responders from shore came aboard to assist.

The fire department said in a statement that it was trucking in a fresh supply of inert gas to release into the hold in order to displace any intrusion of oxygen.\n\"The vehicles are no longer burning, but as soon as fresh air comes onto the deck we will have a resurgence,\" the brigade told HLN. \"We have to avoid that. For that reason, we will blow nitrogen into the deck that we will have brought over from Antwerp. Although it is still not certain that the situation will be under control.\"\nResponders believe that 60-70 vehicles in the hold have burned out, but the full extent of the damage remains to be seen.

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAn interimfactfinding reporton the allision involving the boxshipMaersk Shekouat Fremantle last year suggests that the vessel's helmsman and pilots were operating with different goals. The helmsman was actively steering to maintain a heading of 083 degrees, his last received helm order. Meanwhile, the pilots were trying to make an emergency turn to port, using full ahead thrust, assist tugs, bow thrusters and the port anchor - unaware that their helmsman was applying starboard rudder to counteract them. The ship hit a historic tall ship and a museum, causing considerable damage.\nIn the early hours of August 22, 2024,Maersk Shekoubegan heading inbound into Fremantle's harbor and took aboard two pilots. The primary pilot assigned for the transit was fatigued, so the backup pilot took charge during the master/pilot exchange.\nAt about 0610, as they entered the narrow entrance channel for the inner harbor, southwesterly winds picked up to about 40 knots on the starboard quarter. The ship began to swing to starboard. The pilot ordered the helmsman to steer 083; the helmsman correctly acknowledged the order at about 0613:45. This was the heading that the helmsman would try to maintain throughout the final minutes of the casualty sequence.\nAt the time that the order was given, the helmsman had the rudder hard to port to counteract the effects of the strengthening wind. It wasn't enough to do the job, andMaersk Shekou'sheading was about four degrees off to starboard (087). The master suggested going to full ahead to increase steering forces, and at about 0614:34, the pilot agreed. There was a pier ahead, and they needed to turn to port fast in order to enter the harbor.\nWith more power and a series of assist tug movements,Maersk Shekoubegan to swing back to port. As it swung back from 087 through 086, the helmsman moved to check the swing: he brought the helm to midships, then briefly to 33 degrees starboard. The vessel steadied up squarely on 083, the last ordered heading he had received, which was straight towards the pier.\n\nCourtesy ATSB\nThe pilot was unsure why the vessel had stopped swinging to port, and at 1615:33 he told the (fatigued) secondary pilot that something was wrong. The secondary pilot had been on a phone conversation at the back of the bridge and had not been involved in the back-and-forth among the bridge team, but he interrupted the call and joined the decisionmaking process.\nTogether, without checking in with the helmsman, they began working the assist tugs to try to turnMaersk Shekouto port. The rudder was amidships at this point, and the helmsman was maintaining a steady heading of 083.5 towards the moored tall shipSTS Leeuwin II- now less than a ship length away, with the boxship full ahead and making seven knots.\nAt 0615:54, the master put the bow thrusters full to port. At 0616:10, the secondary pilot ordered stop engines, then full astern, and the master ordered the crew to prepare to drop the port anchor.\nBeginning at 0616:21, as these emergency measures to turn to port were under way, the helmsman applied more starboard rudder to try to counteract the effort to turn to port. The rudder would be over to starboard as much as 29 degrees over the course of the next minute.\nAt 0616:49, the engines reached full astern andMaersk Shekoubegan to slow. The anchor, tugs and bow thruster managed to start a swing to port, but not fast enough to avert an allision. At about 0618,Maersk ShekouhitSTS Leeuwin IIat about three knots, dismasting the sailing vessel and prompting the two crewmembers aboard to flee onto the pier. They escaped with minor injuries.\n\nMaersk Shekou makes contact with STS Leeuwin II\nMaersk Shekoucame to a full stop by about 0618:30, but continued to spin in place. The bow thrusters were still on full to port, and the ship was swinging to port at about 13 degrees per minute. At 0619:52, the master noted to the pilots that the bow thrusters were still running with full power to port, and the thrusters were shut down - but not quickly enough to prevent contact in the narrow confines of the harbor.\n40 seconds later, a stack of containers onMaersk Shekou'sstarboard quarter hit the roof of the Western Australia Maritime Museum. The ship's hull scraped along the wharf for a short distance, damaging the quayside and breaching a small section of the hull plating above the waterline.\nThe ATSB continues its investigation and will release its full report, including its formal conclusions, when it has completed its review."

        "content": "\nThe Norwegian Storting (Parliament) has confirmed the requirements and schedule for the regulations to move passenger and ferry shipping to zero emissions while sailing within the country’s World Heritage fjords. The first phase is set to start in 2026 and progress as technology becomes available for larger ships to sail with zero emissions.\nThe process of developing the regulations began in 2018 with the Norwegian Maritime Authority. Implementation however has beendelayedas they worked to define the scope of the regulations and waited for technology to advance to the level required to maintain shipping while achieving the goals.\n“The process of developing zero-emission requirements for the World Heritage fjords has been long and demanding, both for the industry and for the Norwegian Maritime Authority,” said Alf Tore Sørheim, Director General of Shipping and Navigation. “Now that new provisions have been adopted, it is important to highlight that they provide the clarity the industry has long awaited. This ensures predictability and offers the opportunity to comply with the requirements.”\nThe first phase is just eight months away. As of January 1, 2026, passenger ships of less than 10,000 gross tons will have to meet the zero-emission requirement for the World Heritage fjords, which include Geirangerfjorden, a primary destination for the cruise industry, as well as Nærøyfjorden, Aurlandsfjorden, Sunnylvsfjorden and Tafjorden. All passenger ships, including ferries, must meet the requirement, but for larger ships of 10,000 gross tons and above it will be phased in with the requirement to sail with zero emissions as of January 1, 2032.\nThe Minister of Climate and Environment, Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, describes the legislation as a significant breakthrough for the World Heritage fjords. It is a key step in Norway’s overall sustainability programs and a commitment to the tourism industry.\nThe authorities note that the zero-emission requirement is technology-neutral and does not prescribe specific solutions. It is up to the operators in the World Heritage fjords to use energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide (CO?) and methane (CH?). However, when such energy sources are used, there are requirements for greenhouse gas emission reductions, in accordance with the EU regulatory framework.\nAs part of the final test of the regulation, the government determined that passenger ships may use biogas as an alternative fuel, but that when biogas is used as an alternative fuel, it must be kept separate from fossil fuels until it is bunkered. In addition, the biogas must be bunkered within the final month before the ship enters the World Heritage fjords, and the amount bunkered must correspond to the amount expected to be used during the voyage through the fjords. Biogas sourced from the gas grid, accompanied by a certificate based on a mass balance system, does not meet the requirements for operating in the World Heritage fjords.\nIt also includes a requirement that ships must use shore power where available. The Storting also agreed to create shore-side electricity in the city of Flåm. It is allocating NOK 100 million ($9.5 million) in support of a shore power project.\nNorway is at the forefront of developing technologies including batteries for its ferries as well as alternative fuels. In 2022, coastal ship operator Havila ran thefirst demonstrationof a passenger ship operating solely on batteries in Geirangerfjord. Competitor Hurtigruten has also released its concept designs for a zero-emission passenger ship."

        "content": "In a stunning move late on Wednesday, April 16, the U.S. Department of Interior announced it has ordered a stop to the construction of Equinor’s Empire Wind offshore wind farm. The project had been approved in 2024 and was underway. The move is drawing sharp criticism from New York State Governor Kathy Hochul and leaving the industry stunned.\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum posted a brief message on X writing that Interior in consultation with Commerce is “directing the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to immediately halt all construction activities on the Empire Wind project until further review of information that suggest the Biden administration rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis.”\nWhile the Biden administration did approve several projects late in its term, Empire Wind receivedapprovalfor its Construction and Operations Plan in February 2024. The project also received its Clean Air Permit for construction in February 2024.\nNorway’s Equinor acquired the Empire Wind lease area in 2017 and in June 2024, announced the execution of the Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority for Empire Wind 1 power for 25 years at a strike price of $155.00/MWh. Thefinancial closefor the project was completed in December 2024. The expected total capital investments, including fees for the use of the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, Equinor reported would be approximately $5 billion including the effect of expected future tax credits. New York had issued itsfinal approvalsfor the project in May 2024.\nNew York’s governor who has already been fighting with the Trump administration over congestion pricing for vehicles in Manhattan issued an angry statement saying the federal government should be supporting its efforts for affordable energy “rather than undermining them.”\n“This fully federally permitted project has already put shovels in the ground before the President’s executive orders—it’s exactly the type of bipartisan energy solution we should be working on,” said Governor Hochul in her statement. “As Governor, I will not allow this federal overreach to stand. I will fight this every step of the way to protect union jobs, affordable energy, and New York’s economic future.”\nThe news site FreeBeacon obtained a copy of Burgum’s memorandum to the acting director of BOEM. In it, he contends that “serious issues” were raised on the approval for Empire Wind. He says it was rushed through without sufficient analysis or consultation among the relevant agencies.\nBurgum also writes that he is directing BOEM to continue to review the federal wind permitting practices “to both existing and pending permits.”\nWork had begun on the redevelopment of the site in Brooklyn which was to be used as the base of the wind farm during construction and its future maintenance operations. FreeBeacon reports rock work was scheduled to begin in the coming weeks at the offshore site along with other preparations. The wind farm was scheduled to provide power starting in 2027.\nEmpire Wind 1 and Empire Wind 2, both of which were approved in 2024, are located about 12 nautical miles south of Long Island, N.Y., and about 16.9 nm east of Long Branch, N.J. Together the projects would have a total capacity of 2,076 megawatts of renewable energy that BOEM estimated could power more than 700,000 homes each year.\nTrump in January 2025 ordered a review of the leasing and permitting practices but most expected it would be a stop to future activity. The administration however also pulled the EPA permit for construction on a New Jersey project. There are several other projects currently in the construction phase. The Biden administration had approved a total of 11 offshore wind farms and left others in review at the end of its term."

According to court documents, Lowe's message read \"Hey, I think someone might have a bomb on your sunrise cruise ship [sic].\" Carnival took the matter seriously, andCarnival Sunrise- which was under way in the Caribbean - was diverted to Jamaica for an inspection. Officials had to search through more than 1,000 cabins for any sign of a hazardous device; none was found.\nLowe's motivation, according to prosecutors, was not related to  Carnival or to the ship. He was angry at his girlfriend, who had gone on a cruise with her family \"while leaving him behind to care for their pets.\" The FBI traced the email address back to Lowe and questioned him; he admitted sending the message.\nWhen he was charged, Lowe took responsibility for writing the email and pleaded guilty to a single count of false information and hoaxes. On Monday, he was sentenced to eight months in prison followed by two years of supervised release. The relationship he had with his girlfriend is now over, his counsel said in a memorandum before the sentencing.\n\"Bomb threats are not a laughing matter and are extremely irresponsible,\" said Cheyvoryea Gibson, FBI Special Agent in Charge for the case. \"When individuals make false hoax threats, they divert critical law enforcement resources and spread unnecessary fear. The FBI takes all threats to life seriously and will ensure that those who resort to this kind of intimidation face the appropriate consequences.\""

        "content": "\nNorth Korean exports of artillery ammunition to Russia, for use in its war against Ukraine continue.  But volumes shipped in recent weeks have fallen back from previous peaks, suggesting that initial consignments may have come from stockpiles, now depleted, with more now being met directly from production.\nThe traffic between North Korea and Russia has beentrackedby the Open Source Centre (OSC), led by James Byrne, formerly Director Open Source Analysis at the UK’s Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies. North Korean ammunition is shipped in containers from Raijin to the Russian ports of Danube and Vostochny in the Vladivostok area.  By monitoring the four Russian flagged RO-RO container ships carrying the containers - MVAngara(IMO 9179842),Lady Mariia(IMO 9220641),Maya-1(IMO 9358010) andLady R(IMO 9161003) - then counting the containers on board and measuring volumes, OSC has been able to accurately gauge the number of artillery shells being shipped. All four of the Russian ships are US-sanctioned, and several have also been used for hauling military cargoes to and from Tartus in Syria.\nMVMaya-1has recently come off the Sea of Japan route, loaded cargo in China, transited the Suez Canal in February and conducted a turn-round in Kaliningrad, leaving on April 10 for an unknown destination.  It has apparently been unimpeded whilst in transit or during its port calls, despite being sanctioned.\nOSC tracked 64 trips by the four Russian ships between September 2023 and March 2025.  Traffic peaked in January 2024, when seven cargoes were shipped.  By March 2025, only three cargoes per month were being shipped.  Over the entire period, the 64 sailings sighted shipped a calculated 15,809 containers, with each container likely to have held 224 boxes of 152mm artillery shells, or other loads made up of rockets, 122mm or mortar rounds. Using these figures, OSC estimates that up to 6 million shells might have been shipped to Russia by North Korea by the end of March 2025.\nOnce unloaded at the Russian ports, the containers are moved by train directly to Russia ammunition depots servicing the Ukrainian front line. The main receiving depot at Tikhoretsk, 60 miles south of Rostov, was attacked by Ukrainian drones on September 21, 2024, with an estimated 90% of the stockpile destroyed.  In 2025, Ukraine is planning on producing 3000 of its own-design Bars, Peklo and R-360 Neptune missiles, the latter of which has a range of more than 600 miles, and all of which are capable of attacking Moscow\nUkrainian defense intelligence estimates that North Korea is providing half of the ammunition currently being consumed on the Ukrainian front line.  Batches of the Korean ammunition have to be proofed and separate range tables drawn up, as the performance of the Korean ammunition is inconsistent and inferior to Russia’s own production.  The North Korean shells are also prone to exploding in the breach, if loaded into barrels which are hot from high intensity fire missions.\nRussia is also known to receive shipments of 122mm and 152mm ammunition shells from Iran, albeit in lesser volumes. Iranian exports have tended more towards the supply of drones and missiles. Iran ships weapons through the Caspian ports of Bandar-e Anzali and Amirabad to either Kaspiysk in Dagestan or the Volga-Don trans-shipment port at Olaya. On January 2 this year, Iranian social media images showed Iranian air defense and truck-mounted Fath-360 tactical ballistic missile systems (comparable in capability to the M142 HIMARS) at the dockside at Bandar-e Anzali prior to loading."

        "content": "The first large vessel designed to transport liquified carbon dioxide (LCO2) was launched in South Korea as the industry for the transport and storage of captured carbon begins to take shape. The vessels are being built for Greece’s Capital Maritime Group which in 2023 announced plans to expand into the developing market.\nThe launch took place at the HD Hyundai Mipo shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea. With a capacity to transport 22,000 cubic meters of liquified carbon dioxide, the vessels have about three times the capacity of the first LCO2 carriers. Norway’s Northern Lights project took delivery at the end of 2024 of two 7,500 cbm LCO2 carriers built in China and which are currently undergoing commissioning. They will operate in connection with the storage project started as a partnership between Equinor, Shell, and TotalEnergies.\nCapital Gas Ship Management Corp. will be managing the four gas carriers being built in South Korea and will place them into the commercial market. The new company will be known as Capital Clean Energy Carriers.\nThe vessels will measure approximately 525 feet (159.9 meters) in length with a beam of approximately 90 feet (27.4 meters). The vessels are equipped with three “Bi-lobe type storage tanks” that can maintain a low-temperature environment of around -55 degrees Celsius. According to Hyundai, this allows it to stably transport various liquefied gas cargoes such as LCO2, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and ammonia (NH3).\nThe design also enhances the vessels’ environmental performance. They are fitted with Selective Catalytic Reduction systems to reduce Nox emissions. They can use shore power and have ice-resistant design technology (Ice Class 1C) which will improve navigation stability. Capital also reported in 2024 that it was exploring adding onboard carbon capture systems to the vessels.\nTheconstruction orderwas originally placed in 2023 for two vessels and later increased to four gas carriers. HD Hyundai reports the vessel will complete outfitting and trials for delivery at the end of this year. The others are set for delivery in 20026.\nThe companies cite data from Clarson Research to illustrate the potential market for LCO2 transport. The analysts have written to achieve carbon neutrality, more than six gigatons of carbon will need to be captured and stored annually by 2050. They estimate that 20 percent will need to be transported by sea for storage or reuse. It is estimated that 2,500 LCO2 carriers will be required to meet future demand."

The vessel reportedly was able to evade the small boats, but there are reports of shots fired before the small crafts left the vicinity.\nIt is unclear if the incident was pirates, the Houthis, the so-called Yemen Coast Guard, or others. The UK Maritime Trade Operation issued a warning about the incident which was the first since 2024. The Houthis in January suspended their attacks linked to the Gaza ceasefire but had recently warned they would resume attacks on ships linked to Israel. They have not commented on yesterday’s incident.\nUKMTO reports the vessel was 100 nautical miles east of Aden, Yemen. The multiple small crafts followed the bulker for approximately two hours. The master reportedly altered course towards the Yemeni coast.\nThe report says that shorts were fired but security analysts Neptune P2P Group notes it is unclear if the shots came from the small craft. They note the shots could have been from security guards aboard the merchant ship.\nWhile the incident could have been piracy, the analysts at Neptune note it is unusual for the pirates to operate with multiple crafts or as far east in the Gulf of Aden as this incident. They note it could have been the Yemen Coast Guard due to the vessel’s proximity to the coast or possibly fishermen. They note that local fishermen are known to carry guns to protect their equipment and fishing catch.\nNeptune reports that over 20 fishing vessels as well as four commercial ships have been hijacked since Somali pirates retuned their attacks on ships in November 2023. While two fishing vessels were robbed earlier this year and a third taken hostage in late 2024, the attacks on commercial vessels stopped earlier last year after the Indian Navy and others intervened to rescue vessels that had been boarded by pirates.\nThe ICC International Maritime Bureau in its quarterly report yesterday, April 15, noted the recent attacks demonstrate the continued capabilities of Somali pirates. Recognizing this, the EU also extended its efforts in the region for two more years till early 2027.\nUKMTO is advising vessels to use caution and report incidents while the authorities investigate to determine if it was pirates or other crafts attempting to approach the merchant ship."

It was the second time the U.S. has targeted a private, so-called “teapot refinery” in China.\nSince declaring a campaign of “maximum economic pressure” on Iran, the Trump administration has now enacted six rounds of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales. A month ago, the first private refinery in China wassanctionedalong with a terminal operator.\nToday’s action added a second Shandong Provence-based refinery, Shandong Shengxing Chemical Company, to the sanctions. OFAC reports the refinery has received “dozens of shipments of Iranian crude oil worth more than a billion dollars.” According to the statement, between March 2020 and January 2023, Shandong Shengxing sent more than $800 million in wire transfers to China Oil and Petroleum Company Limited (COPC), an IRGC-QF front company that aided in selling Iranian oil to China. COPC the U.S. says laundered billions of dollars through the U.S. financial system in support of the IRGC-QF, $108 million of which was seized by the U.S. Justice Department.\n“Any refinery, company, or broker that chooses to purchase Iranian oil or facilitate Iran’s oil trade places itself at serious risk,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.  “The United States is committed to disrupting all actors providing support to Iran’s oil supply chain, which the regime uses to support its terrorist proxies and partners.”\nThe action is also adding five tankers to the sanctions, including one flagged in Cameroon (Reston– 115,482 dwt) and four flagged in Panama (Bestla-306,206 dwt; Egret – 299,868 dwt;Nyantara– 113,033 dwt; andRani– 107,123 dwt). According to the U.S., the vessels have been involved in ship-to-ship transfers with sanctioned tankers and shipped billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil, including to Chinese refineries. The U.S. also listed the associated shipping companies in Panama, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, and Hong Kong associated with these tankers.\nThe Islamic Republic News Agency yesterday reported that the Iranian Foreign Ministry expected a “second round of indirect talks with the United States” to take place in Oman on Saturday, April 19. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote on X that a first round of talks had already been executed.\nThe Trump administration says it will continue to pressure Iran into a new agreement. It has also increased the attacks on the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen all as part of the pressure campaign. However, it also confirmed that U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff spoke directly with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.

        "content": "\nSaronic, a start-up launched in 2022 to focus on autonomous vessels for defense systems, acquired Gulf Craft, a Louisiana-based shipbuilder, to accelerate its growth into autonomous shipbuilding. The company says it gives it an immediate capability in shipbuilding as it also unveiled its concepts for a next-generation 150-foot vessel named the Marauder.\nGulf Craft located in Franklin, Louisiana is a custom builder of aluminum boats. Established in 1965, the company builds ferries, offshore support, and other commercial vessels.\n\"Today marks a significant milestone in Saronic's expansion into autonomous shipbuilding and lays the foundation for our vision of our larger, next-generation shipyard, Port Alpha,\" said Saronic CEO Dino Mavrookas. \"While we actively search for a home for Port Alpha, this acquisition gives us the immediate capacity to meet urgent customer needs for larger autonomous vessels and the flexibility to scale to address emerging commercial and defense applications of these advanced systems.\"\nSaronic announced in February 2025 that it had completed its next round of funding raising $600 million in its Series C round. Having invested in developing and expanding its manufacturing capabilities for its small ASVs over the past two years, the company outlined its vision for a new shipbuilding base that it calls Port Alpha. It said the new shipyard would be capable of delivering new classes of autonomous ships at the speed and scale needed to protect and defend the maritime domain.\nThe company reports the acquisition of Gulf Craft provides a strategically located shipyard on the Gulf Coast that will serve as the prototyping and production hub for its medium unmanned surface vessel (MUSV) fleet. The yard provides the infrastructure and skilled workforce it says will be needed to develop, rapidly iterate, and scale the production of Saronic's MUSVs today and into the future. Saronic has retained Gulf Craft's workforce and expects to create more than 500 new jobs over the next 3-4 years. In addition to bringing on skilled shipbuilders, welders, and electricians, Saronic anticipates creating new roles for engineers, technologists, and naval architects to develop and scale production of its MUSVs.\n\n\nGulf Craft builds aluminum commercial vessels at its shipyard in Louisiana (Gulf Craft)\n\nThe acquisition adds nearly 100 acres to Saronic's footprint, supporting both immediate MUSV development and production as well as capacity for significant expansion. Saronic plans to invest more than $250 million directly into the shipyard, which will encompass large facility upgrades that will enable it to apply a first-principles approach to shipbuilding. This includes modernizing infrastructure, acquiring new machinery, and updating the facilities while focusing on building a production system engineered for speed, scalability, and quality. These upgrades will support a rapid capacity ramp-up, enabling Saronic to deliver up to 50 unmanned ships per year.\nThe company also unveiled Marauder, a 150-foot Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV) designed to support a wide range of missions for the U.S., its allies, and commercial customers. With a payload capacity of 40 metric tons, the autonomous ship is designed to travel up to 3,500 nautical miles or loiter for 30+ days, depending on mission requirements.\n\nMeet the newest member of Saronic’s family of Autonomous Surface Vessels. Bayou-born. Mission-ready. Marauder.At 150-feet, Marauder is a medium unmanned surface vessel (MUSV) that will integrate the same proven autonomy stack used across Saronic’s existing ASVs. This new vessel…pic.twitter.com/A51DKOSl2t\n\nMarauder is designed to be fully unmanned and will integrate the autonomy stack used across Saronic's existing family of ASVs. The vessel incorporates Saronic's vertically integrated approach, disciplined engineering philosophy, and strong domestic supplier network.\nAs part of its long-term vision, Saronic says it intends to invest over $2.5 billion to develop Port Alpha, which it calls the world's most advanced shipyard, designed to produce hundreds of unmanned vessels annually. It looks to align its operations with the national efforts to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base and capitalize on the U.S. Navy’s growing interest in future autonomous systems."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "In the face of global uncertainties and the potential impact on shipping from the trade war unleashed by Donald Trump, shipowners and the seafarers’ unions agreed to a better than six percent increase in monthly wages over the next three years. It comes after key agreements last week adding a designation as key workers and strengthening repatriation and shore leave for seafarers.\nDirector of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Sectoral Policies Department Frank Hagemann highlighted that the agreement came about as part of a “wholly unique global collective bargaining forum.” It was noted that maritime transport is the only industry with a formally recognized global minimum wage. Dating back to 1958, the agreement sets every three years the global minimum wage for seafarers.\nThe International Labour Organization led with meeting in Geneva on April 14 and 15 with the Subcommittee on Wages of Seafarers of the Joint Maritime Commission (JMC). Shipowners and seafarers’ unions from around the world, coordinated by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), meet to discuss the issues and negotiate the elements of the Maritime Labour Convention and wage agreement.\nThe wage portion of the talks highlighted the escalation in global trade tensions reports the International Chamber of Shipping. It said both sides expressed concern about the “current cloud of uncertainty” and prospects of a potential full-scale trade war. They recognized that the world’s nearly two million seafarers would be caught in the middle and impacted by a slowing in global trade. This comes after a period of high global inflation during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe terms of the wage agreement adopted yesterday call for a total 6.2 increase in the monthly minimum wage for seafarers between January 1, 2026, and January 1, 2028 (an increase from $673 a month as of January 1, 2025, to $715 per month as of January 1, 20208). Seafarers will receive a 2.5 percent increase in the first year followed by 2 percent and 1.6 percent in the following years.\n“This agreement strikes a careful and considered balance between recognizing the vital contribution of seafarers and maintaining the commercial sustainability of the global shipping industry,” said Pål Tangen of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and spokesperson for the shipowners’ group during the meeting. “These are not ordinary times, and this resolution reflects our respect for their service while ensuring that shipowners can continue to operate in a highly competitive and volatile global market.”\nDuring themeetings on the MLC, master contract for global seafarers, the discussions focused on the hardships encountered during the pandemic. The designation as key workers, seafarer repatriation, and visa-free shore leave were key elements. They also enhanced protections against bullying and harassment and added a new recommendation to provide reference materials on medical care for seafarers. These will go into effect by December 2027.\n“Last week we made an important breakthrough with recognition of seafarers’ key worker status in the Maritime Labour Convention. This week we have taken a further step to improve their welfare through pay rises that both retain and increase the value of the ILO AB minimum wage, taking into account increases in the cost of living since 2022,” said Mark Dickinson of Nautilus International and spokesperson for the seafarers group.\nBoth the wage increase and the revisions to the MLC require approval by elements of the ILO. The contract terms will be presented at the 113th session of the ILO’s International Labour Conference in June. The wage increase will be submitted for approval at the ILO’s Governing Body in November.  The next meeting of the Special Tripartite Committee on the MLC is set to take place in April 2028."

As a precautionary measure, Red Cross volunteers have conducted health assessments on all responders to make sure that ensure they remain in top physical condition, the PCG said.\nThe sand carrier was carrying about 2,000 liters of lube oil and 30,000 liters of diesel. As diesel fuel dissipates and is not persistent, the PCG is not treating it as an imminent environmental threat. 250 meters of containment boom have been deployed as a precautionary measure."

        "content": "\nDemonstration tests recently completed on vessels at the Prot of Long Beach, confirmed the ability to combine maritime emissions capture with carbon capture for at-berth vessels. The project combines the technology of STAX Engineering, a pioneer in maritime emissions capture and control based in California, and Seabound, a UK-headquartered leader in onboard carbon capture, offering what the companies call a comprehensive, cost-effective solution for the maritime industry.\nTrails on the solution began in March 2025 and the companies report they conducted three iterations, including with Wallenius Wilhelmsen and NYK Line. The latest demonstration took place in Long Beach, yesterday, April 16, serving a RoRo vehicle carrier operated by Wallenius Wilhelmsen. The companies said the end-to-end modular solution has now cleared its final trial.\nThe combined system integrates STAX’s mobile emissions control unit—which removes 99 percent of particulate matter and 95 percent of Nox from the vessel’s exhaust—with Seabound’s carbon capture technology. Connecting directly to a vessel's exhaust pipe, STAX technology first removes criteria pollutants, turning the exhaust into purified gas. The gas is then directed through Seabound’s capture unit, isolating and storing up to 95 percent of carbon and 90 percent of sulfur before releasing the cleaned exhaust. The companies report that all results were independently verified by Yorke Engineering, an environmental consultancy.\n“Our partnership demonstrates that effective, scalable emissions solutions are a reality that we can implement now,” said Alisha Fredriksson, co-founder and CEO of Seabound.\nSince its launch in early 2024, STAX has established itself as the only emissions solution servicing all major vessel classes in California. To date, STAX reports it has provided a critical pathway to CARB (California Air Resources Board) compliance in five major ports, and captured more than 126 tons of pollutants. CARB is expanding its in-port emissions regulations to cover all classes of merchant ships.\nSTAX positions a barge alongside the vessel which places a cap on the funnel tocapture emissions. The company reports it will deploy its eighth barge this month. STAX also recently announced $70 million in funding to fuel fleetwide carbon capture integration and international expansion this year.\nFounded in late 2021, Seabound has demonstrated its onboard carbon capture technology. Seaboundrecently installed its systemfor onboard carbon capture system together with Lomar Shipping and Hapag Lloyd, successfully capturing CO2 at approximately 80 percent efficiency onboard a 3200 TEU container vessel. Seabound will be launching its first full-scale commercial carbon capture systems this year.\n“Today marks a landmark moment in our journey toward a zero-emissions future, and it’s just the beginning of a global maritime emissions' solution,” said STAX CEO Mike Walker. “As we expand our carbon capture capabilities across the fleet, our inaugural partnership with Seabound has been instrumental, and we look forward to partnering again with ABP in the Port of Southampton.”\nSTAX and Seabound report they will continue their partnership in the UK's Port of Southampton. In March 2025, ABP accepted STAX and Seabound into its Energy Ventures Accelerator, a program designed to explore clean energy hardware startups to clean up ABP’s ports nationwide as it works toward Net Zero by 2040."

        "content": "\nPresident Donald Trump signed an Executive Order extending the ban that “regulates the anchorage and movement of Russian-affiliated vessels” first instituted by President Joe Biden in April 2022. While the ban will have little practical impact, it is the latest demonstration of the frustration of the Trump team to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n“The policies and actions of the Government of the Russian Federation continue to constitute a national emergency by reason of a disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations of the United States,” says the Executive Order signed by Trump on April 15. It was published today in the Federal Register.\nThe U.S. followed the lead of its European allies and Canadalaunching the bantwo months after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. It was seen at the time as a symbolic step demonstrating the U.S. commitment to penalize the Russian economy. However, it was highlighted that only approximately 1,800 Russian vessels had made port calls in the U.S. in 2021 and the Biden administration had already taken other steps to limit imports and trade with Russia.\nTrump has alternately threatened to take further steps against Russia and swung to blaming Ukraine for the war. He promised during the election to immediately end the war but has not been able to complete the proposed ceasefire. He has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and both sides have said an in-person meeting is being planned.\nRussia wants the U.S. to roll back sanctions and restrictions such as the vessel ban and the sale of oil. Trump has shown a willingness while the U.S. State Department has said there will be no agreements with Russia or lifting of the sanctions until a ceasefire in the war with Ukraine is achieved.\nThe order signed by Trump this week says the U.S. is “continuing for one year the national emergency with respect to the Russian Federation and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of Russian-affiliated vessels to United States ports.”\nThis follows an earlier move by Trump last week to extend the national emergency status concerning the “harmful foreign activities of the Russian government.”"

        "content": "The crew aboard an offshore support vessel has taken to social media with the aid of the International Transport Workers’ Federation to highlight their plight. It comes after the union groups called 2024 the “worst year on record for seafarer abandonment.”\nThe ITF posted on its social media channels a video of the 15 Indian crewmembers aboard the vessel which has remained in Indonesia since October 2024. They are holding handwritten signs saying they do not have proper food and the ship’s managers have threatened them when they ask for their back pay. They are appealing for the help of the Indian seafarer unions and the flag state of the vessel for help. The crewmembers want their pay and reparation back to India.\nAccording to the ITF, the vessel namedStar Apollo(1,500 gross tons) has been in the Batamec Shipyard in Indonesia since last year. There are 15 people, all Indian nationals, aboard who report they have not been paid since their contracts began between four and eight months ago. The ITF says it is trying to aid in the recovery of nearly $80,000 in unpaid wages.\nThe vessel, built in 2012, was sold in 2025 to Mumbai-based Vindhyawashini Offshore, according to the Equasis database. The ship is registered in St. Kitts & Nevis.\n\n\n\n“The crew are extremely frustrated, and the stress of not being paid is taking a toll on their health,” writes ITF Global Inspectorate Coordinator Steve Trownsdale on his social media account.\nThe ITF issued a warning in January that the abandonment of seafarers is “spiraling out of control.” It said abandonment of seafarers skyrocketed 87 percent (3,3133 seafarers compared to 1,676) in 2024 vs 2023. Vessel abandonment they reported was up a staggering 136 percent to 312 vessels in 2024.\nAbandoned seafarers the ITF warned can experience months of unpaid wages, extremely poor on-board conditions, inadequate food and clean drinking water, and long periods of work without proper rest. In some cases, they are left completely stranded for months – even years – on end.\nUnder maritime regulations and the Maritime Labour Convention overseen by the International Labour Organization, flag states are obliged to step in when seafarers are abandoned. It calls for the states to arrange the transport home of seafarers, but many are reluctant to leave the ship until they settle their wages.\nThe lack of enforcement and responsiveness from flag and port states, the lack of insurance for vessels, and shipowners refusing to accept that they are mistreating their crew are common factors the ITF said that contribute to abandonment and complicate the resolution of cases."

The area has been closed to fishing ever since the national monument was expanded by former President Barack Obama in 2014.\n\"The economic zone . . . is huge and it's exclusively ours. So why wouldn't we have our fishermen fish there?\" said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick at a signing ceremony. \"Every country in the world, they all fish the 200 miles off the coast, and we were stopping our own fishermen.\"\nGoing forward, fishing permits and catch limits in the area will be regulated by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council and  NOAA Fisheries under U.S. law. Foreign vessels will be excluded, except for foreign-flag fishing tenders (with appropriate permits.) The extent of any agency resources for enforcement in this far-flung region is unknown: NOAA Fisheries is being downsized by the administration, and may soon be folded into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, according to leaked plans from the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe PIHMNM covers nearly half of the U.S. EEZ in the Pacific Islands. American Samoa is highly dependent on tuna for jobs and economic growth, and the administration says that withdrawing access to such a large swath of the fishing grounds in the U.S. EEZ was detrimental to Samoa's commercial fishermen.\n\"I find that a prohibition on commercial fishing is not, at this time, necessary for the proper care and management of the [PIHMNM] or the objects of historic or scientific interest therein,\" the president wrote in the order."

If carried out, the strike would further slow progress on the Columbia-class nuclear ballistic missile submarine, a multibillion-dollar program that is already behind schedule and over budget.\nUAW Marine Draftsmens' Association Local 571 represents the 2,500 workers who draw up schematics and plans for sub construction at GD Electric Boat, one of the two firms in the United States that can build nuclear-powered submarines. Electric Boat holds contracts for the Columbia-class and the next generation of the Virginia-class attack sub, two of the Navy's highest-priority programs. Columbia is needed to replace the aging Ohio-class as the platform for the nation's at-sea nuclear deterrent, the most survivable second-strike option in the arsenal. The UAW MDA's members did the detail design for Columbia, and they produce the plans for construction.\nGD Electric Boat emphasizes that \"our nation needs submarines now more than any time in our history,\" and says that it has already made its best and final offer to the union. This includes a pay raise of 23 percent and certain retirement package improvements.\nThe union, however, says that the wage increase doesn't go far enough to offset recent inflation, and that a proposed hike in employees' insurance premiums would further erode the gains in the package. Meanwhile, the union says that Electric Boat has kept profits totaling $13 billion over 2022-2024 - more than the price of one Columbia-class hull.\n\"This company has a simple choice. They can get back to the table and get serious about the demands, or they can keep messing around,\" said UAW President Shawn Fain in an address to 1,200 Local 571 members on Monday.\nAt the meeting, rank and file union members voted to authorize a strike, and approved the motion by a margin of about two-thirds. The union leadership will keep working on negotiations with GD Electric Boat, but now has the power to start industrial action if the talks do not produce results.\nOn the same day as the meeting, Electric Boat filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that the union is refusing to bargain or is bargaining in bad faith."

Houthi media outlets have reported that more than two dozen people were killed in the blasts.

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "Tony Munoz",
        "content": "After a 13-month investigation and complaints filed by five U.S. trade unions, the U.S. Trade Representative released its proposal calling for escalating tariffs on Chinese-built ships and the companies that operate them designed to address the perceived unfair Chinese trade practices. While the fees arenot as largeas the proposal in February 2025, they are broader targeting both LNG exports and vehicle carriers. The effort is tied to President Donald Trump’s call to rebuild the American shipbuilding industry.\nIn light of the information obtained during the investigation and taking into account public comments, the U.S. Trade Representative determined that China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance is unreasonable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce and is therefore actionable. Specifically, USTR found China’s targeting for dominance unreasonable because it displaces foreign firms, deprives market-oriented businesses and their workers of commercial opportunities, and lessens competition and creates dependencies on China, increasing risk and reducing supply chain resilience. China’s targeting for dominance is also unreasonable because of Beijing’s extraordinary control over its economic actors and these sectors.\nUSTR asserts that China’s targeting for dominance burdens or restricts U.S. commerce by undercutting business opportunities for and investments in the U.S. maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors; restricting competition and choice; creating economic security risks from dependence and vulnerabilities in sectors critical to the functioning of the U.S. economy; and undermining supply chain resilience.\nWhile it focuses on Chinese vessel operators and vessel owners, Chinese-built vessels, the industry was surprised by the inclusion of all foreign vehicle carriers (PCTCs) and the transport of LNG. The structure does offer some exemptions for vessels in the MARAD programs, engaged in short sea shipping, arriving empty at U.S. ports and below a certain size or capacity threshold. It also includes fees on container cranes, containers, and chassis made in China.\nThe proposal sets the fees for Chinese-built vessels based on the net tonnage of the vessel and a phased-in schedule. The fee would be charged up to five times per year, per vessel. The first fee effective October 14, 2025, would be $50 per net ton and step up six months later to $80. Annual increases would move to $110 and $140 per net ton in 2028.\nFor vessel operators of Chinese-built vessels, the fee starts at $18 per net ton in October 2025, moving six months later to $23 per net ton. The annual step-ups would be to $28 in 2027 and $33 per net ton in 2028. The alternative for vessel operators is based on per container discharged, starting at $120 for each container in October 2025, and then the step-ups at $153 per container in 2026, $195 in 2027, and finally $250 per container in 2028. The fee can be suspended for up to three years if the owner orders and takes delivery of a U.S.-built vessel of equal or greater net tonnage. Among the other exemptions are for vessels with a capacity of less than 4,000 TEU, specialized vessels, and Lakers.\nVehicle carriers get one of the harshest penalties, and it targets all foreign-built vessels in the sector. The fee is set at $150 per car arriving on the vessels starting in October 2025. Again, there is a possible exemption for operators who order U.S.-built vehicle carriers.\nLNG transport is also targeted with a requirement that one percent is exported on U.S.-built vessels starting in 2028. The percentage steps up every two years so that by 2047 fifteen percent of LNG must be exported on U.S.-built vessels.\nThe language in the proposal offers a much stricter definition of what constitutes a U.S.-built ship versus the current Jones Act definitions used by the U.S. Coast Guard which permits foreign-made elements and components. The language in the USTR schedule requires all major components of the hull or superstructure of the vessel to be manufactured (including all manufacturing processes from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings for iron or steel products) in the United States. It also specifies key components of the vessel must be built in the United States.\nUSTR which is led by Ambassador Jamieson Greer who was confirmed at the end of February 2025, said these steps are necessary because China controls nearly a fifth of the world’s commercial shipping fleet, allowing them to influence the pricing and availability of ships used to conduct international trade. It cites data from the Center for Strategic and International Studies that shows the U.S.only accounts for 0.1 percent of global shipbuilding while China produces (more than 53 percent) more than the rest of the world combined. Chinese officials have criticized the effort saying the U.S. was blaming its long-term decline on China instead of investing in its shipbuilding industry.\nWhile the industry was still analyzing the42-page outline of the fees, the unions were quick to respond calling the USTR effort “meaningful remedies put forward to reinvigorate domestic shipbuilding.” The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, one of the unions filing the original complaint, said it applauds the United States Trade Representative and vowed to “work to ensure these policies are properly implemented.”\nThe release of the proposal starts a comment period that runs to May 19, and once finalized the proposal calls for the fees to begin after 180 days."

The five fishermen aboard the boat were detained.\nOn April 15, another boat was spotted near Holothuria Banks, and was suspected of engaging in illegal fishing. Officers boarded it and detained the crew.\nBetween the two boats, ABF officers seized more than 400 kilos of cucumber, a common target for unlawful artisanal fishing activity. They also found 360 kilos of salt, used to preserve the illicit catch for the long journey back north, and fishing gear.\nThe boats were seized and \"disposed of\" at sea, as allowed by Australian law. In previous cases, ABF units have burned illegal fishing boats on the spot.\nThe 12 fishermen will be transferred to Darwin for further investigation and processing, and may face charges. Typical penalties include a suspended sentence and deportation, or brief prison stays and fines for repeat offenders.\nThe ABF has recently redoubled its enforcement efforts in the remote regions of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, where vast distances and sparse settlement make border control a challenging task. An uptick in Indonesian fishing boat activity, including at least one known instance of human smuggling, has given new impetus to the agency's efforts.

The vessel is set to set several new marks in size and speed as well as its charging capabilities as the largest of its kind yet built for operations in Norway.\nTheHinnøyis 7,115 gross tons and 117 meters (384 feet) in length. Built by Turkey’s Cemre shipyard for Norwegian ferry operator Torghatten Nord, the RoRo double-ended ferry was designed by Norwegian Ship Design. The companies highlight it will have a record-breaking speed of 14 knots and power systems capable of a one-hour run in the weather and exposed conditions in Norway’s fjords and Arctic waters.\nThe ferry is larger replacing LNG-fueled ferries that have operated on the route between Bognes and Lødingen for the past decade. Torghatten highlights the design is enclosed to handle the relatively weather-hard conditions. Typically, battery ferries that have been placed into service so far are open designs for shorter distance runs.\n\n\n\nThe new vessel has a capacity for 399 passengers and 120 cars. It was classsed by DNV and is registered in Norway. The shipyard lists propulsion as two Schottel 1.8 kW motors supported by a Siemens water-cooled battery system with approximately 4.750 kWh and a Siemens electrical system.\nIt was outfitted with two independent power systems to provide redundancy and ensure it could operate even if one fails. On-shore it will be supported by what may be the largest connections with 9,200 watts for fast charging of the onboard batteries. In case the shore power is unavailable, biodiesel generators will provide sufficient power for normal operation.\nThe order was placed for the ferry in April 2022 and it was launched in November 2023. The delivery trip commenced on April 15 from Yilova, Turkey after the final functional testing and certification.\nThe vessel is seen as a milestone for electric ferries and a key part of meeting Norway’s increasing environmental regulations.\nTorghatten Nord plans to continue its advanced ferry designs having selected Norway's Myklebust Verft to build two ferries which will be the world's largest hydrogen ships. The ferries, which will also be 117 meters in length are designed to carry up to 120 cars on Norway's longest ferry route between Bodø and Lofoten. They are scheduled for delivery in 2026."

        "content": "Equinor issued a statement detailing the potential impact of the Trump administration’s order yesterday, April 16, stopping construction that was underway on its New York offshore wind farm Empire Wind. At the same time, the state’s regulators issued a strongly worded condemnation of the order following a vow yesterday for the state’s governor to fight the administration.\nThe company reports that it is suspending offshore work on the project, as ordered, complying with theorder received yesterdayfrom the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). It states the project has a gross book value of around $2.5 billion, including its investment in the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal which would be the construction and operational base.\nIt reports that it has drawn about $1.5 billion from the project finance term loan that was completed in late 2024. Equinor US Holdings has provided guarantees for the equity commitment in the project financing and would have to repair the $1.5 billion to the project finance lenders in a full-stop scenario. The company would also be exposed to termination fees from its supplies.\nBoth the state and Equinor are highlighting the long and rigorous review process the Empire Wind project went through before it received federal and state approvals in 2024. NYSERDA (New York State Research and Development Authority) highlighted that it was the first Trump administration that issued the lease for the project saying they are now showing “a complete disregard” for a project that is New York’s largest energy infrastructure project in 50 years and follows Trump’s prioritization of independence and locally produced energy.\n“The federal government’s interference not only ignores the reality surrounding the future energy security of our state and country, it’s fueled by a shortsighted, political agenda that ignores the well-demonstrated economic benefits that this industry can provide as the state and nation work to ensure an affordable, reliable and abundant energy supply for future generations,” said Doreen M. Harris, President and CEO, NYSERDA. “The irrefutable harm created by this action will send a chilling signal to any party investing in the U.S. market, all of whom rely on regulatory certainty.”\nYesterday, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum asserted that had information that “raises serious issues” with the project’s approvals. He asserted the Biden administration rushed the approvals “without sufficient analysis or consultation among relevant agencies.” Burgum directed BOEM to order Empire Wind to cease all construction activities until a further review is completed to “address these serious deficiencies.”\nWhile saying it will safely halt the offshore construction, Empire also said it is, “engaging with relevant authorities to clarify this matter and is considering its legal remedies, including appealing the order.”\nThe company highlights it has more than 35 years of history in the U.S. It says it has invested more than $60 billion in the U.S. to date, including in oil, gas, and renewables.\nSeveral companies including Shell and BP have already pulled back from the U.S. offshore wind sector while analysts were left to speculate on the broader implications of the stop work order against Empire Wind. Burgun in his memorandum said the review is ongoing of federal wind permitting practices with respect to “both existing and pending permits.”Two projects, Vineyard Wind and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind as well underway with offshore construction. Vineyard was delayed by a blade failure and subsequent inspection program while Dominion paused some offshore work during the winter and is due to resume this spring. Orsted also has two projects, Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, which have started onshore cabling and other work. In total, the Biden administration approved 11 offshore projects with one completed in 2024. Other projects remain in review at the federal and state levels."

The Financial Times is quoting a senior U.S. State Department official who says the Houthis have been receiving Chinese satellite data in addition to support from Iran for the attacks that started in late 2023 and targeted more than 100 merchant ships.\nIt was previously well understood that the Houthis were receiving targeting data for their missile and drone attacks on Israel and shipping in the Red Sea from both Russia and Iran, with IRGC Qods Force operatives based in Yemen acting as the conduit. The Iranian Khayyam satellite was jointly built with Russia, based on Kanopus-V imagery satellite, with the Iranian satellite likely to be operating within Russia’s own Kanopus-V constellation. The Iranians and Russians are likely to share most of the output of this combined constellation. Supplementing the satellite imagery data, the Iranians would have added in their own intelligence feeds from IRGC spy ships and regular Iranian Navy ships operating in the area, prior to these vessels being withdrawn from the area several months ago.\nA senior State Department official in Washingtonbriefed the Financial Timesthat the Chinese company Chang Guang Satellite Technology, a commercial entity owned by or with close links to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, has also been feeding targeting data to the Houthis. Chang Guang Satellite is reported to have had 100 mini-satellites in orbit in 2024, a figure which was planned to rise to 300 by the end of 2025. With such a constellation, a 10-minute refresh time would be feasible for any point in the target area.\nThe Financial Times report was unclear whether raw imagery was being passed to the Houthis, or whether processed information was shared either as intelligence or in the form of targeting packs. Chinese military standard communications equipment that would enable such transmission has regularly been seized in the same consignments of arms and ammunition dispatched by the IRGC Qods Force to the Houthis but intercepted at sea by Coalition naval forces. With the reported withdrawal of IRGC Qods Force embeds in the Houthi command and control structure, in the face of targeted US attacks, there will be even greater emphasis on building data links to support the Houthis remotely as the American attacks continue, destroying and degrading the Houthis’ existing communications networks.\n\n\nOn January 28, US Coast Guard Cutter U.S. Coast Guard cutter USCGC Clarence Sutphin Jr (WPC 1147) seized a consignment en route to the Houthis which included Chinese military-grade communication and network equipment (CENTCOM)\n\nThe unnamed senior State Department official briefing the Financial Times was supported by Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokeswoman, who was quoted on the record as confirming that Chang Guang Satellite Technology was “directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on US interests”. The feed of information from the State Department as opposed to the Defense Department suggests that the Chinese behavior is being considered as a factor in broader discussions with China on matters of tariff and trade.\nSurveillance carried out by the Chinese satellites may also enable the Chinese to warn off the Houthis from attacking Chinese ships as they transit the area. Chinese vessels are still regularly using the Gulf of Aden to Suez Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor, giving them a simple commercial advantage over shipping lines obliged by Houthi attacks to take the long way between Asia and Europe around the Cape of Good Hope."

The crewmembers, whose nationality was not specified, are reported to be out of danger while their vessel is being detained pending further inspections.\nThe Maritime Transport Regulatory Authority (ITANSMAR) told the local media that the fire began on the bulkerAltzekon Sunday afternoon, April 13. The vessel was reportedly loaded with coal and departing the Nacala port.\n“It is assumed that there was an explosion in the engine room [of the ship], a fact that has yet to be ascertained,” Itransmar said in a statement sent to the news outlet Lusa. “The four crew members (…) are out of danger and are currently undergoing treatment at a clinic in Nacala,” the newspaper reports.\n\nA post shared by Club of Mozambique (@clubofmozambique)\n\nFour tugboats with fire-fighting equipment were sent to aid the 81,177 dwt bulker which is registered in Nigeria, but the fire had already been extinguished by the ship’s crew. After loading the ship was bound according to its AIS signal for a stop in Las Palmas, Spain with a final destination of Poland.\nThe ship according to the Equasis database had recently been acquired from South Korea by the Green Seeds General Trading Company of Oman. It was built in 2012.\nThe ship is showing that it is not under command while lying in the Nacala Porto anchorage. ITRANSMAR said a delegation of naval engineers would be sent to inspect the vessel. They are inspecting to determine if it can continue on its trip."

        "content": "\nThe Coast Guard has initiated the final of five planned phases of the service life extension program (SLEP) for Coast Guard CutterPolar Star, the service’s sole operational heavy icebreaker.Polar Stararrived at Mare Island Dry Dock in Vallejo, California, on March 30 to begin the remaining SLEP activities. The work is part of the In-Service Vessel Sustainment (ISVS) Program.\nThe SLEP is recapitalizing a number of major systems to extend the service life of the cutter and maintain polar ice-breaking capability until the polar security cutter fleet is operational. ThePolar StarSLEP was designed to address targeted systems such as propulsion, communication, and machinery control systems for recapitalization. The USCG is undertaking the major maintenance program to extend the service life ofPolar Starbeyond its original design of 30 years.\nCommissioned in 1976,Polar Staris the United States’ only heavy icebreaker capable of providing access to both polar regions. The Seattle-based cutter is 399 feet in length and 13,500 tons. The cutter's six diesel and three gas turbine engines produce up to 75,000 horsepower.\nThe life extension program began in 2021 in intervals timed between the vessel’s annual deployment to Antarctica. The current installment is the fifth and final phase planned in the program. The next generation polar icebreaker currently running six years behind the original construction schedule, with the shipyard Bollinger recently saying that completion of the first Polar Security Cutter is anticipated by May 2030 meaningPolar Starwill remain active until age 55 or later.\nAmong the work scheduled during this period is a refurbishment in the two remaining zones of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems refurbishments. These zones will be refurbished with ventilation trunks, fans, and heaters to improve air circulation and maintain a comfortable living environment for the ship’s crew during extended deployments. The gyro repeater recapitalization will ensure that these critical pieces of navigation equipment are updated to modern standards, enabling safe navigation of the cutter.  Ancillary pumps and motors are also targeted for recapitalization through the replacement of critical main propulsion and auxiliary systems with modern supportable units.\nIn addition, personnel from the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore will be on site this summer, recapitalizing the sewage pumps and tank level indicators to ensure the crew can successfully monitor and manage sewage capacity while the cutter is executing its missions in ice.\nKenneth King, ISVS program manager, said “This phase represents a significant milestone for bothPolar Starand the ISVS program, as our dedicated professionals ensurePolar Starmeets its multifaceted missions in the polar regions until the arrival of the polar security cutter fleet.”\nLast year’s effort targeted three systems aboard the vessel, including starting the refurbishment/ overhaul of the ventilation trunks, fans, and heaters that supply berthing areas of the ship. All the boiler support systems were also recapitalized/redesigned, including the electrical control station that is used to operate them. A complete recapitalization/redesign of the flooding alarm system also occurred from bow to stern to monitor machinery spaces for flooding.\nIn 2023, the program focused on improvements to shipboard equipment and numerous vital system upgrades for fire detection, communications, and monitoring water quality. Each year they also completed annual maintenance for the vessel.\nPolar Starrecently completed a 128-day deployment to Antarctica in support of Operation Deep Freeze 2025, the annual joint military logistics mission. This year’s deployment markedPolar Star’s 28th voyage to Antarctica in support of the joint military service mission to resupply and maintain the United States Antarctic Stations."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "While recognizing the Trump administration softened the financial impact of its port fees on Chinese-built shipping for many carriers, the shipping industry was quick to respond raising serious concerns after the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office released the structure of the fees. Like the Chinese, the shipping industry asserts that the fees will do little to support the resurgence of U.S. shipbuilding while instead penalizing the U.S. economy and consumers.\nThe USTR outlined sweeping fees with the costliest targeted at Chinese carriers and while reducing the dollar amounts would also charge all carriers as Chinese-built ships arrive or offload containers. The surprise came with a fee on each vehicle landed from all foreign-built ships, which the World Shipping Council points out encompasses nearly every vehicle carrier in the world. The shipping industry lobbying group calls the fee on car carriers an “arbitrary action” that will slow U.S. economic growth and raise auto prices while doing little to encourage U.S. maritime investment.\n“We urge the U.S. to respect facts and multilateral rules and immediately stop its wrong practices,” said Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He said China believes the fees will “disrupt the stability of the global supply chain, and increase inflationary pressure in the U.S., but “ultimately fail to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry.” China highlights the decline of the U.S. shipbuilding industry began in the 1970s.\nTrump administration officials were quick to defend the president’s policy and tout the benefits. In anop-edin the Washington Examiner, Transportation Secretary Sean Duff writes, “The inauguration of a new Trump-era in maritime dominance is a fundamental feature of the golden age of transportation.”\nThe World Shipping Council while saving it supports the efforts to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding sector, says “the fee regime announced by USTR is a step in the wrong direction as it will raise prices for consumers, weaken U.S. trade, and do little to revitalize the U.S. maritime industry.”\nJoe Kramek, President and CEO of the World Shipping Council, points to serious problems with the structure saying the “backward-looking penalties” would disrupt investment, and risk harming American exporters. Basing the fees on net tonnage, the WSC contends “disproportionately penalizes larger, more efficient vessels that deliver essential goods, including components used in U.S. production lines.”\nThe WSC also flags “significant legal concerns,” noting that the proposed fees appear to extend beyond the authority granted under U.S. trade law.\n“The WSC is urging the administration to reconsider this counterproductive measure, which risks harming U.S. consumers, manufacturers, and farmers without delivering meaningful progress toward revitalizing the U.S. maritime industry,” the group writes in its statement. It instead calls for steps such as targeted investment incentives, infrastructure improvements, and streamlined regulatory processes to strengthen the U.S. maritime sector.\nChina has launched a public relations effort against the U.S. tariffs and highlights that it is taking the lead in lobbying other countries to resist Trump’s tariffs. Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned of unilateral bullying and protectionism in a speech delivered on Thursday hours before the port tariff regime was unveiled. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Vietnam and Cambodia urging opposing unilateral bullying.\nNext week, China is planning Reuters reports informal discussions at the UN Security Council. Reuters says China will accuse the U.S. of bullying."

        "content": "According to reports in the Finnish media, the country’s Rauma Marine Constructions shipyard is in negotiations with the United States to build a series of new medium icebreakers. A week ago, the USCGpublisheda Request for Information for what were termed small icebreakers (370 feet in length) seeking shipyards that could deliver within three years of a contract award.\nFinnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomatbroke the newson Friday, April 18, saying it had confirmed the negotiations with three unnamed sources. Yle News has alsopicked up the storyciting discussions in March between Finnish President Alexander Stubb and President Donald Trump. The newspaper reports just over a week ago Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen discussed the matter with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nAccording to the report, the Rauma shipyard would build up to five medium-sized icebreakers, with the order valued at around €2.5 billion ($2.85 million). Helsingin Sanomat says that exploratory discussions are also underway regarding three larger vessels.\nRauma, located in southwest Finland on the Gulf of Bothnia, highlights on its website that three multi-purpose icebreakers were constructed in Rauma between 1993 and 1998 at the former Aker Finnyards and have been serviced at Rauma Marine. The yard also has experience with ice-strengthened hulls including for the ferryAurora Botniabuilt in 2021.\nThe yard has been building ferries, including for Tasmania, and recently completed the hull for the first of four multi-role corvettes for the Finnish Navy. The first vessel is due to launch this spring and the second has started construction with the yard highlighted the vessels will be able to “operate in icy conditions.” The yard built a new enclosed construction hall for this project and has been positioning itself for expected orders to replace existing icebreakers in Scandinavia.\nRMC, which was founded in 2014, is entirely Finnish-owned. It reports it currently has orders till 2028 valued at over one billion euros ($1.14 billion) as of October 2024.\nYle cautions in its report that the negotiations do not guarantee a deal. It says the U.S. Coast Guard has approached several shipyards around the world to assess their capacity to deliver icebreakers within 36 months. However, it also quotes Foreign Minister Valtonen who said after meeting Rubio, \"We will likely have concrete news fairly soon.\"\nA deal would be in keeping with the 2024 agreement between the United States, Canada, and Finland tojointly develop icebreakers. Canadian shipbuilder Davie was reported to be a driving force behind the agreement. Davie in 2023 acquired Helsinki Shipyard, which it was highlighted has built more than 50 percent of the global icebreakers. The Helsinki Shipyard was scheduled to build a new icebreaker for Russia, but the deal was blocked after the start of the war in Ukraine and that contributed to the financial collapse of the yard."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe Canadian Coast Guard confirmed that a few tar balls have been recovered in the area near where theMSC Baltic IIIcontainership stranded two months ago in Newfoundland. While testing is still ongoing, the Canadian Coast Guard told the local media that it is almost certain the oil came from the vessel but they do not believe there is a consistent leak from the fuel tanks.\nThe first of the tar balls, which alternately are being described as the size of a tennis or golf ball, was found during a routine search on April 11 of the nearby beach, and two more were found the following day. Media reports indicate a total of six or seven of the tar balls have now been recovered and they were sent to a lab for testing. The Coast Guard suspects they are heavy fuel possibly washed from the ship during some of the heavy weather in the bay where the ship grounded.\nAn ROV was used to survey the hull on April 13, and it also confirmed that there was no consistent fuel leak from the vessel. The salvage effort had previously reported multiple cracks in the hull and water in the engine room and holds of the containership. The Coast Guard also says that no oil has been seen in the water or elsewhere in the bay so far.\n\n\nTar balls are being analyzed, but the Coast Guard thinks they are fuel washed from the ship during heavy weather\n\nA subsequent survey of the vessel has lowered the estimate to approximately 1600 metric tons of heavy fuel and marine gas oil aboard theMSC Baltic III. The salvage company hired by the owners placed frac tanks on the deck of the vessel and in late March began an effort to pump the fuel from the vessel. However, it is a slow process due to the time required to heat and pump the fuel.\nThe current process calls for pumping the fuel into the temporary tanks on deck and when they are full they will be pumped into tanks on a barge alongside. Once filled, the tanks are too heavy to lift onto the barge. The Coast Guard explains this process is being used because the weather makes it difficult to keep a barge alongside the ship doe extended periods.\nAs of early April, the Coast Guard reported that 184 cubic meters of fuel had been pumped into the frac tanks. In an interview yesterday, April 17, with the local newspaper The Telegram, the Coast Guard said no fuel has been transferred off the vessel so far. The process continues to move slowly due to weather conditions in the area.\nInitial salvage efforts in March removed from the vessel eight containers loaded with polymeric beads, which are considered dangerous goods. There were approximately 470 containers aboard when the vessel stranded on February 15. However, MSC reported approximately half were empties. The damage to the hull of the vessel makes it impossible at this time to consider refloating the ship.\nThe Canadian Coast Guard highlights that the country works under a “polluter pays” principle. The Coast Guard is overseeing the salvage effort which is being conducted by T&T Salvage hired by MSC. The vessel’s owners and its insurance will be responsible for all the costs of the salvage operation."

        "content": "The diplomatic dispute brewing between Algeria and France has impacted a potential investment by the CMA CGM in the Algerian port sector. The French ship[ping company was reported to be negotiating a concession for the port of Oran through its subsidiary CMA Terminals, but the deal has been on hold as tensions rise between the two countries.\nEarly this week, the CEO of CMA CGM Rodolphe Saadé was scheduled to visit Algeria for a business trip. However, the visit was reportedly postponed as relations between Algeria and France further deteriorated this week. According to local media reports, Rodolphe Saadé was to be received by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune to finalize a port investment deal, which has been under negotiations for nearly a year.\nThe diplomatic incident emerged as Algeria protested after one of its consular staff was arrested in France. The indictment of the official was over suspicion of involvement in the kidnapping of an Algerian government critic in Paris in April 2024. This has seen the two countries expel diplomats from both sides in a tit-for-tat move.\nThe diplomatic dispute also appears to have taken an economic dimension. The Algerian Economic Renewal Council (CREA), the country’s largest business organization, canceled its planned visit to France next month, where it was to hold a meeting with the French employers’ association (MEDEF). CREA accused French authorities of blocking investments in Algeria.\n“The cancellation of the trip follows measures taken by French authorities, who strongly pressured a French maritime transport company to abandon its trip to Algeria to finalize an investment project,” said CREA. With the ongoing tension between Algeria and France, and Saadé’s visit on hold, the negotiations for the port concession are expected to be delayed.\nCMA CGM is already present in nine Algerian ports including Algiers, Annaba, Béjaïa, Skikda, and Ghazaouet. The interest in Oran is because of the port’s strategic location in the Western Mediterranean and its proximity to Europe. CMA CGM is believed to be considering a feeder shipping line between Marseille and Oran, to be operated by its subsidiary, La Méridionale.\n\nTop photo byHabib Kaki--CC BY 3.0"

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Scotland is largely operating blind in the management of its marine resources according to new research published this week as part of a project designed to create a better understanding of the exposure of whales, dolphins, and seals to coastal shipping. It emerged the researchers report that over half of vessels operating in the country’s coastal waters are “invisible” to standard maritime tracking systems.\nA team of researchers at Scottish Heriot-Watt University carried out a study that waspublished this weekwhich is sounding the alarm that the country is navigating blind in as far as understanding the potential adverse impacts of vessels crisscrossing its coastal waters is concerned. The study asserts that only 43 percent of vessels within a 10-kilometer radius of the Scottish coast broadcast an Automatic Identification System (AIS) signal, the standard global tool to monitor ship movements.\nSmaller vessels, such as fishing boats under 15 meters, recreational craft, and jet skis, accounted for much of the missing data. Though they are not legally required to carry AIS, the vessels have the option of voluntarily installing and broadcasting data.\nConsidering that Scottish coast waters are getting busier, the studypublished in the academic journalMarine Policy contends that lack of visibility poses significant risks to marine life, safety, and sustainable ocean management. This is because governments, conservation bodies, and researchers mainly depend on AIS data to model vessel-related impacts such as underwater noise pollution, whale and dolphin collision risk, anchor damage to the seabed, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate impact. Scotland’s coasts are a vital habitat for species like bottlenose dolphins, minke whales, and orcas.\n“With an improved understanding of the activities and movement of different types of vessels, marine planners and policymakers could tailor regulations to maximize their potential effectiveness,” said Lauren McWhinnie, one of the study’s authors. She adds that the wider maritime sector could further benefit through improved safety and awareness.\nThe study seeks to hold Scottish authorities accountable for assuming that they can rely on AIS to know what is happening in coastal seas. After analyzing over 1,800 hours of land and sea surveys conducted between 2019 and 2024 covering nine of Scotland’s 11 marine regions, the glaring fact is that a majority of vessels operate untracked with over 75 percent of vessel activity going unrecorded in some areas.\nIn the Outer Hebrides region, for instance, only 20 percent of vessels were transmitting AIS data despite the area being a hotspot for ecotourism, fishing, and aquaculture. The Orkney Islands region showed a higher rate, with 58 percent of vessels broadcasting.\nThe researchers are pushing authorities to take proactive actions in ensuring all types of vessels operating in the country’s waters, including smaller vessels, broadcast their position using AIS to effectively balance tourism and other vessel-based activities with local sustainability and environmental objectives."

Reflecting monitoring by UKMTO in Dubai, the main threat in the area now appears to come from low-level Somali-based pirates.\nMy friend@Dinlas3found the coordination of the Israeli-made ELM-2084 3D AESA Multi-Mission Radar (MMR) with Multi-Beam Operation near the UAE's Bosaso Air Base, northeast Somalia, also known as Puntland.???? 11°16'16.5\"N 49°06'28.3\"Ehttps://t.co/XvshvTmUxnpic.twitter.com/mFRPplQzIO\nThe EL/M-2084 emplacement at Bosaso, visible in Google Earth (@OSINTWarfare)\nThe EL/M-2084 is a particularly effective radar, as noted by its export success with ‘front line’ nations such as Azerbaijan, Finland, and India. Used at longer ranges for air surveillance, at shorter ranges it can be used for acquisition purposes, tied into air defense systems such as Iron Dome.\nEL/M-2084 surveillance coverage of the Gulf of Aden (Google Earth/CJRC)\nBosaso is one of a string of Emirati light-footprint bases which the UAE maintains to cover the Gulf of Aden and approaches to the Red Sea. The presence of Emirati bases at Bosaso and at Hadibo airport on the island of Socotra is de facto acknowledged by the respective host governments.  The status of recently-constructed airfields and associated possible surveillance facilities on the islands of Perim, at the southern entrance to the Red Sea and at Abd Al Kuri, is more contested.\nThe UAE has not formally acknowledged its military presence at any of these facilities, nor for any in North Africa. Whilst a single EL/M-2084 radar at Bosaso is effective enough on its own, if it were networked with other such systems on Perim and on Abd Al Kuri, the surveillance coverage would intersect and overlap, providing corroboration and triangulation of targets detected, and hence greater precision. However, even the best surveillance on its own is of limited value, unless linked in with systems which can respond, and there is no evidence of active air defense systems being positioned to cover these areas."

The new model appears to be more complete than the previous prototype, which was first displayed in at-sea testing in 2023.\nOn April 9, Vice Admiral Omachi Katsushi, Commander of the Self Defense Fleet (COMSDFLT), visited JSAsukafor an inspection. The vessel belongs to Japan's Fleet Research and Development Command (FRDC) and the railgun is under development at the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA).

Early work focused on projectile flight stability and the gun's rapid fire performance - a hurdle for railguns, which generate enormous forces in operation and tend to wear out their \"barrels.\"\nPrevious illustrations of Japan's railgun testing program suggest that at least one projectile could be an antiaircraft fragmentation round, not a solid slug as envisioned by the American R&D program.\n???pic.twitter.com/u5g7A31eEi\nThe U.S. Navy canceled its unclassified railgun work in 2021, citing technical problems; the barrel tended to fail after one to two dozen shots, according to Defense News. It is unknown whether aspects of the $500 million program continued under classified status after cancellation, not uncommon for American defense R&D. Publicly, though, the service has shifted its focus to high-powersolid state laser technologyfor its foray into energy-based weapons. After 10 years of R&D, some U.S. Navy leaders have expressed frustration andregretat the lack of progress with a satisfactory laser platform.\n\nThe U.S. Navy reached the 1,000-shot mark with its railgun R&D program in 2012 (Video courtesy USN, 2012)\nEnergy-driven weapons like lasers and railguns promise a lower-cost, larger-magazine alternative to guided missiles. Future railgun applications include point defense to counter drones, missiles and small craft - an expensive task for missiles, as highlighted by the Red Sea conflict.\nDespite their durability issues, railguns have distinct advantages. Unlike line-of-sight lasers, railguns shoot a solid projectile with a cannon-like trajectory, so they can be used to hit targets beyond the curve of the horizon. Railguns are not impeded by low-visibility conditions, which can interfere with laser beams and reduce their effective range; lasers also have a more technically demanding requirement for precision tracking, as they have to focus the beam on the moving target for a longer time period in order to burn through it."

In addition to its natural riches, the area is home to historic WWII wrecks from the Battle of Midway, includingYorktown. The research effort is focused on areas of interest in waters deeper than 200 meters, where ROVs are essential for access.\nCommissioned in 1937,Yorktownhad a distinguished combat history. She began her first Pacific patrol just months after Pearl Harbor and saw immediate action in the Marshall Islands and the Gilberts. She played a key role in the Battle of the Coral Sea, destroying the Japanese carrierShohoand damaging the carrierShikaku. The action prevented a Japanese invasion force from reaching Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, slowing Japan's advance in the South Pacific.\nIn early June 1942,Yorktownhelped lead the defense of Midway, her bombers destroying carrierSoryuearly in the battle. Yorktown sustained multiple bomb and torpedo hits, and after taking on a heavy list, her commander ordered abandon ship. She did not sink, however, and a salvage crew initially returned to try and right her for a tow back to Pearl Harbor - but a Japanese submarine attack on June 6 damaged her further, and her list increased. She slipped below the next morning.\n\n\nExterior of USS Yorktown's hull, April 2025 (NOAA)\nYorktown'swreck site was rediscovered by Robert Ballard in 1998, and the NOAA mission returned in April for a closer look at the ship - including some daring interior footage, requiring precise piloting to keep the ROV safely free of entanglements in close quarters. Entering the number three elevator shaft and looking forward, the ROV crew spotted a vehicle located forward on the starboard side of the hangar deck. It had a square back, curved fenders and a now-shredded soft top.\nNOAA's team surmised that the car could be Adm. Frank Fletcher's flag vehicle, since USSYorktownwas his flagship. This would be consistent with a flash of chrome on the bumper and on one visible fender. Plenty of four-wheel-drive jeeps were carried aboardYorktownand other Navy carriers in the Pacific theater, either as cargo for troops or for use as aircraft tugs - but this particular vehicle's chrome trim showed a level of flair not found on a typical GI-issue jeep.\nThe vehicle's true identity remains to be confirmed, and NOAA has asked for the public's help in confirming whether it may indeed have belonged to Adm. Fletcher. On further review, NOAA believes it to be a1940-41 Ford Super Deluxe \"Woody,\"a civilian car with distinctive wood body and a unique combination of trim on the fenders (below). Such a car would be a likelier find on a country estate than on the deck of a carrier at sea, and would have been among thelast cohortof mass-market vehicles that Ford produced before switching fully to wartime production.\nThe vehicle's half-buried fender can just be made out in footage taken from outside the hangar (NOAA)"

        "content": "China is pushing back hard on the White House's proposal for port fees on Chinese tonnage, which would make it much more expensive for specific classes of vessel to call in the U.S. The fees would make American port calls uneconomical for Chinese owners and operators, who would face charges that would peak at $140 per net ton per visit to the United States.\n\"The US measures fully expose the unilateralist and protectionist nature of its policies,\" said China's commerce ministry in a statement Friday. \"They seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, disrupt the stability of the global supply and production chain, violate World Trade Organization rules, and undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system and international economic and trade order.\"\nThe China Shipowners' Association (CSA) joined in, urging the U.S. to stop all \"discriminatory measures\" and abide by global trade rules. The association also rejected USTR's accusations of unfair competition.\nChinese ownership is not the only target of the fee structure; it is primarily aimed at Chinese shipbuilders, and any Chinese-built ship is subject to charges. If not owned by Chinese interests, any laden Chinese-built ship would be charged $50 per net ton per visit to the U.S. - or, for container ships, $120 per import container discharged (if a higher dollar value). Compared to USTR's previous proposal, this is relatively affordable, and has been well-received in some corners of the liner industry. And with a new exemption for vessels on a ballast voyage, Chinese-built tankers, LNG carriers, offshore service vessels and bulkers may be able to escape the charge altogether when arriving empty in the U.S., as these vessel classes often do.\nThough these fees are much lower than initially proposed, the China Association of National Shipbuilding Industry (CANSI) hit back at the announcement of charges targeting its members' products, calling the USTR's proposal a trade rule violation and a threat to the development of international shipping.\nCar carriers built anywhere outside of the U.S. - whether in China, Korea, Japan or Europe - would also be subject to a flat charge of $150 per car equivalent unit of capacity, even when arriving empty. For a large car carrier arriving at an East Coast port, this implies an additional fee of more than $1 million for every visit. American exporters of roll-on/roll-off cargo would be affected, including U.S. OEMs like John Deere, Caterpillar, GM, Toyota and Mercedes, which all export vehicles from U.S. factories to the global market.\nVessels owned in the U.S. or enrolled in U.S. sealift subsidy programs are exempt from the fees, as are vessels on shortsea voyages."

        "content": "The Trump administration's steep tariffs on Chinese goods have prompted carriers to deeply slash sailings on Asia-U.S. routes, a sign of plummeting bookings. So far, freight rate indexes have not collapsed, suggesting that the carriers are pulling out ships quickly enough that slot supply is dropping as fast or faster than the drop in demand.\nAccording to consultancy Sea-Intelligence, carriers are expecting to cut planned sailing capacity for Asia-East Coast cargo movement by 42 percent during the week of May 5-11. Though this is not the same as a year-over-year decline - it represents a cut from carriers' baseline plans - it is still unusual.\"That is an extreme amount of capacity. This is something you typically only see after Chinese New Year for example when everybody also goes on vacation out of China,\" said shipping expert Lars Jensen on a podcast Monday. \"So this is this is pretty extreme, to put it mildly.\"\nThe change appears to be driven by tariff calculations, as American importers attempt to sort out the best strategy for Chinese-sourced goods.\n\"The current political climate is extremely volatile and given that tariffs are being imposed and suspended on an almost daily basis, we assume that both the shipping lines and cargo owners are only adjusting their short-term supply chains for now and waiting for things to settle down (one way or another), before making longer-term network adjustments,\" said Alan Murphy, CEO, Sea-Intelligence in a statement April 16.\nTracking data firm SONAR suggests that ex-China container bookings are down 20 percent year-on-year for the month of April. Meanwhile, activity out of other regional manufacturing hubs - notably Vietnam - has been picking up as importers rush to get goods into the country ahead of the administration's new tariffs on all other trading partners.\nThe plummeting ex-China volume reflects the uncertainties of American importers, many of whom cannot afford a tariff of 145 percent on their goods. If Beijing and Washington can't reach a trade deal that lowers U.S. tariff barriers, \"millions\" of American marketing companies that rely on Chinese-sourced goods could go out of business - and may end up selling their brands to Chinese manufacturers, says Flexport's Ryan Peterson. Under this scenario, familiar Chinese-made goods would continue to arrive in the U.S. market, but with reduced overhead costs and full Chinese control.\nThousands, and then millions, of American small businesses, including many iconic brands, will go bankrupt this year if the tariff policies on China don’t change.????"

On April 7, Naval Sea Systems Command quietly issued notice that it plans to award Bollinger a sole-source contract to build one lead-ship LSM based on the U.S. Army'sGen. Frank S. Besson-class.\nThe ship that the U.S. Navy plans to buy is based on a revised version of the Army design that Bollinger-owned VT Halter built for the Israeli Navy. InIsraeli service, this variant makes 14 knots with a cargo of up to 2,000 tonnes in deep-draft pier-to-pier mode, with a lesser payload for beaching operations.

In U.S. Army service, the ramp facilitates drive-through ro/ro cargo transloading for the complex Joint Logistics Over The Shore(JLOTS)transfer system.\nUnless it is to be heavily modified, the IDF's Besson variant does not have a suite of high-end air defense or surface warfare weaponry. The long Navy-Marine Corps fight over the LSM's fate hinged on whether there would be a few highly survivable and very expensive hulls - the Navy's preference - or whether there would be a large number of less expensive ships built to a less stringent standard, as the Marine Corps demanded. The Besson-class appears to land further towards the Marine Corps' version: it is serviceable enough to be the primary landing and logistics ship for the U.S. Army, and for the Israeli Navy, but it is not an exquisite naval weapons platform (unless up-armed).\nAs first reported by USNI, NAVSEA is also buying the technical data package for the Damen LST 100, a popular landing ship design of comparable size and specifications - but equipped with an enclosed foredeck and an aft helideck.

By the time lifeboats from the UK’s RNLI reached the vessel, the ship reported its crew of 28 was all accounted for and there were no injuries. The fire had been contained to one deck and the onboard fire suppression system had been used. The vessel however was left drifting with rescue vessels standing by while Grimaldi made arrangements for the ship.\nLater that same day, a second fire was reported and unlike in the morning, the crew was not able to contain it. It is unclear if it was a reflash from the first fire or a new incident, but the vessel was abandoned and would burn for days. It was towed into Antwerp on February 24 after the fire was extinguished.\nBuilt in 2000, the Malta-registered 26,000 dwt ship is a Conro, a unique combination of containership and RoRo, favored by Grimaldi.

        "content": "\nWith feeder shipping market showing significant growth opportunities, Saudi Arabia is projected to capture a larger share of the business by 2030. This analysis is contained in a new report by the management consultancy firm Arthur D. Little, which reveals emerging opportunities in the feeder shipping segment. The sector accounts for the short sea, last-leg or regional journeys, which use small-size feeder vessels (with less than 3,000 TEU capacity).\nDue to factors such as location and port investments, regions such as the Middle East are poised to lead in feeder shipping. With the feeder market projected to reach $451 billion in revenue by 2030, the Middle East region will represent a significant portion of this surge. Currently, the feeder market in the Middle East, East Africa, Turkey and South Asia is worth $8 billion.\nThe report suggests that Saudi Arabia is positioned to benefit, thanks to government policies aimed at diversifying the economy. Saudi Arabia is positioned to capture up to 45 percent of Red Sea and 35 percent of Gulf feeder trade, as the regional container volumes are expected to reach 41 million TEU by 2030.\nThis has seen Saudi Arabia invest in a new shipping line, Folk Maritime. The company, owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), targets feeder shipping in the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf regions. Last month, the shipping firm celebrated acquisition of its second container ship, MV Folk Jazan. Built in 2008, the vessel has capacity for 2,015 TEUs. The vessel will be operating out of Jeddah Islamic port and on the company’s routes across the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf.\n“Saudi Arabia sits at the intersection of macroeconomic shifts in global trade, regional port infrastructure growth, and heightened investor appetite for logistics assets. Its ability to combine geographic proximity to high-growth corridors with government-backed investment strategies creates a uniquely scalable feeder shipping environment that few markets can match,” said Paolo Carlomagno, Partner at Arthur D. Little."

The monitoring operation ReCAAP has been raising the concern and now reports two additional vessels were boarded on Sunday and Monday after a two-week lull.\nThe latest incidents include a feeder containership that MSC recently placed on a new route to serve the Asian region. ReCAAP lists a report of a boarding in the early morning hours on Sunday, April 20, aboard the MSC Tara III (33,232 dwt / 3,300 TEU). The vessel was underway when three perpetrators were spotted at about 0500. The vessel was approximately 5.4 nautical miles off Pulau Cula, in the eastbound traffic separation lane of the Singapore Strait.\nThe master raised a general alarm and mustered the crew after the three individuals were seen on the upper deck of the vessel.

The crew was safe and nothing was taken but it marked the first incident reported since April 7.\nLess than 24 hours later a Panama-flagged tanker, Aquaris (106,500 dwt) also spotted boarders in the same general position. She was 2.5 nautical miles off Pulau Cula also in the eastbound lane. Again, three individuals were seen but this time with knives and entering the engine control room. The crew was not injured and nothing was stolen but it was the fifth incident in April.\nEarlier in April, the product tanker Hafnia Hong Kong reported three perpetrators. In that instance, an air compressor and four padlocks were reported stolen. Also in recent incidents, the containership SITC Yuncheng reported lashing gear stolen and the containership Kota Halus said a portable welding machine was missing.\nSince the beginning of the year, ReCAAP has listed a total of 41 incidents on vessels in or near the straits of Singapore and Malacca. Across the broader Southeast Asia region, ReCAAP has only received 49 reports so far in 2025.\nAt the end of the first quarter, ReCAAP highlighted that it had received reports of 35 incidents that occurred to ships while underway in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. By comparison, it reported that there were 11 reports in the first quarter of 2024.\nReCAAP ISC has continued to urge the littoral States to increase patrols/surveillance in their respective waters. It also calls for a prompt response to incidents reported by ships, and strengthening coordination, and promoting information sharing on incidents and criminal groups involved to arrest the perpetrators. For vessels, it is urging greater caution and lookouts as the robbery spree continues.\nThe International Maritime Bureau, which is a specialized department of the International Chamber of Commerce, in its first quarter report, warned that the Southeast Asia region had become the hot spot for piracy.

The cruise ship, which will be the largest for Disney, will be the company’s first ship based year-round in Asia. It comes as the line in proceeding with a large expansion program.\nWith theDisney Adventure, the cruise line becomes only the third in the world to have a cruise ship exceeding 200,000 gross tons. While it will be a one-off, it is also the fourth by class in size following Royal Caribbean International’s Icon and Oasis classes, and MSC Cruises’ World Class. Both Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line recently ordered similar ultra-large cruise ships to be built at Fincantieri for delivery late in this decade and in the 2030s.\n\n\nRendering of the completed cruise ship due to enter service December 2025 (DCL)\n\nDisney acquired the incomplete cruise ship in November 2022 for a rumored €40 million from the bankrupt MV Werften Shipyard with an agreement to complete the construction in Germany. Construction of the ship had begun in 2018 with steel cutting at yards in both Wismar and Rostock and assembly started later that year in Rostock. The midship section, which is 216 meters (708 feet) was built in Rostock and became the largest section to be floated and transferred when it was moved to Wismar in November 2019. The yard in Wismar was assembling the ship and reached approximately 80 percent completion when MV Werften filed for bankruptcy in January 2022 along with its parent company Genting Hong Kong and the group’s Dream Cruise Line.\nGenting Hong Kong had planned the ship as the first of two of the world’s largest cruise ships designed for the Asian market. She was namedGlobal Dreamand was destined to have a capacity of 9,500 passengers and 2,000 crew. Work had started on the blocks for the second cruise ship, but the incomplete blocks were sold for scrap after the bankruptcy.\nMeyer Werft is overseeing the completion of the cruise ship which remained in Wismar at the shipyard which was sold to ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. Disney kept some of the original planned features for the cruise ship, including the longest rollercoaster at sea, but has redesigned the ship for the brand’s theming and removing elements such as a large casino. Passenger capacity was also reduced to approximately 6,700. The hull has been repainted removing the hull art applied by Dream Cruises with the traditional black hull and yellow stripping of Disney Cruise Line and the caricature of Mickey Mouse in the bow.\n\n\n\nThe doors to the building hall in Wismar had been opened and preparations began earlier last week for the float out. Shortly after 900 local time on Saturday, April 19, tugs began pulling the massive 342-meter (1,122-foot) hull from the building hall. Wismar suspended traffic in the Old Harbor during the maneuver as spectators watched the event. The ship is now at the fitting out dock to receive its funnels, lifeboats, and other elements. Sea trials will commence this summer.\nDisney has entered into a five-year agreement with the Singapore Tourism Board to base theDisney Adventureyear-round in Singapore operating short cruises. It is due to start service on December 15, offering cruises to nowhere ranging between 3, 4, and 5 nights.\n\n\nDisney celebrates the float out of its new ships with fireworks and characters (DCL)\n\nIt is the newest addition to the brand which was started in 1998 with two cruise ships. Disney recently introduced its sixth cruise ship and is building two more of the Wish class at Meyer Werft in Germany and its Japanese partner has also ordered a cruise ship to be linked to the Tokyo Disney Resort. Disney has also contracted with Meyer Werft for three additional cruise ships. In January 2025, the cruise line reported it would introduce a new class of ships at approximately 100,000 gross tons with accommodations for approximately 3,000 passengers in each ship.\nThe current plan calls for Disney to have 13 cruise ships by 2031. Having added nine cruise ships in less than a decade, the cruise line will have capacity for nearly 50,000 passengers on its ships when the current expansion is completed."

And Austal is working with L3Harris on a series of workboat-based unmanned vessels for the \"Overlord\" series.\nBlue Water's three founders bring expertise in naval operations, engineering and robotics to this growing field. Hamilton is a former Navy officer, former executive at Kiva (now Amazon's robotics division), and former founder of 6 River Systems, a warehouse-tech company. 6 River designed and successfully fielded an autonomous mobile cart system - dubbed Chuck - that helps human workers pick warehouse orders more quickly than they could on their own.\nCTO Austin Miller is an MIT-educated roboticist and former executive with iRobot, maker of the Roomba household cleaning robot and other devices. CSO Austin Gray is a former Navy intelligence officer with recent experience in Ukraine's UAV manufacturing industry.\nIn a recent social media post, Gray said that the Navy is moving now on unmanned systems, but the service is still going \"at their own speed.\" A recommended $250 million budget shift to test unmanned systems has been approved, but it won't be available for real-world use for a few more years.\n\"If a big company (with its own bureaucracy) wanted to re-program $250M for a new type of technology, they could probably make this happen in a few weeks or months, once they made the decision. The Navy's $250M investment will take until 2027 to show up,\" he said."

The shutdown affected the public-facing website beginning April 18. The incident has not affected the company's physical operations, Wan Hai said, and no breaches of internal data have been discovered.\nAs of Monday, Wan Hai's main website was back up and visible to the public - with an added anti-DDOS identity verification step. Wan Hai said in a statement that the appropriate authorities have been informed of the attack.\nWan Hai is just the latest in a long string of maritime businesses to encounter cyber disruption, most related to ransomware. Maersk suffered what may have been the worst cyber incident in the sector in 2017, when a Russia-linked malware virustook downbusiness systems at its global APM Terminals division for days. This cut Maersk's worldwide shipping volume by an estimated 20 percent overnight; the recovery effort took months, and the overall impact cost Maersk at least $300 million in business disruption, network reconstruction and client reimbursement costs.\nUnlike the common hack-for-profit scams seen in shipping, the Maersk/APM incident was an engineered nation-state attack on a specific target, with Western businesses suffering collateral damage. Most shipping companies encounter more benign ransomware schemes, perpetrated by financially-motivated hackers who can be paid to restore access."

        "content": "\nFormer FESCO co-owner and Board Chairman Andrei Severilov has opened a new venture targeting the West African freight market.\nLast week, Russian company JSC A7 Holding - associated with Severilov - registered a new freight transportation entity. According to Interfax news, the newly-formed A7 African Cargo Lines LLC (A7 ACL) was launched on April 17, with a charter capital of $122,000. The company’s primary activity is listed as railway freight transportation.\nInterfax reports that the new line is incorporated in the United States, and is owned by two U.S. business entities: A7 Holding LLC (registered in Delaware) and A7 Infrastructure LLC (registered in Missouri). These entities are registered to corporate agents, and their relationship to A7 ACL could not be immediately confirmed.\nSeverilov told Interfax that the company is keen on establishing a feeder shipping service between West Africa and Russia. “At the first stage, with the assistance of the Russian trade mission in Nigeria, we are implementing a project to establish a direct shipping line,” said Severilov.\nBy mid-June, the company wants to launch a new maritime route between Novorossiysk and Nigeria’s Lagos port. Two containerships will be chartered for the line’s inaugural route, each with a capacity of 700 TEU. There are future plans to expand maritime connections to Senegal’s Dakar port.\nSeverilov has extensive experience in the shipping sector, including a stint as the Board Chairman at top Russian container line FESCO. He also held a 23.8 percent stake in FESCO’s parent company, PJSC FESCO. However, Severilov had to leave the company after the Russian state nationalized FESCO in 2023, effectively transferring its ownership to the state nuclear power company Rosatom. The transfer followed the conviction of businessman Ziyavudin Magomedov on corruption charges; Magomedov was the founder of Summa Group, which held a large stake in FESCO.\nSeverilov announced he would re-enter the transport sector in September 2024. But even as Severilov’s freight company targets the Nigerian market, its entry comes while the Nigerian government is incentivizing local shipping companies to own their own vessels.\nLast week, the Minister of Blue Economy Adegboyega Oyetola, directed the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) to begin the disbursement of the Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund (CVFF). The fund was established back in 2003 with a goal of supporting Nigerian shipping companies to access subsidized credit for the acquisition of vessels. This is the first time the fund will be operationalized. As of last year, NIMASA reported that CVFF had accumulated over $360 million, as part of contributions made by the Nigerian shipping sector.\nEligible Nigerian shipping companies could access up to $25 million each at competitive interest rates. NIMASA has already issued a notice inviting applications through a select group of primary lending banks."

The agency had been under pressure to complete the report because of the destruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.\nThe ship strike that collapsed the Key Bridge killed six people in March 2024, and the replacement will cost billions. The National Transportation Safety Board has determined that the accident could have been prevented with adequate risk analysis and pier protection, and NTSB has called on 30 bridge owning authorities to conduct standard safety assessments on 68 at-risk bridge spans across the United States. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendysingled outMDTA, the Francis Scott Key Bridge's owner, and said that the state agency had still not completed an assessment of the nearby Chesapeake Bay Bridge - also on NTSB's list of vulnerable spans.\nThat review is now done, MDTA said Monday. The agency told NTSB that it spent $600,000 studying the vulnerability of the Bay Bridge's piers to a possible ship strike, and it has concluded that it needs to up-armor the pier bases. That would likely include more fenders and new dolphins, large rock-and-concrete islands that are massive enough to keep runaway ships away from the piers.\nShorter-term risk reduction strategies could include new communication protocols for vessel pilots, reduced vessel speeds, one-way transits, and new ways to manage vehicle traffic on the bridge spans. MDTA did not include tug escorts on the possibility list.\nThe budgeted cost of the refit program is in the range of $160 million, MDTA said - though it noted that this investment is voluntary, and that the Bay Bridge already meets legal standards for legacy spans (even if it does not meet the safety recommendations set by industry association AASHTO).\nThe Bay Bridge's twin spans are nearing their due date for replacement, so the infrastructure built for their protection now could be incorporated into a future bridge down the road, the agency's chief engineer told the Baltimore Banner earlier this year."

Last week saw a fresh round of sanctions by the U.S government, aimed at slowing Iranian oil exports to China. With these market barriers, Iran sees an opportunity in expanding bunker fuel services at Qeshm Island.\nAccording to a report by the state-controlled Fars news, the Iranian government wants to build four major refineries in Qeshm, each with a capacity of processing 140,000 barrels of oil per day. This hoped-for project is intended to increase the supply of bunker fuel and gasoline at the island’s terminals. No timelines were provided for the project.\nThe Salakh port, located to the south of the island, is already supplying 50,000 metric tons of bunker fuel to ships. The first phase of the bunkering terminal at the port came online back in 2017.\nWith the new refineries, the Iranian government said that the bunker capacity will increase to 750,000 metric tons per month. In addition, there is a long-term project to increase the Island’s storage capacity to 100 million barrels of oil.\nBased on the island’s strategic location in the Strait of Hormuz (a transit route for over 20 percent of the global trade), Iran believes that Qeshm is poised to capture a larger share of over $30 billion in bunkering revenues generated in the region. In a year, more than 50,000 ships operate within the Persian Gulf for trade and energy services. Iran hopes that a bunkering hub in Salakh port would be competitive with Fujairah, which is the top bunker spot in the Gulf region."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe revised, less stringent terms of the U.S. Trade Representative's fee plan for Chinese-built ships are an encouragement for China's shipbuilders, multiple shipping sources have told SCMP this week. Though the USTR's initial proposal dampened foreign owners' interest in buying Chinese-made tonnage in the first quarter, the recalibrated financial penalties and the full exclusion of many vessels in the new version gives China's shipbuilding yards reason for optimism - especially as the White House is now signaling its willingness to negotiate down its demands on trade.\nThe new, more detailed version of the USTR's proposed rule covers much less of the world fleet than the first version. Most importantly, it now exempts most non-Chinese vessels from the fee structure. Before, an owner with Chinese ships anywhere in its fleet would get billed for every U.S. port call, even if using its non-Chinese ships to call in the United States. Under the revised USTR plan, the owner can separate out its Chinese-built ships for use in overseas trade, use all its other ships for port calls in the U.S. market, and avoid any of the fees - while still buying and using Chinese tonnage.\nThe revision also contains broad exemptions. Most vessels arriving in ballast will not be charged, and all vessels smaller than a Panamax (55,000 dwt, 4,000 TEU for a boxship, or 80,000 dwt for a bulker) are fully exempt.\nFor Chinese ships that do get billed, the fees are also less onerous: they are now assessed once per visit to the U.S., not for each port call in a string, and only up to five times per ship per year. The charges are also calibrated by vessel size now, removing a disproportionate impact on smaller vessels.\n\"[It] is a big relief for Chinese shipbuilders, as it significantly alleviates clients’ concerns about placing orders,\" a senior analyst at a Chinese state shipping firm told SCMP, estimating that about 60 percent of China's current orderbook would not be subject to tariffs.\nThe relief comes just in time for China's yards, notably in the dry bulk segment. Bulker orders dropped by more than 90 percent in the first two months of the year, according to BIMCO. Top shipbroker Howe Robinson reports just 39 newbuild bulker contracts signed in the first quarter anywhere in the world, down from 213 the year before. Chinese yards received just 13 of these orders, according to Xinde.\nThe day after the USTR's revised plan was released, specialist yard China Merchants Industry Groupannounced plansto start building general-purpose bulk carriers and boxships through the purchase of an existing shipyard, Qingdao Yangfan Shipbuilding Co."

        "content": "An explosion and fire aboard the coastal cruise shipOcean Navigatorin October 2023 was likely caused by not following maintenance recommendations and infrequent changes of lube oil and oil filters concluded the National Transportation Safety Board. One crewmember was seriously injured in an explosion and fire in the engine room of the ship when one of its auxiliary engines failed and parts were ejected during an explosion followed by a fire.\nTheOcean Navigator, which was built in 2001 as a modern version of an American coastal cruise ship, was operating at the time for Hornblower’s American Queen Voyages and had just docked in Portland, Maine on its next to last scheduled cruise when theexplosion occurred. Earlier in the year, AQY announced it would be removing the ship and her sister ship from service at the conclusion of the Canadian cruise season.\nEngineers reported that the machinery was working properly as they navigated into the port and docked around 0630. There was a total of 210 people aboard, 128 passengers and 82 crewmembers. After shutting down the propulsion system, the third engineer and a motorman were assigned to troubleshoot a high exhaust temperature issue in the no. 1 auxiliary engine while the vessel was using its no. 2 auxiliary engine to provide electric power for the ship.\nThe third engineer reported smelling oil and found a small lube oil leak from a crankcase cover door on the running no. 2 auxiliary engine. He went to tighten a bolt, but before he could there was an explosion and fire along with low lube oil pressure and oil filter plugged alarms. Both the engineer's and motorman’s overalls were on fire with the motorman more seriously injured.\nNTSB commends the quick response of the crew in sealing the engine room by closing watertight doors, shutting off ventilation fans, closing dampers, and activating quick-closing fuel valves to effectively starve the fire of fuel and oxygen. They prevented the spread of the fire and the fire self self-extinguished.\nThe captain saw thick smoke coming from the funnel and immediately returned to the bridge. The passengers were mustered and evacuated without injury. Local fire crews responded but found the situation controlled.\n\n\nFire damage to the no. 2 auxiliary (NTSB report)\n\nThe subsequent investigation found that the no. 2 engine was damaged beyond repair. The engine block had cracked, and investigators found a 10-inch high and 16-inch wide hole and reported one of the connecting rods had been ejected. There was damage to the no. 1 auxiliary engine from the fire as well as the turbocharger, piping, cables, and electrical wires and lighting in the engine room. The NTSB reports the cost of the casualty at $2.4 million.\nThe NTSB investigators concluded that the engine failure was caused by debris in the engine’s lube oil system—possibly due to the crew exceeding manufacturer-recommended intervals for changing the lube oil and oil filter elements—which caused catastrophic mechanical damage to the engine and subsequent fire from the ignition of atomize lube oil released through the engine’s ruptured crankcase.\nThe crew had last changed the entire quantity of lube oil for the no. 2 auxiliary engine in September 2022—about 13 months before the engine failure—but the engine had operated more than 5,000 hours with this lube oil in the engine, five times longer than the manufacturer’s recommendation. Additionally, since the last change of the lube oil filter elements in May 2023, the engine had run over 3,000 hours. The engine manufacturer’s recommendation is to replace filter elements at every oil change or after the filter elements had been used for 1,000 hours.\n“Manufacturers provide maintenance recommendations and intervals (schedules) to ensure equipment operates safely, optimally, and reliably throughout its service life,” the NTSB writes in its report. “By regularly reviewing equipment manufacturer manuals and guidance, operators can ensure conformance with recommended maintenance plans and mitigate the risk of equipment malfunction or failure.”\nThe analysis of the lube oil in the no. 2 engine identified abnormally high levels of aluminum and iron. It had increased significantly since the last in-service sample was taken in September. There was also an increase in lead and tin.\nThe vessel was sold during the bankruptcy of American Queen Voyages and Hornblower. The subsequent survey for the repairs showed that the engine block, crankshaft, several main bearings, connecting rod bearings, and the no. 14 fuel injector were all damaged during the explosion and fire with the plunger of the no. 14 fuel injector broken off, pistons and pins and other components from the nos. 13 and 14 cylinders “totally destroyed.” They also observed “heavy local wear” in main bearings and signs of cavitation that were not typical and also suggested oil quality or other lube oil issues.\nNTSB concluded that debris in the system would have caused scratching or scoring of the inner layer of the bearings as the debris circulated. The wear would have permitted more lube oil to flow out the sides of the bearings, reducing pressure, and generating excessive heat. The lack of changing out the filter elements made the filter less effective or it could have clogged and a bypass value would have permitted more debris into the system.\nThese factors they believe contributed to the failures and catastrophic mechanical damage to the engine. The hot oil spewing out started the fire.\nRepairs were made to the ship and it returned to service under its new owners in April 2025. Thecomplete reportis available online."

        "content": "\nSouth Korea’s Hanwha Ocean is reported to be looking to leverage its long expertise in LNG carriers and its unique position through the ownership of a shipyard in Pennsylvania in response to the new U.S. Trade Representative’s fees for Chinese-built ships. Bloomberg quotes an executive from Hanwha highlighting its unique capabilities and the pending need for the first modern U.S.-built LNG carriers.\nWhile much of the attention on the USTR fee structure released last week has been on the aspects of Chinese-build ships, Chinese vessel operators, and the foreign companies operating Chinese-built ships, another key provision of the fee structure picks up an idea that had been circulating in Washington D.C. for years to require a portion of LNG exports to leave the U.S. on U.S.-built and operated vessels.\nThe U.S. emerged as the leading exporter of LNG in the past few years rivaling Qatar and Australia, in part driven by Europe’s need to replace Russian supplies of gas. The Trump administration has promised to accelerate the LNG market and already moved to license new projects and terminals.\n“To incentivize U.S.-built liquified natural gas (LNG) vessels, limited restrictions on transporting LNG via foreign vessels,” proposed USTR outlining its fee structure. “These restrictions will increase incrementally over 22 years,” notes the announcement.\nUSTR calls for introducing a requirement starting April 2029 that one percent of U.S. LNG exports must travel on U.S.-flagged and U.S.-operated vessels. Starting in 2031, it would step up to two percent, reaching seven percent by the 2040s, and ultimately 15 percent in 2047. USTR says it may direct the suspension of LNG export licenses if the percentages are not met.\nThe requirement for U.S. vessels calls for vessels built in the U.S. where all the major components of the hull or superstructure are manufactured in the U.S. as well as key components in propulsion, cargo handling, and alike. Many in the industry have called the USTR requirement unrealistic noting the lack of commercial shipbuilding capacity in the U.S. and the lack of experience specifically with LNG carriers.\nBloomberg is quoting Ryan Lynch, vice president of commercial shipping at Hanwha Shipping who says “as many as five to seven US-flagged, US-operated LNG carriers would be required before the end of the decade.”\nSouth Korea’s Hanwha Group entered the shipbuilding sector in 2023 when it acquired control of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) in an agreement with the South Korean government-controlled banks. Then in December 2024, it completed its $100 million acquisition of Philly Shipyard, highlighting its role in building commercial U.S. Jones Act ships as well as its work for MARAD.\nEarlier this year, building on DSME’s legacy, Hanwha Ocean highlighted it had become the first shipbuilder to deliver 200 LNG carriers. The vessel was theLebrethah, built by the company for SK Shipping, and which will be deployed and operated in Qatar Energy’s North Field Expansion Project.\nThe company reports it made history in 1995 by successfully delivering its first LNG carrier and 21 years later, in 2016, delivered its 100th LNG carrier. Over the next nine years, it built another 100 LNG carriers claiming a 57 percent market share. It noted that between 2022 and 2024 it received orders for 31 ships for the second Qatar project.\nHanwha, according to Bloomberg, is now positioning itself to share the Korean expertise with its Philly Shipyard. As such, it could become the first to build a modern U.S. LNG carrier."

An Iranian court is reported to have handed down stiff jail sentences in two cases today and hours later the semi-governmental news agency Fars reported two more vessels have been apprehended.\nAccording to the media reports, Iran claims that it has seized 4.5 million liters of smuggled diesel fuel alone this year. The country’s low price of diesel and gasoline is reported to encourage smuggling in the Persian Gulf region. Iran offers lower prices for the fuels than its neighboring Arab states.\nFars reports two vessels registered in Tanzania, which it names asSea RangerandSalama, were stopped today, April 22. The vessels were reported to be near the central district port city of Bushehr on the Persian Gulf.  A total of 25 “foreign crew” were reportedly detained and 1.5 million liters of diesel fuel seized. Both vessels were being directed back to the Bushehr Port where the media said the vessels were being handed over by the Iran Navy for “legal proceedings.”\nSeparately, Iranian media reported a court in the southern Iranian province of Hormozgan issued judgment today, April 22, on two other foreign crews. It said one of the unnamed vessels was caught with 4.25 million liters of smuggled fuel and that the captain and two “deputies” were each sentenced to five years in jail. Collectively a fine of $5.37 million was also ordered.\nThe second captain and his two top “deputies” were also sentenced to five years in jail for smuggling 1.7 million liters of fuel. They were ordered to pay a total of $3 million in fines. In both cases, Iran said the vessels would be released once the fines were paid.\nThe reports also highlight that on March 31, Iran confiscated two vessels,Star 1andVintage. They were stopped in the Persian Gulf with a total of 3 million liters of diesel fuel.\nIranian forces have previously said they increased the monitoring of vessel activity. They have vowed to crack down on fuel smuggling.\n"

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nContinuing the effort to apply maximum economic pressure on Iran, the U.S. Treasury through the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has taken steps to disrupt Iran’s liquified petroleum gas (LPG) business. It is part of the Trump administration’s ongoing campaign targeting all sectors of Iran’s oil industry with the latest sanctions placed on a U.S. described “LPG magnate” and a newly built Chinese LPG carrier.\nAccording to the U.S. statement, Seyed Asadoollah Emamjomeh, his corporate network, and his son Meisam Emamjomeh, have been responsible for shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian LPG and crude oil to foreign markets. This led the U.S. to describe the father as an LPG magnate.\n“Emamjomeh and his network sought to export thousands of shipments of LPG—including from the United States—to evade U.S. sanctions and generate revenue for Iran,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “The United States remains committed to holding accountable those who seek to provide the Iranian regime with the funding it needs to further its destabilizing activities in the region and around the world.”\nThe UAE-based company Pearl Petrochemical FZE, controlled by the father but passed to the son in October 2024, is linked to the newly built LPG carrierTinos I. The vessel built by China’s Jiangnan Shipyard was delivered in May 2024 and is registered in Panama. The 93, 000 cbm VLGC was touted as an advanced fourth-generation design. It is 230 meters (755 feet) in length with a service speed of 16.5 knots.\nAccording to the U.S. Treasury, the newly delivered vessel attempted in June 2024 to load LPG from the United States. The vessel was to take on the cargo in Houston and the U.S. reports it was to be sold to China. Treasury did not provide details but says the vessel failed to load the cargo.\nThe vessel has been added to the U.S.’s designated list of blocked entities along with Pearl Petrochemical which the U.S. says is the beneficial owner of the vessel. Emamjomeh the U.S. contends also owns or controls nine additional LPG companies in Iran, including, reportedly, one company with a monopoly on the National Iranian Gas Company’s LPG deliveries.\nFor more than a decade, the U.S. says the family has owned and operated an LPG sales, transport, and delivery network using multiple Irani and UAE-based companies. The U.S. says they have been responsible for shipping millions of dollars of Iranian LPG to foreign markets. One operation exported thousands of shipments of LPG from Iran to Pakistan.\nThe U.S. reports that LPG continues to be a major source of revenue for the Iranian regime. The announcement of today’s sanctions says the proceeds from the LPG exports are funding Iran’s nuclear and advanced conventional weapons programs, as well as regional proxy groups and partners such as Hizballah, the Houthis, and Hamas."

        "content": "\nGlobal trade volume and global economic growth will both be reduced if new U.S. tariff policies continue on their current course, according to the International Monetary Fund's latest World Economic Outlook forecast.\nCompared to its last update in January, the IMF has cut back its 2025 trade growth forecast by half, from an expected 3.2 percent down to 1.7 percent. It also pared back its economic growth forecast from 3.3 percent in 2024 to 2.8 percent in 2025 - a global slowdown, but not a recession. IMF predicts that the most affected OECD country will be the nation at the center of the tariff negotiations: the United States, which will see growth for 2025 reduced by half (from 1.8 percent down to 0.9 percent).\nHowever, the IMF's forecast assumes that the Trump administration holds course on its current tariff plans, including the \"reciprocal\" tariff list affecting most foreign trade partners. That prediction appears uncertain, and the White House has repeatedly changed its position on what the final bundle of tariffs should look like after all talks are completed.\nOn Tuesday, following Monday's sharp selloff in the U.S. markets, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a private meeting of JP Morgan investors that the growing trade war with China is \"unsustainable.\" Trump's 145 percent top tariff rate on Chinese goods is the steepest on any U.S. trading partner, and China has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 125 percent.\nBessent predicted that these tariff tensions would de-escalate in the \"very near future,\" even though formal talks with Beijing have not started. Immediately after his closed-door comments, public markets soared, and the Dow recovered Monday's losses by the close of trading Tuesday.\nSeparately, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that the administration is already reviewing 18 trade proposals, and there will be trade meetings with 34 other countries this week alone. She confirmed that as of yet, there have been no formal talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on tariffs.\n“We're going to be very nice [with China]. They're going to be very nice. And we'll see what happens,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"But ultimately, they have to make a deal because otherwise they're not going to be able to deal in the United States.\"\nTrump also suggested that he is not going to \"play hardball\" with China, despite his longstanding complaints that Chinese industrial policies have \"ripped off\" America.\nTrump's plan for one-on-one, nation-by-nation dealmaking has an additional challenge: China has threatened anyone who sits down to talk with the White House if the outcome is bad for Beijing.\n\"China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests,\" the nation's commerce ministry said in a statement. \"For one’s own temporary selfish interests, sacrificing the interests of others in exchange for so-called exemptions is like seeking the skin from a tiger. It will ultimately only fail on both ends and harm others without benefiting themselves.\""

        "content": "The Saverys family is pushing forward with its strategy to grow a shipping giant that will play a leadership role in the sustainable transition in the maritime sector. Just seven weeks after announcing its initial investment in dry bulk shipping company Golden Ocean, the Saverys’ CMB.TECH has agreed to acquire Golden Ocean in an all-stock deal that will create one of the largest listed maritime groups in terms of market capitalization, net asset value, and expected share liquidity.\nA year ago after completing the takeover of Euronav and the combination with CMB.TECH, Alexander Saverys outlined a strategy leveraging existing shipping to drive the group’s decarbonization initiatives. He is now calling the proposed merger with Golden Ocean “another great step forward” in building a diversified maritime group. The company, which currently has 162 vessels, will increase to more than 250 and operate in five key segments of the industry.\nCMB.TECH began its approach in March announcing it was acquiring a 40 percent stake in Golden Ocean from renowned investor John Fredriksen at a cost of nearly $1.2 billion. At the time, it said the share purchase would not trigger a mandatory takeover bid or similar offer, but since then it has continued to accumulate its position.\nUnder the terms announced after the market closed on April 22, the companies will merge with Golden Ocean shareholders receiving for each share .95 shares of CMB.TECH. They will hold 30 percent of the combined company with CMB.TECH holders retaining 70 percent. A terms sheet has been signed and they expect to complete the merger agreement in the second quarter of 2025. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.\n“The value of our fleet would reach more than $11 billion and, combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares, we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “Our focus on decarbonization is starting to generate meaningful long-term contracts, and the recent IMO decisions on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from shipping give us even more wind (and ammonia) in our sails.”\nGolden Ocean currently has 91 vessels with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13.7 million dwt. CMB.TECH’s dry bulk fleet currently includes 28 Newcastlemax and 20 Suezmax carriers\nPeder Simonsen, CEO of Golden Ocean, said it would be an opportunity to be part of a large diversified maritime group. He cited the complementary nature of the fleet and the strengths of the larger company. The deal is also being seen by analysts as a vote of confidence in the bulker sector at a time of market uncertainties."

The company reports it will be ready to ship the engine in October for installation in a gas carrier as other major companies including MAN and WindGD have also reported they were in the final stages of certification before shipping their first ammonia engines.\nThe company reports that the first Japanese-developed and manufactured commercial unit of a large, low-speed, two-stroke engine recently started co-firing operation with ammonia. It is being labeled the first full-scale commercial engine based on ammonia. J-ENG reports its first development is a large, low-speed, ammonia-fueled 2-stroke engine (50 cm cylinder bore).\nThe project was launched under the auspices of the “Green Innovation Fund Project: Next-generation Ship Development” project of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). Since May 2023, when J-ENG started the world's first ammonia co-firing operation of a large, low-speed, two-stroke engine in a test engine, the company reports it has obtained many results and knowledge. This includes insights into stable operation at high ammonia co-firing rates and safe handling of ammonia, through various test operations over about a year and a half.\nJ-ENG says it will conduct verification operations on the full-scale engine and plans to ship the engine in October of this year. The engine will be installed on an Ammonia-Fueled Medium Gas Carrier (AFMGC) and then demonstration operations of the vessel will be carried out. Concurrently, the company says it is also developing an ammonia-fueled engine with a cylinder bore of 60 cm for several promising follow-on projects.\nSeeking to be a first mover for next-generation fuel engines J-Engine says it has also decided to construct a new plant with the support of a subsidy project by the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism through the GX Economic Transition Bonds. The plant, which is scheduled for completion in 2028, will be used to expand the production of ammonia fuel engines (in the product mix with fuel oil engines) and promote the spread and expansion of zero-emission ships.\nTesting and demonstrations of the first ammonia-fueled vessels began in 2024. Japan’s NYK is at the forefront with a converted tug that previously ran on LNG and was rebuilt with an ammonia-fueled engine. DNV calculates that there currently are 33 vessels on order to be fueled by ammonia due for delivery by the end of this decade."

He has led the class organization for the past 14 years during a turbulent and transitional period in the maritime industry emerging as a key voice on decarbonization and a recognized influencer in the shipping industry.\nWiernicki, who holds a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering, was ranked by Lloyd’s List in December 2024 as number 68 on its listing of the Top 100 People in Shipping. He is a recognized industry thought leader in the areas of decarbonization and sustainability, digitalization and advanced technology, marine safety management and human factors, naval architecture, marine engineering, alternative fuels, carbon economics, and environmental, social and governance (ESG).\nLast month he had addressed the uncertainty about the IMO’s carbon levy warning that it was holding back investments in shipping. He said the industry was balancing short-term efficiency measures with long-term fuel readiness while looking for greater certainty for the future.\nTaking the helm of ABS in 2013 was the culmination of a now 35-year career with extensive commercial, government, and international experience in marine and offshore design, operations, infrastructure and safety management, ports and bunkering, digitalization, cybersecurity, and clean energy transition. He joined the company in 1993 as Vice President of Engineering within the ABS Americas Division.\n“We have faced many challenges during my tenure, including the pandemic, the marine and offshore industry downturn and unprecedented, and disruptive technology and regulatory driven change,” Wiernicki said today addressing the membership. “In spite of these events, we were able to move forward with a number of strategic investments that have allowed us to become an industry recognized technology and safety leader.”\nHe leaves ABS at a time when they said the group has never been stronger, with substantial growth and industry-leading safety performance. ABS told members during the annual meeting that its fleet grew to 300 million gross tons in 2024. It said it maintained the number one position among class organizations in global new order share (22 percent) and is a leader with both shipbuilders and shipowners. It reported that it also maintained its leadership position in the global offshore market and expanded its support for governments while continuing to be in the forefront in digital and sustainability services.\nThe retirement, ABS emphasized is the culmination of a well-planned succession process.\nThe leadership of ABS, upon election by the Board of Directors, is expected to pass to the current ABS President and Chief Operating Officer John McDonald. The plan calls for him to become Chairman and CEO from January 1, 2026.\nMcDonald is currently responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization globally. Previously, he served as Senior Vice President, Global Business Development and Global Marine market sector for ABS. He has risen from the position in 2010 and 2011 of Division President Europe to become COO in July 2021.\nMcDonald has a bachelor’s degree in marine engineering from Maine Maritime Academy and holds an MBA from Texas A&M University."

As part of that program, the companies committed to an investment of £77 million ($100 million) to modernize the yards and increase capabilities for the Fleet Solid Support (FSS) contract. The Spanish group stepped in in late 2024 to save the UK shipyard group from liquidation and maintain the FSS program reporting that it would increase the planned investment in the yards.\n“The modernization program will significantly enhance the Belfast yard’s ability to build the FSS vessels and support future programs,” said Navantia UK detailing its plans. “The investment is designed to deliver a comprehensive regeneration of UK shipbuilding capabilities, leveraging the opportunity presented by the FSS program.”\nAssembly work and outfitting for the three FSS vessels is slated to take place at the yard in Belfast. The Appledore shipyard is producing the bow sections for the vessels. Work on the upgrades had begun in 2024, but was suspended due to the group’s financial troubles. Navantia UK reports that work resumed in March.\nAccording to the group, the modernization focuses on maximizing productivity, creating jobs, and implementing sustainable manufacturing. Phase one focuses on enhancing capabilities for building vessel hulls, with improvements to delivery systems, stockyard management, and cutting technologies. It includes a comprehensive upgrade both for infrastructure development and advanced equipment installation. It will feature new lifting cranes, robotic plasma cutting systems, and automated quality control processes. A fully mechanized panel line for flat panel units will be installed, while the Belfast shipyard’s iconic Samson and Goliath gantry cranes will continue to play a vital role in operations.\nThe investment program extends beyond Belfast, with significant upgrades at the Appledore shipyard in Devon. The company has already committed to purchasing an advanced plasma cutter with expanded bed dimensions and sophisticated bevel-cutting capabilities, replacing machinery that has served the facility for more than 20 years.\nNavantia UK’s investment strategy also encompasses the Scottish facilities at Arnish and Methil, which specialize in the energy industries. At Arnish, investment has begun including on skills development infrastructure, featuring a new welfare facility, dedicated training center establishment, office space improvements, and enhanced security and parking provisions.\nJuan de la Cueva, CEO of Navantia UK, called the investments a “watershed moment” for UK shipbuilding. He said it was part of a long-term commitment to UK shipbuilding. Harland & Wolff they said will be transformed into a cutting-edge facility capable of delivering the highest quality vessels.  The Belfast yard was once an industry leader but entered a long decline delivering its last new build in 2009 and saved from a prior bankruptcy in 2019. Similarly, the Appledore shipyard went into receivership in 2003 and finally closed in 2019 before being acquired by Harland & Wolff Group in 2020. The group acquired the two smaller yards in Scotland in 2021."

North America, LATAM, and Europe experienced a decline in new installations compared with 2023.\n“Once again, the wind industry has broken new installation records, despite more challenging macroeconomic headwinds over the last few years,” said Ben Backwell, CEO of GWEC. “The aggressive stoking of tariff wars adds further uncertainty to international investment decisions and threatens to disrupt the international supply chains which the wind industry relies on. The full costs on our industry of the wide array of declared and threatened tariffs we have seen – both general and on specific commodities such as steel - have yet to be fully calculated.”\nGWEC, however, warns of increasing policy instability in some markets and points to the need to improve permitting, grid transmission, and auctioning mechanisms. It says these steps are critical to keep pace with the global trend for electrification, meet countries’ energy and climate targets, and lessen reliance on volatile fossil fuels. It also sees this as critical to fulfilling globally agreed ambitions to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n“It's vitally important that policymakers around the world don’t take their eyes off the prize, ensure stable and predictable market frameworks, work within multilateral frameworks to ensure free and fair trade,” says Blackwell. He says governments must work with investors and the industry to enable rapid deployment of clean, efficient wind power to support economic growth, resilience, and prosperity.\nThe report forecasts a compound average growth rate of 8.8 percent for the wind industry, projecting an additional 981 GW of wind energy capacity across the globe by 2030. GWEC’s Market Intelligence service sees consecutive record years through to 2030, with 138 GW of new capacity in 2025, 140 GW in 2026, 160 GW in 2027, 167 in 2028, and a leap in 2029 and 2030 to 183 GW and 194 GW respectively.\nGWEC’s forecast for 2025-2030 sees offshore wind rise from 16 GW in 2025 to 34 GW, with offshore moving from 11.8 percent of new capacity to 17.5 percent of new capacity by the end of the decade.\nThis year’sGlobal Wind Reportfocuses on four key challenges the market faces, including financial and macroeconomic headwinds, trade barriers and market fragmentation, inadequate procurement and auctioning frameworks, and challenging investment conditions in the global wind energy supply chain."

        "content": "\nIn a little-noticed action last week, U.S. African Command (Africom) took the rare step of bombing a stateless vessel that was suspected of smuggling arms into Somalia.\nThe boat was allegedly delivering \"advanced conventional weapons\" to al-Shabaab militants in Somalia. Al-Shabaab (\"The Youth\") is an Islamic militant movement with roots in al-Qaeda, and has been fighting the Somali government since the early 2000s. More recently, Western analysts suggest, al-Shabaab hasdeveloped tiesto Yemen's Houthi terrorist group - based in part on shared interests in arms smuggling.\nU.S. special forces have contributed to the counterinsurgency campaign against al-Shabaab for years, but have not dealt the group a decisive defeat. The conflict has recently heated up, with Al-Shabaab fighters making gains near the capital city of Mogadishu, and the Somali government's allies have responded with new urgency. Turkey's army delivered 500 troops into Mogadishu earlier this week, and Africom has launched a new round of airstrikes on remote Al-Shabaab positions.\nWithin this urgent context, Africom opted to use revised Pentagon engagement policies to order a rapid airstrike on the inbound smuggling vessel, according to The War Zone. \"They have to do things quickly. They did not have time to pull in boats [for a boarding],\" a U.S. official told the outlet.\nThe Somali government said in a statement that the strike targeted an unflagged ship and a smaller support craft that were operating in Somali territorial waters. It added that in Africom's assessment, \"all individuals aboard both vessels were neutralized.\"\nAfricom did not provide further details, but suggested that no civilians were harmed.\nHistorically, suspected smuggling boats in the Mideast and Horn of Africa have been interdicted in search and seizure boardings, often by U.S. Coast Guard teams with law enforcement training; kinetic weapons have almost never been used against cargo vessels in the area, at least in publicized actions."

The Navy is highlighting that along with an embarked USCG Law Enforcement Detachment and Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron, the new littoral combat ship stopped two alleged drug smuggling operations in the Caribbean within a 72-hour span.\nThe operations resulted in the confiscation of 580 kilos of cocaine and 2,480 pounds of marijuana. The report estimates the total value of the drugs at over $12 million and highlights that the operation was a combination of air and surface operations to complete the interdictions.\n“We train diligently and stand ready to execute interdiction missions at moment’s notice,” saidMinneapolis-Saint Paulcommanding officer Cmdr. Steven Fresse, “To be able to make an immediate impact so early on during our maiden deployment is a testament to the hard work and skills of the ship’s crew.”\nThe vessel is a Freedom-variant of the littoral combat ship class built by Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Wisconsin. She was launched in 2021 and commissioned in May 2022. She departed on March 26, 2025, from her home base at Naval Station Mayport for her maiden deployment to support the U.S. 4th Fleet area of operations.\nAt 388 feet (118 meters) in length, the Navy reports she has a top speed in excess of 40 knots and a range of over 3,500 nautical miles. Designated LCS 21, she is number 11 in the Freedom-variant, which currently has a total of 15 ships (10 active) and one more, USS Cleveland, fitting out.\n\n\nMinneapolis-Saint Paul is on her first deployment after commissioning in 2022 (USN)\n\nDuring her initial deployment, the Navy saidMinneapolis-Saint Paul’s primary mission is to support counter-illicit drug trafficking in the Caribbean. Minneapolis-Saint Paul operations will also involve practical exercises and exchanges with partner nations.\nPreparing for the mission, the vessel’s crew accomplished certification in Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) operations, which the Navy said would enable the ship to conduct Maritime Interdiction Operations and support the embarked Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment. This capability is vital for countering illicit drug trafficking and was supported by embarking an aviation detachment, which includes the MH-60 R helicopter to conduct reconnaissance, track contacts of interest, and engage in maritime interdiction operations.\n“I have watched this crew tackle a challenging and condensed schedule to ensure we are prepared for our maiden deployment to the 4th Fleet. We have overcome every obstacle in our path and have demonstrated that we are a resilient team ready to execute our mission,” said Cmdr. Fresse at the time of the departure. “This will be USSMinneapolis-Saint Paul’s first deployment, as well as the first for many of my crew members. However, we are eager to accomplish the mission.”\nThe Navy highlights that the crew also completed multiple certifications in a range of critical warfare areas, including Air Warfare, Electronic Warfare, Intelligence, Surface Warfare, Cyber Warfare, and Search and Rescue. These certifications it said demonstrated the team's proficiency across multiple domains, proving that they are equipped and prepared to handle the complex and multifaceted nature of modern naval operations."

A valve leak released an unspecified quantity of butadiene, a common industrial gas used for making plastics and synthetic rubber (like car tires). 1,3-butadiene is an EPA-listed carcinogen, an inhalation irritant, and highly flammable. Luckily, it breaks down quickly in the atmosphere, limiting the time in which it can have an effect.\nThe leak occurred because of a broken valve, according to local CW39 Houston. It was contained by late Tuesday, and the barge was towed to a safe location for further evaluation. The Houston Ship Channel has reopened to full service, and the City of Galena Park says that there are no air quality threats to the public.\nNo injuries were reported from the gas leak."

Security services are saying the crew was well prepared and remained safe and while it was the first recent incident, the risks remain high across the Gulf of Guinea and in West Africa.\nThe official report from Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG) says the boarding took place on April 21 and involved four individuals. They reportedly approached the vessel at high speed in a black-hulled craft and remained aboard for nearly four hours taking personal property and equipment from the vessel before fleeing.\nSecurity consultants Neptune P2P Group is highlighting that the captain and crew were well-prepared and followed mitigation recommendations quickly fleeing to the citadel where they remained during the incident. The perpetrators may have tried to enter the citadel or Martin Kelly, Head of Advisor at EOS Group, speculates it was a possible attempt at kidnapping because the pirates remained aboard for nearly four hours. The crew was unharmed according to the authorities.\nThe official reports did not name the vessel involved, but in an unconfirmed report, Neptune P2P says it was theSea Panther, a 13,000 dwt chemical tanker with Greek ownership and registered in the Marshall Islands. The vessel’s AIS shows it departed Lomé on April 20 and arrived on April 23 at Douala, Cameroon.\nWhile it is the first reported incident involving a commercial vessel near Nigeria in years, the dangers remain high in the region. Yesterday, the Nigerian authorities confirmed that a well-known fashion designer from Port Harcourt had been murdered by pirates. The individual named Hope Georgewill was kidnapped on March 26 and his family reportedly paid a ransom of approximately $1,250. The police reported they recovered his body and that they also raided the pirates' hideout killing four individuals and recovering a stash of weapons, outboard motors, and other equipment.\nThe Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps also reported on April 19 that one of its personnel was killed during a shootout with a pirate group. The incident took place in the Niger Delta Region.\nMDAT-GoG’s data shows that in April alone there have been four incidents including an attempted robbery off Monrovia, Liberia, and boardings near Accra, Ghana, and Abidjan in Cote d’Ivoire. Security services have also warned of continuing pirate group activity to the south in the region between Equatorial Guinea and São Tomé e Principe.\nThe current incident is reported by Neptune P2P as the fifth boarding in the Gulf of Guinea in 2025. The group highlights a 30 percent increase in activity over the same period in 2024."

The former rig is in use for aquaculture, according to China, but South Korea's government believes that there is more to the story. Chinese authorities intervened to stop a Korean research vessel from investigating the rig in February, raising security concerns in Seoul. Korean diplomats plan to raise the issue with China at an upcoming maritime dialogue, officials said.\n\"We are treating this issue with utmost seriousness from the standpoint of protecting our maritime territory,\" Korean minister of oceans and fisheries Kang Do-hyung told reporters on Monday.\nThe jackup platform has been identified as theAtlantic Amsterdam.It began life in 1984 as a drill rig, but in 2013 it was refitted for use as a floatel.

Container booking data for mid-May shows that shipments for inbound cargo from China to LA-Long Beach will be down by more than 40 percent, according to CNBC, an unprecedented and sudden drop.\nOn Tuesday, Trump told the press that he would not \"play hardball\" with China and would be \"nice\" in negotiations going forward. He added that the current rate would be coming down \"substantially,\" though not all the way to zero.\nOn Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's team is aiming at average tariffs of 50-65 percent on Chinese goods, possibly lower for noncritical items and higher for strategic industries. A final decision has not been made, the WSJ said.\nLater in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent denied that the White House is considering cutting tariff rates on China without getting something in return. But he said that both sides are motivated to walk back from current levels. \"Neither side believes that these are sustainable [tariff] levels,\" he said. \"This is the equivalent of an embargo, and a break between the two countries in trade does not suit anyone's interests.\"\nStocks have rallied on the news of a likely tariff rollback, including some key shipping stocks. AP Moller-Maersk, the largest publicly-listed ocean carrier (and second-largest overall) saw its shares jump up eight percent in a day. It has now regained most of its losses since April 2, buoyed by expectations of lower trade barriers.\nJones Act carrier Matson, which operates an express service between China and the United States, has been hit hard by the tariff disruption: its stock has lost nearly a quarter of its value since April 2. It began to recover from those losses on Tuesday, reflecting rising expectations of an eventual return to higher booking levels on transpacific routes.\nAs a discretionary expense, cruising is sensitive to swings in economic outlook, and it has tracked the recovery of the rest of the market. Carnival rebounded 3.5 percent over the past five days, Royal Caribbean is up by 7.5 percent, and Norwegian Cruise Line is up by 5 percent. However, all of the big three cruise stocks - like the markets overall - are still well below where they were last month."

        "content": "In a surprise development, the Port of Antwerp-Bruges surpassed the Port of Rotterdam for container volume during the first quarter of 2025. Traditionally Europe’s second busiest port, Antwerp-Burges highlighted its market share in the Hamburg-Le Havre Range increased to 30.5 percent, and on a global level, the port climbed one position to reach 14 in the ranking of largest ports, but like all its peers, the port is anticipating a tough period in the coming months related to the unrelenting tariff policy of Donald Trump.\nAntwerp-Bruges released its first quarter throughput performance highlighting the strength of its container business while reporting an overall decline largely driven by a sharp decrease in bulk volumes. Container throughput however was up 4.6 percent in tonnage and 4.5 percent in TEUs. The ports handled 3,436,000 TEUs. By comparison, the Port of Rotterdam which has long dominated in Europe reported a 2.2 percent increase in TEUs to 3,364,000.\nThe Belgian port said the growth came amidst the transition to the new alliances among liner companies, industrial actions including a paralyzing port strike, and congestion at other ports, which also contributed to longer container dwell times for Antwerp-Bruges. Rotterdam said its tonnage decreased due to an eight percent decline in loaded exports, a decline in the number of transshipment containers, bad weather in January, and an operational dispute at one of its terminals which resulted in fewer ship visits, delays, and lower productivity.\nDuring the quarter, Antwerp-Bruges handled 67.7 million tonnes of cargo, reporting a four percent overall decline, citing the weak performance in the bulk categories. Liquid cargo recorded the sharpest decline, falling by 19.1 percent impacted by gasoline, naphtha, and LNG. The segment is not only feeling the impact of sanctions against Russia and the struggling European petrochemical sector but has also been hit by changing market conditions in Africa. Belgium’s ban on high-sulfur and benzene fuels exports to Africa is having material negative effects on shipments.\nRotterdam also reported an overall 5.8 percent decline in first quarter throughput. It said the decline was also mostly due to less throughput of crude oil and oil products, iron ore, and coal.\n“We are in particularly uncertain times, which makes it difficult to predict what 2025 will bring next. But as in previous crises, our port is showing resilience and operational reliability,” said Jacques Vandermeiren, Port of Antwerp-Bruges CEO. “At the same time, the protectionist measures taken by the United States make it clear that Europe needs to make a stronger commitment to robust economic policies in order to strengthen our industry and anchor its strategic position.”\nHistorically, the United States has been the second-largest global trading partner of Port of Antwerp-Bruges for over two decades. In 2024, the maritime trade volume accounted for approximately 10 percent of the port's overall cargo traffic. Of this, 11 million tonnes were exported to the U.S., with the port handling over 200,000 cars bound for the U.S. as well as auto and machinery parts (mostly from Germany), chemicals, vehicles, food, plastics, and pharmaceuticals.\nExecutives at the Port of Rotterdam expressed similar concerns. They noted that import duties imposed by the United States on goods exported from Europe had yet to have an effect on first-quarter throughput but were creating uncertainty.\n“The first three months of this year were characterized by a high degree of volatility in world trade as a result of threatened import duties in the United States and conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East,” said Boudewijn Siemons, CEO of Port of Rotterdam Authority. “This volatility has led to uncertainty among companies in the areas of trade and investment. We see this reflected in throughput volumes and the willingness to invest. In these uncertain times, it remains as important as ever that, together with national and European governments, the Port of Rotterdam continues to work towards a competitive European investment climate.”"

The project is a partnership between Italian energy major Eni and the UK Government to support what is being called one of the world’s most advanced CCS clusters.\nThe UK Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Ed Miliband, and Eni CEO, Claudio Descalzi, announced that they have reached the financial close for the project. The UK Government had previously announced its funding allocation of £21.7 billion ($29 billion) to be invested over 25 years across the first two CCS Clusters in the country. Eni will be the operator of the CO2 transport and storage system of the HyNet Industrial Cluster.\nUK Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Ed Miliband called this the “launch of a whole new clean energy industry for our country,” citing the job creation and support for the industrial sectors of the UK. He said it would kickstart growth and support the UK’s industrial competitiveness for the long term.\nThe Liverpool Bay CCS project will operate as the backbone of the HyNet Cluster to transport carbon dioxide from capture plants across the North West of England and North Wales through new and repurposed infrastructure to permanent storage in Eni’s depleted natural gas reservoirs, located under the seabed in Liverpool Bay. The project foresees the repurposing of part of the offshore platforms as well as 149 km of onshore and offshore pipelines, and the construction of 35 km of new pipelines to connect industrial emitters to the Liverpool Bay CCS network.\nIt is designed to support industrial operations including companies involved in cement manufacturing, and energy from waste plants, as well as supporting the growth of low-carbon hydrogen production in the region. The HyNet Consortium aims to become one of the first low-carbon clusters in the world.\nThe project will have a storage capacity of 4.5 million tonnes of CO2?per year in the first phase, and the potential to increase to 10 million tonnes of CO2?per year in the 2030s. It will be used to address the needs of industries that currently do not have efficient and effective solutions for their carbon emissions.\nConstruction of the project is expected to commence this year, ready for planned start-up in 2028, in line with industrial emitters in the HyNet Cluster."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump signed a much-anticipated executive order that will set up an American permitting process for deep sea mining in international waters, beyond the U.S. outer continental shelf.\nThe order directs the Commerce Department to expedite a sovereign permitting process for mining under the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act, an obscure statute from the 1980s. The Cold War-era law provides a pathway to unilateral resource recovery on the high seas, bypassing the UN's International Seabed Authority (ISA), which has jurisdiction under UNCLOS.\nThe richest areas for polymetallic nodules - the only technologically mature mining target - are far outside of U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, primarily in the Pacific between Hawaii and Mexico. The nodules in the Clarion Clipperton Zone contain roughly 28 percent manganese; 1.3 percent nickel; 1.1 percent copper; and 0.2 percent cobalt, all strategically valuable elements. The nodules also contain trace amounts of rare earth metals, which are critically important to defense production.\nCanadian mining firm The Metals Company has a years-long interest in this region, and itworked closelywith the White House in the months leading up to the announcement. It is the only Western firm with equipment capable of performing the work in the immediate term, and is expected to apply for a U.S. mining permit, with support from Swiss contractor Allseas and Korean-built drillshipHidden Gem.The Metals Company's stock soared at 1100 hours Thursday, and was up 44 percent at closing.\nISA has taken a cautious approach to licensing, and is weighing the economic benefits against scientists' warnings of large-scale and long-lastingenvironmental damage. However, the U.S. is not a signatory to UNCLOS, and the Trump administration is motivated to move quickly to \"restore American dominance in offshore critical minerals and resources.\"\nMore than three dozen nations, including China, Russia, the UK, France and India, have already condemned the U.S. license plan and registered their support for the ISA. The ISA's secretary-general, Leticia Carvalho, implied in a statement that the order was inconsistent with UNCLOS. “The International Seabed Authority remains the sole body with the legal mandate to regulate activities in the area, and its legitimacy stems directly from international law,” Carvalho said.\nBeyond high-seas permitting, Trump's order also directs the Department of the Interior to set up a similar permit process for the U.S. OCS (under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act). The order also directs a variety of government resources towards helping private companies extract resources. These include the possibility of federal mapping services to find minerals; funding support from federal development banks; and possible government purchasing of the minerals produced, using the National Defense Stockpile.\nFederal purchasing may be an important tool to create a market. Many leading companies (including Apple) have already pledged not to buy metals from deep-sea mining for their supply chain, citing the potential environmental impact. It is also possible that the sale of the metals may be challenged legally, according to environmental lawyer Duncan Currie, who compared unilateral high seas mining to illegal fishing.\n\"When a fishing vessel violates fishing regulations, it faces consequences, including not being able to unload its catch in various ports. Its catch also cannot be sold in several countries, like the US or the European Union. Similar things would apply to metals obtained in violation of UNCLOS,\" Currie told Dialogue Earth.\nCompetition for strategic seabed resources could also accelerate without a uniform set of rules. China - which already has acontroversial historyof UNCLOS compliance - has invested substantially in deep sea mining technology, and has a strategic interest as the world's leading producer of critical minerals."

Under the measure added to the 20-year-old Vessel Monitoring Directive, ships are now going to be required to provide insurance information.\nMany countries have raised concerns about the dangers of unregulated vessels sailing near their coastlines, and especially the large tankers supporting the Russian oil trade. Denmark has been outspoken about its concerns as the so-called shadow tankers travel its waterways to reach the Russian oil terminals on the Baltic. Various efforts have been discussed to crack down on these vessels with countries such as the United Kingdom launching efforts to inspect documents for vessels in the English Channel and Denmark started an enhanced Port State inspection effort.\nThe changes adopted by the European Commission now require all vessels, including those merely passing through EU waters without entering an EU port, to provide insurance information. The Commission asserts that this change strengthens oversight of uninsured or unsafe vessels, supports safety and environmental goals, and aligns EU rules with global standards amid rising threats from hazardous cargo and geopolitical instability.\n“It reflects the EU's dedication to safer, more secure, and environmentally responsible maritime operations, aligning its regulations with international standards and tackling the challenges associated with hazardous cargo and geopolitical tensions,” said the Commission’s Director-General for Mobility and Transport, Magda Kopczy?ska.\nBy requiring that all vessels operating in the vicinity of the EU are properly insured, the commissioners assert the EU’s ability to monitor and, if necessary, investigate maritime activities is strengthened. They said it addresses risks posed by uninsured or unsafe vessels and also reinforces the commitment to a more environmentally responsible maritime sector.\nFollowing this legislative change, the European Commission and Member States have also submitted a proposal to the International Maritime Organization (IMO seeking a minor amendment to several existing Mandatory Ship Reporting Systems (MRS) in and around the European coastal states.\nThe announcement of change did not specify any planned steps for enforcement actions and penalties for vessels that fail to comply."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe NTSB released a report on a 2024 incident in which a towing vessel moving coal barges struck a vane dike on the Ohio River resulting in an estimated $1.3 million in damages to the barge, cargo, and dam rates. It found that the pilot did not effectively compensate for the outdraft current while navigating out of the locks near Louisville, Kentucky, but that a lack of communication, an inexperienced pilot, and the use of a personal cell phone contributed to the incident.\nThe report recognizes that the upstream section of the McAlpine Locks and Dam is uniquely difficult to navigate, even under ideal circumstances. It highlights that there have been nine reported incidents in the area involving tow vessels since January 2020, totaling over $2.7 million in property damage.\n“Lock canal entrances near dams present unique hazards for vessels transiting inland rivers,” the report said. “Fast moving river water near low-flow canal waters can produce outdraft currents. Mariners should thoroughly assess the potential impact of outdraft currents when entering or exiting locking channels. Vessel horsepower and vessel handling should be carefully considered.”\nIn this instance, the towing vessel Amber Brittany, built in 1982 and 138 feet in length, was pushing 15 loaded coal barges along the Ohio River. On March 8, 2024, the vessel was waiting its turn to enter the McAlpine Locks when the captain was relieved by the pilot. The captain and pilot discussed the upcoming locking procedure and transit strategy. The captain recommended favoring the left descending bank to avoid the effects of outdraft. He also warned of shoaling on the left descending bank.\nDuring the investigation, it came out that the company personnel was under the impression that the pilot had previous experience operating tows on the Ohio River. However, the pilot told the Coast Guard and NTSB investigators that he had not previously operated on the Ohio River. This led the NTSB to the conclusion that the pilot’s inexperience in a challenging location contributed to the contact.\n\n\n(Source NTSB)\n\nAn analysis of the AIS signal showed that as the tow vessel was exiting the lock area its course alerted appreciably to port. The pilot blamed an outdraft current saying he had attempted to counter it and then realizing the tow was going to contact the vane dike, attempted to land as softly as possible.\nThe second barge contacted the vane dike mooring cell and the tow broke apart. Ten of the 15 barges broke free and floated downstream. One of the barges ultimately sank. Another barge began taking on water and was pushed to the bank.\nFurther investigation however revealed that the pilot was also on his personal cell phone. Records indicated the pilot was using the phone just before the contact. The first in a series of outgoing and income text messages coincided with the Amber Brittany’s departure from the sailing line. In all, the NTSB reports that the pilot sent 16 messages starting before the contact and continuing afterward over a 20-minute period and made two outgoing calls after the contact happened. In the three minutes prior to the contact, the pilot sent three messages and received three incoming messages.\nThe NTSB warns that mariners should avoid using mobile devices, especially while maneuvering in unfamiliar areas of restricted navigation.\n“Using cell phones and other wireless electronic devices has been demonstrated to be visually, manually, and cognitively distracting. Talking on cell phones can have serious consequences in safety-critical situations, and sending or reading text messages is potentially even more distracting than talking because texting requires visual attention to the display screen of the device,” the report highlights.\nIt is not the first time personal cell phone usage has been documented during incidents. The NTSB said the pilot on the containership Ever Forward was busy on his personal cell phone when the boxship grounded in the Chesapeake Bay.  That same year a bulker and an OSV were in a collision 66 miles south of Port Fourchon, Louisiana. The master of the OSV later admitted to the NTSB that he had made a personal call using his cell phone, and was using dictation to send personal text messages. At the same time, the second officer on the bridge of the bulker was also distracted while he had begun printing updates for electronic navigation charts and digital publications.\nNTSB in its role can only conclude the probable cause of the incidents. The U.S. Coast Guard and other local authorities are responsible for the regulations and disciplinary actions. The Coast Guard has also issued warnings against using personal devices which could cause distractions while navigating."

        "content": "The American Waterways Operators (AWO) has awarded its Honor & Excellence in Rescue Operations Awards to the crew of the El Coqui, one of the two con/ro ships that Crowley operates between Florida and Puerto Rico.\nIn January, the crew ofEl Coquirescued four survivors from a life raft north of the Dominican Republic. Yachtsmen David Potts, 63; John Potts, 62; Andrew Cullar, 26; and Russel Case, 67, were on a voyage from St. Croix to Texas when their sailing vessel struck an underwater rock and began taking on water. The yacht sank within 10 minutes, but the survivors managed to board their raft and get out an EPIRB distress signal.\nThe Coast Guard received the alert and dispatched a search plane to look for survivors. Sector San Juan also sent an AMVER alert to nearby merchant ships, andEl Coquiresponded.\nThe ship arrived on scene shortly after, and the crew spotted the survivors. However, the raft was located in a rocky, shallow area, and El Coqui could not get closer than three nautical miles, according to an American Maritime Officersaccount.\nA small boat, the Bonanza, reached the raft and picked up the men. Despite challenging and rough surface conditions, the boat transferred them safely aboard El Coqui. They were delivered ashore at the con/ro's next port call in Jacksonville.\n\n“They were exhausted both mentally and physically. We literally had to drag them up the ladder because they could barely make it,” Capt. Kurt Breitfeller told AMO. “You could tell they were mentally spent. They even said they couldn’t sleep because they kept having nightmares about what happened.”\nAWO also recognized Second Mate Keven Zapolski of the Crowley-managed boxshipPotomac Express,who helped rescue a crewmate who had gone over the side. The victim went into the water between the dock and the ship, and Zapolski quickly threw down a life ring. Terminal staff and first responders helped rescue the crewmember.\n\"We are proud of Second Mate Zapolski as well as Capt. Breitfeller and the mariners ofEl Coquifor their dedication and heroic actions to ensure the safety of others,” said Cal Hayden, vice president of marine operations for Crowley global ship management. “Their swift responses exemplify the essential commitment to safety that defines Crowley’s mariners and our operations, and we are honored to recognize their bravery.\""

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe dramatic container explosion aboard the boxshipYM Mobilityat Ningbo last year was caused by thermal runaway in a cargo of organic peroxides, according to China's Maritime Safety Administration (CMSA). It is the latest in a long string of container accidents involving this class of dangerous chemicals, notorious for self-heating, decomposition, fires and explosions.\nThe container in question was a reefer box filled with tert-butyl perbenzoate (TBPB), a common activator for making plastics like polyethylene and polyester. It is unstable at high temperatures, and has a thermal tipping point of about 140 degrees Fahrenheit, above which its self-heating tendency accelerates until combustion or explosion. This particular shipment was headed for Jebel Ali, where the terminal requires refrigerated storage for TBPB, so the manufacturer packed it in a reefer box in order that it could be plugged in on arrival.\nYM Mobility'soperator did not require the box to be plugged in while under way. When the container was loaded aboardYM Mobilityin Shanghai on August 6, it was stowed as deck cargo on the starboard bow, packed in a reefer but unplugged and unrefrigerated. Ambient summertime temperatures were about 95 degrees Fahrenheit.\nCourtesy CMSA\nYM Mobilityleft Shanghai August 7 and transited to Ningbo. On August 9, a crewmember on duty smelled an \"irritating odor\" while up on the bow. At about 1331, he inspected the container involved and noticed a hissing noise, white smoke and a yellow liquid dripping from the door - characteristic of TPBP decomposition. Over the next six minutes, the smoke increased. The crewmembers up on the bow realized the danger and evacuated the area, and the captain sounded the fire alarm to muster the crew.\nBy 1338, white smoke obscured most of the starboard bow, and within minutes, it was billowing all over the foredeck. At 1346:30, the reefer box exploded violently, blowing six containers over the side and disintegrating three more. No injuries were reported, and all crewmembers safely evacuated onto the dock a few minutes later.\n\nFirst responders from shore took over firefighting efforts, and the blaze was under control by the next morning. It took another day to fully put out the last hot spots in adjacent containers.\nA post-accident inspection found that the force and heat from the blast were enough to warp the hatch coaming, hatch cover and adjacent structures. More than a dozen containers were burned, blown up or had their contents ruined.\nCourtesy CMSA\nCMSA notedthat reefer boxes are airtight and thermally insulated, and any heat from a self-heating substance like TBPB would accumulate inside the container, particularly in hot weather. Under these conditions, the cargo could get hotter and hotter until it went into thermal runaway and exploded.\n\"No attention was paid to the temperature changes in the box during transportation,\" CMSA concluded, calling the arrangement negligent. \"The transportation plan of transporting TBPB in unplugged refrigerated containers during the hot season is inappropriate.   . . . TBPB shippers failed to take into account the thermal insulation and airtightness of unplugged reefers in hot weather.\""

The action came as Ukraine continued to assert it would not cede the occupied region to Russia despite Donald Trump’s statements recognizing the area as Russian.\nAccording to the announcement, Ukrainian forces detained the cargo ship in the “internal waters of the Black Sea area of Ukraine.” The SBU released pictures of its forces on the bridge of the vessel and documents it said it found during a search of the ship. They reported finding “physical evidence” during the search of the vessel and its navigational equipment that confirmed the “looting of Ukrainian agricultural products by the Russians.”\nUkraine is asserting the vessel loaded 5,000 tons of wheat in the port of Sevastopol in 2024, which it refers to as “temporarily occupied territory in southern Ukraine.” It further asserts the vessel was hiding its actions by “operating under the flag of one of the Asian countries.”\nThe vessel has now been officially arrested, and the crew placed in detention. Ukraine says the crew will be transferred for “procedural actions.”\n\n\nUkraine asserts it found physical evidence the ship transported wheat from Crimea in 2024 (SBU)\n\nUkraine has repeatedly accused the Russians of stealing grain and other materials during its occupation of ports and other areas in Ukraine and Crimea.

The naming ceremony took place forBYD Shenzhenon April 22 in Yizheng, China as the new vessel prepares for its maiden voyage to Brazil.\nThe vessel which is part of a four-ship class designed by Deltamarin marks several key advancements in the sector. Two vessels will be constructed by CMJL Nanjing Shipyard and two by CMHI Jiangsu Shipyard.BYD Shenzhenis reported to have the largest capacity for a vehicle carrier with 9,200 standard car spaces across 16 decks. It surpasses Höegh Autoliner's first Aurora-class vessel, theHöegh Aurora, which was delivered in August 2024 with a capacity of 9,100 cars. The second of the class,BYD Changsha, was launched in March and will also have a capacity of 9,200 units.\nThe new Chinese vessel (16,300 dwt) also incorporates a range of technologies to increase efficiency. It is LNG fueled with high-efficiency, energy-saving main engines that provide a speed of 19 knots. It employs a Boil-Off Gas recondenser, anti-fouling, drag-reducing coasting, and shaft generators. Furthermore, it has a hybrid 1 MW battery power system and is equipped for shore power.\n\n\nThe first of the 9,200 unit vessels will be sailing to Brazil (BYD)\n\nBYD announced in 2022 its plans to launch a fleet of car carriers to build what it calls a “maritime bridge” to support its global sales growth and supply chain. The company said it would invest about $687 million to develop a fleet of eight car carriers. The first of the vessels,BYD Explorer No. 1was delivered in January 2024 followed byBYD Changzhouin December 2024, andBYD Hefei, which was the company’s first owned PCTC. Each of the first three vessels has a capacity of 7,000 units.\nThe launch of the fleet however comes as the Chinese EV industry is facing growing opposition. The European Union moved in October 2024 to impose tariffs on Chinese manufacturers after citing concerns about unfair state subsidies and potential market distortion. U.S. Trade Representative also outlined plans to impose a fee on each car landed in the U.S. from any foreign-built car carrier in addition to Trump’s steep tariffs on all Chinese imports.\nBYD does not currently sell vehicles in the United States but is already the world’s largest EV company. In 2024 it reported overseas sales of 417,200 units and in the first quarter of 2025, it shipped more than 25,000 units overseas.\nThe newBYD Shenzhenwill initially be sailed to Brazil, which the company said is one of its fastest-growing markets. It sold 75,700 vehicles in Brazil in 2024, which it said was a 328 percent year-over-year increase.\nOver the past few years, the car carrier sector has experienced strong growth compelling record orders, and the growth in the size of the vessels. Wallenius Wilhelmsen is poised to take the title for the largest vessels starting next year with its new Shaper class pure car and truck carriers. The vessel will have a capacity of 9,300 units and incorporate advancements including the capability to operate on methanol as their primary fuel. They are also being built to convert to ammonia when it becomes available as a maritime fuel.\nThe first six ships of the new Wallenius Wilhelmsen class are set to each have a capacity of 9,300 units. In November 2024, the company announced it was exercising an option for two more vessels and would be upsizing eight members of the class to each have a capacity of 11,300 units. A total of 14 Shaper class vessels were reported to be on order being built at China Merchants Jingling Shipyard Co."

        "content": "The continuing strong growth in the cruise ship industry has helped Florida’s Port Canaveral to set new records in its current fiscal year. The port had its busiest month ever in March with a 16 percent year-over-year increase in passenger volumes coming after a record winter season and new, larger ships scheduled to homeport at the Central Florida port.\n“It wasn’t long ago when we exceeded 500,000 guests in a single month. Now, with numbers like this approaching nearly a million, it’s not just remarkable, it demonstrates the strong demand for sailings from our Port. We’ve been predicting it, and we were ready for it,” stated Capt. John Murray, Port Canaveral CEO.\nIn March 2025, the port handled 925,994 passengers coming and going from the cruise ships. That was up 16 percent compared to a year earlier and was the second record month in the port’s nearly completed winter season. The Orlando Sentinel highlights another record in December 2024 when Port Canaveral handled 837,900 passengers.\nPort officials reported to its board of directors that for the six-month period in FY 2025 they have already handled 4.42 million passengers and they are projecting the port will reach 8.4 million passengers for the full year. That is up from 7.6 million last year and in FY 2019, Port Canaveral hosted nearly 4.6 million revenue cruise passengers.\nThe strong passenger counts were driven by a record 16 cruise ships sailing from the port during the peak winter months. The port says that cruise ships are now operating more than 1,000 trips annually from Port Canaveral, with many being the shorter 3- and 4-day trips to the Bahamas. The port however slipped back into second place in the passenger counts after briefly topping PortMiami as the cruise industry restarted after the pandemic.\nThe port also reported that it was ahead of forecast for each of the first six months in the current fiscal year. That has also helped it to generate a record of just over $23 million in operating revenue in March. For the first six months of the year, the port achieved over $111 million in operating revenue.\nPort Canaveral reports it has grown in popularity as a homeport, particularly for cruise guests who prefer to drive to their port. Also with its proximity to the Central Florida theme parks and attractions, the port highlights that just over a quarter of the passengers stay in the local area for pre- or post-cruise stays fueling the hotels, restaurants, and tourism industry.\nMurray highlights that the port is investing millions of dollars to make sailing from the Central Florida region even more accessible and convenient. Its projects include expanded terminals, updated parking facilities, and updated technology that allows guests to get to and from their cruise faster than ever. Previously he also highlighted their early planning which made Port Canaveral the first in North America to homeport an LNG-fueled cruise ship.\nWhile several of the ships move to other markets during the summer months, the port is preparing this weekend to welcome the new Norwegian Aqua, and this summer it will become homeport to Star of the Seas, which will be the largest cruise ship in the world. Carnivale Cruise Line recently announced it would position its newest ship, Carnival Festivale in the port in 2027 and MSC also announced that its new giant, MSC World Atlantic will be positioned in the port. MSC, Princess Cruises, Celebrity Cruises, and Norwegian Cruise Line will all deploy newer ships to Port Canaveral this winter.\nNear term, the port is looking to expand one of its existing cruise terminals. It is also working on plans to build one or more new terminals to accommodate additional growth in the cruise business while also balancing with the needs of the cargo business and its operations to support the space industry."

As different stakeholders line up to nudge the outcome one way or the other, Fortescue chairman Dr. Andrew Forrest - a leading green-fuel proponent and a major bulker charterer - has issued a call for more nations to line up behind a green transition. In particular, he singles out Saudi Arabia as a state with political sway and much to gain (not just lose) from green bunkering.\nLike several leading oil exporters,  Saudi representatives at IMO opposed an ambitious carbon regulation plan at MEPC 83. Forrest suggested that the nation's fossil-fuel-heavy economy has \"tremendous potential to lead the path to full decarbonization rather than simply forestall the energy transition.\" He pointed to the example set by Brazil, which is striving to maximize offshore oil output but has also shown climate leadership in international forums.\n\"This is a moment for bold leadership. We call on Saudi Arabia to use its influence to drive consensus, not disrupt it, and to chart a path that secures the wellbeing of its people,\" Forrest said. He noted the high heatstroke and fatality rate during the 2024 Hajj as an additional motivator.\n\"[MEPC 83] is a major victory. It represents one of the most significant climate achievements by any heavy industry,\" Forrest said in a statement. \"Petrostates, particularly Saudi Arabia, must be held to account if they set out to destroy – not deliver – multinational agreement and solutions to climate destruction that fossil fuel is causing.\""

        "content": "\nIn its latest move against the offshore wind energy sector, the Trump administration suspended funding for a research project developing prototypes for floating offshore wind turbines. The move came days after the research project being undertaken by the University of Maine launched the base for its test system which was due to begin operations this summer.\nIn a letter released online by Maine State Representative Reagan Paul, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E) accuses the university of “failure to comply with one or more of the National Policy Assurances” in its ongoing grants. It is informed that ARPA-E “is suspending all activity” effective this date (April 11) for a period of up to 90 days. The suspension could be canceled or extended by ARPA-E and the university has the right to object and provide information and documentation challenging this suspension.\nA university spokesperson told the media in Maine they had not been aware of any issues or investigations. It is being pointed out that the letter does not make specific allegations of the nature of failures or violations of rules.\nThe state of Maine and the Trump administration have been feuding since February. State Governor Janet Mills openly rejected Trump policies including on transgender rights during a White House event. The governor cited state law to which Donald Trump said “You better comply,” and later “See you in court.” Maine Public Radio is saying that two other grants were also suspended and that the university has had several pools of federal aid suspended, cut, and reinstated since February.\nThe university’s Advanced Structures and Composites Center has been leading the research into floating offshore wind turbines for more than a decade and in 2024 won grants which are reportedly valued at $12.5 million. The project was to build and test a prototype in the Gulf of Maine.\nThe researchers successfully floated a 375-ton concrete base on March 30 as the first step in the prototype project. The base was towed to Searsport, Maine where it was docked. The work called for the installation of the tower, turbines, and blades in the coming week. The prototype is a 56-foot square base that stands 32 feet high. It is a quarter-size research prototype for the tests.\nBy the end of May, the prototype was to be towed into position in Penobscot Bay near Castine, Maine. It was scheduled to undergo 18 months of testing and data collection from more than 200 sensors.\nMaine proposed a research site for floating offshore wind in 2021 and won approval from the Bureau of Offshore Energy Management (BOEM) in 2023. A research lease was awarded in August 2024 for a project that ultimately proposes to place up to 12 floating turbines that would have a capacity based on current designs for up to 144 MW of electricity."

        "content": "\nA project launched in 2023 by Höegh Evi and Wärtsilä’s Gas Solutions unio has completed the development of the world's first floating ammonia-to-hydrogen cracker. According to the companies, this breakthrough technology will enable floating import terminals to produce hydrogen at industrial-scale volumes from transported ammonia, marking a major step in the energy transition.\nHydrogen has been recognized as a potential key source of energy, especially for hard-to-abate industries and ammonia can be used as an efficient carrier of hydrogen. Europe plans to import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year by 2030 according to the EU's REPower strategy. To meet this demand, Höegh Evi and others are developing hydrogen import terminal projects in Europe, with a targeted start of operations before 2030.\nAs the development of the hydrogen grid progresses, Höegh Evi believes that floating infrastructure with ammonia cracking technology can unlock large-scale imports. Working with Wärtsilä Gas Solutions, and as part of Norway's green platform program, the companies sought to develop an efficient platform for cracking ammonia using a similar structure as the current floating LNG regasification terminals.\n\"This pioneering development of the floating ammonia-to-hydrogen cracker represents a significant leap forward in our quest for sustainable energy solutions,\" said Walter Reggente, Vice President of Wärtsilä Gas Solutions. “Together with Höegh Evi and our partners, we are not only addressing the challenges of hydrogen storage and transportation but also paving the way for a more resilient and flexible energy infrastructure.”\nThe industrial-scale ammonia cracker has a modular design that allows integration into both hybrid Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRUs) and dedicated Floating Hydrogen Terminals. The companies report the technology is highly scalable with a sendout capacity of up to 210,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually. Ammonia storage can range from 10,000 cbm to 120,000 cbm.\n\"The floating ammonia-to-hydrogen cracker developed by Höegh Evi, Wärtsilä, and partners is a game-changer for the hydrogen economy and the energy transition in Europe. Our floating terminals and cracking technology can unlock the full potential of global value chains for green hydrogen, providing European industry with a reliable supply of clean energy within this decade,\" said Erik Nyheim, CEO of Höegh Evi.\nThe project received approximately half its budget or nearly €5.9 million (US$6.7 million) in funding from the Norwegian Government's green platform program. The ammonia cracker was constructed at Sustainable Energy's Norwegian Catapult Center in Stord, Norway. Additional partners in the project include the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), the University of South-East Norway, Sustainable Energy, and BASF SE."

        "content": "\nIndia is making a major statement in its quest to become a global cruise tourism destination with the inauguration of the country’s largest terminal at Mumbai Port. After eight years of construction and ?556 crores ($67 million) of investment, the Mumbai International Cruise Terminal (MICT) has started operations, a development expected to boost India’s determination to grow cruise tourism.\nMICT has been in the works since 2018 and has faced a myriad of challenges, including funding and pandemic-instigated construction delays. The inauguration of the terminal is thus a significant milestone in efforts to attract leading cruise lines to India and drive the growth of cruise tourism. Currently, the cruise tourism market in India is valued at only $100 million, which is a mere one percent of the global market.\nWith the new terminal developed through a public-private partnership, India is upbeat about changing the narrative. MICT is the country’s largest cruise terminal spreading over an area of more than 415,000 square feet at Ballard Pier. The terminal is designed to handle over one million passengers annually, approximately 10,000 passengers per day. MICT can handle five cruise ships simultaneously, with an 11-meter (36-foot) draft and up to 300 meters (984 feet) in length.\nThe Mumbai Ports Authority (MbPA) reports it signed a 30-year concession with private firms Ballard Pier Port Private Limited and J M Baxi & Co to operate the terminal. Currently, only Cordelia Cruises operates from the new terminal, with its sole cruise ship, the Empress (48,500 gross tons) with a capacity of 1,840 passengers sailing twice-weekly. The line is in the process ofexpanding its fleetannouncing an agreement with Norwegian Cruise Line to assume operations of two of its older ships in 2026 and 2027. India is also a stopover port for cruise ships transiting the region.\nIndia’s Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal termed the inauguration of MICT as a major step in advancing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of transforming the country into a global cruise hub through state-of-the-art infrastructures. The vision encompasses tapping the potential of the country’s long coastline and vast inland waterways to build a booming international and domestic cruise tourism industry.\nIn September last year, the Indian government launched the Cruise Bharat Mission to oversee the transformation of the cruise industry, setting ambitious targets that include the development of 10 international sea cruise terminals, the creation of 100 river cruise terminals, the launch of five marinas, and the integration of more than 5,000 km of waterways. The overall goal is to double cruise passenger traffic to over one million and 1.5 million river cruise passengers by 2029. This is expected to translate to the creation of over 400,000 direct and indirect jobs across the cruise value chain.\n“Today, Mumbai, with its longstanding reputation as a major maritime hub in the world, commenced cruise operations from the Mumbai International Cruise Terminal, providing passengers with modern amenities for a better and safer experience,” said Sonowal.\nWhile MICT incorporates sustainability amenities, Sonowal also inaugurated a shore power facility at Mumbai port as part of the green port initiative. Currently, however, only MbPA tugboats and Coast Guard vessels will be able to plug in before being expanded to include cruise ships in the future."

        "content": "French shipping group CMA CGM reports it has closed the first stage in its planned acquisition of Santos Brasil, a multi-terminal operator in Brazil including the Port of Santos. CMA CGM announced in September 2024 itsintention to acquirethe company first buying shares from an institutional fund manager and then launching a tender offer for the remaining shares.\nThe acquisition comes as South America and specifically Brazil continues to draw investments from the major shipping companies. CMA CGM will be investing in excess of $2 billion to expand its operations in Brazil. MSC and Maersk have also announced expansions for their operations in Brazil as well as DP World.\nCMA CGM reports it closed the acquisition of approximately 48 percent of the shares in Santos Brasil from funds managed by Opportunity, one of the largest asset managers in Brazil for a reported value of approximately $1.1 billion. Combined with a three percent position held by an affiliate of CMA CGM, the company now controls 51 percent of Santos Brasil.\nA second stage tender will be launched for the remaining shares once an independent appraisal is completed.\nSantos Brasil operates five terminals and a total of eight assets, including the largest container terminal in Brazil and South America. The Tecon Santos Terminal in Santos currently has a capacity of 2.5 million TEU and will be expanded to 3 million TEU. It can dock three 14,000 TEU vessels simultaneously.  According to CMA CGM, the terminal handles 40 percent of Brazil’s overall container volume. They also called it the most efficient terminal in the Port of Santos.\nThe acquisition expands CMA CGM’s 20-year presence in Brazil and is keeping with the strategy to grow terminal operations and the logistics segments of the business. CMA CGM said it will support the development of Santos and the other ports and will integrate the operations with its group including CEVA Logistics.\nThe acquisition comes as Santos continues to report strong growth. The Port Authority reported March was the third consecutive month of increases and at 460,000 TEU was the busiest March on record. It said the positive performance resulted in an increase of nearly seven percent for the first quarter of 2025 or a total of 1.3 million TEU handed in the port.\nThe federal government has committed to investments in the Santos port complex. It will invest $2.2 million to improve access both by land and sea, including new roads and the deepening of the shipping channel.\nThe Port of Santos is a key contributor to Brazil’s foreign trade accounting for nearly a third (30 percent) of the country’s trade flow in March. China is the main trading partner accounting for more than 28 percent of the volume in the port.  In addition to containers, Santos is a major port for soybeans and other agricultural commodities as well as gasoline and the fuel sector."

        "content": "The Panhellenic Seaman’s Federation and other unions in Greece are demanding an investigation and better enforcement of safety regulations after a seafarer was killed as a ferry was unloading overnight in Patras. The unions called for a rally and 24-hour strike starting Friday, April 25, asserting that safety regulations are being repeatedly violated and ignored by the authorities.\nThe ferryAF Claudia(24,418 gross tons) docked at the port of Patras at 22:50 on Thursday, April 24, completing the approximately 32-hour run from Venice to Patras with a stop in Igoumenitsa. Built in 2001 and registered in Italy, the RoRo ferry can accommodate up to 950 passengers and has a 2,044 linear meter garage that can handle approximately 100 vehicles.\nThe ferry is owned by Italy’s Adria Ferries. It is operated under charter to Greece’s Attica Group. It is operating for the SuperFast Ferry brand.\nAccording to the Hellenic Coast Guard, a truck was backing up on the vessel’s ramp when its trailer struck a 47-year-old female seafarer which Attica Group said was working on the vessel’s hotel department. She was fatally injured by the truck with the police reporting the driver has been detained. The ferry remained in Patras on Friday.\nAttica Group issued a brief statement expressing condolences for the loss early on Friday morning of the crewmember. The Greek Maritime Accident Investigation Service (ELYDNA) reported it was sending a team to Patras to investigate the cause of the tragic incident.\nMedia reports are highlighting that the Patras Labour Center had earlier this month issued a warning of “grave risk” for the safety of crew and passengers as well as ships. They contend that safety is in danger during loading and unloading and as vessels arrive and depart ports. Reports assert there is a poor safety record for the ferries operating on the routes between Italy and Greece.\nThe unions called for a rally starting at 18:30 today, Friday, April 25, and for a 24-hour strike beginning at 19:00 today till Saturday, April 26 at 19:00. It comes as the summer tourist season begins in Greece.\nA strike had previously been planned for May 1. The unions announced another rally planned for next Thursday preceding the start of that strike. The union was planning to use the May Day event to highlight working conditions in its ongoing protests. It also staged a one-day strike on April 9 as part of its demands for better wages and working conditions.\nGreece’s Minister of Shipping and Island Policy Vassilis Kikilias wrote his condolences on social media. He said it was important to never forget that seafarers face danger every day at sea and their protection and safety must always come first."

        "content": "\nAfter two weeks, Estonian authorities are saying they continue to wait for word from the managers of a detained tanker that the issues leading to its detention have been resolved. TheKiwala(115,000 dwt) remains anchored in Muuga Bay and is being guarded by the Navy including with its flagship and patrol boats.\nEstonian authorities with the Transportation Administration told the news outlet ERR that theKiwala's captain and crew have been cooperating with the investigation. They are however waiting for confirmation from the oil tanker's representative that the ship's issues have been resolved.\nKristjan Truu, Director of the Maritime Department at the Transport Administration, had said when the ship was detained on April 11 that they were hopeful for a “swift resolution.” Speaking to ERR he said, \"Once we have received confirmation, inspectors from the Transport Administration can go on board to carry out a follow-up inspection.\"\nOver the past year, Estonia officials said there has been an increase in unknown insurance-covered vessel transits through the Gulf of Finland. These activities they assert pose a threat to Estonia’s critical infrastructure, safe navigation, and the marine environment. As such, they said they were acting under their rights and obligations as a port state when they stopped the vessel for an inspection.\nSince June, the Transport Administration reports it has inspected the documents of 458 vessels. During these inspections, a variety of insurance documents were submitted to the authority. One forgery was identified, and additional documents suspected of being falsified were sent to the relevant flag states for verification. In cooperation with other authorities, the Transport Administration reports it had also conducted inspections of seven vessels in anchor areas.\nWhat initially started as a routine check of documents however quickly escalated aboardKiwalainto the ongoingdetention. The ship claimed to be registered in Djibouti, but in a check, they were told the flag had been withdrawn due to “illegal activities.” The tanker is sanctioned by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland for previous illegal activities.\nInspectors spent the full day aboard the vessel on April 11 and carried out an extended inspection of the vessel. They identified several significant deficiencies that led the authorities to say the vessel could not be allowed the vessel to continue its voyage, as maritime and environmental safety cannot be guaranteed.\nOut of the 40 deficiencies, 29 were significant and constituted the basis for detaining the vessel. The majority of these — 23 in total — were related to documentation, while the remaining deficiencies concerned the implementation of the ship’s safety management system, crew preparedness for various shipboard emergencies, and technical issues.\nUntil the authorities have been satisfied that all the issues have been corrected, Estonia will continue to detain the tanker. It was traveling in ballast inbound for Russia’s Ust-Luga terminal.\nThe European Commission announced yesterday that it was also moving to tighten restrictions on vessels transiting European waters. Even if the vessels are not making a port call, the EC resolution now requires the vessels to file proof of insurance. It is seen as a further crackdown targeting vessels such as theKiwalaoperating as part of the shadow fleet servicing the Russian oil industry."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. government is continuing its support to strengthen the capabilities of the Tunisian armed forces to enable them to respond effectively to a fragile security situation and a worsening immigrant crisis in the northern Africa region. According to U.S. officials in Tunisia for the commissioning of two former USCG cutters, these steps are reinforcing the enduring partnership between the two countries.\nThe two Island Class patrol boats, which had been part of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) fleet for years before they were decommissioned, were commissioned into at the naval base in La Goulette on April 17. They are expected to help the North African nation deal with growing security challenges including human trafficking, smuggling, organized crime, illegal immigration, and terrorism.\nNow christenedTazargaandMenzel Bourguiba, the two 34-meter vessels were part of the 49-vessel Island class that was built between 1985 and 1992 for the U.S. Coast Guard. One of their key missions was in the war on drugs and later their mandates were extended to encompass the whole range of Coast Guard missions including search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, migrant, and military operations. The Island class ships, all of which were built at Bollinger's Lockport, Louisiana shipyard, are being replaced with Sentinel-class patrol boats.\nToday, a majority of the boats have been retired from American service but most continue to serve in many allied foreign coast guards and navies. Among the recipients of the ships are Pakistan, Ukraine, Greece, Georgia, and Costa Rica.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. contends the donation of the two vessels to the Tunisian Navy is critical in strengthening Tunisia’s capacity to secure its maritime borders and advance regional security. Equipped with twin diesel engines that allow them to achieve speeds of up to 30 knots, the boats can operate over a range exceeding 3,000 nautical miles, a capability that is ideal for patrolling Tunisia’s vast coastline. Each vessel is armed with a 25mm Mk 38 machine gun and two .50 caliber machine guns and also features advanced radar and navigation systems.\nThe two vessels are the latest military assets that the U.S. has donated to Tunisia. In recent months, the U.S. has also donated four Textron C-208EX aircraft and six C-130 military aircraft to the Tunisian Air Force to support its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. Apart from military assets and equipment donations, Washington has also invested more than $1 billion in security cooperation with Tunisia since 2011.\nThe commissioning ofTazargaandMenzel Bourguibainto the Tunisia Navy fleet coincided with a scheduled port visit of the Blue Ridge-class command and control ship, USS Mount Whitney to the country as part of the U.S. commitment to regional stability.\n“The visit is especially meaningful because it falls during the 220th anniversary of the 1805 Battle of Derna, when, through the support and cooperation of Tunisia, the U.S. military defeated maritime terrorism to make a more stable and secure region for commerce and economic development,” said Joey Hood, U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia.\nForward deployed to Gaeta, Italy, Mount Whitney, is part of the 6th Fleet area of operations that supports U.S. national security interests, security, and stability in Europe and Africa."

        "content": "The on-again-off-again acquisition of the maritime business from Spire Global by Kpler closed on Friday, April 25, the agreed date in a settlement between the two sides, but not without a new wrinkle to the contentious combination. The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed it has opened an investigation into the proposed business combination requiring the companies to be independently operated.\nKpler confirmed in the closing announcement that it is working closely with the relevant regulatory authorities and in particular with the UK Competition and Markets Authority “in light of their review of the transaction.” Both sides had to enter into a compliance statement with CMA promising to operate the business units separately, not sharing technology or confidential business data. In addition to not moving forward with an integration, they committed to ensure that sufficient resources are made available for the development of both businesses, on the basis of their respective pre-merger business plans and maintain their current product offerings.\nDespite the latest glitch, Kpler called the closing a “strategic move that bolsters Kpler's capabilities in maritime data and analytics.” Mark Cunningham, CEO of Kpler, said \"The addition of this high-quality data will unlock greater value for our customers and partners by providing increasingly comprehensive and timely insights into global trade flows. It's about helping them navigate complexity, uncover opportunities, and make better decisions every day.\"\nSpire reported the completion of the sale for approximately $233.5 million, before adjustments, plus a $7.5 million agreement for services over a twelve-month period, post-close. Spire reports it used the proceeds of the sale to retire all outstanding debt and that the remaining proceeds will be used to invest in near-term growth opportunities. It followed thetermsfirst announced for the deal in November 2024.\nSpire Global reported in February it hadfiled a lawsuitagainst Kpler for a failure to close the acquisition of its maritime group while also warning shareholders of potential debt problems if the deal is not completed. At the time, it said it believed all the conditions to closing contained in the purchase agreement had been satisfied, but that Kpler had not moved forward with the closing. Three weeks ago, Spire reported an agreement had been reached to resolve the litigation and mutually release claims, if the closing occurred by April 25.\nIn the CMA filing, it came out that Kpler had communicated with the regulator on February 25, March 11, March 12, March 24, March 31, and April 10, requesting that the CMA consent to derogations to the Initial Enforcement Order. CMA agreed on April 16 to permit Kpler to have a level of oversight of the acquired company while requiring that they be kept independent and Spire’s business continue as a going concern so as not to prejudice the investigation. CMA reports it is continuing to consider if the combination may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in any market or markets in the United Kingdom.\nSpire Maritime built its niche with real-time capabilities by designing, building, and deploying nanosatellites, each the size of a wine bottle, in a constant earth orbit collecting data from all the ships. Kpler said when the deal was announced it would expand its data reach, offering comprehensive visibility across open oceans. Management said the acquisition would further strengthen Kpler’s commitment to delivering superior real-time data and analytics to its clients, supporting informed, data-driven decision-making across the global supply chain.\nKpler in 2023 acquired MarineTraffic a portal for AIS data, mapping, and visualization along with FleetMon, a vessel database. Access to Spire Global’s proprietary satellites and analytics would enhance the portfolio.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Spire Global retains its satellite network, technology, and infrastructure. It said it would focus its business on its customers in aviation, weather, and the space services sectors."

It points to the growing uncertainties in global supply chains saying the acquisition as well as a new equity position in ORBCOMM build on the complementary strengths to provide greater essential intelligence to customers.\nORBCOMM was one of the pioneers in AIS which S&P highlights is used today to track and monitor vessels, enhancing maritime visibility and delivering critical insights that support business intelligence and decision-making for government and commercial clients worldwide.\nThe standardized AIS system began to emerge in the 1990s and by the early 200s, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was moving to mandate the use of AIS. It was first introduced for newbuilds and later required as retrofits to all ocean-going commercial vessels.\nSince 2004, ORBCOMM's AIS vessel tracking technology has incorporated high-quality, proprietary data with satellite and terrestrial-based coverage. Its AIS solutions are utilized for diverse applications such as supply chain visibility, maritime safety, surveillance and security, environmental monitoring, regulatory compliance, and more.\n\"With the uncertainties surrounding global markets and supply chains, this strategic acquisition underscores our commitment to investing in differentiated data and solutions that can help our customers navigate the volatility,\" said Whit McGraw, Head of Risk & Valuations Services at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"ORBCOMM's AIS data services business offers cutting-edge technology and coverage that strengthens our energy transition and maritime supply chain offering, giving us ample opportunity to invest in new product innovations.\"\nThe financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. ORBCOMM's AIS data services will be integrated within the S&P Global Market Intelligence division of S&P Global.\nS&P Global also announced it has entered into an agreement to take a strategic equity position in ORBCOMM. The two organizations report they will create a strategic alliance to develop a range of differentiated supply chain data and insight offerings.\nIn addition to the maritime applications, ORBCOMM offers services dedicated to the overland transport sector as well as heavy industry. The company also offers satellite connectivity services and it is used by government as well as sectors such as natural resources.\nThe companies said the acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close during 2025."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "German renewable energy giant RWE is set to announce that it has stopped its offshore activities in the United States and setting higher requirements for future investments because of the “political developments.” The company follows TotalEnergies, Shell, and BP which previously announced they were backing away from projects in the U.S., and Equinor which last week said it is considering “legal remedies” after Trump’s Department of Energy suspending offshore work on a full-permitted wind farm off New York.\nRWE released a manuscript of the speech Dr. Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE, will deliver next week, April 30, during the company’s annual meeting. In the speech, he will highlight the company’s many successes in 2024 and the progress being made on the Sofia wind farm for the UK and with the Danish wind farm Thor. He notes RWE has a combined offshore wind farm capacity currently of 3.3 GW and a further four projects with a capacity of 4.4 GW under construction.\nTurning to the U.S. market environment, Krebber will tell shareholders, “We have stopped our offshore activities for the time being,” while the company has also introduced “higher requirements for future investments in the U.S.” He says despite the company’s success with onshore wind, solar energy, and battery storage, “Nevertheless, we remain cautious given the political developments.”\nRWE became the largest leaseholder in the New York Bight with a potential 3-gigawatt area it won in the hotly contested 2022 offshore auction. At the end of the same year, RWE won a lease area to develop up to 1.6 GW off the coast of Northern California, which it projected would be one of the first commercial-scale floating wind farms in the country. It is also working with Greater New Orleans and GNOwind Alliance for regional opportunities. It launched site investigations off California in 2024 and proposed the Community Wind project with 1.3 GW of capacity to New York State.\nThe company in November 2024 warned it was delaying investments citing higher risks for offshore wind in the U.S. and a slower ramp-up of the European hydrogen economy. Krebber will tell shareholders next week the company has raised its threshold expectations for new investments. For future projects, he says they will increase the average return requirement from 8 percent to more than 8.5 percent.\nFor the U.S., he notes while the company surpassed 10 GW of generation capacity from renewable energy at the start of 2025, RWE will enforce higher requirements for future investments. This includes having all necessary federal permits in place, tax credits being safe harbored, and all relevant tariff risks mitigated. Only if these conditions are met for future investments, for the time being in onshore wind and solar, will it “be possible given the political environment.”\nDevelopers of U.S. offshore wind projects remain concerned after the moves by the Trump administration including launching a review of the leasing process, pulling permits for projects in New York and New Jersey, and stopping funding on a research project in Maine. At the beginning of the month, four offshore projects were reported to be proposing to delay their state-level regulatory reviews. Shell reported in November 2024 that it would take a $1 billion charge as it moved away from U.S. offshore wind projects and Equinor said if a full-stop ensues for its Empire Wind project, it would have to repay $1.5 billion in financing and would be exposed to termination fees from its suppliers."

According to Iranian media reports it killed at least 14 people and six others are listed as missing. The number of people injured is varying widely in the reports with the Minister of Interior of the Pezizkian government saying at least 300 people are in the hospitals and another 200 were treated and released. Some reports suggested as many as 750 people were injured.\nOffice buildings in the port have been damaged and glass blown out of windows. The immediate neighborhood around the port is a commercial rather than a residential area which helped to reduce the number of people in the immediate vacinity.\n\nFootage shows the moment an explosion occurred in Shahid Rajaee Port, Bandar Abbas.pic.twitter.com/Sjl1X9LJqP\n\nThe explosion is believed to have started in a container stored in the hazardous and flammable section of the container park. An extensive container storage park lies immediately to the north of the port’s container loading quays. The Shahid Rajaei commercial port handles about 85 percent of Iran’s non-oil and gas exports and imports, and is connected to Iran’s transnational rail network.\nThe Iranian authorities have for some years been planning an expansion of the port to increase throughput. The commercial port lies 10 miles to the west of the Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor, which is the homeport to most of Iran’s regular Navy.\n\nFire continues to spread to nearby containers as fire fighters attempt to control the blaze at Bandar Abbas' Shahid Rajaei port.Follow Press TV on Telegram:https://t.co/0EMmcJs6DLpic.twitter.com/6usWBzXrWE\n\nIn February and March, The Maritime Executive tracked the progress from China of two sanctioned ships owned by Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), MVGolbonand MVJairan, which then unloaded their cargoes of sodium perchlorate at Bandar Abbas. Sodium perchlorate is processed and fashioned into ammonium perchlorate rocket fuel at the Iranian facilities at Parchin south of Tehran and Khojir. Ammonium perchlorate makes up 70 percent of the standard fuel load of most of Iran’s solid-fueled ballistic missiles, such as medium range Khybar-Shikan and Fattah missiles, and the shorter range Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles.\nIt is not known if containers unloaded from the two ships were, several weeks after unloading, still in the Sina container port at the time of the explosion, or whether the containers formed the seat of the explosion. As would be expected, an Israeli spokesman denied any knowledge of the explosion, although the Times of Israel was the first media organization to point out a possible connection.\n\n\nUnusually, heat from the explosion is not yet showing in NASA fire-detecting imagery showing the Shahid Rajaei port; heat spots shown are of oil refineries and the Hormozgan steel works (FIRMS)."

        "content": "In the wake of a terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, in which 26 tourists were killed by gunmen, both India and Pakistan have put their forces on alert in the expectation that India will launch reprisal attacks and that Pakistan will respond.\nThe attack in Kashmir’s southern district of Anantnag was the first such act of terrorism since October 2001, when terrorists killed 35 people outside the Jammu and Kashmir state legislature. But tension between India and Pakistan over the status of Jammu and Kashmir has existed since independence, when after fighting a defacto border was established, leaving most of the province in Indian hands. The two countries then fought wars in 1947–1948, 1965, 1971, and 1999, with the status of Jammu and Kashmir the principal source of contention. The first two wars were draws, with numerically superior India gaining the upper hand in 1971 and 1999.\nIndia has suspended the Indus Water Treaty, under which river waters are shared; has expelled Pakistani nationals and defense attaché staff; and has closed border crossing points. Pakistan has replied by taking similar measures.\nSince Pakistan matched India’s nuclear capability in 1988, both countries have had to balance a desire to take robust military action against the risk that fighting will escalate out of control and threaten the use of nuclear weapons.\nNaval warfare played a major role in the 1971 war, with Indian carrier-borne aircraft crippling the Pakistani naval presence in the East, and the Pakistani navy in the West largely neutralized by missile boat attacks. The Pakistani submarine PNS/M Hangor (S-131) did manage to sink the Indian frigate INS Khukri (F149) and damage a second, INS Kirpan (F144). In the 1999 war, India successfully imposed a naval blockade on Pakistan’s principal port of Karachi, and the resulting shortage of imported fuel was a factor in Pakistan accepting the ceasefire that ended the war.\n#AreaWarning#Pakistanissues a notification for firing by naval ships in the Arabian Sea Region south of KarachiDates | 26-27 April 2025pic.twitter.com/Zr4XHHA5Ct\nIf relations worsen further, the Indian Navy is likely to attempt to impose another naval blockade as a passive option with less escalatory risk, and deployments are likely to have taken place accordingly. Whilst most deployments will be kept secret, the Indian Navy’s carrier INS Vikrant (R11) was spotted off the coast of Goa on April 23. The Indian Navy also has five operation Kilo-class submarines, and up to ten smaller Scorpene and Type-209 diesel electric attack submarines.\nPakistan has issued a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen/Mariners) for the Arabian Sea and initiated a naval live fire exercise, blocking a large sea area on the Exclusive Economic Zone border between the two countries and covering the sea approaches to Karachi. Pakistan can deploy up to eight French-built Agosta-70 and Agosta 90B Class submarines.\nPotentially, both Indian and Pakistani precautionary naval deployments may impinge on commercial traffic, although international maritime transit routes can be adjusted southward to avoid potential areas of conflict."

        "content": "\nOn Sunday, U.S. Central Command said that its multiweek campaign of airstrikes against Yemen's Houthi militant group is having an effect, and the number of Houthi missile and drone attacks on U.S. Navy warships is beginning to come down.\nSince the operation began on March 15, U.S. forces have carried out more than 800 strikes on Houthi targets, CENTCOM said, killing hundreds of the group's fighters and multiple members of its leadership. The casualties include \"senior Houthi and UAV officials,\" and the command said that it is using intelligence to reduce civilian harm.\nCENTCOM declined to divulge the specifics of past or future targets for reasons of operational security. It has had serious issues with leaks in the recent past: at the outset of the campaign, a group of senior U.S. leaders accidentally gave a reporter the details of imminent strike force launch times, target sequencing and time on target - sensitive advance information about when U.S. pilots would be arriving over Yemen.\nCENTCOM has declined to discuss any details of the time or location of its strikes, but it has released a list of the types of installations it is targeting. The target list includes command centers, air defense systems, weapons factories, and weapons storage locations. The command is prioritizing the advanced weapons that the Houthis have used against shipping - anti-ship ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, UAVs and drone boats.\nThe destruction of the Houthi-operated fuel port at Ras Isa will begin to have a broader effect on the group, too, the command said. The port handled fuel imports critical for the Houthis' military operations; its commercial traffic also made it a major source of tax revenue for its Houthi overseers.\nTwo carriers remain on station in the Red Sea to carry out ongoing strikes, supported byB-2 strategic bombersoperating out of Diego Garcia. \"We will continue to increase the pressure and further disintegrate Houthi capabilities as long as they continue to impede freedom of navigation,\" CENTCOM said.\nThe Houthis still retain the ability to launch attacks on shipping and continue to target U.S. warships. However, the militant group now operates at a much reduced tempo, the command said. The number of ballistic missile launches has dropped by nearly 70 percent, and suicide drone attacks are down by 55 percent. The fact that the Houthis retain an ability to launch attacks suggests continued Iranian support. \"The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime,\" CENTCOM concluded."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nOne year after the official declaration of the fourth global coral bleaching event, NOAA and the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) have updated the initial impact of the catastrophe. From January 2023 to March 2025, the bleaching event has impacted 84 percent of the world’s reefs, with 82 countries and territories reporting damage.\nAs sea surface temperatures continue to rise, bleaching-level heat stress has been extensively reported across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean basins. Bleaching occurs when corals lose their colorful photosynthetic algae (Zooxanthellae), revealing the white calcium carbonate skeleton. When this occurs, the corals are left without their primary energy source, which could lead to death unless temperatures drop. This time, though, scientists are concerned that bleaching will simply be a state of being going forward.\n\"We just may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event. So this may be the last one,\" marine scientist and former NOAA Coral Reef Watch coordinator Dr. Mark Eakin told PBS.\nThe first global coral bleaching event was declared in 1998, with 21 percent of reefs experiencing bleaching-level heat stress. This rose to 37 percent in the second event in 2010 and 68 percent during the third event (2014-2017).\nScientists have called the fourth event unprecedented, starting with some bleaching episodes from May 2024. This has seen a widely-used bleaching prediction platform adding three new levels (Level 3-5) to its Bleaching Alert Scale, which indicates heightened risk of mass coral mortality. The previous highest level, Level 2, indicates risk of mortality to heat sensitive corals. The new level now, Level 5, indicates the risk of over 80 percent of all corals on a reef dying due to prolonged bleaching.\nThe fourth bleaching event is happening at a time that the global average temperature is rising. NASA confirmed 2024 as the warmest year on record. The average surface temperature in 2024 was 1.28 degrees Celsius above NASA’s 20th-century baseline (1951-1980), topping the record set in 2023. This contributed to record-breaking ocean temperatures, and triple the previous record number of marine heatwaves around the world.\n“The fact this most recent, global-scale coral bleaching is ongoing, takes the world’s reefs into uncharted waters,” said Dr. Britta Schaffelke, Coordinator of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN). “In the past, many coral reefs around the world were able to recover from severe events like bleaching and storms. We need to continue to observe and measure if and how reefs will recover and change, to help inform the combination of conservation measures most suited for a particular reef.”"

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\n\nArchaeologists have confirmed the identity of two 18th-century shipwrecks in Costa Rica that for years were thought to be pirate ships. It has now been confirmed that the wrecks located in shallow waters off Cahuita National Park are those of Danish slave shipsFridericus QuartusandChristianus Quintus,which were shipwrecked off the coast of Central America in 1710.\nThe National Museum of Denmark is announcing that after analyzing samples taken from the shipwrecks, archaeologists have finally managed to resolve their mystery, bringing to an end years of speculation that they were pirate ships.\nWhile the history of the two ships is well known and documented, their resting place had remained a mystery. Records show that in 1708, the two ships sailed from Copenhagen via West Africa towards Saint Thomas in the West Indies. Over several months of sailing along the coast of West Africa, the holds of the ships were filled with hundreds of slaves and made ready for the long voyage across the Atlantic.\nIn the spring of 1710, the two ships were in the Caribbean Sea. During the voyage across the Atlantic, however, they had gone off course, sailing nearly 2,000 kilometers further west than their intended destination, the Caribbean island colony of Saint Thomas in the Danish West Indies.\nSailing off course resulted in food and water rations running low, and a mutiny broke out among the crews of the two ships. The ensuing melee resulted inFridericus Quartusbeing set on fire.Christianus Quintushad its anchor cable cut so the ship drifted towards the coast, where it was crushed in the waves in shallow water and also sank.\nThe two wrecks were first discovered in the 1970s, although it was not until 2015 when U.S archaeologists discovered yellow bricks in one of the wrecks, igniting renewed interest in the history of the ships. In 2023, archaeologists from the National Museum of Denmark and the Viking Ship Museum carried out a diving mission to the two ships' resting place and took samples of wood and bricks that were part of the cargo. Several clay pipes were also found.\nDetailed analysis of the samples has returned results that are consistent with Danish medieval history and accounts of the two ships. Analysis of the wood showed the timbers originated in the western part of the Baltic Sea, with the tree having been cut down sometime during the years 1690-1695. The wood was charred and sooty, confirming historical accounts about one of the ships being set ablaze.\nThe bricks bore remarkable similarities to those manufactured in Flensburg for use in Denmark and the Danish colonies in the 18th and 19th century. Analyses of the clay showed it came from parts of Denmark that were home to a sizable brick-producing industry. The clay pipes were identified as ordinary, Dutch-produced pipes that were also used onboard Danish ships.\n“The analyses are very convincing and we no longer have any doubts that these are the wrecks of the two Danish slave ships. The bricks are Danish and the same goes for the timbers, which are additionally charred and sooty from a fire. This fits perfectly with the historical accounts stating that one of the ships burnt,” said David Gregory, National Museum marine archaeologist.\nThe project that led to the identification of the two shipwrecks, which was made possible through collaboration among several organizations, is part of a new mission by the National Museum to excavate several Danish shipwrecks abroad. The two ships are a reminder of Denmark’s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, which the government banned in 1792 (although slavery was not abolished until half a century later in 1847)."

Given its fittings, and North Korea's claims, it is likely capable of launching ballistic missiles - and nuclear payloads.\nNampo Shipyard's newly-launchedChoi Hyonis the first warship in North Korea that is fitted with vertical launch systems - and more than just one type. Just forward of the deckhouse, a block of VLS hatches shows two different sizes of cell - 32 small cells and twelve medium, 44 in total. Aft, there are 12 more small hatches, eight medium hatches, and 10 unusually large hatches, 30 in total. Taken altogether there are 74 cells of various types, just shy of the 80 cells on a Zumwalt-class destroyer. Amidships, there is a structure that likely conceals additional racks for angle-launched cruise missiles.\n\nCourtesy KCNA\nIn addition to its abundance of above-deck missile tubes and relatively compact size,Choi Hyun'smost visible feature may be its short-range air defense system. The War Zone notes that it appears to be identical to the Russian Pantsir-ME, and if functioning, it would be a thorny obstacle for an inbound aerial threat. The Pantsir-ME has a pair of Gatling guns co-mounted with eight short-range antiaircraft missiles, offering multiple ways to address inbound drones, aircraft or cruise missiles. Russia is deeply indebted to North Korea for the provision of arms, ammunition and manpower for the war in Ukraine, and it is possible that an advanced air defense system was part of the two sides' exchange.\nIn South Korea, the guest list attracted as much attention as the ship itself. Supreme leader Kim Jong Un attended the launch, accompanied by his daughter, referred to in Korean media as Kim Ju-ae. The younger Kim is believed to be 12-13 years old, and her identity is shrouded by the Kim family's preference for secrecy; even her name is a subject of debate. She has appeared alongside Kim Jong Un regularly at major state occasions and weapons tests, raising speculation that she could be in line as an heir to the North's hereditary leadership."

ILWU members work at the main container ports on the U.S. West Coast, and the volume of arriving import cargo is set to plummet because of the cost effects of the administration's 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods.\nIn a statement, the ILWU said that it expects to see massive job losses as a result of the tariffs. \"These tariffs are nothing more than a direct attack on the working class and should be opposed outright,\" the union said.\nCarriers have already begun to blank sailings in expectation that future demand for ex-China shipping routes will be reduced by the steep tariffs. Hapag Lloyed has reported a 30 percent cancellation rate for shipments out of China, and Bloomberg reports that the number of boxships en route from China to the U.S. is down by about 40 percent since the tariff announcement in early April. Some amount of substitution is expected as importers find new supply chain alternatives in Southeast Asia, but some products may become hard to find on store shelves, retailers have cautioned.\nThe ILWU warned that scarcity and inflation will impose a new burden on working families, citing estimates of a baseline cost of living increase of about $1600 per household per year. \"We refuse to accept policies that destroy jobs, inflate costs, and sell out the working class,\" said ILWU.\nThe tariffs depend on the White House's negotiating process, and could change at any time. The administration has already rolled back tariffs for electronics and semiconductors, reducing the levy for these key categories to ____. It is also reportedly finalizing a plan to cut the total effective rate on foreign car parts, which are essential for U.S. automotive manufacturers.\nChina has retaliated with tariffs of 125 percent on U.S. goods, along with a de facto suspension of heavy rare earth element exports. It is pressing the White House for substantial (or total) tariff relief as a precondition for talks. Beijing insists that there is no ongoing negotiation, despite the president's recent claims of high-level phone calls and meetings.\n\"As far as I know, there have not been any calls between the two presidents recently,\" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun. \"If a negotiated solution is truly what the U.S. wants, it should stop threatening and blackmailing China, and seek dialogue based on equality, respect and mutual benefit.\""

They will be used to load products in Saint John for deliveries mostly to Halifax, Charlottetown and St. John's. They will also be used when needed for voyages to U.S. Atlantic Coast ports and other destinations such as Quebec and Montreal. With a capacity of 260,000 to 265,000 barrels, they will transport gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other products.\nTo ensure that the tankers are future-ready, they are designed for potential methanol operations with an ABS Notation – Methanol Fuel Ready and also high voltage and shore power ready. They were designed with enhanced ballasting capabilities to optimize operations in the Bay of Fundy."

Without even paying the steep cost of electrofuels, the tanker met both FuelEU Maritime Targets for 2050 and IMO \"direct compliance\" carbon targets for 2044, decades ahead of time.\nThe unexpectedly high power of Bow Olympus' suction sails helped make it possible, Odfjell said. The 72-foot sails have driven fuel consumption down by as much as 40 percent in the best wind conditions, and 15-20 percent in \"good, but not perfect\" conditions, according to Odfjell VP of Technology Erik Hjortland. \"That translates to five tons of fuel saved per day, equivalent to a reduction of 15 tons of CO2 emissions per day,\" he said.\nEven light airs generated a noticeable effect, and the team used a new form of AI-driven weather routing to make the most of all available wind. AIS data shows that the ship took a changeable course rather than a fixed Great Circle route. The fuel savings were significant, and at current Rotterdam bunker pricing, they amounted to more than $2,000 per day - before taking into account any carbon price savings. (Best of all for a crew on a North Atlantic route, the sails have a roll-damping effect.)\n\"We are thrilled to note that our initial calculations are confirmed and even exceeded,\" said Hjortland in a statement. \"We can probably operate the sails more often than anticipated, positively affecting the already healthy return of investment figures.\"\nWhen this propulsion system was combined with certified all-waste-feedstock biofuel, Bow Olympus managed a GHG intensity reduction of 85 percent compared to operation on conventional fossil bunkers. This is about as close to zero as any ocean-crossing merchant tanker can accomplish with current commercially-available resources and technologies.  \"I am positive that we have begun charting a credible course toward carbon neutrality,\" Hjortland said."

It comes as Chian continues to invest in the sector and looks to become a competitor in the market dominated by a few European shipbuilders.\nThe second ship which was named Adora Flora City for its ties to Guangzhou, the southern city near Hong Kong, was floated overnight between April 27 and 28. According to the shipyard officials, it demonstrates China’s increasing proficiency and improved efficiency in cruise ship construction as the vessel is nearly 70 percent completed. Steel cutting began in August 2022 and the ship which is larger than the first cruise ship reached this point a month earlier in construction. Also, this project is being supervised by domestic Chinese teams where the first project was in cooperation with Italy’s Fincantieri and RINA class society. RINA continues to participate while emphasizing China’s large investments in developing the sector.\nThe new ship will operate under the colloquial name ofAida Huachengand is due to enter service at the end of 2026 from Guangzhou. It is based on the same design asAdora Magic City(Aida Modu) which was introduced at the start of 2024. Both ships are based on a Fincantieri design for Carnival Corporation, although the new ship has been lengthened 17.4 meters (57 feet) to an overall length of 341 meters (1,18 feet). It will be 141,900 gross tons with a total passenger capacity of 5,232 passengers.\n\n\n\nAdora Cruises, which is owned by CSSC, highlights that the interior design is being adapted to be “more beautiful, more technological, more Chinese.” The interior décor will be a combination of Art Nouveau style, the Maritime Silk Road, and Lingnan cultural elements. They are emphasizing the ship will provide a “more Chinese” cruise experience versus the first ship which more closely followed the Carnival designs or theAdora Mediterranea, which was acquired from Costa Cruises.\nAmong the changes the main atrium is doubled in size, the fitness area is being optimized, new suites are added, and there are upgrades to the dining and shopping areas. A new outdoor multifunctional space is also being created to host entertainment performances, leisure and healing activities, social interaction, and the coffee culture of its namesake city.\nThe construction timeline calls for the cruise ship to start sea trials in May 2026.\nAdora was conceived as a partnership between CSSC and Carnival Corporation but Carnival later sold shares to become a minority investor. The brand launched focused on the domestic Chinese market with the acquired cruise ship. Adora reports so far it has carried over 620,000 passengers. It looks to expand its operations with the new ship and increase the number of foreign passengers.\nChina highlights its developing efficiency and skills in cruise ship construction. It looks to compete for future projects against Fincantieri, Chantiers de l’Atlantique, and the Meyer yards in Germany and Finland, which are the leaders in building nearly all large cruise ships.\n"

        "content": "\nSupporting the Indian government’s ambitions to build the country’s role in international shipping, CMA CGM Group today marked the transfer of one of its ships to the Indian register. India which is already home to many seafarers wants to develop its shipping operations and expand its shipbuilding industry to more international shipping.\nCMA CGM was one of several major shipping companies including also Maersk and MSC Mediterranean Shipping toexpress interest in India. The company hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at its headquarters in February and said it would explore registering ships in India. The company is also looking at India’s shipbuilding and repair operations and already has investments in terminals located at Nhava Sheva Freeport, near Mumbai, and Mundra Port.\nToday, April 28, theCMA CGM Vitoriawas officially entered into the India registry while the ship was docked at the Nhava Sheva Free Port terminal. Built in 2008 and acquired by CMA CGM in 2022, the 33,434 dwt vessel was previously registered in Malta. Entering the Indian registry requires the ship to be crewed by Indian nationals and be classed by the Indian Registry of Shipping.\nThe vessel, which has a capacity of 2,592 TEU is deployed on a route between India, the Persian Gulf region, and the Red Sea. India’s Economic Times highlights that Indian ships pay a tonnage tax instead of corporate taxes and the country is considered “lender and regulatory unfriendly for fleet owners.” However, the news outlet says CMA CGM will soon transfer a second vesselCMA CGM Manaus(built in 2009 and 2,592 teu) from the flag of Malta to India. CMA CGM in its announcement said three more vessels after theCMA CGM Vitoriawill be transferred in the coming months to the Indian flag.\nIndia’s Directorate General of Shipping was credited with helping to facilitate the transfer. Officials said CMA CGM is “testing the waters.” They predicted more ships would follow.\n\n\nThe vessel is required to have an Indian crew and be classed by the Indian registry of Shipping (CMA CGM)\n\nCMA CGM highlights it is part of its 34-year presence in India noting that it currently operates 19 weekly maritime services that call in Indian ports. The company also recently opened a crew management office in Mumbai for its fleet. To facilitate the transfer, it set up an Indian subsidiary.\nThe Economic Times highlights that CMA CGM follows several other large shipping companies. BW LPG is the largest owner/operator of Indian-flagged VLGCs with nine LPG carriers and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines is the nation’s fourth-biggest fleet operator with nine oil, product, and gas carriers, reports the Economic Times.\nIndia’s state-run Shipping Corporation of India is the only operator of Indian-flagged containerships. It has three smaller vessels and a fourth under charter.\n"

        "content": "\nCMA CGM through its subsidiary CEVA Logistics is continuing the efforts to expand its logistics portfolio with the acquisition of Turkish logistics firm, Borusan Tedarik. The deal which is valued at approximately $440 million will double CEVA’s footprint in a key strategic market and provide new opportunities in other regions.\nBorusan Tedarik has been in operation for more than 50 years, providing comprehensive logistics solutions in Turkey. This includes contract logistics, finished vehicle logistics (FVL), full truckload (FTL), and less than truckload (LTL) ground transport, as well as air and ocean freight and customs. In 2024, Borusan Tedarik had a gross revenue of $567 million and approximately 4,000 employees.\nCEVA said the acquisition would nearly double the size of its warehousing and distribution operations in Turkey, adding approximately 570,000 square meters to its existing 620,000 square meters of warehouse space. Further, the combined ground transport activities would execute nearly one million transports per year in Turkey.\nThe deal also includes the transfer of Borusan Tedarik subsidiaries in Germany, Bulgaria, Hong Kong and China. Borusan Limani, another logistics company in the Borusan group that manages operations at the Borusan port on Gemlik Gulf in the Sea of Marmara, however, will remain with the Turkish group.\n“As a top 5 global logistics player, we have identified Turkey as one of our strategic geographies where we expect to grow significantly. Complementing our existing presence in Turkey withreputable experts and operations of Borusan Tedarik would put us in a position to offer even greater value to our combined customers,” said Mathieu Friedberg, CEO CEVA Logistics.\nCEVA reports it will emerge in the top 3 with the automotive industry in finished vehicle handling, Its ocean capacity will be increased by 25 percent, while its air capabilities will rank among the top 5 in Turkey.\nAs the logistics arm of the CMA CGM Group, CEVA is integrating other large logistics players recently acquired by the ocean carrier. These include Ingram Micro’s CLS Division, GEFCO and Bollore Logistics.\nUnder the terms of the agreement with Borusan, CEVA will acquire 100 percent of Borusan Tedarik, including 69.47 percent of the shares held by the private Borusan Holdings and the remaining 30.53 percent which is held by the publicly traded Borusan Yatlrlm. Closing the deal is subject to regulatory approvals."

The fishermen saved the crew of the vessel who are reported to be from Somalia.\n\nVideo shows Yemenis frantically rescuing hundreds of sheep from the Red Sea after a commercial ship ran aground off the coast of Yemen.The vessel was heading for Djibouti when it capsized, leading to the drowning of more than 160 sheep, according to local sources.pic.twitter.com/a5hpUhxCte\n\nAt least 160 of the animals are reported to have drowned while others remained trapped aboard the boat. Media reports are saying the vessel capsized.\nAnimal rights activists are citing this as another example of why live export must be eliminated. Middle Eastern countries maintain the trade due to dietary laws and ritual slaughter. Countries such as Australia and New Zealand have moved to end live export in the face of pressure from activists. The shipping company Wellard, which was once the largest operator for live export vessels, reported at the start of 2025 that it had sold its last ship and closed its shipping operations. However, Argentina in February 2025 repealed a more than 50-year old ban saying it was to support free trade and to grow Argentina’s export industry and role in world trade."

        "content": "The United States is continuing its pressure campaign against the Houthis in Yemen and Iran as the sponsors of the militants with a new round of sanctions. The Department of the Treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned three product tankers and their shipping companies for offloading products in Yemen after the expiration of U.S. licenses at the beginning of April.\nThe U.S. previously had authorized the offloading of refined petroleum products in Yemen as part of humanitarian aid, but the licenses ended as of April 4, 2025, after the Trump administration on March 4, re-designated the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The U.S. is linking the products to Iran’s oil sanctions evasion and says the Houthis are profiting from the shipment of goods through ports they control in Yemen. In particular, the U.S. is citing the discharge of refined petroleum products.\nTreasury highlights that the Houthis control the Red Sea ports of Hudaydah, Ras Isa, and Al-Salif, and assets the group is funneling millions of dollars derived from port revenue and the seizure of refined petroleum products imported through these ports to fund the attack campaign against U.S. interests and those of our allies in the region. Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender says the group sells refined petroleum products delivered through these ports at exorbitant prices on Yemen’s black market, which enables Houthi operatives to purchase military materials, creates an artificial shortage of essential goods for average Yemenis, and fuels rampant corruption among Houthi leaders.\nOne of the product tankers that was listed is the San Marino-flaggedTulip BZ(25,926 dwt) which was built in 1993 and is now owned by interests in Lebanon. The U.S. says the vessel finished discharging its cargo in Ras Isa on April 10 and that in the past it has been used to transport petroleum products for Iran. Previously as theGas Line(operating between 2012 and 2021), the U.S. says the vessel transported products for the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The Marshall Islands-registered Zaas Shipping & Trading Co, which facilitated the delivery of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) to Ras Isa is also being listed.\nThe second vessel, the product tankerMaisan(73,741 dwt), registered in Panama, completed offloading gas oil in Ras Isa on April 8. The vessel, built in 2005, is managed by the Mauritius-registered Bagsak Shipping and according to the U.S. has also been linked since February 2023 with the export of Russian crude oil and petroleum products. The U.S. says theMaisanwas previously managed by a company that was one of the top players in the shadow tanker fleet involved in the export of Russian crude oil and petroleum products defying Western sanctions.\nTheWhite Whale(37,263 dwt) was built in 2001 and is also linked to ownership interests in Lebanon. The U.S. reports the vessel finished offloading gas oil in Ras Isa on April 17. It is managed by the Marshall Islands-registered Great Success Shipping Company.\nTreasury is also reporting that two other previously sanctioned vessels are still delivering products to the Houthis. It identified an LPG tanker now namedClipper(29,458 dwt) for a recent shipment of Butane and propane to Yemen. The ship is now showing a false flag of Guyana according to the Equasis database and unknown management. The U.S. says in December 2022 the vessel then known asQueen Lucawas listed for its ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force.\nTheAkoya Gas, an LPG tanker built in 1997, registered in Tanzania in mid-April was at a berth in Yemen. The U.S. says it was blocked in September 2022 when it was operating asGas Allurefor its involvement in Iranian petrochemical and petroleum sales.\nU.S. Central Command announced on April 17 that it had attacked the Houthi-operated fuel port at Ras Isa. The port handled fuel imports critical for the Houthis' military operations while commercial operations also made it a major source of tax revenue for the Houthis.  CENTCOM reported yesterday, April 27, that since the bombing operation began on March 15, U.S. forces have carried out more than 800 strikes on Houthi targets greatly degrading their capabilities."

        "content": "\nFinland joined its neighbor Estonia in reporting a continuing increase in the number of suspicious vessels sailing in the Gulf of Finland and the waterways of the Baltic to and from Russia. The Finnish Coast Guard recounted an incident where a laden tanker had to be warned off the course it was on heading toward a shoal, the second in just months involving a shadow tanker.\nIn its weekly update, the Finnish Board Guard reports that an unnamed shadow fleet tanker carrying crude oil was nearing a dangerous shoal near the Kalbadagrund lighthouse east of Helsinki near Emäsalo on the Gulf of Finland. They determined the vessel was within about 10 minutes of reaching the shoal with the danger of “serious marine environmental damage” if the vessel had continued on its course.\nThe Maritime Traffic Center was able to reach the vessel by radio and warn it about the dangers. The vessel corrected its course. The Coast Guard says a similar dangerous situation took place in February in the same location. Again, another tanker belonging to the shadow fleet was on a dangerous course.\n“During the past week, several ships belonging to the so-called shadow fleet, whose flag state has been unclear, were again spotted in the Gulf of Finland,” says the Board Guard in its weekly summary. They noted that during the past week, “anomalies were detected” and investigated with the AIS signal from vessels registered in Panama and Liberia. “The Gulf of Finland Coast Guard continues to monitor the phenomenon,” they report.\nEstonia’s Foreign Minster Margus Tsahkna yesterday, April 28, also said his country was continuing to detect shadow fleet vessels sailing under flags of convenience. He said Estonia was the first country to start inspecting the vessels in June 2024 of the Russian shadow fleet. Since then, Tsahkna said his country has requested insurance documents from more than 500 ships and that it would continue to conduct Port State inspections of passing vessels.\nOne of these inspections resulted in the detention of a shadow fleet tanker, theKiwala, due to suspicions it was operating as a stateless vessel without insurance. Estonia detected 23 deficiencies due to documentation and another 17 technical issues saying 29 of the issues were grounds for the detention. After two weeks the vessel was able to demonstrate technical compliance and departed Estonia bound for Russia. However, according to Estonia’s Transport Administration, the vessel’s flag registration was only extended till May 7 by Djibouti, providing it time to transition. Djibouti reportedly canceled the registration at the beginning of 2025 due to “illegal activities.” The European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland all had previously sanctioned the tanker.\nFinland and Estonia each said they would continue to monitor vessels transiting the Baltic. Tsahkna also called for cooperation among the Baltic states to protect the marine environment from the continuing danger coming from the shadow fleet."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nData captured by the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations in Dubai suggests that Houthi attacks on shipping have largely ceased, the last incident recorded being an attempted attack on a ship by suspected pirates on April 15. The Houthis claim to have attacked the USSHarry S. Truman(CVN-75) in the Red Sea, but the US Navy doesn’t appear to have noticed. Occasional Houthi ballistic missile attacks on Israel have however continued. The only safe conclusion to draw at present is that the Houthi missile and drone capability is degraded, but that a resumption of attacks on shipping could still resume.\nThe conventional expert wisdom is that an air campaign against the Houthis will not dent their tenacious will to fight, the Houthis being stubbornly resistant to casualties and damage inflicted. Such impressions are reinforced by the large crowds that the Houthis are able to mobilize for political demonstrations, such as occurred in Sana’a on April 18.\nBut Houthi attempts to characterize the American strikes as an indiscriminate assault on civilians, copying the Hamas narrative in Gaza, have largely fallen on deaf ears. One of the largest civilian death counts occurred on April 20, when the Furwa Market in Old Sanaa was struck not by CENTCOM but by a defective Houthi anti-aircraft missile. An attempt to label a strike on a weapons store in a building under construction in Saada as an attack on a cancer clinic was disproven by the Houthis’ own images of the scene.\nA spokesperson for the Houthi Health Ministry reported on April 19 that 198 people had been killed since March, without indicating how many were civilians. There clearly was a large death toll following US attacks on port infrastructure both in Hodeida and the Ras Isa fuel terminal around April 24, but elsewhere attacks appear to have been relatively well calibrated and precise. On April 28, the Houthis claimed that 68 African migrants being held in a detention center were killed by an American airstrike.\nOn balance, the American airstrikes are causing neither an upsurge of support for the Houthi leadership, nor yet a revolt. Their Yemeni opponents think pressure is building on the Houthis, but that a tipping point has not yet been reached. On April 24, the head of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, wasstill speakingof ‘promising signs of a shift in the balance of power’ and ‘growing unity among anti-Houthi factions’.\nThis appraisal appears to be shared by CENTCOM campaign planners. For the moment, strikes are focused on the Houthi leadership, missile and drone infrastructure, sources of revenue and on technical cadres. Strike data from ISW andcompiled by @VleckieHonddo not yet show a focus on Houthi front line positions, particularly in the Marib and around Hodeida, where government forces would need to break through if they were to recapture key territory taken over by the Houthis.\nI plan to update this map every few days with newly located strikes. For now downloads of the source file will only be considered through requests over DMsLink to the map:https://t.co/te08WBdQxB\nConfirmed airstrikes recorded by @VleckieHond\nBut in the meantime, cumulative damage continues to be inflicted. While this pressure on the Houthis continues and builds, CENTCOM gives no indication of any intent to scale back its assault, despite attrition of munitions stocks and MQ-9 Reapers.\nHence the campaign is settling in as a battle of wills, and the Houthis appear to have the weaker hand. Notwithstanding their reputation for resilience, the Houthis have in the past succumbed to pressure - but only when threatened by a loss of territory to their Yemeni opponents. As for Houthi political obduracy, it should be remembered that the Royalist faction under Imam Muhammad al-Badr in Yemen’s civil war of the 1960s came from the Shi’a stronghold in Saada which is now the Houthi heartland - and in those days they accepted military support both from the British and the occasional paradrop of weapons from the Israelis. If the threat to shipping is to be definitively brought to an end, reflected in the risk assessments and responses of the maritime community, then a significant political change in Houthi thinking will still be necessary."

        "content": "Estonian officials confirmed on Saturday, April 26, that the shadow fleet tanker they had been detaining for two weeks had been released reporting the vessel was now technically in compliance. TheKiwala(115,577 dwt) was stopped on April 10 while it was transiting the Baltic and a standard Port State inspection raised concern about the legitimacy of its flag and insurance as well as multiple deficiencies.\nThe Estonia Transport Administration last week reported it was stillwaiting for confirmationthat 40 deficiencies had been corrected. Its inspectors identified 29 issues that were grounds for detention. This included 23 issues related to documentation, in addition to issues with safety management aboard the tanker, crew preparedness for various shipboard emergencies, and unspecified technical issues. The vessel is also operating under sanctions from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland.\nThe key question related to the vessel’s flag state. Estonia reported that the ship said it was registered in Djibouti, but records showed that the flag had been withdrawn at the start of the year. Estonia’s foreign ministry however reports it received information from Djibouti that it would accept the vessel until May 7. A confirmation letter was submitted to the Estonian Transportation Administration for what was called a “transitional period” with the documentation valid for another week and a half.\nThe tanker was re-inspected and the results of an audit of the vessel’s class society were checked. Estonia reports the technical issues had been corrected and so the detention order was lifted. The authorities said the vessel’s Chinese captain and international crew had cooperated. The Director of the Transport Administration told ERR News, “Technically, the ship is in order and it may depart.”\nAIS signals show theKiwalagot back underway over the weekend and is arriving tomorrow, April 29, at the Russian port of Ust-Luga. The ship was traveling from Sikka, India, where it departed on March 11. Equasis shows the vessel managed from China but lists the Djibouti flag as false.\nThe vessel has been flag hopping and listed multiple managers over the past three years. There was no word of what flag it would be moving to in May.\n“The whole incident confirms once again that there are significant deficiencies in the registers of the so-called flags of convenience countries and the data is not reliable and communication with them is problematic,” said Estonia’s Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna.\nHe declared that his country would continue to deter Russian shadow fleet vessels that are sailing under a flag of convenience. He said since June 2024 the country has stopped over 500 ships to request insurance documents while they are transiting the Baltic. He said they would continue to work with other Baltic countries to ensure the safety of shipping."

        "content": "\nOn Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal to provide no-cost transits for all U.S. naval and merchant vessels. The remarks on Panama reflect his previous statements, but this is the first time that Trump has made equivalent demands about access to the Suez Canal.\nIn a social media post, Trump claimed that the French- and Egyptian-built Suez Canal \"would not exist without the United States of America,\" and said that he has instructed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \"immediately take care of, and memorialize, this situation.\" The remarks drew outrage from Egypt's political class - but not its rulers, who have remained quiet.\nThe Suez Canal was built by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps' Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez during the period of the U.S. Civil War, supported by participation from international shareholders. The privately-funded work started in 1859, and it initially depended upon forced labor. Despite the warnings of naysayers, and a substantial number of casualties during construction, the canal opened in late 1869 and was an immediate commercial success. It passed into British hands in 1882, and British troops defended it from attack until Egypt nationalized it in 1956. Under the current Egyptian administration, it has been widened and expanded, with new parallel channels for two-way traffic.\nAccording to Al Jazeera, U.S. traffic accounts for about 10-20 percent of the volume on the Suez Canal, and generates fees of $400-700,000 per vessel traffic for the Egyptian government's Suez Canal Authority. Waiving these fees would be a significant blow to the SCA's already-reduced finances.\nEgyptian commentators have expressed surprise at Trump's demand, and have questioned whether the canal's existence depended on the U.S., given its French, British and Egyptian operating history.\n\"[Egypt] refused the presence of any military bases from the Americans and before them the Russians,\" said Egyptian member of parliament Mahmoud Badr in a social media statement. \"The Suez Canal was built by Egyptians with their blood, nationalized by Egyptians, and is protected by the Egyptian army.\"\nEgypt's Civil Democratic Movement, which includes several of the country's political opposition parties, accused Trump of \"a lack of historical awareness and unacceptable arrogance.\"\n\"The Egyptian people consider the Suez Canal a red line and will never accept any infringement on Egypt's sovereignty and national security,\" the group said in a statement. \"They will follow in the footsteps of their fathers and grandfathers in defending their nation's freedom and territorial integrity.\"\nRed Sea security\nOver the course of the past year, the Suez Canal's traffic levels have fallen drastically due to the Houthi threat in the Red Sea. The militant group carried out more than 100 attacks and caused two sinkings off Yemen in 2024; merchant shipping is now taking a cautious approach to the Suez route, and traffic on the canal has fallen by 60 percent since 2023.\nThe Houthis' stated objective - a Gaza ceasefire - briefly occurred with U.S. support in January; Israel ended that ceasefire in March, and the U.S. has turned to an intensive campaign of airstrikes to suppress the Houthis' capacity to interfere with shipping. If successful, this campaign would benefit Egypt and the Suez Canal.\nWhile the Houthis' operational tempo has fallen, the group still has the ability to launch drones and missiles - for now, focused on U.S. Navy and Israeli targets. Merchant shipping traffic levels remain low in the Red Sea, and most top shipping companies have said that they would wait until long after hostilities have ended before bringing their ships back to the area."

        "content": "\nGermany’s federally owned Deutsche Energy Terminal GmbH (DET) announced the arrival of its third FSRU unit and the second to be placed in the port of Wilhelmshaven. Coming a little over two months after another German company terminated an FSRU contract in the east, the country continues to work to balance the imports of LNG and plan for the country’s long-term energy needs.\nWith the support of the German government, the LNG import projects werestartedin 2022 to replace the flow of gas from Russia after the start of the war in Ukraine. Five FSRU units were chartered with the first going to Wilhelmshaven and later ones placed at strategic points around the country. The first LNG cargoarrivedin January 2023.\n“This winter, we saw how quickly German natural gas storage facilities are depleting. The discontinuation of pipeline-based gas deliveries via Ukraine at the turn of the year put our European neighbors under pressure,” said Dr. Peter Röttgen, Managing Director of DET. “Past experience has shown us: As long as renewables do not yet fully cover our energy needs, a reliable natural gas supply remains crucial.”\nA specially developed second terminal was built in Wilhelmshaven to support the arrival of the second FSRU unit. It is a purpose-built island jetty in the Jade Stream with the company highlighting the unique structure. While it is in the seabed of the Jade Stream, the steel structure has no physical connection to the dyke 1.5 kilometers away. It is connected to the onshore transfer station underwater via various pipelines.\n“In order to reliably fill the storage facilities for next winter and keep natural gas prices as low as possible for industry, commerce, and, last but not least, households, we need the capacity of LNG terminals to strengthen the resilience of our energy supply – especially in crisis situations,” said Röttgen.\nOn April 28, the FSRUExcelsiorreached Wilhelmshaven. The 277-meter-long Floating Storage and Regasification Unit built in 2005 and owned by the shipping company Excelerate Energy will be operated by DET. In the coming weeks, the floating regasification vessel will be connected to the long-distance gas grid and prepared for commissioning under strict safety requirements.\nWilhelmshaven02 is DET's second terminal in Wilhelmshaven and, together with Brunsbüttel, DET's third terminal. The FSRUExcelsiorhas a storage capacity of 138,000 cubic meters of LNG.\nIn 2025, the regasification ship will feed up to 1.9 billion cubic meters of natural gas into the German gas grid. This corresponds to the natural gas consumption for heating 1.5 million households in apartment buildings. In each of the two subsequent years, the regasification and grid feed-in capacity of the Excelsior will then reach up to 4.6 billion cubic meters, which is equivalent to the heating energy required by up to 3.7 million four-person households.\nDeutsche ReGas in Februaryterminated its charterfor the FSRUEnergos Power. The 174,000 cbm vessel had been operating since February 2024 as one of the two FSRUs on the 13.5 bcm/year Deutsche Ostsee LNG import terminal, located in the port of Mukran (Rügen Island), Germany. Reports suggested the vessel would be going to Egypt, but the 145,000 cbm FSRUNeptunewhich is 50 percent owned by Hoegh LNG and sub-chartered by Deutsche ReGas from TotalEnergies remained operational at the terminal in the eastern part of the country.\nData from the German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur), highlighted that the FSRUs now represent about eight percent of the country’s LNG imports. Approximately 69 TWh of natural gas were imported via the LNG terminals in Wilhelmshaven, Brunsbüttel, Lubmin, and Mukran during the 2024-2025 season."

The project is being called the “single largest direct foreign investment” in Louisiana’s history and a major sign of support for the Trump administration which has promised to dramatically expand the U.S. energy sector to supply the world.\nThe project wasacquired in 2024from developer Tellurian, but there had been rumors that Woodside might delay the massive project. The company recently announced it wasselling40 percent of Louisiana LNG Infrastructure, the operating company, to Stonepeak, a U.S.-based alternative investment fund. As part of the announcement for the final investment decision, Woodside reported Stonepeak will provide $5.7 billion toward the expected capital expenditure while Woodside will invest nearly $12 billion but has said it may look for additional strategic partners.\n“Louisiana LNG is a game-changer for Woodside, set to position our company as a global LNG powerhouse and enable us to deliver enduring shareholder returns,” said Meg O’Neill, Woodside CEO. “The project benefits from access to abundant low-cost gas resources in the United States and boasts an asset lifespan of more than 40 years. It also has access to well-established interstate and intrastate gas supply networks.”\nThe plan calls for a three-train, 16.5 million tonne annual capacity with the first LNG coming in 2029. It also has an expansion capacity for two additional LNG trains and is fully permitted for a total capacity of 27.6 Mtpa. With the addition of the project, Woodside reports the company will have the capacity to deliver 24 Mtpa from its global LNG portfolio in the 2030s.\nThe project, which was known as Driftwood LNG, is located near Lake Charles, Louisiana. Work had begun in March 2022 under the prior ownership with Bechtel Energy executing the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract to begin construction of phase one. The target was to reach the final investment decision with the project coming online by 2026 or 2027, but Tellurian encountered challenges launching a strategic repositioning in December 2023 with new management.\nThe original plan had called for 11 Mtpa in the first phase with a later expansion of 5.5 Mtpa. The advantage for Woodside in acquiring the project was that it was fully permitted and not subject to the hold on licenses launched during the review of the industry under the Biden administration.\nCritics however were quick to point out that the plant will contribute to greenhouse gas emissions with one forecast reported by The Wall Street Journal that it would add 1.6 billion tons of GHG emissions over its 40-year life. Others are highlighting the global efforts to expand LNG production and export including Qatar’s massive project which is nearing completion. While the U.S. has been the global export leader, many point out that as industry looks to move away from LNG to synthetic fuels and other alternatives that do not emit methane, consumption of LNG is expected to plateau. Bloomberg cites data that the LNG supply will exceed consumption by 2027 with the oversupply growing by the end of the decade.\nThe gas industry has also been critical of the U.S. Trade Representative's plan to require a portion of LNG exports to be transported on U.S.-built ships. The industry points out the U.S. has not built a modern LNG carrier and has not developed the specialized skills for these high-value vessels. South Korea continues to be the leader in the sector, although Chinese shipbuilders have been working to build their participation in the sector. South Korea's Hanwha Ocean said it was prepared to use its expertise and recently acquired Philly Shipyard tobuildthe first U.S. LNG carriers.\nAnnouncing that it was moving forward with the Louisiana project, Woodside cites strong and sustained demand for LNG expected in both Asia and Europe, as those markets pursue energy security and decarbonization aspirations. Woodside points to the marketing opportunities across the Pacific and Atlantic basins saying the project creates a balanced and resilient portfolio for the company."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nSpeaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box program this morning (April 29), the Port of Los Angeles’ Executive Director Gene Seroka forecasted a “precipitous drop” in volumes coming to the port as the impact of the Trump tariffs begins to materialize. Seroka was the latest in a series of warnings coming from across the shipping industry of the expected sudden drop in imports and the potential impact on U.S. consumers and the economy.\nSeroka who at the beginning of April forecasted the port would see a 10 percent decline in volumes in the second half of the year, said on CNBC that volumes would be down by more than a third next week compared to 2024. He said the port’s planning tool shows a 35 percent decline next week noting that approximately 45 percent of the port’s volume is made up of shipments from China.\nToday, the Port of Los Angeles is reporting that there are only six containerships on berth, down from 14 last Friday, April 25. While the report shows 44 vessels inbound between Asia but still outside the 40 nautical mile zone, the port also reflects that 20 sailings have been blanked by the carriers during May. That represents 253,500 TEU of capacity that has been canceled for the month while an additional 10 sailings (117,500 TEU of capacity) have already been canceled for June.\nSeroka told CNBC that the cancellations in May represent approximately a quarter of the usual number of ships arriving in the port. It will have direct repercussions on the jobs of the longshoremen and others working in the port as well as the trucking and warehousing industries.\nThe concerns are starting to ripple across the U.S. economy. The Conference Board reported today that consumer confidence plunged to a five-year low reaching levels not seen since the pandemic in May 2020. The report shows that the consumer confidence index fell 7.9 points in April to 86 with growing concerns over the job market and a looming recession.\nSeroka forecasted that consumers would begin to see the impact of the slowdown in imports with reduced choices on the shelves of retail stores. Other economists have been more dire in their outlook suggesting that Americans would soon begin to experience shortages and empty shelves rivaling the peak of the pandemic.\nRetailers appeared to rush shipments in March in an effort to build inventory. The Port of Los Angeles reported that March volumes were up nearly 5 percent for the month. During the first quarter, it said volumes were up better than 5 percent. This led Seroka to forecast on CNBC today that retailers have about five to seven weeks of full inventory left on their shelves.\nThe March trade deficit report from the Commerce Department supported the position that retailers rushed imports through the ports last month. The U.S. trade deficit for goods widened to a record high ($162 billion) in March with imports in total soaring to over $340 billion. The goods trade gap increased to just under 10 percent or an increase of more than $16 billion creating the imbalance despite a more than $2 billion increase in exports.\nSeroka forecast that the volumes coming out of China, except for a few commodities, would remain “light at best” until “some accord or framework can be reached with China.”"

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The Port of Antwerp is reporting that disruptions caused by a strike against the government have continued to mount today with no ocean or inland ships moving from the port which emerged last month as the busiest in Europe. Port officials are warning that the action will continue till Wednesday morning, and then they expect at least one to two days to clear up the mounting backlog.\nThe national authorities and the Port of Antwerp—Bruges began preparations on Monday afternoon, April 28, in order to bring the port traffic to an orderly stop. They said 25 ships were waiting to depart with another 31 waiting to enter, but expected that all traffic would be halted. The strike began Monday evening at 1930 and will continue till 0730 on Wednesday.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Antwerp-Bruges is reporting that a total of 74 ships are now waiting. In Antwerp, 38 vessels were unable to depart while on the North Sea, 36 vessels are waiting, all heading for Antwerp. Ships are unable to pass the lock at Scheldt, but unlike thestrike last month, the unions are not stopping work in the other main seaport of Zeebrugge.\n“The general strike of March 31 was a success, but the measures proposed by the government remain unpalatable,” said FGTB, one of Belgium’s unions and organizers of today’s stoppage along with the AVC. “We must keep up the pressure and push for change.”\nToday’s actions were focused on Antwerp and Brussels as well as regional centers around the country including Ghent. In addition to stopping vessel movements at the Port of Antwerp, the strikes stopped most air traffic. All departures are again suspended at Brussels Airport as well as more than half the arrivals.\nThe unions continue to protest planned changes by the new collation government that center on pensions, unemployment benefits, and budget cuts to the public service sector. AVC issued a list of demands saying workers are entitled to free and fair wage negotiations, union consultations when overnight, Sunday or overtime hours are required, and that there should be better flexibility for workers to have family time. The unions are calling for a minimum of five weeks of legal holiday for everyone.\nMedia reports indicate that at least 100 ships a day are using the port for access to the inland routes. During the strike at the end of March, the Port of Antwerp-Bruges estimated the backlog at over 50 ships, but since then port data showed Antwerp had become thebusiest container portin Europe. It surpassed Rotterdam in total volume during March.\nWhile the unions are promising to resume work on Wednesday, April 30, the following day, May Day (May 1) is a national holiday in Belgium. The unions have called for another day of rallies as they continue to press the collation government to relent on its planned cuts."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe christening and launch were held today, April 29, for the first of two new large car ferries ordered by Shinnihonkai Ferry Co. and Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency (JRTT). The vessels that incorporate the latest energy-saving designs are also part of a modal shift that is underway in Japan to realize the benefits of sea transport.\nThe new ferryKeyakiwill be approximately 14,300 gross tons. It will be 199 meters (653 feet) in length with a capacity for 286 passengers. Operating between Otaru in Hokkaido and Maizuru in Kyoto Prefecture, it will transport up to approximately 150 trucks and 30 passenger cars. It will have four 8,540kW main engines giving the vessel a speed of 28.3 knots. Travel time on the route is approximately 21 hours.\nBuilt by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Shimonoseki Shipyard & Machinery Works in Yamaguchi Prefecture, the yard highlights several advancements in the design of the ferry. TheKeyakiis the first ferry in Japan to adopt the latest energy-saving hull form, including a Katana Bow, and reduces water resistance by optimizing the shape of the stern. It will also have a ducktail.\nAnother unique feature is a propulsion resistance system that suppresses with an energy-saving roll-damping system combining an anti-rolling tank and fin stabilizers. MHI explains the anti-rolling tank contains water that shifts laterally within a ship's beam. When a vessel rolls, the tank water moves in the direction opposite to the rolling, easing the rolling effect. Together these innovations will enable five percent savings in energy compared to earlier vessels.\nMitsubishi also highlights a strong increase in the utilization of ferries as Japan is currently undergoing a modal shift to sea transport. They report it is in an effort to mitigate environmental impact by reducing CO2 emissions and to compensate for truck driver shortages arising from workstyle reforms.\nShinnihonkai Ferry reports the vessel will feature a comfortable design, including a three-story atrium entrance and a glass-enclosed elevator, as well as a two-story atrium forward salon at the bow. Passengers will be able to enjoy meals with a view of the sea at the restaurant and grill, and on the top deck where there will be an open-air bath where passengers can feel the breeze of the Sea of Japan. The ship's cabins include suites with ocean-view bathrooms, deluxe rooms with private terraces, state Western-style rooms equipped with showers and toilets, Japanese-Western rooms perfect for family trips, and rooms for bringing pets. Tourist class also offers a comfortable voyage with private berths.\nTheKeyakiis the ninth ferry built by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding for Shinnihonkai Ferry. Following the completion of outfitting and sea trials, the ship's handover is scheduled for December 2025."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThree of the best-known names in the shipping industry, Fredriksen, Ofer, and Wilhelmsen, the current large shareholders of Edda Wind have decided to take the company private. They report that the current ownership structure has emerged as a hindrance to their growth plans for the company.\nCurrently, Frediksen’s company Geveran Trading and Wilhelmsen New Energy jointly control approximately 67 percent of the shares of Edda Wind. Through a newly formed company Electric AS, the three investors plan to full control of Edda Wind and delist the firm from the Oslo Stock Exchange. They will make a mandatory cash offer for the shares they do not currently own offering a nearly 33 percent premium to the current price or a total valuation of $287.5 million.\nThe offer comes just days after Edda Wind, which owns and operates eight service operation vessels (SOVs) and commissioning service operation vessels (CSOVs) for the offshore wind market, released its 2024 financial results posting a 79 percent growth in revenues to €70.4 million ($80.2 million) and achieving a 161 percent increase in earnings (EBITDA).\nStarted in 2015 to focus on the emerging offshore wind sector, Edda Wind was an early mover when it comes to delivering purpose-built vessels for offshore wind farm operations. Management states that Edda Wind has already gained a solid track record of excellence in the offshore wind industry. The company is continuing to build out its fleet.\nThe three shareholders have teamed up to take control of Edda Wind after getting frustrated by the company’s slow rate of growth, particularly the acquisition of next-generation offshore wind service vessels.\n“Following a series of equity capital raises it has become evident to the three largest shareholders that it will be challenging to continue investing and scaling the company in a public setting,” the company said in the filing announcing the buyout. “A key hindrance for Edda Wind as a publicly listed company has been the concentrated ownership situation resulting in a low free float and poor stock liquidity.” The three investors said they are focusing on the ability to continue to grow Edda Wind’s fleet of next-generation offshore wind service vessels.\nEdda Wind is pushing ahead with fleet expansion and intends to add four newbuilds this year. Two of the vessels have already secured contracts upon delivery, including NB 967 which is set for delivery from Vard’s Vung Tau yard in Vietnam in the second quarter of the year. This will mark the company’s entry into the Taiwanese market which is projected to grow significantly over the coming years.\nAs a key player in the market, all the company’s vessels are designed to transport wind turbine technicians and other personnel, as well as equipment, spares, and consumables, to offshore wind farm sites. They also serve as accommodation hubs for technicians as they perform work on the wind turbines. The fleet of the CSOVs under construction will be able to accommodate up to 120 persons, while the SOVs can accommodate up to 60 persons.\nWith offshore wind experiencing significant growth, the company highlights stable market conditions with approximately 83 percent of vessel capacity for 2025 already booked."

When an engine room fire broke out, it burned through the ducts, opening the space to the atmosphere and allowing in oxygen - even though the crew closed every available damper and set off their CO2 system.\nAt about 0330 on January 30, 2024, the crew of the towboatJohnny Mwere maneuvering to enter the locks at the Kentucky Lock and Dam on the Tennessee River. They had four barges of rock and were pushing ahead. At 0333, as they slowly approached the lock wall to tie off, the pilot had difficulty maneuvering. Alarms began to go off in the wheelhouse, and a deckhand reported smoke around the outside of the deckhouse. Though they were not aware of it at the time, two cylinders on the port main engine had catastrophically failed, blowing fractured rod caps and other debris out through the crankcase covers on both sides of the engine. Evidence suggests that the engine continued to run on the remaining cylinders, throwing burning oil mist out through the side of the block and into the space.\nThe captain woke to the sound of smoke alarms in the accommodation spaces and ran to the wheelhouse. He had the pilot sound the general alarm, and the crew mustered on the foredeck. After an unsuccessful attempt to attack the fire with a fire extinguisher, the master closed the dampers and had the crew close emergency fuel shutoff valves. They activated the fixed CO2 system, and the engines all shut down.\nAt about 0350, the situation appeared more stable: the smoke had dissipated and the crew believed that the fire was out. The master took a moment to call the company and report the casualty, and the crew waited aboard the barge tow for further developments.\nAt about 0454, the smoke fromJohnny M'sengine room surged back. The captain led the crew back from the barges to the towboat so that they could recover their belongings, and then they abandoned ship onto a nearby Good Samaritan towboat.\nThe risk of fighting the fire from the good Samaritan vessel was deemed too high, and the vessel continued to burn unabated until about 0715, when a marine firefighting crew arrived and began to combat the blaze using the equipment on their fire boats. The effort continued until 1130, when the fire was declared out.\nThe damage toJohnny Mwas extensive and extended throughout all deck levels, especially the engine room and lower decks. The total cost came to $3 million.\nThe catastrophic failure of theJohnny M'sport side main engine, which initiated the fire (NTSB)\nFire investigators found that the air intake forJohnny M'smain engines had been supplied by two flexible, fabric ducts. These uninsulated ducts ran from the air intake openings on the side of each stack and down into the engine room. The vessel was not equipped with covers for these particular intake openings, NTSB said, so the crew had not closed them. When the fire broke out, it burned through the fabric ducts, and the space was no longer sealed from the atmosphere; oxygen could get in, and the CO2 from the extinguishing system could get out.\n\"Had the vessel been outfitted with covers for the main engine combustion air intake openings or the flexible ducting been made of a fire-resistant or noncombustible material or structurally protected from fire, oxygen likely would not have been able to enter the engine room, and the CO2 fixed fire extinguishing system likely would have been effective,\" NTSB concluded. \"Unprotected ducting has the potential to provide a pathway for fixed fire extinguishing agents, such as carbon dioxide, to escape and air to enter the engine room if the ducting is compromised by a fire within the space.\"\n\nThe flexible, flammable ducting aboard Johnny M (NTSB)\n"

According to the UK Ministry of Defence, intelligence analysts found a cluster of buildings south of Sanaa that were used for making drones \"of the type used to attack ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\" British forces attacked the facility in order to defend freedom of navigation and protect the UK's economic interests, the MoD said.\n\"This action was taken in response to a persistent threat from the Houthis to freedom of navigation. A 55% drop in shipping through the Red Sea has already cost billions, fueling regional instability and risking economic security for families in the UK,\" said British defense secretary John Healey.\nOffering more detail than U.S. forces have provided in recent months, the MoD said that Typhoon FGR4 fighters - with aerial refueling support from the UK's Voyager tankers - hit several of these buildings with Paveway IV guided bombs. \"Very careful planning had been completed to allow the targets to be prosecuted with minimal risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure,\" the UK MOD emphasized. \"As a further precaution, the strike was conducted after dark, when the likelihood of any civilians being in the area was reduced yet further.\"\nThe U.S. air campaign has completed more than 800 strikes since March 15, and has also taken aim at dual-use targets and individual Houthi leaders. On April 25, a U.S. strike destroyed the fuel terminal at the Houthi port of Ras Isa, along with an adjacent tanker truck depot; the strike killed an estimated 80 people, according to Houthi media. More than 100 more were reportedly injured, including - according to TASS - three Russian sailors who were aboard a nearby tanker."

        "content": "Finnish ship owner Wasaline is partnering with marine battery manufacturer AYK Energy to undertake the biggest battery retrofit so far carried out on a vessel. Built in 2021,Aurora Botniawhich was already billed as one of the most efficient vessels will add a new battery system nearly five times as powerful as its current system and which is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately a quarter.\nBuilt at Rauma Marine Constructions, the hybrid ROPAX FerryAurora Botniaentered service in August 2021 equipped with dual-fuel engines and batteries. It uses LNG, biogas, and batteries for the propulsion on its daily runs between Vaasa in Finland and Umeå in Sweden.\n“There’s growing demand for environmentally friendly transport, and intermodal cargo transportation from Europe is increasing yearly,” said Peter Ståhlberg, Managing Director of Wasaline. “Expanding our battery capacity is a major step that allows us to make our vessel even more sustainable and allocate more capacity to batteries and biogas.”\nAYK Energy reports it will build the new system at its manufacturing plant in China and it will be ready for installation on the ferry later this year. The project will take place at the end of 2025 at the Turku Repair Yard in Finland andAurora Botniawill return to service in January 2026.\nThe hybrid vessel is equipped with dual-fuel engines and currently has 2.2 MWh batteries. It uses electric-powered Azimuth thrusters. The new battery system will have a capacity of 10.4 MWh. According to the companies, the new system will slash fossil energy use by around 10,000 MWh annually.\n“This is the largest battery retrofit on a vessel to date, and we are extremely proud to be partnering with Wasaline as the provider of this advanced battery solution,” said Chris Kruger, Founder and President at AYK Energy. “AYK’s battery systems are built around safety. We are one of the few manufacturers to exclusively use LFP and have developed a system where the LFP chemistry is safer and has comparable energy density to NMC.”\nHe explains this project will exceed the previous biggest marine battery retrofit on theAIDAPrimacruise ship by about 500kWh. It is the next step in the fast-growing sector with AYK saying it is seeing a surge in demand for its batteries across the maritime industry. The manufacturer is supplying battery systems to tugs, OSVs, superyachts, fishing vessels, work boats, and even large container vessels as part of their power mix. AYK recently struck a deal to supply a 6MWh battery for the world’s first battery-methanol tug being built for Svitzer.\nAYK this year successfully installed the biggest marine battery systems ever built, two 12 megawatt-hour (MWh) Orion+ batteries for Brittany Ferries hybrid electric vessels theGuillaume de Normandieand its sister shipSaint-Malo. The vessels were built at China Merchants Jinling Shipyard Weihai."

Three of the injured people appear to have been Russian seafarers who were working aboard a foreign-flagged product tanker; the vessel reportedly called at Ras Isa despite the U.S. State Department's warning that all ships should cease trading at Houthi-controlled ports.\nThe vessel in question was the 54,000 dwt product tankerSeven Pearls. Flagged in St. Kitts and owned anonymously in Liberia, the agingSeven Pearlshas a history of port calls in Houthi territory. Over the past year, she has regularly traded between the UAE, Djibouti, and Houthi areas of Yemen, interrupted by a three-month detour to the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.\n\nSeven Pearls' AIS history, April 2024-March 2025 (Pole Star)\nSeven Pearls'AIS signature has not been detected by commercial AIS services in more than a month, and her last transmission put her in the vicinity of the Suez Canal.

Elements of the legislation, which was introducedoriginally introducedin December 2024, have also been worked into the Executive Order on shipbuilding signed by Donald Trump earlier in April as well as the U.S. Trade Representative’s proposed fees on Chinese-built ships calling at U.S. ports.\nThe legislation focuses on the fact that there are currently just 80 U.S.-flagged vessels in the commercial industry while contending that China has 5,500 ships. It points to the long decline in U.S. commercial shipbuilding and problems in recruiting, training, and retention of seafarers. It calls for oversight and consistent funding of U.S. maritime policy, making U.S. ships commercially competitive which it says can be done by cutting red tape and rebuilding the U.S. shipyard industrial base. It also seeks to address the staffing challenges.\n“After decades of dangerously neglecting our shipbuilding industry, we’re finally doing something about it,” said Senator Mark Kelly, a U.S. Navy veteran and the first U.S. Merchant Marine Academy graduate to serve in Congress. “The SHIPS for America Act is the most ambitious effort in a generation to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding and commercial maritime industries and counter China’s dominance over the oceans.”\nThe bill calls for 250 U.S.-flagged ships within 10 years with the creation of a Strategic Commercial Fleet program. To drive this expansion of U.S. merchant shipping the act would require a portion of U.S. imports from China to be moved on U.S. flagged ships starting in 2030. The U.S. Trade Representative’s plan includes a requirement that an increasing portion of LNG exports are transported on U.S. flagged ships while the bill expands on that and adds a requirement for government-funded cargo to also move on U.S. flagged ships.\nThe Trade Representative is calling for fees on Chinese-built ships and operators with Chinese-built ships as well as fees on all car and vehicle carriers. The new legislation expands on that with duties on vessels owned or operated by a “country of concern,” which are identified as China as well as Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Ships from the latter countries are currently barred from U.S. ports.\n\nLive outside the Capitol: We’re speaking about the SHIPS for America Act and how we’re going to revive American shipping and shipbuilding. Hear from me, leaders on this issue and the workers, and shipbuilders who will make this happen. ??https://t.co/56G6Bkcp3z\n\nKey elements of the proposed legislation also call for a White House-based advisor to lead an interagency Maritime Security Board and implement a National Maritime Strategy. Trump incorporated some of these concepts into his order calling for a White House office of shipbuilding.\nFinancing for the new fleet is addressed by establishing a Maritime Security Fund that would reinvest duties and fees as well as revising the current Title XI Federal Ship Financing Program into a revolving fund. It would also establish a 25 percent investment tax credit for shipbuilding investments. Additional financial incentives would be provided for shipbuilding and ship repair.\nIt calls for the creation of a U.S. Center for Maritime Innovation as well as investments in training and credential programs. It proposed streamlining and modernizing the U.S. Coast Guard credential system and making investments in the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy as well as the state-run maritime academies.\n“Unfortunately, the bottom line now is America needs more ships,” said Senator Todd Young, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and co-sponsor of the legislation. “Shipbuilding is a national security priority and a stopgap against foreign threats and coercion.”\nDespite strong support, the bill failed to gain traction and issues became clouded with similar concerns to expand naval shipbuilding and to address a shortage of navy personnel and delays in warship construction. Trump’s order included a focus on issues such as the delayed frigate program and the national security cutter program for Arctic icebreakers.\nSenators Kelly and Young highlighted the bill has been revised to address issues. It will now be presented in two pieces to the U.S. Senate. One piece is the SHIPS for America Act and the second element is the Building SHIPS in America Act.\nToday’s announcement again garnered broad support from all sectors of the U.S. shipping industry. More than 70 organizations from all sectors of the industry are endorsing the legislation."

        "content": "\nA Chinese autonomous tech company has launched what may be the world's fastest research vessel - the Blue Whale, a high speed unmanned craft with a unique set of features. Designed for typhoon research, this civilian vessel can loiter underwater for 30 days, launch \"research rockets,\" and hit top speeds of about 36 knots - the speed needed to keep pace with most U.S. Navy warships.\nThe prototype Blue Whale was launched Monday at a pier in Zhuhai. It was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China in 2022 and built by a team from tech firm Yunzhou, a leading maker of unmanned vessels for Chinese security forces. Many of the company's other models aremarketedfor police and military applications and are capable of swarming behavior, interception and high-speed ramming.\nThe new research vessel is about 36 feet long, and weighs in at about 12 tonnes. Not only is it faster than perhaps any other research platform, but it is submersible, too: it can loiter up to 200 feet below the surface to escape a passing typhoon, and can stay down for 30 days - much longer than needed to wait out a storm. It can transit at up to four knots underwater, maintaining silence with magnetic fluid drives and special hydroacoustic coatings, according to SCMP.\n\"Through autonomous route planning and mission scheduling, it can position itself near typhoon paths to deploy rocket-powered meteorological sensors to gather critical oceanic and atmospheric data,\" Yunzhou head engineer Wu Guosong told the outlet.\nIt carries a multibeam sonar for bottom mapping, and Yunzhou says that Blue Whale has a modular payload architecture, so it could be readily adapted for new purposes.\n\"It not only provides us with an unprecedented tool for exploring the frontiers of science, but also provides a smart and efficient tool for serving national strategies,\" said Prof. Chen Dake, an American-educated scientist who heads the project for China's Second Institute of Oceanography.\nAfter sea trials, the R&D team hopes to put the Blue Whale into operation next year."

        "author": "Nick Austin",
        "content": "\nWhile the threat of U.S. port fees for Chinese-built ships continues to loom, it does not appear to have changed the orders of several major operators. Reports are indicating that Chinese shipyards booked billions of dollars in orders from independent charter owner and operator Seaspan as well as China’s COSCO while other orders however are going to the yards in South Korea.\nSeaspan which works with many of the leading carriers financing and building ships for long-term charters has a long relationship with China’s shipbuilders. The group has been undertaking a multi-year expansion highlighting nearly 10 percent compound annual growth in capacity and a fleet now of around 200 vessels and 2.3 million TEU of capacity.\nAlphaliner is reporting the group has signed a new construction contract with China’s Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding, part of the China State Shipbuilding Corp., for six new vessels. No value was reported for the new shipbuilding agreement which is said to be for 13,600 TEU vessels for an undisclosed operator.  Under the U.S. Trade Representative’s fee structure, the operator would pay the fees each time the ships call in a U.S. port.\nChina’s COSCO also disclosed that it is continuing its shipbuilder but as would be expected they are using domestic shipyards. The ships will be built for its Orient Overseas Container Line with the order reported to be valued at over $3 billion. A total of 14 vessels each with a capacity of 18,500 TEU will be built and delivered between the third quarter of 2028 and 2029. The work is going to COSCO-owned shipyards with the project split between Nantong Cosco KHI Ship Engineering (NACKS) and Dalian Cosco KHI Ship Engineering (DACKS).\nThe new vessels for OOCL are methanol dual-fuel continuing a pattern the company started a few years ago when it ordered large containerships to be split between COSCO and OOCL. Alphaliner reports that COSCO has 50 containerships on order to be split between its two brands and it is also expanding its bulker and tanker fleets.\nSouth Korea’s shipyards are reportedly also experiencing strong interest and a new competitive position in the competition for orders with their Chinese rivals. Speculation centers on some owners responding to the threat of the U.S. port fees. The Korean media for example reports that Chinese yards have typically dominated the feeder ship market but now the Korean yards are reporting increasing orders in the sector.\nHD Hyundai Heavy Industries reports that it has secured a total of 22 orders recently valued at approximately $1.8 billion for smaller containerships. One of the orders was for 18 feeders valued at $1.275 billion with the work split between the group’s Mipo and Samho yards. The vessels will be delivered by the second half of 2028.\nAs of this week, the HD Hyundai group is reporting that it received orders o far in 2025 for 49 vessels valued at $6.16 billion. That is 34 percent of the group’s 2025 goal for orders valued at $18 billion.\nSamsung Heavy Industries last week also announced that it had won an order for two containerships valued at approximately $395 million. Year-to-date Samsing reports it has received orders for 18 vessels totaling an estimated $2.6 billion.\nA shipbuilding official told Korea’s Chosun Daily that the U.S. port fees are helping to level the playing field with the Chinese yards. Traditionally, Chinese shipbuilders have had the advantage of lower costs leading Korean yards to mostly focus on higher-value vessels including the LNG sector and the emerging market for ammonia carriers."

At about 0200 hours local time on Tuesday, a scaffold around the top of a new concrete LNG containment tank gave way. Three workers fell several stories and suffered fatal injuries. Two more were injured and were left stranded on the scaffold; the injured men have been treated and released from the hospital.\nThe deceased included Felipe Mendez, 25; Felix Lopez, 42; and Dontrell Magee, 41, according to local 12 News. Magee was found alive at the scene but died later at the hospital, Jefferson County authorities told local media.\nContractor Bechtel has temporarily halted work on Port Arthur LNG for an internal review, and has sent on-site tradesmen home to their families. In a statement, Bechtel said that a \"tank jump form system incident\" had occurred, and said that it would be cooperating with authorities in an investigation.\nImagery from the scene showed a single section of the circular scaffold hanging down from the structure, still attached on one side.\nPort Arthur LNG is a vast project, and construction on the first phase began in 2023. It is on track for completion in 2027-8, and thousands of people are employed on the project.\nThe first phase alone will have two liquefaction trains and an export capacity of 13 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). It is located on the Sabine-Neches Ship Channel, next to Golden Pass LNG and Sabine Pass LNG. Its production capacity is fully subscribed on long-term contracts with ConocoPhillips, RWE, PKN Orlen, INEOS and Engie."

        "content": "Hapag-Lloyd and Ocean Network Express (ONE) both released financial results today, April 30, providing the first outlook among the major carriers for 2025 based on the ongoing trade war and U.S.-driven tariffs. The carriers cited strong first quarter demand while reporting a quick falloff and “many uncertainties” for 2025 leading to lower financial expectations.\n“We have gotten the current 2025 financial year off to a good start,” Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting. “But the market environment is currently characterized by many uncertainties resulting from a series of protectionist measures.” Jansen said that all parties in shipping and trade with the U.S. are now “looking to see what concrete impacts these measures will have.”\nHe pointed out that globally 22 percent of container traffic is tied to the United States while for Hapag about 27 percent of its cargo volume is tied to the U.S. Last week, Hapag warned that up to a third of shipments scheduled from China to the U.S. had already been canceled. Many carriers have also reported removing capacity from their trans-Pacific routes as freight rates have also declined.\nIt has been suggested by analysts and many sectors of the industry that shippers rushed products to the United States during the first quarter to beat the pending tariffs. Hapag pointed to nine percent increases both in its volume and freight rates during the first quarter contributing to its strong results.\nHapag booked a 17 percent increase in its first quarter earnings (EBITDA) to $1.1 billion on revenues of $5.3 billion. While warning that it continues to expect lower results for 2025, the company maintained its forecast for the year calling for EBITDA earnings of between $2.5 billion and $4 billion, after having reported nearly half the low end of the range during the first quarter.\nThe outlook for 2025 they said is subject to “considerable uncertainty due to the volatile development of freight rates and major geopolitical challenges.” Among the issues Hansen also noted for the market is the continuing increase in fleet capacity noting that while it will be slower than in 2024, capacity growth is likely to exceed the increase in demand this year. Capacity could also be released if safe passage is restored through the Red Sea.\nONE similarly said, “Considering the prevailing geopolitical landscape, and the significant instability introduced by recent tariff developments in April, forecasting a precise full-year profit figure for financial year 2025 presents considerable challenges.”\nIn the most dire case presented by ONE, it said profits could be down by three-quarters in 2025. It cited the potential for a decline of $850 million saying profits could be as low as $250 million. ONE reported that since February and the Lunar New Year holiday, it has been experiencing weakness, especially on east-west routes. It pointed to emerging issues saying the recovery on the routes was lagging and a downward trend in rates.\nONE pointed to its expansion in its network and new service offerings as well as the newly established The Premier Alliance.\nHapag reported it would be moving forward with its current strategy with a focus on quality, efficiency, and decarbonization. It said it would also be watching costs in the year ahead. Hapag is also expanding its terminal operations pointing to an acquisition in Le Havre, France, the opening of the Tuticorin terminal in Inda, and extended concessions in Florida and Haldia, India."

As of Tuesday morning, the unified command had more than 170 people working on scene, along with a dozen skimmer boats.\nThe spill began last weekend at a well near the Garden Island Bay Production Facility, an oil collection point near Pass a Loutre. Operator Spectrum OpCo LLC, the Coast Guard and the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office (LOSCO) have set up a response team to manage the mixed oil and gas release, aided by multiple response contractors.\nThe amount of oil released by the well is as yet unknown, and the source of the spill has not yet been shut down. A well control contractor is working on source intervention, and more equipment is en route to help shut in the well and bring the spill to an end.\nSo far, the responders have deployed nearly two miles of containment boom, and have another 3,200 feet on hand in case it is needed. Nearly 400 bales of absorbent boom have been deployed to protect shoreline areas, and the skimmer boats have removed more than 23,000 gallons of oil-water mixture. A one-mile safety zone is in effect around the area to protect workers and the general public.\nLuckily, no injuries or wildlife impacts have been reported. The spill is located far from the Mississippi's main shipping channel, so it does not affect oceangoing marine traffic.\n“Our top priority remains the safety of the public and our responders,\" said Captain Gregory Callaghan, U.S. Coast Guard’s Federal On-Scene Coordinator for the incident. \"The Unified Command is working around the clock to secure the source of the discharge as safely and quickly as possible. We are committed to minimizing further impacts to the environment.”"

The Cold War-era law provides a pathway to unilateral resource recovery on the high seas, bypassing the UN's International Seabed Authority (ISA), which has jurisdiction under the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS).\nThe White House's license plan was designed in consultation with The Metals Company, the sole private firm with access to a fully-tested deep sea mining system. Canada-based TMC has already filed its first permit application, which asks for U.S. permission to mine an area of the Pacific located far outside of the U.S. exclusive economic zone.\n\"The recent permit request is for mining in the deep sea outside of the jurisdiction of the United States,\" said Leticia Reis de Carvalho, Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority, in a statement Wednesday. \"The advantages for the United States in engaging through the international legal system are substantial and far outweigh the potential risks and challenges associated with unilateral action across the chain, from intergovernmental relations to investment security.\"\nThe U.S. is one of the few nations that have not ratified UNCLOS, which governs ocean resources that are so far from shore that they are considered \"the common heritage of mankind\"; while not a UNCLOS signatory or an ISA member state, the U.S. has sent observers to past ISA negotiations, and has not previously objected to international regulation of the high seas.\nAmerica's new course of action presents risks, Reis de Carvalho said. First and foremost, UNCLOS requires all member states to not recognize an unlicensed deep sea mining claim's legitimacy. That means that UNCLOS signatories are technically not allowed to recognize any ownership claim to the mining operation's products, making the ore harder to sell.\nTMC has already lined up a commercial buyer, Switzerland-based commodities firm Glencore. The Trump administration is also exploring options to set up a critical-minerals stockpile, which would create a government buyer for the product.\nReis de Carvalho pushed back on certain mining firms' complaints about the pace of ISA regulatory negotiations, and she encouraged the U.S. to join the international process. \"ISA Member States are working as effectively and responsibly as possible to develop regulations for the consideration of extraction activities,\" she said. \"Our collective work to finalize the [UNCLOS] Mining Code is not a bureaucratic exercise; it is the foundation for ensuring that any activities in the Area [beyond national jurisdiction] benefit all humanity, for present and future generations, while protecting the marine environment.\""

The group received approval from the Belgian courts today, April 30, for its offer to acquire the bankrupt Air Belgium and transfer of the airline’s assets through an agreement with the court-appointed liquidator.\nThe French group stepped in a month ago with a last-minuterival offerto acquire the air operations after the original offer from a group called Air One Belgium, a joint venture of the UK’s Air One International and the Dutch company Peso Aviation Management, failed to close. The buyout had been accepted in December 2024 but the court grew frustrated setting a March 27 deadline for alternate offers.\nCMA CGM partnered with Air Belgium between 2021 and 2023 to launch the French-branded cargo operations before it received its licenses. Air Belgium operated its four Airbus A330F aircraft under agreement with CMA CGM before the French group received its certificate and launched operations at Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport.\nAir Belgium was founded in 2016 and started operations offering long-haul passenger flights and cargo operations in March 2018. It however was financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and later the war in Ukraine forcing the company to focus on its cargo operations. China’s Hongyuan Group invested in the company in 2022 owing a 49 percent interest and a new working relationship was formed providing services for the Chinese group. Due to continuing financial difficulties, Air Belgium ceased its passenger operation in September 2023 to focus on air cargo and leasing for passenger and cargo flights.\nCMA CGM reports it transferred the company’s assets and will continue the Air Belgium brand with operations from Belgium. It is also maintaining 124 jobs, including 72 pilots and 52 operational and support staff.\nThe acquisition accelerates the growth plans for the French group’s air cargo business effectively doubling capacity while the group waits for the delivery of new aircraft it has on order for CMA CGM Air Cargo. It says the addition of the base in Belgium will enable it to create tailored solutions for forwarders, shippers, and other logistics customers.\nCMA CGM Air Cargo based at Paris-Charles de Gaulle, currently operates two Boeing 777f aircraft to Hong Kong and Shanghai. It also has one Airbus A330F operating to Zhengzhou and has established an air freight hub in Chicago. This hub is being serviced by two Boeing 777F aircraft operated by Atlas Air under the CMA CGM Air Cargo brand.\nThe group highlights that will now be operating an air cargo fleet of nine planes made up of four Boeing 777Fs, three Airbus A330Fs, and two Boeing 747Fs. It looks to expand its trans-Pacific routes and support the expansion of its cargo activities in the American market with the delivery of new aircraft.\nCMA CGM Air Cargo currently has an additional Boeing 777F currently on order. Starting in 2027, it will also be added eight Airbus A350 craft. Three of the planes will be used in the American market as the group continues to grow its air cargo offerings.\nThe major carriers turned to air cargo recently to round out their logistics offerings. In addition to CMA CGM, both Maersk and MSC launched branded air cargo services. CMA CGMcommittedduring a meeting with President Donald Trump to expand its U.S. air cargo operations are part of its investment in logistics operations in the United States."

They will be among the largest in the Western Hemisphere and permit the shipyard to resume servicing large cruise ships that have been forced to travel to Europe for their overhauls and maintenance.\nThe shipyard is jointly owned by Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean Group along with a share held by the Bahamas government. The yard was established to provide maintenance for cruise ships close to the Florida homeports as well as for other commercial ships during the offseason. Grand Bahama Shipyard was started in 2000 with one drydock capable of handling ships up to 27,000 tons displacement. The yard added a second drydock in 2001 capable of handling ships up to 50,000 tons displacement and by 2009 a third drydock was added, giving the yard a lifting capacity of up to approximately 82,500 tons displacement. However, in 2019 it suffered a casualty that disabled its larger drydock.\nPlans for replacements and expansion of the yard were delayed by the pandemic before an order was placed in May 2022 with China’s Beihai Shipbuilding Co. The companies have also entered into agreements with the Bahamas’ government for the investments and expansion of the operations.\n\n\nThe first of the two new docks, East End, is nearly ready to begin the trip from Chian to Freeport, Bahamas (Grand Bahama Shipyard)\n\n“We are close to reassuming our position as a leading, world-class cruise ship repair facility,” said Dave Skentelbery, CEO of the Grand Bahamas Shipyard. “The investment by our shareholders will be a significant boost to the economy of Grand Bahama, providing both direct and indirect employment opportunities.”\nThe company reports that the first of its two new docks is nearing completion and will begin shipment to the Bahamas. It is reported to be on schedule for delivery to Grand Bahama by the first week of November. The second dock will follow and is expected to arrive in 2026.\nThis first dock named “East End” is 357 meters long and 76 meters wide (1,171 feet by 250 feet) and capable of lifting to 93,500 tons. It will be equipped with four state-of-the-art modern cranes and control systems and will be in operation in January 2026. The second, larger dock, named “Lucayan” was designed for a 125,000-ton lift capacity meaning that the yard will again be able to service all of the large cruise ships and other commercial vessels.\nWorking with the Bahamas. The yard is making preparations for the expansion, including the extension of a pier, which is well advanced and will be ready to receive the dock in November.  The company also reports it has engaged another 20 apprentices this year and is already in the process of recruiting crane operators to train for the new docks.\nThe owners are investing a reported $600 million in the project which modernizes the yard and increases its capacity."

The five-day effort uncovered eight undeclared hazardous materials containers and 33 stolen cars, valued at more than $2.4 million. The vehicles were about to be shipped to West African countries, beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement.\nThe practical objective was to prevent shipboard or pierside fires or explosions from improperly stowed hazardous materials. The dangerous goods included cars with connected batteries - a potential ignition source in the event of any electrical system shorts - and full gasoline tanks.\nThis month, CBP and the USCG teamed up again to conduct warehouse spot checks around the Port of New York and New Jersey, including a site in Red Hook. Guided by CBP container screening data, they uncovered a 60 percent deficiency rate in hazmat compliance. The two agencies are collaborating more closely at PONYNJ now, and CBP is providing the Coast Guard with regular tip-offs about any potential violations it discovers during cargo screening.\n\"Through partnerships and vigilance, we enhance port security, disrupt illegal activities and ensure the safe movement of legitimate commerce,\" said Lt.

Operator Spectrum OpCo LLC, the Coast Guard and the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office (LOSCO) set up a response team and brought in multiple contractors to begin a cleanup effort.\nA well control contractor arrived on scene early in the response, and their source intervention and well control operations continue. More equipment for that work - including cutting tools, a capping stack, piping, a crane and storage barges - are now en route and are being staged for an operation to shut off the flow.\n\n\nImage courtesy USCG\nSo far, the spill response contractors have collected about 33,000 gallons of oily water mixture, and the cleanup effort continues with support from 180 personnel, 12 skimming vessels and various collection equipment. About 12,000 feet of standard containment boom have been deployed, with more on standby as needed.\nNo injuries or wildlife impacts are reported, and the spill is far enough from the main shipping lanes that it has not affected deep-draft marine traffic. A one-mile safety zone remains in effect around the epicenter of the spill.\nThe well was previously decommissioned and has been out of use for 10 years, according to local WWLTV. The cause of the sudden failure is not yet known."

        "content": "The Mediterranean Emission Control Area officially launched today, May 1, under the MARPOL Annex of the International Maritime Organizations. Officials are hopeful that it will help to clean the Mediterranean region and contribute to the overall improvements already seen in air quality since the launch of the first ECA in the Baltic and the addition of three subsequent areas. The IMO has three additional areas slated to enter the program.\nThe effort to create an emission control area in the Mediterranean had been a priority for activists and was discussed over the past several years before it was adopted in 2021 at the UN’s Barcelona Convention and received an IMO designation in 2022. The IMO highlights the importance of the region in shipping noting that the Mediterranean is home to some of the busiest maritime routes in the world. The IMO says the Mediterranean supports 20 percent of seaborne trade. It estimates more than 17 percent of cruises and 24 percent of the worldwide fleet navigate in the Mediterranean.\nUnder the new requirements, ships must reduce the sulfur content in marine fuel to 0.1 percent from the global standard of 0.5 percent. The measures became mandatory as of May 1.\nEU officials highlight data that shows sulfur oxide emissions in the EU decreased by approximately 70 percent since 2024. They credit it to the establishment of the ECA in Northern Europe. They however note that nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in the EU have increased by 10 percent between 2015 and 2023. The data however shows that NOx emissions specifically in the Mediterranean are up eight percent. The European Commission and Mediterranean states are reported to be currently discussing the next phase steps for the most effective means to reduce NOx emissions.\nThe first ECA was adopted in 1997 and entered into force in 2005 for the Baltic. Since then, the program has been expanded to include the North Sea, North America, and the Caribbean region around the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The IMP says since the sulfur content limit was introduced in 2020, an overall 70 percent reduction in total sulfur oxide emissions from shipping has been achieved due to the 0.5 percent global standard for maritime fuels.\nIn 2024, the IMO designated two further ECAs for the Canadian Arctic and the Norwegian Sea. In April, during the MEPC meeting, the IMO also approved the Northeast Atlantic ECA. Its adoption is due to be finalized this year and to go into effect in 2027. It covers the areas near Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and the U.K."

        "content": "\nEffective Wednesday, logistics giants DSV and Schenker have merged into one company under the DSV banner. The megamerger reinforces DSV's position as a leader in global logistics, with 160,000 employees and about $46 billion in annual revenue.\n\"With this acquisition, we have become a world-leading player in global transport and logistics, at a time when global supply chains are in focus more than ever before,\" said DSV CEO Jens H. Lund. \"By combining the two companies, we will create a unique flexible platform for long-term financial growth.\"\nDSV bought German competitior Schenker from Deutsche Bahn in September 2024 for $16 billion, the largest transaction in DSV's history. The acquisition gives DSV an even greater presence in the German freight market, including maritime, road, rail and air cargo. At the time of the purchase announcement last year, DSV said that it planned to grow its German business so much that the combined entity would have more employees within Germany than both firms did separately.\nThe combined firm is emphasizing business continuity, and it seeks to retain as many existing customers from Schenker as possible.\n\"DSV is committed to a smooth transition and will approach the integration with due respect and careful consideration for customers, employees and stakeholders,\" the firm said. \"During the integration process, it is a key priority to avoid disruptions and retain a high service level for our customers.\"\nFor DSV, the acquisition comes with an immediate upside. It has updated its earnings outlook to expect an additional $600 million in EBIT this year (on top of its previously-predicted earnings range) from Schenker's operations. However, given the exceptional uncertainties in the global trade landscape, the company cautioned that unforeseen changes could affect its full-year results for 2025.\nDSV added that expects no material contribution to its finances from Saudi Arabia's troubled NEOM project in 2025. The logistics company is a leading partner in NEOM, a futuristic greenfield city which has been quietly scaled back over the past year.\nTop image:Hjart / CC BY SA 4.0"

        "content": "\nOn Wednesday, a barge hit a 150-year-old lighthouse in the middle of the Hudson River, damaging the structure's dock and a stairway. The lighthouse and the barge survived the encounter, and the operating company has agreed to participate in a long-term restoration project for the historic structure.\nThe Hudson-Athens Lighthouse is located just off Athens, New York in the Hudson River. It is a formal, elegant structure with a granite-block caisson and a red brick tower, and is one of just two remaining \"middle-of-the-river\" lighthouses on the Hudson. It has been operated by a nonprofit historical preservation association - the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse Preservation Society (HALPS) - for more than 40 years. HALPS is committed to a long-term program of repairs to restore the site to its 1930s-era condition.\nBecause of long-term damage to its foundation, the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse is in danger of collapse. It is on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of 11 most endangered historic places. According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, its wooden piling foundation has been eroded by the wakes of large commercial ship traffic, along with the inevitable effects of decades of ice flows, tides and currents. An estimated $7.5 million in work is required to restore it to serviceable condition.\nThe impact of the tug and barge did not cause any of these issues, but the contact did add several new ones. The access dock and the stairs from the dock up the caisson were damaged. Luckily, no injuries were reported, and the structure of the lighthouse itself is intact.\n“This incident reinforces what we’ve known for some time—the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse is in urgent need of structural restoration,” said Van Calhoun, Chair of the HALPS Restoration Committee. “The impact may have drawn attention to the damage, but it’s the long-term wear from river conditions and vessel traffic that truly threaten its foundation. We appreciate Carver Companies not only for stepping up to repair what happened, but also for recognizing the broader need to preserve this historic landmark for the future.”\nRepairs to the stairway have already started. The master of the tug has been suspended and an internal investigation is under way, said Brian Moore, general manager of Carver Marine Towing.\nTop image: Hudson-Athens Lighthouse circa 2006 (Kadin 2048 / CC BY SA 2.5)"

In coordinated announcements, the U.S. State Department announced sanctions on the oil sector while the Treasury Department targeted the network supplying ballistic missile propellant ingredients to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nSo far, the sanctions have been coming from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and its Office of Foreign Assets Control, but on Wednesday, April the U.S. State Department announced the oil sector sanctions. It came as State is locked in ongoing negotiations with Iran focusing on the nuclear program and is scheduled to hold a fourth round of talks this weekend.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said in a press statement that the U.S. is “committed to driving Iran’s illicit oil and petrochemical exports – including exports to China – to zero,” under Donald Trump’s maximum pressure campaign. “So long as Iran attempts to generate oil and petrochemical revenues to fund its destabilizing activities, and support its terrorist activities and proxies, the United States will take steps to hold both Iran and all its partners engaged in sanctions evasion accountable.”\nIn the latest round of sanctions, the U.S. designated four sellers of Iranian petrochemical products and one buyer that are accused of generating hundreds of millions of dollars in funds for Iran.  Four companies based in the UAE (Solvent Organics, Al Seerah Trading, Harold Trading, and Shivanai Organics) were accused of exporting in total approximately $500 million of petrochemical products from Iran. A Turkish-based company (Kimpas) was accused of importing $15 million of petrochemical products and an Iranian cargo surveyor (Keyhan Sanjesh Azma) was also designated for its participation.\nState also added two tankers,Eloise(105,709 dwt) andOlia(106,360 dwt) to the sanctions.Eloisebuilt in 2002 is registered in Gabon while theOlia, which was previously designated for its role with Russian oil exports, is being identified in the Equasis database with an unknown flag. It was previously registered in Gabon and before that Panama, Liberia, and the Bahamas. The U.S. also designated UAE-based Vroom Marine as the manager of the two tankers.\nThe Treasury Department one day earlier on April 29 targeted the network involved in shipping ballistic missile propellant ingredients to Iran. It listed six entities in China and Iran as the network that facilitated the procurement of sodium perchlorate and dioctyl sebacate which is used to produce ammonium perchlorate for solid propellant rocket motors of ballistic missiles. The U.S. highlights that ammonium perchlorate is controlled by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), a multilateral political understanding among states that seek to limit the proliferation of missiles and missile technology.\n"

The shipyards are anxious to build their ties with the U.S. Navy which Phelan was quick to point out would be part of the efforts on countering the Chinese and restoring America’s maritime dominance.\n“Working with leading shipyards like Hanwha Ocean Shipbuilding and HD Hyundai Heavy Industries is essential to ensuring deployed U.S. ships and systems remain fully operational in the Indo-Pacific,” said Secretary Phelan. “Leveraging the expertise of these highly capable shipyards enables timely maintenance and repairs for our vessels to operate at peak performance. This level of large-scale repair and maintenance capability strengthens our combat readiness, sustains forward deployed operational presence, and reinforces regional stability.”\nThe official statements focused on the Korean yard’s expertise in vessel maintenance, repair, and overhaul which it said is crucial to enhancing naval operational capabilities. The yards however also highlighted their shipbuilding capabilities anxious to expand their naval work.\nHanwha Ocean was the first Korean yard to win maintenance contracts servicing two USN support vessels. It hascompletedan extended job for the dry cargo ship USNSWally Schirraand is currently working on the replenishment oiler USNSYukon. During his tour of the yard, Phelan was shown the progress and visited the Yukon.\nThe company also emphasized its experience in shipbuilding and its recent acquisition of the Philly Shipyard saying it stands ready to support America’s shipbuilding efforts. Hanwha Group Vice Chairman Dong Kwan Kim is reported to have discussed the goal of deeper cooperation in naval shipbuilding between Korea and the U.S.\n\n\nAt HD Hyundai, the yard highlighted its construction of Aegis class destroyers (HD Hyundai)\n\nEarlier at HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Phelan was shown the ROKSJeongjo, an Aegis class destroyer built by Hyundai and delivered to the Korean Navy in 2024. The vessel is currently undergoing a routine inspection which gave the yard the chance to highlight its experience saying it is the only Korean yard ready to build advanced destroyers.\n“Based on HD Hyundai’s technological edge and shipbuilding capacity, we are committed to contributing to the revival of America’s shipbuilding industry,” said HD Hyundai Executive Vice Chairman Chung Ku-sun. He joined Phelan in signing the yard’s guest book and wrote, “Let’s work together to rebuild America’s shipbuilding base.”\nHD Hyundai wascertifiedin 2024 for the USN vessel maintenance program and is reported to be planning to bid for contracts this year. It was also highlighted that the company recently completed an agreement with Hunting Ingalls Industries in the U.S. to explore collaboration opportunities both for defense and commercial shipbuilding.\nDuring the visit, Phelan also met with South Korean government officials where he stressed the long relationship between the two countries. He said the relationship fosters innovation, enhances national defense, and drives economic prosperity.\nSouth Korea’s shipbuilders continue to be encouraged by Donald Trump’s comments about the need to rebuild the U.S. fleet and the opportunities to work together. Korean media reports Samsung Heavy Industries and K Shipbuilding are also looking to register for the USN maintenance programs. A year ago, then Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro in February 2024visitedSouth Korea's shipyards calling for efforts to work together.\nPhelan arrived in South Korea after a similar visit to Japan where he also toured major shipyards and met with officials. Reports said he suggested building commercial ships with Japanese support that would also be suitable for military use in an emergency. He was reported to be planning to discuss dual-use shipbuilding with Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nMarine insurer Gard has warned shipowners once again about the hazards of on-duty phone use, which is becoming easier and more tempting as shipboard connectivity improves. Notifications are a particular behavioral challenge, since an incoming text message can grab a seafarers' attention even when they aren't actively using their phone. But as tempting as it is to try it, multitasking with a phone exposes personnel to danger in a hazardous industrial environment - and owners/operators might consider restricting phone use during seafarers' working hours, Gard warned.\nLike almost all members of modern society, seafarers can develop a habit of constant connection to their personal devices. While it may be tempting to think that it is possible to multitask with phone in hand, years of accident data suggest that texting and seafaring isn't much different from texting and driving - it's distracting, and therefore dangerous.\nEvery mariner knows of casualties that happened because someone was on the phone, from collisions to groundings to accidents on deck. Some examples are infamous, like theEver Forwardgrounding in 2021, which was caused by a highly-trained marine pilot who was distracted by his phone while on duty. Others are tragic, like the death of the third mate of the ro/roSeatruck Progress,who was struck and killed by a semi-trailer in 2019.\n\"Although it may seem like we are being productive by handling emails, social media, and various apps on one hand, whilst maintaining a navigation watch on the other, our brains are not processing these activities in parallel. Instead, we rapidly shift our focus between them, a phenomenon called task switching,\" cautioned Gard. \"This division of attention, rather than genuinely multitasking, distracts from the primary task and ultimately reduces our ability to engage fully and effectively with either activity.\"\nSwitching back and forth between tasks takes mental energy, reducing concentration and decisionmaking ability. This slows down reaction times and reduces situational awareness, Gard warned.\nSeafarers on night watch face an additional risk because they need their night vision. Human eyes can take five minutes or more to properly readjust to nighttime vision after exposure to a bright phone screen, research shows - and a watchstander needs to be able to see at all times.\nGard advised operators to consider putting restrictions on where and when their crewmembers can use phones and other devices. Options include limiting personal device use during working hours, or in certain locations, like the bridge and engine room; restricting device use when in pilotage waters; putting work computers in places where they won't be tempting to use on watch; or setting up the ships' communications systems in ways that limit distractions.\n\"While establishing procedures and processes, and raising awareness among the crew is important, it is crucial to emphasize that this alone may not be enough. Companies must also prioritize raising crew awareness regarding the distracting potential of these devices and verify that the established procedures are being followed,\" Gard advised."

The long-delayed project is a mission-critical replacement for thePolar Star,the United States' sole remaining heavy icebreaker.\nThe service said that the transition to production status allows the Coast Guard (and the Navy program office that supports it) to build momentum on the project. It also gives shipbuilder Bollinger the ability to ramp up hiring, which will allow it to deliver the ship as quickly as possible.\nThe Polar Security Cutter is the first heavy icebreaker built in the United States in nearly 50 years, and all of the stakeholders involved in the project have had to relearn the skills required for constructing this uniquely demanding vessel class. The PSC's ultra-thick hull is built of special cold-resistant steel to withstand polar temperatures, and the vessel is densely and heavily compartmentalized for strength. This adds considerable technical complexity and cost when compared to a typical Coast Guard cutter. A Congressional Budget Office report on the project found that it had also suffered from significant design issues, which the shipbuilder and the USCG have worked to address.\nThe program started with a contract award to VT Halter, owned at the time by Singapore's ST Engineering. Bollinger took over when it bought VT Halter in 2022. In March, the Coast Guard awarded Bollinger a $950 million contract modification to underwrite the extra expenses. According to Bollinger, the timeline for delivery is now in 2030, six years behind schedule.\n\"Hard work and dedication have successfully put the PSC program on a strong path forward after a rocky start under the previous, foreign-owned builder,\" said Ben Bordelon, President and CEO of Bollinger Shipyards in a statement in March.\nAfter years of congressionalpressure, the Coast Guard recently purchased a commercial icebreaker - Edison Chouest'sAiviq- as an interim vessel. Shortly after taking delivery ofAiviq, the service began seekingoptionsfor another midsize icebreaker on the international market."

        "content": "\nPort Canaveral located in central Florida is continuing to experience strong growth as not only the second-busiest cruise homeport, but also in its cargo operations and support of the space programs. The port mapped out a comprehensive five-year plan to expand capacity and capabilities across all aspects of its business operations which include investing upwards of $500 million in landside and waterside improvements.\nCapt. John Murray, Port Canaveral CEO highlights that the “Port Canaveral Advantage” plan is a port-wide continuous improvement program that identifies near- to long-term needs for enhancements and upgrades to port assets and operations. Within a five-year planning window, the program includes large-scale, high-value critical infrastructure projects associated with new cruise ship arrivals, modernizing and expanding cargo berths and bulkheads, upgrading facilities maintenance, deploying new technologies across a spectrum of operations and renovations to the port’s recreational facilities including Jetty Park.\n“These port-wide investments are designed to leverage the Port’s success to benefit communities from the Space Coast to Central Florida, and throughout the state,” said stated Capt. Murray. “Our goal and commitment are to always be the best port possible for our valued partners, guests, and visitors.”\nSeveral cruise-related projects are about to get underway at Port Canaveral, with one of the most ambitious being the expansion of Cruise Terminal 5. The design project, awarded to BEA Architects of Miami, will increase the terminal’s size by 65 percent to accommodate larger vessels.  During an estimated 16-month construction period, the cruise terminal would continue to operate without interrupting scheduled ship turns.\nIn addition to expanding CT-5, the port plans to enhance Cruise Terminal 10 to expand its capacity beginning with a feasibility study that is expected to be completed by June 2025. The project’s goals include expanding the terminal’s capacity to accommodate the world’s largest cruise ships up to 5,600 passengers and berthing up to 1,200 feet in length.\nExterior upgrades at Cruise Terminal 1 will begin in May 2025 and include new canopies and walkways, updated landscaping, and new lighting. These upgrades are in addition to refurbishments to the adjacent cruise parking garage with new paint, landscaping, and perimeter fencing plus gangway upgrades.\n\n\nNew cruise ships including the Norwegian Aqua arriving at the port in April for the first time are propelling the growth (Port Canaveral Authority)\n\nThe investment in the cruise operations comes as the port recorded its busiest month ever in March handling 925,994 passengers coming and going from the cruise ships, a 16 percent increase over last year. It was the second record month following 837,900 passengers in December 2024. For the first six months in FY 2025, the port has already handled 4.42 million passengers, and they are projecting the port will reach 8.4 million passengers for the full year up from 7.6 million last year.\nOne of the challenges for the port is balancing the fast growth in cruise with its commercial operations. As part of the investments, the port plans to renovate existing pier structures on the south side of the port to create additional multipurpose, multiuser berth space and improve vessel turn times. Renovations for the two north side cargo berths – North Cargo Berths 3 and 4 – are nearing completion adding 1,800 linear feet of multipurpose bulkhead space while ongoing improvements include harbor deepening and berth box dredging to accommodate larger vessels, seawall and uplands facility upgrades, and the addition of a third mobile harbor crane set to arrive later this year. Roadway improvements are also underway to improve access to and from cargo terminals, ease roadway congestion, and reduce truck wait times.\nPort Canaveral also has a long-standing role in supporting America’s space program. Today, two commercial space companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin, have maritime operations at the port utilizing multiple cargo berths for their vessels' dockage and for offloading and transporting recovered launch vehicle components.\nThe port plans to self-fund its improvements operating without taxpayer contributions. Port Canaveral Chief Financial Officer Jeff Long reported at the recent board meeting that the port was having a “very healthy financial year so far,” in FY 2025. Approximately 84 percent of the port's operating revenue for the first six months of the FY came from cruise operations. Between October 2024 and March 2025, total operating revenues reached nearly $112 million with reports indicating passenger counts were ahead of plan and the outlook remains strong in all areas of the port’s business."

The UN verifies that vessels are not carrying armaments or other weaponry to aid the Houthis.\nAccording to the reports local authorities have demanded that some vessels move from the anchorage into the port and berth. There are reports of threats of violence and in at least one instance UKMTO is saying warning shots were fired. Other vessels are reported to have been boarded by armed personnel.\n“These reported incidents reinforce the threat to vessels visiting Houthi-controlled ports,” writes UKMTO. It warns that the ships are “likely to be held or restricted from safely departing.”\nMartin Kelly, Head of Advisory at EOS Risk Group, explains, \"There are several motivations to the Houthis not allowing ships to depart including using commercial shipping as a deterrent against US, UK and Israeli airstrikes. Moreover, ships seen to be fleeing ports demonstrates the Houthi inability to defend its port infrastructure which is could be seen as undermining Houthi ability.\"\nThe April strikes on the oil terminal the Houthis contend killed 74 people and injured at least 171 others, according to the Ministry of Health.\nYesterday, April 30, the Russian Embassy in Yemen issued a statement confirming that a product tanker namedSeven Pearls(53,714 dwt) was in the Ras Isa anchorage. The vessel which is registered in St. Kitts and Nevis reportedly suffered minor damage during the U.S. bombing. The Embassy said one crewmember is in a hospital and requires complex eye surgery while two other Russian citizens were slightly injured but in stable condition.\nIt said that 19 Russian crewmembers remain aboard the ship. The Embassy said the ship’s owner was working to evacuate the injured seafarers and remove the ship from Yemen.\nTurkey’s Foreign Ministry also reported that a Turkish-managed LPG Carrier,St. Oslo(29,121 dwt) is being detained in the port awaiting permission to depart from the Yemini port authorities. The ship which is registered in Panama is reported to have 17 Turkish sailors onboard.\nAnother unconfirmed Turkish media report said an unnamed fuel tanker operated by a Turkish company sustained minor damage while it was in the port unloading. It is said to have four Turks including the captain and 22 Indian crewmembers aboard. The media report said the ship attempted to leave the port but was denied permission by the group controlling the terminal. They said no vessels at the terminal were being allowed to leave following the air strike. Ships they said were directed to wait in a designated area."

        "content": "\nIran is reported ready to commission its next logistics ship converted from a merchant ship for operations by its Navy. The ship is based on a 33-year-old crude oil tanker that had been operating under the Iranian flag since 2019.\nOpen Source intelligence analyst Mehdi H, who reports accurately on Iranian naval matters, posted a picture of a newly converted tanker that appears to have been commissioned by the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja). He reports the vessel will soon start sea trials. It features a helipad which Mehdi H says is likely for helicopter and UAV ops.\nThe ship is now named IRINSKurdestan(K442), and from its pennant number looks likely to fulfill the same role as IRINS Makran (K441). Both IRINSMakranandKurdestanwere converted from crude oil tankers at the ISOCO shipyard west of Bandar Abbas. IRINSMakranwas converted from the 55,909 GT Aframax tankerBeta(IMO 9486910), launched in Japan in 2009.Markanmade itsfirst appearancein January 2023 with Iran reporting it was intended as a logistics and intelligence-gathering ship, fitted with a large helicopter pad with space for up to seven helis, an array of signals intelligence and data processing equipment, and ample fuel tank capacity to resupply other Iranian vessels at sea.\nIRINSKurdestanhas been converted from the smaller 29,506 GTTabukan(IMO 8917467), launched in 1997 also in Japan. It is 183 meters (600 feet) in length and 45,425 dwt. AIS signals for the vessel last showed it in Lagos, Nigeria more than a year ago.\n\nIranian Navy will soon start sea trials of a new forward base ship named Kurdestan.This new base (442) like IRIS Makran (441) is a converted crude oil tanker previously named Tabukan (IMO: 8917467).The conversion by ISOICO includes a helipad likely for helicopter & UAV ops.pic.twitter.com/EqXqjRiuOv\n\nAlongside the Moudge Class frigate IRINSDena(F75), IRINSMakranmade up the 86th Flotilla which between September 2022 and May 2023 circumnavigated the globe, traveling via Jakarta, Pitcairn, the western coast of South America, and Rio de Janeiro. The flotilla was denied passage through the Panama Canal, necessitating a first rounding of the Cape of Good Horn for the Nedaja.\nTo a mariner’s eye, however, IRINSMakranseems far too big to be an effective at-sea replenishment ship, making the circumnavigation more of a publicity event than an operational endeavor. IRINSKurdestanat half the size will make a much better platform for carrying out tactical replenishment at sea and is similar in size at 18,880GT to IRINSKharg(K431) which performed this role until it sank in mysterious circumstances off Jask in June 2021. IRINSMakrancould well now revert to its intended role as an offshore support base, and with IRINSKurdestanwill also likely be used for conducting training cruises with naval cadets.\nIRINSKurdestanis equipped with a helicopter deck, built on a platform over the foredeck as with IRINSMakran. In all likelihood, the ship has retained its functionality as an oil tanker but will be reinforced with additional radar and anti-aircraft missile systems. As of yesterday, IRINSKurdestanwas anchored in the Bandar Abbas roads, from where its crew will have had a fine view of the fires engulfing the Bandar Abbas commercial port.\nIn addition to the converted tankers, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in 2023 commissioned alightly-converted container ship, which it deployed as an expeditionary base ship renamedShahid Mahdavi."

        "content": "The new government of Syria and CMA CGM made official today their new agreement to operate the Latakia port, the country’s main seaport which is located on the northern Mediterranean coast. CMA CGM has operated the port for more than a decade under the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\nThe new government announced in February that it had reached terms with the French group for a new, much longer, management agreement, but under revised terms. During the signing ceremony today, May 1, officials emphasized that the operations would be under state supervision and that the new contract was provided without “granting any exceptional operational privileges.”\nCMA CGM received a new 30-year agreement for port operations. The Syrian port authority said the new agreement “addressed a settlement of all outstanding obligation,” and provides for new terms. News reports said the Syrian state will receive 60 percent of the port’s revenues and CMA CGM will retain 40 percent. The percentage will be adjusted as the number of containers entering the country grows.\nIt said the company has agreed to new long-term investments in the port and its operations, Mazen Alloush, Director of Public relations for Syria’s General Authority for Land and Sea ports, told the SANA news agency that CMA CGM during the first year would invest approximately $32 million to maintain and modernize the port’s equipment. Over the next four years, CMA CGM will invest a further $230 million as part of the expansion of the port.\nAmong the steps planned is a new pier able to handle larger vessels. The basin will also be deepened CMA CGM’s regional director told the press.\nReports said the new deal was in recognition that CMA CGM had stood with Syria despite international sanctions in recent years. It was also pointed out that the Saadé family which owns CMA CGM has historical ties to Syria although it is now identified as being French-Lebanese.\nThe port has a bit of a notorious reputation under the prior regime while there are reports of sectarian violence continuing in the region. The Port of Latakia has been cited as a hotspot for the smuggling and the regional trade in illegal drugs. The port has also allegedly received shipments of Ukrainian grain stolen from Russian-occupied Crimea."

        "content": "Belgium’s DEME Group which is an established leader for installations of offshore wind energy reported that it has completed the acquisition of Norway-based Havfram. The agreement to acquire the company was announced in April with DEME highlighting that it would expand its footprint in the offshore wind energy market and enhance its positioning in turbine and foundation installations.\nOffshore wind energy is a fast-growing portion of DEME’s business with the company highlighting to investors in the first quarter that offshore wind and offshore energy accounted for approximately €2 billion of its revenues in 2024 or nearly half the group’s total revenues of €4.1 billion. It started in offshore wind in 2000 and says it has completed over 350 projects including for foundations, cables, turbine installation, and rock placement. It reported 37 percent growth in revenues from wind energy projects, having more than doubled in two years and a backlog of approximately €4.3 billion at the end of 2024. It however is one part of a group that has more than 100 vessels and is also active in environmental remediation, dredging, and marine infrastructure.\nDEME called the acquisition of Havfram strategic citing 90 percent utilization of its assets for offshore wind energy in 2024. It is contracted to support some of the highest-profile projects both in Europe and North America, including Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Wind Farm.\n“DEME’s investment in Havfram underscores our unwavering belief in the immense potential of offshore wind infrastructure as a key element in the global energy transition,” said Luc Vandenbulcke, CEO of DEME on April 9 announcing the agreement. “This acquisition complements our fleet and will bolster our competitive edge in both turbine and foundation installations, enhancing our operational flexibility and interchangeability, and strengthening DEME's leadership position in the industry.”\nThe acquisition represented an aggregated transaction value of approximately €900 million, including the share purchase and the remaining capital expenditures needed to complete the construction of two installation vessels Havfram has on order in China. The shares were acquired from Sandbrook Capital, a private investment firm focused on climate infrastructure, and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), one of Canada’s largest pension investors.\nHavfram announced in 2021 an agreement with J.P. Morgan to fund its expansion and the order of installation vessels.  Two vessels were ordered from China’s CIMC Raffles using the GustoMSC NG20000X Jack-Up vessel design. The ships are reported to incorporate the latest battery hybrid drive train technology. Detailing the designs, Havfram had said the vessels would have the capability of installing offshore wind turbines with a rotor diameter of more than 300 meters, as well as XXL monopiles weighing up to 3,000 tons at water depths of up to 70 meters. Capacities were optimized for high variable deck load and the extreme lift heights expected over the next decade. The crane would have a lifting capacity of 3,250 tons.\nDEME said that Havfram's state-of-the-art vessels would be seamlessly integrated with DEME's existing fleet. They are due for delivery in the fourth quarter of this year and early in 2026 with Havfram reporting it had already booked approximately €600 million in assignments between 2026 and 2030. Havfram in 2023 said it had options for two additional vessels. It had also expored building a vessel for the U.S. offshore market.\nHavfram will be integrated into DEME’s Offshore Energy segment under the DEME brand. It plans to continue operations from Havfram’s current offices in Oslo, Norway. It said there would be no disruption to project planning for the Havfram’s assignments."

        "content": "The U.S. Navy reported on May 2 that its Strategic Systems Programs conducted a successful end-to-end flight test of a conventional hypersonic missile. While it was conducted from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, it is a key step toward the nation's first sea-based hypersonic weapon system.\nAccording to the details that were released, the test marked the first launch of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) capability utilizing the Navy's cold-gas launch technology. It is the same system that will be used for the sea-based platform for hypersonic missiles. The report said the test is informing the Navy fielding approach for the Conventional Prompt Strike offensive hypersonic capability, as well as the continued development and production of the common hypersonic missile that is being developed in partnership with the U.S. Army.\nThis test was the next step in the Navy's flight-testing program of the common All Up Round (AUR) that is being developed in partnership with the Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office. In 2024, the programs completed two additional end-to-end flight tests of the AUR that will be fielded to both the Navy and Army. In 2021, thefirst static fire testof the first stage of its newly developed 34.5” hypersonic missile was conducted.\n\n\nThe system uses a cold-gas launch (USN)\n\n\"The speed, range, and survivability of hypersonic weapons are key to integrated deterrence for America,\" said Secretary of the Navy John Phelan. \"When fielded, Conventional Prompt Strike will deliver unmatched capabilities to our warfighters.\"\nThe CPS Program has been diligently planning and executing engineering and test efforts topreparefor the first Navy fielding aboard the USSZumwalt. Last December, it wasrevealedthat the unique cannon turrets forward onZumwalthad been removed during a year-long overhaul preparing the vessel for the CPS system. A second destroyer of the class, USSMichael Monsoorwas also reported to be slated for a similar overhaul.\n\n\nUSS Zumwalt seen here in 2022 has now been refitted for the CPS system (USN)\n\nUtilizing an In-Air Launch test facility, the CPS program conducted an extensive test campaign to validate the launch approach before the completion of this flight test. Information gathered from this test will inform the continued development and production of the AUR and the first use of this cold-gas launch approach on a surface ship platform.\n\"The cold-gas approach allows the Navy to eject the missile from the platform and achieve a safe distance above the ship prior to first-stage ignition. This technical achievement brings SSP one step closer to fulfilling our role of providing a safe and reliable hypersonic capability to our Navy,\" said Vice Adm. Johnny R. Wolfe Jr, Director of the Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, which is the lead designer of the common hypersonic missile.\nThe rapid development and demonstration of conventional sea-based hypersonic strike weapon systems is a priority for the Navy as works to support the U.S.'s ability to deter, and if necessary, defeat potential strategic competitors. The range, accuracy, lethality, and survivability of hypersonics is reported to be a significant leap ahead in U.S. conventional strike capabilities, complementing existing capabilities and enabling the U.S. to defeat adversary high-end capabilities."

The groundbreaking for the Marsa LNG plant, a $1.6 billion investment by TotalEnergies and OQ Exploration and Production (OQEP), took place a year after the companies reached their final investment decision.\nFive years after it was conceived, construction of the plant that is designed to position Oman as an LNG hub serving the entire Gulf region has begun. The plant is being implemented by Marsa LNG, a joint venture between TotalEnergies that controls an 80 percent stake and OQEP with a 20 percent shareholding.\nLocated at Sohar Port and Freezone, one of the fastest-growing ports in the world and a major global shipping corridor, the 1 million tonnes per year (Mt/y) liquefaction plant will offer LNG bunkering to vessels operating across the Middle East. The plant, which is expected to start operations in the first quarter of 2028, is being implemented while Sohar is recording growth in the number of vessels calling at the port, with over 3,000 calls in 2024.\nMarsa has already signed a charter contract for a new bunkering vessel christenedMonte Shamsthat is under construction and which will be stationed in Sohar from 2028. It will be able to supply LNG to a wide range of vessels including containerships, tankers, and cruise ships, among others. The vessel, which will have a capacity of 18,600 cbm.\nThe Marsa LNG project will be powered by upstream gas production of 150 million cubic feet per day sourced from the Mabrouk North-East field in onshore Block 10. Marsa holds a 33.19 percent interest in the field, securing a reliable feedstock supply for the LNG plant.\nThe plant is being touted as one of the lowest carbon-intensity LNG facilities in the world. It will be fully electrified and combined with a 300 MW solar farm that will supply its annual energy needs.\n“With an ambitious technical design, we intend to set the standard and pave the way for the next generation of low-emissions LNG plants across the world,” said Patrick Pouyanné, TotalEnergies Chairman and CEO. “We also offer an effective way to support the shipping sector’s energy transition, by providing lower-emissions marine fuel in a key location at the entrance of the Gulf.”\nThe Marsa facility is part of TotalEnergies' ambitions to support LNG in the shipping energy transition. The company has actively invested in LNG bunkering infrastructure to support its shipping customers' adoption of LNG and currently deploys three bunker vessels, theGas Agilityat the Port of Rotterdam, theGas Vitalityat the Port of Marseille-Fos, and theBrassavolaat the Port of Singapore."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Navy’s Lewis B. Puller-class expeditionary mobile base USSMiguel Keithrecently completed a five-month Regular Overhaul but instead of undertaking it as a U.S. shipyard, it was completed at Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) in Yokohama. It marks the first time a Japanese shipyard has bid on and won a contract of this scale for a U.S. Navy vessel and the Navy’s strategy of using international shipyards to keep critical vessels available in their assigned areas.\nThe shipyard has previously conducted smaller voyage repair contracts for the U.S. Navy but the Navy’s regulations generally prohibit overhauling, repairing, or maintaining U.S. naval vessels in foreign-owned and operated shipyards outside the United States except for these small projects. However, it was determined since the ship was not scheduled to return to the U.S. within 15 months, and the project was under six months, that the work would be done in Asia.\nThis was the first regular overhaul project for the U.S. Ship Repair Facility and Regional Maintenance Center’s Singapore Detachment, according to Douglas Cabacungan, the Project Manager. “Usually, we provide shorter emergent and continuous maintenance repairs outside of Japan,” said Cabacungan. “So, we were able to expand our skill set, work outside of our comfort zone, and work with a contractor we normally do not work with which will pay dividends when we need to start operating in places we aren’t currently.”\nThe Singapore Detachment planned the $12 million project executed by MHI. During the availability, 56,000 square feet of nonskid decking was replaced on the flight deck and mission deck. In twenty-nine spaces, including the galley, scullery, laundry, and berthing areas, deck replacement and preservation were accomplished. Over 10,000 square feet of the forward deckhouse superstructure and MOGAS deck and associated equipment were also preserved. MHI also fabricated, welded, and replaced over 300 feet of flight deck catwalk safety handrails. Additionally, four galley ovens were replaced, and the entire exterior of the ship was painted bow to stern.\n“The ability to use Mitsubishi Heavy Industry’s shipyard to conduct this level of maintenance availability has allowed SRF-JRMC’s organic workforce in Yokosuka to focus their efforts on the three other warship maintenance availabilities being conducted simultaneously,” said Capt. Wendel Penetrante, Commander of SRF-JRMC. “We were even able to complete one of those availabilities 3 days early and respond to two unplanned voyage repairs.”\nThe USSMiguel Keithis a 787-foot (240-meter) long vessel designed to be a customizable floating command base that can launch helicopters and small boats, provide living quarters for troops, and command-and-control facilities. Her large open decks can accommodate a variety of other capabilities, including berthing for special operations troops, laundry facilities, or cold storage. The ship has been operating in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations since September 2020 with a mixed crew of sailors and civilian mariners from Military Sealift Command (MSC). The overhaul was completed on April 15 the Navy reports.\nThis project follows two large overhauls that were assigned in 2024 to South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean. The first wascompletedearlier this year and work on the USNSYukonis currentlyunderwayin South Korea.  The U.S. has also expanded its use of international shipyards assigning smaller projects for thefirst timein 2022 to India’s L&T (Larsen & Toubro) Kattupalli shipyard in Chennai.\nSecretary of the Navy John Phelan this week has beenvisiting shipyardsin Japan and South Korea. The discussions centered on the repair projects and support from the international yards as the United States looks to rebuild its shipbuilding capabilities and expand its fleet."

        "content": "The first monthly data has appeared since the major container carrier alliances began to shift, and it is showing a positive impact on schedule reliability. The analysts at Sea-Intelligence highlight that the sector remains in transition with the move to the new routes, schedules, and feeder systems not expected to be fully rolled out until July.\nMaersk and Hapag-Lloyd announced their new alliance called the Gemini Cooperation for key east-west trade routes promising 90 percent reliability for the key long-distance trade routes. Based on large investments in terminals and port operations, they are using a new approach based on more feeder routes into hub ports and fewer port calls for the larger vessels on the long-distance routes.\nThe companies have been saying anecdotally that early results showed they were meeting their goals and now the data analysis from Sea-Intelligence for March confirms that the Gemini Cooperation is on target. Sea-Intelligence highlights during their service transition there are multiple ways of measuring performance while reporting that Gemini is achieving between 85.7 and 90.3 percent reliability.\nMaersk has also said it would be the summer months before the first full results would be available for the new alliance. It predicted that the increased reliability would present an advantage in the market for shippers. This may be especially important in the current turbulent environment where the market is reacting to the tariffs and trade wars.\nBy comparison, the global container shipping sector achieved 57.5 percent schedule reliability in March. A three percent improvement, both month-over-month and year-over-year, Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence highlights it is “the highest level recorded since November 2023.” It was also the second consecutive month-over-month increase.\nFor most of 2024, the sector was achieving schedule reliability in the low to mid-50 percent range. For the year it averaged 53 percent. It was below the recent and pre-pandemic averages of 60 percent or higher.\nThe changes in the sector are also seeing the end of the 2M alliance between Maersk and MSC. Going mostly alone, MSC is now achieving approximately 75 percent on the east-west trade routes. Overall, across all routes, it was third in the industry at nearly 62 percent reliability.\nOther changes saw the launch of the new Premier Alliance, made up of HMM, Ocean Network Express (ONE), and Yang Ming after the departure of Hapag-Lloyd. Sea-Intelligence reports it launched with reliability between about 51 and 53 percent on the east-west routes.\nAmong the largest carriers, Maersk remains in the lead with nearly 67 percent reliability for all its routes. Hapag-Lloyd took second place at 64.3 percent.\nThe carriers are looking for new advantages in the market and to use with shippers as the trade war causes upheaval and an uncertain outlook. Carriers have moved quickly to blank sailing from their schedules in response to the tariffs while several have also reduced or eliminated trans-Pacific routes.\nSea-Intelligence says it will only be possible to truly evaluate the performance this summer as the transitions in the industry are completed and carriers settle into new patterns. However, the possible safe return to Red Sea routes could also have a strong impact on container shipping, and other segments, with some analysts expecting it could happen by the second or third quarter of 2025."

        "content": "\nThe Canadian Coast Guard is reporting progress with the salvage operations for the grounded containershipMSC Baltic IIIwhich has beenstrandedin a remote part of Newfoundland since losing power on February 15. Weather, despite it having progressed from winter to spring, continues to be the biggest challenge with the cove exposed where the vessel is grounded and days when crews cannot access the ship.\nAs of mid-week, the Coast Guard reports the salvage team hired by MSC had been successful in removing approximately 230 cubic meters of fuel from the vessel, with 195 cubic meters having been transferred from the barge to another of the company’s containershipsMSC Celine(2,732 TEU). The discrepancy in volume is due to the amount of residual oil left in the frac tanks after transfer.\nMSC Celinemade a stop in Corner Brook last weekend, April 25-26, during which time the fuel that had been pumped into frac tanks on a barge was transferred to the MSC vessel. AIS shows the ship departed April 26 and is due in Freeport, Bahamas on its normal route.\nThe fuel removal from the wreck is a slow process as it requires heating before the fuel is pumped from the vessel’s tanks to frac tanks that were placed on deck. When full the tanks are too heavy to lift, so the fuel needs to be again heated and it is pumped to tanks on a barge alongside. The Coast Guard reports four frac tanks on the deck of theMSC Baltic IIIare full. They were hoping for a window of good weather noting once that is pumped off approximately a quarter of the fuel will have been removed from the ship.\nImages on Canadian TV also showed the vessel’s cranes in operation shifting containers. The Coast Guard reports an additional 14 boxes had been transferred to a barge and moved by tug into Corner Brook where they will be placed on the dock. Previously they reported eight boxes with hazardous polymer beads were removed. The vessel had approximately 470 boxes aboard, although half were reported to be empty. Three empties were ripped open by the weather, but the Coast Guard highlighted the priority remains the removal of the fuel and reducing the pollution risk.\nCoastal surveys are continuing, and they reported finding two additional tar balls. Six tar balls had previously beenfound in mid-April, but they believe it was washed from the vessel and not a large leak. The hull however has multiple cracks with reports of water in the engine room and cargo holds.\nThere is no estimate of how long it will take to complete the salvage operation. The contractors hired by MSC have begun work on an access road into the area of the cove. It will be used to move personnel and equipment into the area. Earlier reports had said a bridge would be built to the bow of the vessel to also provide easier access and make the operations less dependent on good weather conditions."

The ferryChina Zorrilla(approximately 14,000 gross tons) being built for Argentina-based Buquebus was floated from the building dock today at the Incat shipyard in Hobart, Tasmania in Australia.\nOfficially known as Hull 096 currently, the vessel is 130 meters (426 feet) in length and when completed will carry up to 2,100 passengers and 225 vehicles. It was originally ordered in 2019 and then billed simply as the largest aluminum ship and designed for service on the River Plate running between Argentina and Uruguay.\nDiscussions began between Incat and the shipowner and in 2023 they reported they were investigating the possibility of replacing the planned LNG powerplant with a battery-electric solution. The original concept called for four dual-fuel engines using LNG and providing a maximum speed of over 40 knots.\nIncat reports the ship is now being equipped with over 250 tonnes of batteries and an Energy Storage System (ESS) boasting more than 40 megawatt-hours of installed capacity making it possible to run only on battery power. The ESS, which is four times larger than any previous maritime installation in the world, is connected to eight electric-driven waterjets and supplied by technology partner Wärtsilä. Corvus Energy was to develop the ESS system.\nThe shipyard boats that this combination of technology sets a new global benchmark for the shipping industry. It is being called a defining moment for maritime sustainability.\n\n\nThe ferry was floated out becomes the largest electric vehicle of its kind (Incat)\n\n“This is a historic day – not just for Incat, but for the future of maritime transport,” said Incat Chairman Robert Clifford. “We’ve been building world-leading vessels here in Tasmania for more than four decades, and Hull 096 is the most ambitious, most complex, and most important project we’ve ever delivered. This ship changes the game.”\nWork will now continue completing the vessel’s interior, which includes a 2,300 square meter duty-free retail deck – the largest shopping space on any ferry in the world. Final fit-out, battery installation, and energy system integration will take place ahead of sea trials later this year on the River Derwent.\nIncat previously reported the vessel was scheduled for delivery before the end of this year. The ship is the ninth Incat-built vessel for Buquebus."

As of the end of the day on Saturday, the AIS signal shows it has completed the Suez Canal transit.\nThe 15,670 GT vessel set off from the Bandar Abbas commercial port on April 18, making a port call in Jebel Ali, and departed on April 21. The vessel is not known to have made any port call en route and hence has taken much longer to complete the Jebel Ali to Suez leg of its voyage than would a normal commercial vessel.\nTheElyanais listed by name and is subject to secondary sanctions by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). It is linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), which is sanctioned as an entity.\nEquipped with deck davit cranes, theElyanawould be capable of off-loading cargo at unsophisticated ports en route, potentially being able to do so in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen without using the closely monitored (and recently demolished) ports of Hodeida and Ras Isa.\nIn June 2024, theElyanaunloaded cargo in Latakia, in Syria, which had been taken on in Bandar Abbas. While closely aligned with the doomed Assad regime in Syria, the IRGC are known to have used Latakia as a hub for their arms imports destined for Hezbollah and the Syrian regime, using shipping to the port of Latakia and flying Boeing 747 cargo aircraft directly into Latakia International Airport. In October 2024, Israeli aircraft targeted a number of Iranian-controlled arms dumps in the area, hitting one warehouse on the Russian-controlled Hmeimim airbase, a substantial ammunition depot in the adjacent port of Jableh, and also the cargo area of Latakia International Airport.\nOnce it leaves the Suez Canal, the final destination of theElyanais not known, albeit the vessel is currently proceeding northwards at 9.5 knots with its Automatic Identification System switched on. It is declaring a destination of Benghazi, Libya\nOn April 30, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Iran on his personal X account, posting that “We see your LETHAL support to The Houthis. We know exactly what you are doing,” and warning Iran it will face consequences for its continuing support."

        "content": "\nFor the first time in history, an unmanned drone boat has shot down a fixed-wing fighter aircraft in combat, according to Ukraine's military intelligence directorate (GUR).\nOn May 2, aUkrainian Magura-7naval drone operating near Novorossiysk opened fire on a Russian Su-30 fighter jet with a missile. The short-range engagement was successful, and the fighter broke up before falling into the sea, the drone's camera footage suggests.\nRussian military-linked blogger Rybar confirmed the shootdown; he said that both of the plane's pilots successfully ejected and were rescued by good Samaritans. He claimed that the munition was an R-73 (Archer) short-range air-to-air missile, a Soviet design repurposed in a surface-to-air role.\n\nCiting GUR chief Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the War Zone reports that the missile used was the U.S. Air Force's AIM-9, the standard short-range infrared-guided air-to-air missile of NATO forces. Budanov claimed that off-camera, the drone also shot down a second Su-30 in the same engagement.\nThe Kremlin has not commented.\nUkraine has experimented in adapting infrared air-to-air missiles onto the Magura platform previously. These munitions have the advantage of built-in target acquisition and homing systems, compact size and comparatively light weight.\nThe GUR is adding anti-aircraft missiles to its drones in an attempt to erode the Russian military's aviation capability in the northeastern Black Sea, as it already has on the surface. On New Year's Eve, a Magura droneshot downa Russian helicopter and damaged another over the Black Sea - the first time in history that a drone boat has shot down a manned aircraft of any kind in combat.\nThe Magura already dominates surface warfare throughout the northern half of the Black Sea. With extensive targeting and technical support from the U.S. military and the CIA (according to theNew York Times), Ukraine's drone fleet has had a devastating effect on Russian naval vessels. Russian forces have attempted to blunt further attacks by using helicopter and jet patrols to intercept the drones at sea, before they can reach protected harbors.\nThe Ukraine conflict is the first in history to be fought primarily by drone in every warfighting domain. On both sides, drone attacks now account for theoverwhelming majorityof personnel casualties in the land war; a large share of the airstrikes on infrastructure targets; and virtually all of the naval conflict in the Black Sea. In keeping with the drone-on-drone character of the rest of the war, the Russian military's next step in combating Ukrainian Magura sea drones is the deployment of airborne suicide drones, which Russian remote operators fly directly into inbound boats to blow them up.\nAttack on Novorossiysk\nIn a related action, Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale attack on the port of Novorossiysk on Saturday. Among other effects, a grain terminal and multiple apartment buildings were reportedly damaged in the strike, Russian officials said. Bystander videos on Russian social media confirmed that high-rise residential buildings were hit.\nRussia's defense ministry claimed that a total of 170 Ukrainian drones and 11 missiles were shot down over the course of the attack, along with 14 Ukrainian sea drones destroyed."

        "content": "\nAmid the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan, the two countries have taken further steps to limit their trade relations. On Saturday, the Indian government suspended imports of goods from Pakistan. The ban was imposed with immediate effect, with the government saying the measure is in the interest of national security.\nIn the same spirit, no Pakistani ships will be allowed to enter Indian ports. Indian flagged vessels were also banned from visiting Pakistani ports. “This order is issued to ensure safety of Indian assets, cargo and connected infrastructure,” said the Directorate General of Shipping.\nIslamabad has responded with similar measures in a tit-for-tat move, halting maritime trade and postal services with India. The Wagah-Attari crossing, the only land border between the two countries, remains closed.\nAlthough India and Pakistan have been arch-rivals for decades, matters became worse after the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgram, a resort town in the Indian-administered sector of contested Kashmir. New Delhi accused Islamabad of involvement in the attack, which saw at least 26 people killed.\nThe restrictions on imports and exports come at a time when the bilateral trade between India and Pakistan has been plummeting. This is largely as a result of trade barriers, which India started to introduce in 2019 following yet another terrorist attack in its Kashmir region.\nSince then, bilateral trade has fallen from a high of over $2 billion to just $1.2 billion in 2024. For instance, Pakistani exports to India dropped from $547.5 million in 2019 to just $480,000 last year. The main exports from Pakistan include glassware, copper, organic chemicals, fruits and nuts.\nOn the other hand, India’s main exports to Pakistan include pharmaceuticals, vegetables, plastic, coffee, cereals and dairy products. Data from India’s Ministry of Commerce show that in the period between April 2024 and January 2025, Indian exports to Pakistan amounted to $447 million.\nBut some trade experts believe that unofficial trade between India and Pakistan has soared, with traders turning to creative (and controversial) workarounds to avoid scrutiny. One such method is third-country transshipment via global ports such as Dubai, Singapore and Colombo, according to Ajay Srivastava, founder of India-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).\nGTRI estimates that over $10 billion worth of Indian goods reach Pakistan annually via such third-country transshipments.\n“While not always illegal, this grey-zone strategy highlights how trade adapts faster than policy. Trade finds a way, even when diplomacy doesn’t. Supply chains bend, not break, especially when there is demand on the other side,” added Srivastava."

The abandoned well had been spraying a mist of oil and gas into the air in a marsh near Pass a Loutre since April 26, releasing an unknown quantity of petroleum into the environment.\nOil spills are common in Louisiana, but this was on the larger side. So far, the response team has recovered 70,000 gallons of oily water mixture from the site. To keep the pollution from spreading, more than 20,000 feet of standard containment boom has been rolled out to encircle the wellhead and the work site. Cleanup and damage assessment efforts continue, according to the Coast Guard.\n“Gaining control of the discharge is a vital milestone, but it marks only the beginning of our work. The Unified Command is fully committed to an exhaustive cleanup effort and will remain on site for as long as necessary to ensure the removal of oil and the safety of both the community and the ecosystem,” said Capt. Greg Callaghan, Federal on Scene Coordinator.\nThe well was operated by Spectrum OpCo, which is a unit of Houston-based Spectrum Energy, according to NPR. Spectrum OpCo was the responsible party; on Thursday, the Coast Guard decided to federalize the response and tap the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to ensure \"continuity of operations.\"\nWell 59 was a disused wellhead that had been decommissioned 10 years ago. According to NPR station WWNO, the well dates back to the Second World War and is now 83 years old; the unknown condition of the well below the surface complicated the response effort, WWNO reported."

        "content": "Maersk Offshore Wind’s installation vessel marked a milestone with the float out of the unique ship from the Seatrium shipyard in Singapore. The vessel is being built as part of the group’s efforts to develop the offshore wind sector, but conceived with the U.S. market as its target, it is unclear how the vessel will be deployed.\nThe ship is designed to be positioned at the offshore wind farm development site and be fed by two specially designed barges carrying the material and brought to the site by tugs. The WTIV has a stabilizing system to hold the barges for the transfer of materials. The company has promoted that this would improve installation efficiency by up to 30 percent and critically would make the system compliant with the U.S. Jones Act which limits coastal operations for foreign vessels. Maersk’s WTIV will be registered in Denmark.\nMaersk Supply Services announced the order for the vessel in 2023 to be built by the yard then known as Sembcorp Marine due for delivery into U.S. waters in 2025. As part of the plan, the company was working with Kirby which at the time said it planned to invest between $80 and $100 million for the construction of the two barges and tugs as part of the feeder system. Edison Chouest Offshore stepped in during 2024 announcing it would build the tugs and barges for the installation system at the Bollinger Shipyards.\nThe installation vessel, which is approximately 475 feet (145 meters) in length was floated from the building dock and repositioned to the outfitting berth Maersk reports. There it will be fitted with its cranes, the largest of which will have a lifting capacity of 1,900 tonnes and the ability to reach up to 590 feet (180 meters) above the deck. Maersk has highlighted in the past the vessel would be capable of handling the largest offshore wind turbines. It will have 100 cabins and a walk-to-work gangway.\n\n\n\nInvestment company A.P. Moller Holding in 2023 acquired Maersk Supply Services which included the offshore wind business. A year later, however, it sold the majority of Maersk Supply Services to DOF but retained the offshore wind business which was launched as Maersk Offshore Wind.\nThe installation vessel’s first assignment was for the Empire Wind offshore wind farm being developed by Equinor. The project was underway when the Trump administration in mid-April issued a stop-work order for offshore construction. It said it would be reviewing the permitting claiming it had been rushed by the Biden administration.\nEquinor has said if the project which was fully permitted is stopped it would be libel to repay $1.5 billion for the equity commitments to the project financing. It said the project has a book value of around $2.5 billion and it could also be exposed to termination fees towards its suppliers. Equinor is complying with the U.S. order but called it “unlawful” and said it is reviewing steps including possible legal action.\nMaersk Offshore Wind in April predicted future growth for its business and foresaw ordering additional vessels. With the U.S. market likely stalled, however, it will have to look to Europe and other areas that continue to move for with their offshore wind projects."

Located in Philippines’ largest port of Manila, the modernized MSH is poised to take up more trade in the rapidly growing Southeast Asia corridor.\nThe MSH expansion project cost approximately $100 million, according to DP World and ATI. This went into the extension of a pier, dredging to a depth of 13 meters, yard expansion to accommodate 20,000 TEU and the purchase of two additional ship-to-shore (STS) cranes.\nIn addition, the expansion will see MSH’s annual capacity rise to two million TEUs, a jump of over 25 percent from the current 1.45 million TEUs. Notably, the two neo-post-panamax STS cranes are the biggest among MSH’s 11 quay-side equipment and among the biggest ever deployed in the Philippines. With an outreach of 58 meters, each crane can handle vessels carrying up to 20 containers wide.\nIn the past decade, cargo throughput at MSH has been on the rise. Last year, MSH handled 1.3 million TEUs, 8 percent higher than 2023. MSH handled 350,000 TEUs in the first quarter of 2025, over 25 percent higher compared to the same period in 2024.\nBesides MSH, DP World is also an operator in Batangas Port, Cavite Barge Terminal and several inland logistics terminals. ATI is the local partner of DP World in the Philippines.\n“The modernization projects at MSH are a testament to the long-standing private-public-partnership to enhance the country’s trade facilities and capabilities. We extend our gratitude to our partners from ATI and DP World for bringing in the operational knowledge, expertise and resources,” said Vince Dizon, Department of Transportation Secretary.\nWith a growing economy, the Philippines has committed funding to modernize its key ports. In December, the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) rolled out 66 port expansion projects worth over $420 million. Some of the upgrades earmarked under this initiative are almost complete, according to PPA general manager Jay Daniel, who visited some of the sites last week. One of the projects is the $10 million upgrade of the Banago port in Bacolod city. The project is on track for completion by the end of June 2025. It represents one of the largest port infrastructure investments on Negros Island by the Philippine government. The project involves expansion of the road network connecting to the port, upgrade of the roro marshalling yard to accommodate up to 50 trucks, and construction of a three-story passenger and operations building."

        "content": "\nUkraine has unveiled a 40-year concession plan for its Black Sea port of Chornomorsk. The details of this project were presented by Ukrainian government officials at an investment forum in Warsaw, Poland last month.\nThe Ministry of Development delegation said that the lease initiative is aimed at modernizing and expanding terminal infrastructure in Chornomorsk port. The concession will cover two terminals - a container terminal and a multipurpose terminal - with a potential of handling up to 760,000 TEU and over 5 million tons of cargo annually. The concession auction will be held in the second quarter of 2025, and a contract with the winner is expected to be signed in the fourth quarter of this year.\nThe lease project has been prepared with the help of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Tender documents are ready outlining the terms of participation, risk structure and guarantees of state support.\n“Despite ongoing military threats, the seaport sector has demonstrated exceptional resilience, maintaining significant cargo volumes. The concession of the container terminal in the port of Chornomorsk is an opportunity for investors to become part of the new logistics system in the Black Sea,” said Andrii Kashuba, Deputy Minister for Development of Communities and Territories.\nThe lease will complement the progress made with the new Black Sea corridor, as the government plans to diversify cargo routes and improve customs efficiency. Ukraine launched the Black Sea corridor in August 2023 after Russia withdrew from the UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative. This alternative trade corridor has proved resilient, with Ukraine using it to export almost 73 million tons of grain for the last two years.\nAs part of the greater ports of Odessa, Chornomorsk is a strategic maritime hub and a lifeline for Ukrainian global trade. The ports of Greater Odessa - including Pivdennyi, Chornomorsk and Odessa - continue to handle the highest cargo volumes for Ukrainian trade. For instance, out of 23 million tons of cargo handled by Ukrainian ports in the first quarter of 2025, 20.7 million tons was processed by the ports of Greater Odessa, according to data by the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority. This includes 10.6 million tons in Pivdennyi, 6.6 million tons in Chornomorsk and 3.5 million tons in Odessa."

There have been a much higher number of incidents on the land border between Indian and Pakistani-controlled areas of Kashmir, but these have been confined to small arms fire, whereas in previous periods of tension cross-border incidents have escalated into artillery exchanges.\nBesides the activity on the confrontation line in Kashmir, until now the primary Indian response to the attack has been political. This includes the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, under which river waters are shared, the expulsion of defense attaché staff, air space restrictions and the closure of land border crossing points. Pakistan has taken similar measures in response.\nAt sea, India has mounted additional reconnaissance flights over the Arabian Sea, using P-8I Poseidon aircraft from Indian Naval Air Squadron 316 based at Hansa in Goa. The Indian Navy also deploys Dornier 228 and MQ-9B drones for maritime reconnaissance. In 2024, the Indian Navy contracted to receive 15 MQ-9B Sea Guardian drones, for delivery by 2029, and the drones currently being used have been leased from General Atomics for use in the interim. One of the leased MQ-9Bs was lost over the Bay of Bengal last year, but was immediately replaced by General Atomics.\nIndia has also replicated Pakistan’s extended conduct of missile firing exercises in the Arabian Sea, but has done so in areas well back from the maritime boundary between the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) belonging to each country. These exercises have involved Kolkata Class destroyers, Nilgiri and Krivak Class frigates, with support from replenishment ships.\nThe Visakhapatnam class guided missile destroyer INSSurat(D69), commissioned in January, conducted a firing of a Barak 8 surface-to-air missiles, a system jointly developed with Israel. India’s most modern aircraft carrier INSVikrant(R11), commissioned in September 2023, has also been at sea in the area. Such a force could quickly move into position to replicate the Operation Talwar blockade of Karachi carried out effectively during the clash between the two countries in 1999. The Indian Navy, numbering about 150 ships and submarines, is numerically much larger than that of Pakistan.\nOutput from the spokesman at Indian Naval Headquarters in New Delhi has however been non-belligerent, focusing instead on an Indian Navy visit currently being carried out to Mauritius and the Maldives. Conversations have taken place between the Director of Operations of the respective nations on the hotline reserved for de-escalation efforts at times of tension.\nOperating just 120 nautical miles from recent Indian naval drills, a threat often overlooked is China’s distant-water fleet - these vessels may double up as listening posts, tracking deployment rhythms & response patterns, feeding early warning, naval intel to their sponsorspic.twitter.com/katZv8t5fW\nOpen source observer of naval matters in the region Damien Symon has also noted that there is an extremely large Chinese fishing fleet lying just outside the Indian EEZ, consisting of 224 fishing boats. China has a well-established record of using its fishing fleet for supplementary naval duties such as intelligence gathering, but such a mass of vessels could be used to disrupt naval operations.\nOn April 28, the Indian government announced that it had signed a $7.4 billion contract with France for the delivery of 22 single and four tandem-seat Rafale-Marine aircraft, a type only otherwise in service with the French Navy. The aircraft are for delivery by 2030, and will complement the land-based version of the Rafale, which is already in service with the Indian Air Force. The aircraft are intended to provide the air wing component for INS Vikrant. Both the aircraft and the carrier will be based at Visakhapatnam Naval Base on India’s eastern seaboard."

The vessel has also been deflagged by its registry, leaving it stateless, and at least three nations have reportedly denied it a port of refuge.\nTheConscience(ex nameAdler Nordica) is a 1972-built passenger ship of 120 dwt capacity. It was operating under German ownership until 2023, when it was sold to Turkish interests. It was reflagged in Palau in 2024, and in January 2025 it was resold to a Libyan firm based in Tripoli. RenamedConscience, it is now operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an NGO that has taken up the mantle of the famous 2010 Free Gaza Movement flotilla.\nThe group's objective is to run the Israeli Navy's blockade of Gaza and deliver a symbolic quantity of humanitarian aid to shore. Israel has imposed strict limits on food aid deliveries to Gaza on and off for the past year, and for the last two months, enhanced restrictions - intended to increase pressure on terrorist group Hamas - have reduced food imports for the civilian populace to near-zero. Israel has offered to allow aid flows to restart, but only if delivered to Israeli-authorized sites in a small section of southern Gaza, with no food available in the rest of the territory. The UN has refused this restricted delivery plan, alleging that it is an attempt to coerce the population into moving into a concentration area to get food.\n\"Food stocks have now mainly run out, water access has become impossible,\" reported United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs spokesperson Olga Cherevko from Gaza on Friday. \"Gaza is inching closer to running on empty.\"\nIn this context, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition attempted to organize a blockade run to get food to Gaza's shores. Their plan was to bring dozens of activists aboard the Conscience - including the climate activist Greta Thunberg - and set sail from Malta with an aid cargo. On Friday, as the passengers were gathering in Malta and preparing to board, two blasts hit the ship, damaging the hull and disabling a generator. Video from aboard the ship showed a blast hole in the foredeck and smoke throughout the vessel's interior; crewmembers reported that the ship was taking on water at the bow.\nThe NGO claims that the blasts were from two Israeli drone strikes. Malta is 1,000 nautical miles west of Israel, outside of range for most drone operations, suggesting a different launch point if the NGO's allegations are true.\nOn Sunday, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition alleged that Maltese authorities had denied activists access to the ship in international waters, forcing a delegation to go back to shore to go through Maltese customs and immigration. \"This is the second day in a row where Maltese authorities have blocked FFC access to its ship, crew and participants,\" the NGO claimed, adding that Malta has refused requests to provide a port of refuge for repairs.\nMaltese Prime Minister Robert Abela told Reuters that his government was not interfering with the ship, and said that the crew had refused to allow surveyors and Maltese police to board to investigate the damage.\nIt is not the first time that an activist group has attempted to breach the Gaza blockade. In 2010, the Free Gaza Movement and the Turkish Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms financed a multi-ship flotilla to deliver aid to the restricted district's shores. Israeli commandos boarded the ships as they approached, and nine activists were killed in the ensuing melee."

Operating for nearly 15 years it was the company’s largest international asset while the move is part of a strategy to hone the company’s portfolio.\nPRIO, Brazil’s largest independent oil and gas company, and already a minority partner in the project will pay $3.35 billion and a maximum of $150 million in interest to acquire Equinor’s 60 percent interest in the project. Equinor is also the operator of the project. PRION in 2024 acquired a 40 percent position from China’s SPEP Energy Hong Kong and Sinochem International Oil for $1.915 million.\nDiscovered in 1994, the Peregrino field is just over 50 miles off the coast in the Campos Basin. Equinor has been operating in the field since 2009 with the first oil delivered in 2011. It reports that around 300 million barrels of oil have been produced while PRIO reported as of January 2024 independent estimates set the field’s future resources at 338 million barrels and a potential abandonment date forecast for after 2037.\n“This deal is part of Equinor's ongoing effort to high-grade its international portfolio through asset divestments and acquisitions,” said Philippe Mathieu, Executive Vice President for Exploration and Production International at Equinor. “With this transaction, we realize value from a long-standing asset in our Brazil portfolio.”\nPeregrino is a heavy oil field and consists of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) platform, supported by three fixed platforms. Equinor reports its current share of production from Peregrino was around 55,000 barrels per day.\nPRIO in December cited plans to increase production by about 35,000 barrels per day. It also cited the potential to optimize logistics with its other operations in the region. The company said it would look to combine cargo loads from other fields it operates to optimize the operation.\nEquinor highlights that it is not abandoning Brazil. It says it will focus on starting up the Bacalhau field and continue progressing with the Raia gas project. With these two operated projects and its partnership in Roncador, Equinor projects its equity production in Brazil will be close to 200,000 barrels per day by 2030."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Marine Corps' new antiship role in the Western Pacific made a major debut in the latest round of joint U.S.-Philippine exercises. Traditionally focused on amphibious assault and crisis response, the USMC has restructured its doctrine to get ready for the fight in the First Island Chain, with China's powerful surface navy squarely in its sights.\nThe new, reenvisioned Marine Corps is centered in part on a light unmanned truck with two antiship missiles - the Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, or NMESIS. The NMESIS unit has a survivability edge over a typical coastal defense battery, as the launchers are unmanned, easily relocated, and can be controlled remotely - reducing the risk that personnel will be hit in any attack on the launch site.\nEach launcher truck is capable of partial or full autonomous navigation, and carries two Kongsberg-built Naval Strike Missiles (NSMs), the same antiship missile fielded by the U.S. Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (and by vessels of five other NATO nations). The NSM is built of composites and has a stealthy profile, designed to evade detection by the target vessel's air defense radar.\n\nA NMESIS launcher arrives at Batan Island aboard a C-130 transport aircraft (USMC)\nDuring Balikatan 2025, for the first time, Marine Corps units with NMESIS launchers deployed to the Batanes Islands in the Luzon Strait. The task force used a standard C-130 transport aircraft to fly the lightweight launch equipment into the theater. The rapid deployment and the location sent a message: from central Batan Island, the NSM could range the full span of the Bashi Channel and the rest of the Strait, from the southern tip of Taiwan to the northern tip of Luzon.\nIn future operations, NMESIS would likely deploy into a combat zone in larger numbers: each Marine Corps NMESIS unit will field 18 launchers, and the service wants to have three units (54 launchers) forward-positioned in the Pacific. The service wants to have a total of 261 launchers in its inventory by 2030."

In the event of a cross-strait invasion, small teams of heavily-armed marines would fan out to unimproved outposts south of Okinawa, where they would be well-positioned to harass Chinese warships with long-range missiles. The strategy depends on logistics to move these teams into remote locations, resupply them, and relocate them on the fly to keep ahead of the enemy. This requires a new fleet of landing craft, drones, and other methods of short-range transportation.\n\nOne novel transport mode could be advantageous in a fight, the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL)'s Matthew Koch told TWZ: an all-electric WIG craft. Koch's team is looking closely at Regent's Viceroy Seaglider, a 12-seat passenger craft designed to hit speeds of 180 knots on pure battery-electric power.\nLike other WIG designs, the Seaglider stays close to the surface and does not require FAA pilot licensing for operation. Unlike other WIG craft, it is whisper-quiet and cool-running because of its electric motors. This would give marines a fast, low-heat-signature, below-the-radar method to sneak into or out of remote sites.\n\nThe first Regent Viceroy prototype began sea trials earlier this year. First commercial delivery is expected in 2027, and Regent says that it has secured billions in commercial preorders.\nThe Marine Corps has put down $10 million for a parallel military demonstration program, on top of a $5 million initial R&D contract."

        "content": "\nThe Joint Expeditionary Force, a coalition of 10 European nations, recently demonstrated its skills and practiced coordination as it moved a strategic cargo through the Baltic region. The exercise known as Baltic Express involved warships from Denmark and Sweden, and a pair of RAF Typhoon fighter aircraft from 140 Expeditionary Air Wing, supported by strategic resources at key points in Northern Europe as\nThe 13,274 dwt UK sealift vessel MVHartland Point, built in 2002, was loaded with more than 3,500 tonnes of vehicles and other equipment for the British Army’s 4th Light Brigade Combat team. The unit will be training with the Estonian Armed Forces in exercises throughout May.\n“Baltic Express was uniquely JEF activity, demonstrating how we bring nations together to act,” said Captain Dan Thomas of the Royal Navy and the senior officer who oversaw Baltic Express. “This successful escorting mission was our contribution towards enabling a major national exercise in Estonia. Baltic Express also showcased how we would reinforce our allies in the eastern Baltic Sea in a NATO Article 3 context, and offer NATO extra options in the event of a crisis.”\nDeparting from Marchwood on the UK’s south coast on April 24, the JEF highlights it gave them a chance to practice coordination skills as the vessel sailed east toward its destination at the Estonian port of Paldiski, where it arrived on April 27. The 820-nautical-mile journey presented an opportunity for the coalition which is made up of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nAir, land, and sea assets were involved in the escort operation moving strategic cargo across the Baltic (JEF)\n\nTheHartland Pointwas met at the entrance to the Baltic Sea by the Danish frigateAbsalonand the ocean patrol vesselFreja. These warships escorted MVHartland Pointthrough the Kattegat and handed her over to the Swedish corvette Sundsvall. She also received air cover from two RAF Typhoons from 140 Air Expeditionary Wing, currently based in Poland as part of a NATO air-policing operation.\nAs Hartland Point headed east through the Baltic Sea, her progress was radar monitored from operations centers in Denmark, Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. In addition, the German Navy / NATO headquarters based in Rostock, Germany, known as Commander Task Force Baltic, also played an essential role in Baltic Express by coordinating all maritime activity across its area of responsibility.\nShe was traveling to support the maritime escort operation and defense exercise in Estonia, both part of a series of military activities taking place from April to June under the collective title of Razoredge. The effort is drawing together JEF nations and NATO allies in a series of military and civilian, multi-domain activities and engagements across the Baltic Sea Region. The aim of Razoredge is to strengthen alliances, show unity, and showcase collective solidarity in the face of new security challenges."

When the hybrid-electric vessel enters service later this year it will be the first the line had that is capable of operating in a fully zero-emission mode.\nThe vessel which is still going by its hull number 1090 and the code name Futura is equipped with a 10 MW battery capacity which will make it possible to complete the run between Rodbyhaven in Denmark and Puttgarden in Germany in approximately one hour in zero emissions mode at a speed of 10 knots or 45 minutes at a speed of up to 16 knots in hybrid mode. Shore charging will be introduced this fall making it possible to recharge the battery system in just 12 minutes.\nThe ferry was designed by LMG Marin and in addition to its hybrid propulsion was to be ready for future upgrades to methanol. While achieving the reduction or elimination in emissions the ferry is also 23 percent larger than the four Scandlines runs on the route currently. It is 485 feet (147 meters) in length with a capacity for 66 freight units (1200 lane meters) and a maximum of 140 passengers.\n\n\nRendering of the new ferry which will be capable of running on batteries in a zero-emission mode (LMG Marin)\n\nMarin’s modular design also means the vessel can be converted to car cars as well. A double-ended Ro-Ro the ferry is also able to transport trucks on both its upper and lower decks.\nKongsberg reported in 2022 that the vessel would use its azimuth thruster Azipull. The thruster it said would be delivered with controllable pitch propellers, in an L-drive configuration with an integrated permanent magnet drive motor. This they reported would increase overall energy efficiency while reducing noise and vibrations.\nBuilt at the Cemre Shipyard in Yalova, Turkey, trials began in March. Scandlines reports equipment testing and auxiliary systems tests as well as a heeling test were recently completed at the equipment berth. The unique vessel has already completed its first round of Sea Acceptance Tests and now is back at the outfitting dock.\nA comprehensive process to test all the systems and equipment is underway. Scandlines is working with the shipyard, Lloyd’s Register, and the Danish Maritime Authority for the testing, verification, and documentation of the ferry.\nAs soon as the handover is completed, the ferry will depart for Denmark. Stops are planned in Gibraltar and Brest, France before proceeding to Rodbyhavn. After an official naming, it will be deployed sailing on the Fehmarnbelt and a critical route connecting Denmark and Germany.\nThe vessel is the latest pioneering ship developed by Cemre. In mid-April, the yard also delivered a large fully electric ferry for Norway."

        "content": "\nA wide-reaching coalition of states involved in offshore as well as onshore wind energy filed suit in federal district court on May 5 seeking to stop the implementation of the presidential executive order to suspend and review leasing for wind energy projects. They are calling the “blockade” on wind energy projects “unlawful,” and asked the District Court in Massachusetts to issue a preliminary injunction to immediately stop the administration from enforcing the freeze while the litigation proceeds.\n“This administration is devastating one of our nation’s fastest-growing sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy,” said New York State Attorney General Letitia James. “This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet.”\nAccording to New York State, “The administration’s indefinite blockade could leave billions of dollars in states’ clean energy investments stranded or underutilized and significantly harm their economic development.”\nAssociated Press got a comment from the White House calling the lawsuit “lawfare” from Democratic attorneys general and linked wind energy to the “Democrats’ radical climate agenda.” A spokesperson said it was an effort to stop a popular agenda energy and to stop unleashing American energy and lower prices.\nDonald Trump signed an Executive Order on January 20 suspending all federal approvals for wind energy projects and ordering his departments to begin a review of the industry and the licensing process. Since then, the Department of the Interior ordered New York’s Empire Wind project being developed by Equinor to stop construction even though the project was fully licensed in 2024. The EPA has also revoked an air permit related to the construction of a planned offshore wind farm in New Jersey while the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management stopped reviews, and grants to a research project in Maine for floating wind turbines were suspended.\n“The President’s attempts to stop homegrown wind energy development directly contradict his claims that there is a growing need for reliable domestic energy,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. “My colleagues and I will continue to challenge this administration’s unlawful actions to chill investment and growth of this critical industry.”\nThe101-page filingcites the hypocrisy of the president’s approach to energy pointing out that Donald Trump also signed an Executive Order declaring a “National Energy Emergency, purportedly brought on by the country’s alleged ‘insufficient energy production’.”  The Executive Order called for steps to “shore up the inadequate energy supply.”\nThe filing says while energy, and specifically domestic energy, is a high priority the administration is threatening to undermine a critical source of clean energy and job growth. They note the years of bipartisan support for offshore and onshore wind energy projects and the efforts in Trump’s first term. They state that states have a responsibility to meet increased energy demand.\nThe suit contends that the president is acting outside his legal authority and has no statutory right to shut down the permitting process. They are calling the order “arbitrary and capricious” saying it is in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\nThey are asking the court to intervene and rule the approval blockade unlawful. They want the court to prevent the departments from enforcing the order and wind energy permitting process.\nThe coalition filing the suite includes states involved in offshore wind energy (Massachusetts, New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington) as well as other states (Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, and the District of Columbia).\nIt comes as developer Equinor has also threatened to challenge in court the federal order to stop its project off New York. Others in the industry however have already pulled back on their U.S. investment plans moving their emphasis to Europe and other parts of the world which continue to adopt offshore wind energy development."

After assembling a list of 23 passengers and 21 crewmembers who were aboard on the casualty voyage, rescue agency Basarnas identified two missing crewmembers - named as Ilham and Khayu - who may have been trapped in the wreckage.\nSurface search efforts continued Tuesday, and a Basarnas dive team has deployed to the site for a search and recovery mission within the vessel's interior. Both missing individuals were recovered deceased, and the search has been suspended, according to local outlet Beritakaltim."

        "content": "\n\nGoogle, which is expanding its use of renewable power for its operations, is reporting that its latest power agreement will be the first time a corporate power purchase agreement has extended the lifespan of an offshore wind farm. Google has entered into a power purchase agreement with Shell for the nearly 20-year-old Egmond aan Zee offshore wind farm taking up 100 percent of the site’s 108 MW capacity.\nEgmond aan Zee was built as part of the NoordzeeWind joint venture with Vattenfall with Shell controlling a 50 percent share. The wind farm located approximately six miles from the coast began production in 2007 becoming the first large-scale commercial offshore wind farm to be built in the Dutch North Sea. Shell acquired full ownership of the wind farm in 2021.\nGoogle’s newest power purchase agreement for the site will permit Shell to extend the lifespan of the offshore wind farm by at least four years beyond its original decommissioning date. According to Google, it permit enabled Shell to pursue permit extensions and invest in crucial upgrades.\nShell NoordzeeWind will be the first offshore wind farm to undergo a life extension in the Netherlands. Google says that it believes it is also the first that faced decommissioning and permit expirations, but will be extended through the corporate PPA.\nTo date, Google reports it has supported over 1 gigawatt of clean energy generation capacity in the Netherlands through PPAs. This investment in offshore wind reflects Google’s broader commitment to employ renewable energy. It hopes this effort will inspire similar partnerships giving new life to clean energy assets facing retirement.\nAt the beginning of 2024, Goggle reported adding over 700 MW of renewable energy agreements in Europe, including in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Poland.  This included agreements with Shell and with Eneco, owners of the Crosswind & Ecowende joint ventures. Google said it would support 478 megawatts of carbon-free energy capacity with two new-to-the-grid offshore wind farms: HKN V and HKW VI.\nGoogle last month also signed its first power purchase agreement for offshore wind energy in Taiwan and the Asia Pacific region. Google has committed to purchase renewable energy from the Fengmiao I offshore wind project being developed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and due to begin generation in 2027."

The vessel had drawnnew interestafter safety and security concerns were raised in January 2025 which led to a government order to remove the vessel.\nA Port of Gdynia Authority spokesperson confirmed to the media on May 5 that the tankerKhatanga(23,000 dwt) is ready to leave the port but said they had requested additional time from the Maritime Directorate in Gdynia. In February, an order was issued requiring theremoval of the shipfrom the port within three months. Port officials said they had been trying for months to gain the authority to remove the ship which they noted had broken away from the dock on two occasions and which they believed was a safety threat.\nMedia reports at the time highlighted that the cargo tanks had not been properly vented for years increasing the risk of an explosion. There was also speculation that the Russians might be using the ship as a base to spy on NATO activities in the port.\nTheKhatangaarrived in Gdynia in October 2017 but was detained after issues were identified during a Port State inspection. The owners, Murmansk Shipping Company, promised repairs to address structural issues identified during the inspection and to take steps to correct issues identified regarding the training and competence of the crew. Instead, the tanker languished in the port before the owner declared bankruptcy in 2020. A court-appointed receiver checked on the vessel on several occasions, but it was otherwise abandoned without a crew or maintenance. However, because it was involved in a bankruptcy the port lacked the authority to have the vessel removed.\nPort officials report following the government order that the tanker has now been sold to a qualified scrapyard in Denmark licensed for the required remediation and dismantling of the vessel. However, because the European Union has classified the vessel as waste, and because it is incapable of navigation, they require documentation before the ship can be towed from the port.\nCurrently, they are waiting for the necessary documentation from the Danish Ministry of the Environment. In preparation, the port spokesperson said that technical and environmental activities have been completed, and the fuel onboard has been removed.\nThe Maritime Directorate in Gdynia also authorized the port to seek reimbursement from the Russian shipowner for the costs incurred while the ship had remained at Gdynia. In February 2025, port officials estimated the costs at nearly $3.5 million.\n(Top photo in Gdynia harbor in July 2020 byBraveheart-CC BY-SA 4.0)"

        "content": "After pressure from the cruise industry and concerns raised by local government in the states where cruises contribute to the economy, Mexico’s federal government has reportedly agreed to a lower amount and phased-in rollout to thehefty head taxplanned for cruise passengers. News of an agreement is in the Mexican press after intense negotiations that started in December while the implementation was delayed for six months.\nCiting the need to support the Mexican economy and for port development, the federal government announced in late 2024 that it would end an exemption for cruise passengers of the head tax charged to short-stay tourists known as a Non-Resident Duty. The fee was to be set at $42 per passenger as of January 1, 2025, with the potential of higher costs when the local port taxes were also factored into the cost.\nThe cruise industry complained saying that Mexico was jeopardizing the long-standing relationship and its economy with the costs. The government relented announcing a six-month delay till July 1, giving the industry time to adjust. At the same time, the negotiations began seeking a compromise with the industry. In April, it was reported that the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association was working hard to strike a compromise.\nMexican media reports indicate that the deal was struck so that the head tax will begin in July at $5 per person for the next 13 months. From August 2026 through July 2027, it will step up to $10 per person and then $15 in 2027-2028. As of November 2028, it will increase to $21 per passenger.\nThe reports said the intervention of the governor of the Quintana Roo state Mara Lezama was instrumental in reaching the compromise. Her state is home to the popular ports of Cozumel and Playa del Carmen and derives significant income from the cruise industry.\nThe cruise lines have also agreed to promote port infrastructure projects including the proposed fourth pier in Cozumel. They will also seek to increase the number of cruise passengers they bring to the Mexican ports and will promote Mexican goods aboard their ships. They will also increase the acquisition of supplies in Mexico.\nFederal Tourism Secretary Josefina Rodriguez is reported to have called the agreement a major step to contribute to Mexico’s economic development.\nThe cruise industry executives speaking at the Seatrade Cruise Conference in April called for greater collaboration with ports around the world and said they hoped ports would discuss concerns with them. They cite the potential for collaboration while ports and popular destinations struggle with the influx of passengers and the impact of over-tourism. As cruise ships increase in size and capacity, many destinations are looking for ways to balance cruise passengers with onshore tourism and maintain the environment for residents.\nThe reports from Mexico said a joint announcement of the agreement will be released in the coming days."

Moller – Maersk have agreed to expand their long-term working relationship to jointly develop future decarbonization solutions for vessels while HD Hyundai will expand its use of Maersk’s integrated logistics services across its affiliates. The companies plan to explore technology for vessel efficiency and route optimization as well as research on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell systems.\nMaersk has long worked with Hyundai as a shipbuilder for its containerships. The companies starting in 2021 worked closely on the development and construction of the first methanol dual-fuel containerships. HD Hyundai’s Mipo Shipyard in South Korea built theLaura Maersk, the company’s 2,100 TEU feeder ship that was the first to use methanol. It was delivered in 2023 and was followed with the order for 18 large 16,000 TEU methanol dual-fuel containerships. The first was christened in January 2024 and the company has continued the integration of the ships into its fleet.\nDiscussing the new agreement, Chung Kisun, Vice Chairman & CEO of HD Hyundai said, “We will rapidly advance the world’s best shipbuilding technologies with the goal of building a sustainable maritime logistics network that ensures safety, low-emissions, and optimal efficiency.”\nInitially, the two companies will conduct a six-month trial of new technologies on a Maersk container vessel built by HD Hyundai Heavy Industries. They will test applying Avikus’ HiNAS, an advanced navigation solution for energy-efficient vessel operations, and HD Hyundai Marine Solution's OCEANWISE route optimization to the operations of the boxship. The purpose of this trial is to validate the fuel-saving and greenhouse gas emission-reduction impacts of optimized navigation systems.\nRobert Maersk Uggla, Chairman of A.P. Moller – Maersk, called the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the company on May 6 at the HD Hyundai Global R&D Center in Seongnam, “an important milestone, reinforcing the strong relationship we have developed.” He said it would pave the way for even greater collaboration in the future.\nThe companies also plan to explore cooperation in the field of ship retrofitting for decarbonization, including optimizing engine efficiency, increasing container ship cargo capacity, and retrofitting dual-fuel propulsion systems, Maersk has previously worked with China’s  Zhoushan Yatai Ship Engineering and Repair Co. for the first conversion of a conventional containership to dual-fuel methanol.\nMaersk and Hyundai report they will also collaborate on joint research to examine the feasibility of the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) system. Testing of hydrogen-based systems is in an early phase as multiple companies look at fuel cells as a source of electric power in the future.\nHD Hyundai reports it will also strengthen its global supply chain by leveraging Maersk’s integrated logistics services. This includes expanding ocean freight volumes supported by Maersk’s East-West network and utilizing Maersk’s capabilities across airfreight services and land transportation, as well as warehousing infrastructure. The initial phase of the partnership will focus on providing tailored logistics solutions for HD Hyundai’s affiliates including HD Hyundai XiteSolution, and HD Hyundai Marine Solution, and will be gradually rolled out across other affiliates."

        "content": "\nThe Trump administration has decided to implement a mutual ceasefire with Yemen's Houthi rebels, President Donald Trump announced in a press conference Tuesday. He said that U.S. bombing runs over Yemen would cease \"effective immediately,\" and that he would take the Houthis \"at their word\" that they would cease attacking American shipping.\nAccording to the Sultanate of Oman, which brokered the reported agreement, \"neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping.\"\nThis appears to return relations between the Houthis and the U.S. to the state thatexisted in January, when a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza prompted the Houthi leadership to halt attacks on most shipping.\nThe Israeli government was not informed of the U.S.-Houthi detente ahead of Trump's announcement, according to The Jerusalem Post's Amichai Stein.\nAfter Trump's statement, official Houthi outlets pledged to continue missile attacks on Israeli territory.\nIt remains unclear whether the new ceasefire also ensures the safety of non-American shipping in the Red Sea, including Israeli-linked shipping. A State Department spokesperson declined to clarify, and referred reporters back to the president's remarks.\nMohammed Ali al Houthi, one member of the Houthi leadership council, has cast doubt on whether the arrangement is final. In a statement on X, he said that the group would evaluate an American proposal \"on the ground\" before making any formal agreements. Trump described the arrangement not as a deal, but a \"capitulation\" - a Houthi proposal to give up attacks on shipping in exchange for an end to U.S. bombing.\nThe effects of combined U.S. and Israeli airstrikes would have given the Houthi leadership a powerful incentive to reach a compromise agreement. American forces have hit Houthi command posts and weapons sites \"around the clock\" since March 15, and two carriers have been deployed in the Red Sea to ensure a high tempo of bombing runs. Since last weekend, Israeli forces have launched mass attacks on dual-use targets in Houthi areas, destroying the airport in the group's capital of Sana'a, the seaport at Hodeidah and several cement factories. The ceasefire announcement followed just hours after the latest Israeli raid.\nPossible guidance improvementsin the Houthis' Iranian-supplied missile inventory may also have made the group more dangerous to U.S. military assets in recent weeks. Satellite imagery suggests that at least one U.S. Navy carrier off Yemen was forced to make unusual high-speed evasive maneuvers in late April, and the Navy hasconfirmed the lossof an F/A-18 strike fighter over the side of USSHarry S. Trumanduring a hard turn; the crew got out of the way before it went over, but one crewmember was injured.\nAfter the ceasefire announcement, analysts' attention has quickly turned to the Houthis' Iranian sponsors - and the question of whether the truce would be durable.\n\"If this sticks, the Houthis and Iran will use the quiet to rebuild Houthi capabilities in Yemen and try to create the illusion that Tehran is de-escalating amid U.S.-Iran talks when it's a tactical pause to survive,\" said United Against a Nuclear Iran's Jason Brodsky. \"Recall after Israel struck Iranian soil last year, the regime pushed Hezbollah into a ceasefire to not only buy quiet to rearm, but to avoid further damage to Iranian interests.\""

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) based in Singapore released what it believes is the first comprehensive study looking at the emissions savings and costs associated with the use of onboard carbon capture and storage systems. The center notes that while life cycle assessments are available for onshore carbon capture technologies, assessments of the overall GHG emissions from deploying these solutions onboard vessels across the associated value chains are limited. It hopes the results of its new study will provide shipowners with valuable information as they consider incorporating the technology into their planning.\nThe study, namedCOLOSSUS(Carbon capture, offloading, onshore storage, utilization, and permanent storage), provides an in-depth analysis of GHG emissions and costs associated with OCCS across the entire carbon value chain, accounting for emissions from fuel production, transport, and use, to CO2 capture onboard the vessel and its final disposition. The study explored five OCCS technologies, with six marine fuel options, and three post-capture scenarios.\nThe key findings illustrated some encouraging potential for ship owners with for example a base finding of a 29 percent savings well-to-wake in GHG emissions for a vessel burning heavy fuel oil (HFO) using the most developed of the OCCS technologies (monoethanolamine (MEA)-based OCCS). This is considered to be the most mature of the technologies.\nThe savings can be expanded by replacing HFO with biofuels. For example, bio-LNG and biodiesel from used cooking oil combined with OCCS they found could produce reductions of 69 to 121 percent well-to-wake.\nAmong the post-capture scenarios evaluated, using the captured CO2 in concrete they reported is most effective. This approach can increase GHG emissions savings from 29 to 60 percent across the carbon value chain by partially displacing the need for carbon-intensive cement in applications ashore. Captured CO2 they also reported can be used to produce e-methanol with renewable electricity, allowing the vessel that consumes this e-methanol to claim a 17 percent GHG emissions savings.\nPost-capture transport and permanent storage of CO2 they also reported add minimal emissions, approximately 1 percent to the WtW emissions of a vessel deploying MEA-based OCCS when the captured CO2 is transported 1,000 km. They also concluded that the cost of avoided carbon for OCCS with permanent storage is between $269 to $405/tCO2 for a 40 percent gross capture on an MR tanker.The results also show a potential pathway for extending the economic life of current in-service vessels. They highlight that an HFO-fueled ship adopting MEA-based OCCS at 40 percent gross capture can, on a WtW basis, maintain an equivalent GFI below the direct compliance target until 2032. Similarly, LNG-fueled ships equipped with the same OCCS can maintain an equivalent GFI below the direct compliance target until 2035. Further, when fossil fuels are completely replaced by their bio-counterparts, OCCS can lower the GFI enough for the ship to be compliant with the more stringent 2040 targets.“As we face an increasing array of decarbonization solutions spanning different industries and value chains, coupled with the challenges of quantifying and elucidating carbon flows from source to sink including its re-use, there is a pressing need for a comparable means to understand their net abatement impact,” said Professor Lynn Loo, CEO of GCMD. “We hope this LCA (life cycle assessment) study for OCCS provides a foundation for the comprehensive understanding needed to shape robust regulatory frameworks surrounding OCCS and supports decision makers in making informed, value chain-based decisions.”\nThe Center notes that while the recently articulated GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) framework does not explicitly specify how emissions reduction from OCCS is taken into consideration, they believe the study offers a structured basis for assessing the solution’s potential in helping shipowners and operators manage their emissions' portfolio."

The company looks to bring its co-branded approach with the National Geographic Society to the fast-growing European river cruise market.\nLindblad is partnering with a newly launched firm called Transcend Cruises which was started in 2024 as a charter-only river cruising company. Transcend focuses on B2B marketing offering customized group travel on its ships. It is focused on the affinity market, tour operators, travel advisors, and meeting and incentive planners.\nTranscend in 2024 ordered its first river cruise ships to be built by Den Breejen Shipyard in the Netherlands. The first two ships, which will each measure 443 feet (135 meters) are due for delivery by early 2026. The ships will each have accommodations for up to 120 passengers.\n\"Our state-of-the-art newbuild river cruise ships offer both a luxury experience, as well as the opportunity to accommodate the lecturing and mind-enriching requirements essential for their travelers,” said Hans Rood, CEO of Transcend Cruises. “With a strong focus on wellness, sustainability and best of services, we are the perfect fit to deliver the programs Lindblad Expeditions require. By collaborating, we are able to create the most exclusive experiences on Europe's most spectacular waterways.\"\n\n\nTranscend's first two river cruise ships are due for delivery by early 2026 (Transcend)\n\nThe European cruise market has been developed by leaders including Viking, AmaWaterways, Avalon, UniWorld, and others focusing on cultural and lifestyle experiences. The success of the market has attracted many brands and last year Royal Caribbean Group announced it would expand its Celebrity Cruises brand into river cruising.\n“We know that 'how you see it' matters, and that's why we've curated these river voyages with the same depth, care, and expertise that define all of our expeditions,” said Natalya Leahy, CEO of Lindblad Expeditions announcing the plans for European river cruising.  “With National Geographic naturalists and historians, and exclusive events woven into each journey, our guests will explore Europe's storied rivers in truly meaningful ways.”\nThe European river cruise program will start in 2026. The company said details including which rivers it would be sailing will be released in the coming weeks.\nAccording to Lindblad, each voyage will be staffed by one of the brand's veteran Expedition Leaders, several knowledgeable Field Staff, and at least one National Geographic Expert. Staff will guide guests on private tours, exclusive tastings, and expertly curated synonymous with the co-brand. Lindblad and National Geographic have been partners for over 20 years and more recently the company’s ships have all taken on the National Geographic brand identity.\nLindblad launched its first expedition in 1966 with the first non-scientific civilian expedition to Antarctica.  Today, the company reports the largest, most diverse fleet of expedition ships in the industry, consisting of 22 owned and chartered mission-built vessels ranging in size from 16 – 148 guests. Lindblad Expeditions offers over 100 unique itineraries across six continents, selling and operating over 600 annual departures on behalf of the National Geographic-Lindblad Expeditions co-brand."

Local police units pursued him on the Indian River for an hour before pushing the vessel into the mangroves to force it to a stop.\nAccording to the local sheriffs' office, Vilkov made a circuitous journey to get there, and he likely stole more than one boat.\nAt about 0100 hours Monday morning, Vilkov arrived at a restaurant parking lot in Jupiter, Florida, and was captured on surveillance camera walking down to a marina. At about 0200 hours, a TowBoat US response boat at that marina started up without authorization, and its GPS tracker showed it moving north. It then ran aground on a sandbar, and the unauthorized operator abandoned it. The thief was not immediately identified.\nAt 0300 hours, police for the town of Jupiter found Vilkov, who was on foot and walking down a highway near the site of the grounding. They had no evidence to connect him to the missing TowBoat US vessel, so he was allowed to go.\nAt about 1200-1300 hours, Vilkov arrived at a different marina, located about three hours to the north, police said. Bystanders spotted him aboard a 68-foot luxury yacht, preparing to get under way. At about 1555 hours, the dockmaster for the marina called police to report that the yacht had been stolen.\nMarine units from multiple police agencies pursued the yacht until about 1730 hours, when they pushed it into a mangrove thicket near Hobe Sound Bridge, about six miles north of the marina where the theft began.\n\nCourtesy Martin County Sheriffs' Office\nThe police believe that Vilkov was attempting to make it another eight miles north to St. Lucie Inlet, then head for sea and make a run for the Bahamas. His motives are unclear; he had been in the U.S. since 2022 after legally claiming asylum status. His wife and child flew back to Russia last week, police told local WPTV.\nThe yacht sustained damage from the brief grounding and from its encounter in the mangroves. Vilkov has been charged with grand theft, aggravated fleeing, and resisting arrest for the theft of the yacht, and he will likely be charged in connection with the theft of the TowBoat US vessel as well.\nThe Department of Homeland Security is assisting in the investigation, and has provided a Russian interpreter. Whether Vilkov is convicted or not, he will likely be deported to Russia after his time in police custody, Sheriff John Budensiek told WPTV."

In this instance, however, it is emerging from the May 4 attack that the Houthis have a capability which could threaten both ports and ships at sea.\nThis may explain why the carrier USSHarry S. Truman(CVN-75) has been seen performing vigorous evasive maneuvers in the Red Sea, one of which is likely on April 28 to have caused theloss overboardof an F/A-18 being deck-handled.\nUpdate: CSG 8The image below is from 23 April, not 28 AprilCould be an issue on the Sentinel side given their delays in sharing Red Sea imagery or it was my error (more likely)Regardless, apologies for the incorrect date and on the posthttps://t.co/Cz8YdGwn5e\nWhat the Houthis described as a Palestine-2 missile impacted on waste ground within Ben Gurion International Airport, landing within 500 yards of the Terminal 3 building and injuring a number of people in the adjacent car park. Attempts to shoot down the incoming missile using both US THAAD batteries and Israel’s Arrow-2/3 systems both failed, although Israel claimed the missile type was not new, had been shot down before, and that technical faults had affected both interceptor systems.\nIn reality, the likelihood of simultaneous faults occurring on two separate interceptor systems is low. This apparent heightened threat, plus the proximity of the impact point to a busy airport terminal building, provoked an unusually angry Israeli government response.\nOn the evening of May 5, after a pause of many months, Israel launched thefirst waveof an attack using 20 aircraft, firing 50 missiles at military and infrastructure targets in Yemen, including what was left of the port at Hodeida and Yemen’s largest cement factory at Bajil.\nAt least 10 airstrikes targeted Yemen's ???????? Hodeidah port, the Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah TV reported on Monday, blaming the strikes on Israel ???????? and the United States ????????, a day after the Iran-aligned group launched a missile that struck near Israel's main airport…pic.twitter.com/MhLCUk07Eh\nOn May 6, attacks at the same scale continued, with Sana’a International Airport comprehensively targeted. Israel’s Arabic language spokesman tweeted out a warning to civilians to clear the airport area an hour before impact. Several power stations in Sana’a were also struck, as was a second cement factory in Amran.\nThe apparently improved performance of the Houthi missile may potentially be connected to the unveiling by Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh of an improved warhead to their Haj Qasem medium-range solid fuel missile. The separating warhead appears to be independently maneuverable, and its rounded nose, apparent in imagery of a test flight, supports claims by the Brigadier that it has a non-emitting homing system immune to jamming, probably using an electro-optical sensor to compare the image gathered passively with pre-loaded satellite imagery of the target.\nIran unveils an electro-optically guided version of its Haj Qasem missile, dubbed Qasem-e Basir.- Claimed to feature improved reentry vehicle maneuverability- Resistant to GNSS jamming in the terminal phase- Range reportedly around 1,200 kmpic.twitter.com/jYKWY0KBNp\nThe Iranians are claiming to be back-fitting this new warhead to their existing silo-based Haj Qasem fleet, calling the upgraded missile the Qasem Basir. But the warhead is small enough to have been shipped into Yemen as an assembly, for the Houthis to integrate onto their own versions of the Haji Qasem.\nIn recent days, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that Iran has indeed been spotted shipping weaponry to the Houthis. The Houthis could do so for example by using Iranian cargo ships equipped with deck davit cranes to offload cargoes at remote ports on the Hodeida coastline; such a ship, the MVElyana(IMO: 9165827), made a northerly passage up the Red Sea at the end of April, and is currently en route to Benghazi.\nThe electro-optic target acquisition system in the Iranian missile warhead is best suited to static targets with distinctive layouts such as airports. Hence the Houthi threats in the wake of the Ben Gurion attack to target airports in the future as part of an ‘air blockade’ of Israel, and also Iranian threats to hit airfields in GCC states which support American operations.\nPorts also make distinctive targets for this relatively unsophisticated homing system. A harder task for such an acquisition system would be to target an aircraft carrier - but the Houthis appear in recent days to have been attempting to use their new capability for just this very purpose.\nIf precedent is followed, the Houthis will attempt another missile attack shortly, to demonstrate that they retain offensive intent, despite the Israeli air attacks. Senior Houthi figures continued to issue threats after the second wave of airstrikes."

Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have launched a new wave of attacks which expanded today to target and damage key parts of the port.\nMedia reports cited a loud explosion early Tuesday morning coming for the port area in Port Sudan followed by pictures of large plumes of smoke. The attacks were reportedly launched by drones and marked the first time Port Sudan has been directly targeted in the new wave of violence.\nThe fuel storage area in the port was reported to be burning. Pictures released by the Sudan News also showed areas of the container port on fire. Several ships appeared to be docked in the port.\n\n??? ???? ???? ???? ?????#???????????????? ???????? ??????? ??#?????????????? ???? ?????? ????? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ???? ?????? ??????? ?????? ???? ?????? ????? ???? ????? ???????? ????????pic.twitter.com/0IOXs7DGka\n\nThe news reports said it was part of a larger wave of attacks with the city’s commercial airport also hit. An army base was also reportedly targeted.\nCivilian teams were working to control the fires, but it is unclear if there have been causalities or deaths from today’s attack. The Sunday News reported marine activities resumed in the port later in the day.\n\nFor the third day in a row, UAE-backed Rapid Support Force has launched heavy attacks on Port Sudan, resulted total blackout.Military bases, power stations and civilian areas have been hit, causing serious damage.pic.twitter.com/Tnn7wA45qb\n\nPort Sudan is a critical point for the country and its population which is reported to be facing starvation. Most of the humanitarian aid entered the country passes through Port Sudan. It is the main cargo handling facility both for dry bulk and nearly one million containers annually. The government supported by the army also fled into Port Sudan after losing the country’s capital Khartoum and much of the east of the country to the RSF forces.\nThe latest wave of attacks started on Sunday when the RSF forces launched a drone attack on a military base outside the city limits. On Monday they also launched attacks on the country’s main fuel storage depot south of the city.\nUN officials on Monday called the latest escalation a “worrying development,” saying it would threaten humanitarian efforts. The UN has estimated that nearly nine million people are displaced in the country with many having fled to the relative calm around Port Sudan."

HM Customs made a sizable drug bust from a bulker in the anchorage by deploying drones that were acquired in December 2024.\nThe Chinese-owned bulker Great Zhou (39,744 dwt) arrived in Gibraltar on April 30 on a bunkering stop after a voyage from Santos, Brazil. HM Customs undertook a routine check of the vessel while also using its newly acquired drones.\nThe survey of the underwater areas of the vessel raised suspicions at one of the vessel’s sea chests on the port side of the hull. Divers ultimately retrieved four packages that had been hidden in the sea chest and the investigation found they contained 120 kg of cocaine.\n\n\n\nHM Customs detained the vessel and interviewed the crew. It was later permitted to proceed to a scheduled port call in Italy.\nThe Chief Minister, the Hon Fabian Picardo congratulated HM Customs for the successful operation. He noted, “This is why my Government has made serious investment in HM Customs to support their crucial work in combatting drug crime, with real results for Gibraltar and for other countries that these drugs are intended for.\"\nOfficials in Gibraltar believe the crew was not aware of the drugs hidden on the outside of the hull. They also believed that the drugs were not meant to be offloaded in Gibraltar but would have proceeded to another country in Europe but through their efforts interrupted a smuggling operation."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "Erik Kravets",
        "content": "\nLast year'sGaza floating-pier missionwas even more fraught than previously reported, according to a new investigation by the Pentagon's independent inspector general's office. In addition to theservicemember who was killedin an accident during cargo operations, 62 people were injured in unspecified incidents, theIG found.\nMost of the problems were built into the operation before it got under way. The IG found that the Army and Navy had systematically downsized their joint logistics over the shore (JLOTS) capabilities since 2018, leaving remaining units undermanned and underequipped for the mission. The Army hadcut its watercraft division'sinventory from 134 vessels down to 64, and the Navy had eliminated one of its two JLOTS units. The surviving units had a low (but undisclosed) mission readiness rate, and had a hard time meeting manning requirements for watercraft. Officials involved in the deployment told the IG after the fact that \"the DoD's current JLOTS capabilities were not sufficient to meet projected needs.\"\nIn addition, the Army and Navy pontoon systems were different and resulted in damage when used together; they were designed with different amounts of freeboard, and Army boats would ram into and puncture the sides of taller Navy pontoons. After challenges experienced in a previous exercise, the services had concluded that these systems could not be used together - but they were still deployed and combined for the operation off Gaza.\nIn the run-up to the deployment, planners also failed to take beach conditions and sea states at the site under consideration - a profound and inexplicable error for this particular system. Certain elements of the JLOTS pier and pontoon system are rated for surface conditions of Sea State 3 or less, equivalent to a gentle breeze and waves of less than four feet. These conditions could be expected in a sheltered bay or harbor, but the operating site was on an exposed beachhead facing the sea. One bout of rough weather tore the pier structure apart and scattered pontoon sections along the beachfront, and after this experience, the operating units were forced toremove and withdraw the structureto the shelter of a nearby port whenever the forecast called for higher waves.\nTaken together, these challenges severely limited the mission's ability to deliver food; ultimately, the JLOTS system was in working service forjust 23 days, and it shipped just 8,100 tonnes of food and other aid to shore - a small fraction of what one merchant ship could have delivered to the Israeli port of Ashdod, just 25 miles northeast.\nThe IG called for the Navy and the Army to go over their respective JLOTS units and determine how to bring them up to mission-capable levels.\nThe mission's failure did not go unnoticed. In designing its own over-the-shore logistics system, the Chinese People's Liberation Army learned from the limitations of floating piers, and it jumped straight to a jack-up system instead. Itsnewly built landing bargesare equipped with tall jack-up legs to get out of the wave action, and they are fitted with extra-long bridging ramps to land troops and vehicles far up the beach. They can be connected end-to-end to form a \"causeway\" out to deeper water, giving Chinese military logistics vessels a comparatively secure, less weather-dependent landing platform to offload."

        "author": "Erik Kravets",
        "content": "\nDanish renewable energy giant Ørsted has decided to discontinue efforts on the fourth phase of a major UK offshore wind energy project, which comes as a major blow to the UK’s renewable energy ambitions. The company is citing increased costs and risks despite the UK’s decision in 2024 to increase its support for the projects and the new government’s strong commitment to wind energy.\nØrsted has decided to discontinue the UK’s Hornsea 4 project in its current form, attributing the move to a combination of increased supply chain costs, higher interest rates, and increased execution risk. These factors, the company determined, have deteriorated the expected value creation from the project. It asserts that it, however, remains fully committed to the UK market.\nLocated approximately 40 miles off the UK coast and with a capacity to generate 2.4 GW, Hornsea 4 was the company’s fourth gigawatt-scale project in the Hornsea zone. Both Hornsea 1 and Hornsea 2, with a combined capacity of 2.5 GW, are operational, while Hornsea 3, with a 2.9 GW capacity, is currently under construction.\nØrsted was awarded the Contract for Difference (CfD) for Hornsea 4 in September last year and had planned to reach a final investment decision later this year for the wind farm that would have powered 2.6 million UK households. The CfD was at a strike price of £58.87 ($77.40) per megawatt hour (MWh), a fixed price at which the company would sell the electricity generated for the first 15 years.\nHowever, changing dynamics in the offshore industry, the company said, forced it to abandon the project. Ørsted highlights that the new developments have increased the execution risk and deteriorated the value creation of the project, meaning it was not viable to continue with its implementation in the current form.\nTaking the decision to stop further spending on Hornsea 4 and terminating the project’s supply chain contracts is resulting in material negative impacts on the company’s books. The company will incur costs of $533.4 million to $685.7 million in 2025 to shelve the project. The EBITDA impact is expected to be $475 million to $533.4 million, which includes a write-down of the offshore transmission assets and a provision for contract cancellation fees. The impacts on its books also include a write-down of between $76 million and $152.3 million in capitalized construction costs.\n“Our capital allocation is based on a strict and value-focused approach, and after careful consideration, we’ve decided to discontinue the development of the Hornsea 4 project in its current form,” said Rasmus Errboe, Ørsted Group President and CEO.\nErrboe, who only took over the leadership of the company in January following the ouster of Mads Nipper, added that adverse macroeconomic developments, continued supply chain challenges, and increased execution, market, and operational risks have eroded value creation from the project.\nDespite putting the brakes on Hornsea 4, Ørsted says that if industry fundamentals change in the future, it might reconsider the development. While discontinuing the project is a big blow for Ørsted, the company is still reporting a solid operational performance and reaching more than 10 GW of offshore capacity during the first quarter of this year. Ørsted saw its operating profit (EBITDA) increase by 18 percent to $1.3 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the same period last year.\nDespite the challenges engulfing the offshore industry, the company maintained its full-year guidance of between $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion, excluding earnings from new partnership agreements and impacts from cancellation fees. This year, the firm is also committing between $7.6 billion and $8.2 billion in capex."

        "content": "\nYemen's Houthi rebels have begun to clarify their version of the Red Sea truce agreement announced by the White House, and it appears that international shipping may still face risks on the waterway.\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced that the Houthis had \"capitulated\" after an extended U.S.-Israeli bombing campaign. The group agreed to stop attacking U.S. shipping, Trump said, and U.S. forces would immediately stop bombing sites in Yemen.\nAfter Trump's statement, official Houthi media channels announced that the group would continue to attack Israel in retaliation for the ongoing military operations in Gaza. On Wednesday, Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam emphasized that the new agreement with the White House did not affect the group's hostilities with Israel in \"any way, shape or form.\"\nIf the Houthis' plans to attack Israel also extend to Israeli shipping, the new ceasefire may not reduce risk for foreign-flag commercial traffic. The Houthis have previously attacked vessels with documented links to Israel, but they have used the same justification to attack vessels with no clear Israeli ties - and even vessels that have clear ties to Houthi allies. If this targeting pattern continues, neutral vessels could be targeted as \"Israeli ships,\" whether by accident or by intent.\nGiven the uncertainty, leading ocean carriers have suggested that they will wait some months after hostilities end before returning their ships to the Red Sea at scale, in part because of the cost and disruption of adjusting global networks to a different route. It would be expensive to change from the Cape of Good Hope route to Suez, then change back to the Cape route again if the Houthis began targeting foreign-flag merchant ships once more.\nAnalysts agree that when container shipping does return to the shorter Red Sea route, the global ocean freight market will return to a familiar pattern - overcapacity and thin margins.\n\"The one element of the container shipping market that affects freight rates the most . . . may be nearing an end. But, let's see if this is really happening,\" said Xeneta lead analyst Peter Sand in a social media post. \"If transiting the Red Sea to its full extent is once again safe . . . the balance of the market will once again shift. From its current tightness to one where overcapacity will depress freight rates.\""

        "content": "Argentine officials now believe they have dealt a knock-out blow against organized crime and drug smuggling in what is being reported to be the largest drug seizure in the history of Port San Lorenzo. The investigations are ongoing to unravel some of the mysteries of the case and confirm the details provided by the ship’s cook, who has confessed to his role in the smuggling operation.\nThe authorities believe the situation began in late April. The Greece-managed bulkerCeci(42,665 dwt) registered in the Marshall Islands arrived off Montevideo, Uruguay, on April 20, where she anchored for four days. She was arriving on a trip from the UAE and Bandar Imam Khomeini Port in Iran. On April 25, she docked at the inland port of San Lorenzo, Argentina, where she was loading 46,000 tons of pressed sunflower seeds and was scheduled to sail to Amsterdam.\nThe situation began to unfold when on Tuesday night, April 29, the captain of the vessel made his rounds inspecting his ship as they prepared to get underway. In the cold food storage area holding the supplies for the crew, the captain spotted “suspicious packages.” He notified the shipping company, which in turn contracted the Financial Intelligence Unit. The Coast Guard descended on the ship and began a search using trained dogs.\nThe police found a total of 16 carefully wrapped watertight bundles, and inside 379 packages. Testing confirmed 469,500 kilos of high-purity cocaine. The value in Argentina was set at nearly $6 million, with reports saying that if it had reached Europe, the value would have soared to at least $20 million.\nAlong with the cocaine, the police found GPS devices, nets, ropes, and other gear that they suspect was used to possibly bring the cocaine aboard and would have been used to lower the bundles over the side of the ship at a designated drop point. The police said drop-on-drop-off is a common technique, but it means someone on the ship had to be assisting the professional gang behind the shipment. The cartels are known to look for “cheap labor,” seeking out low-level crewmembers on the ships.\nThe 20 Filipino seafarers from the ship were detained and questioned. Media reports say the ship’s cook, Jonathan Caputero, confessed to his role. The police have arrested him, making him the first international crewmember to be apprehended in a smuggling effort. They are examining his cell phone, and the ship, as of May 7, remains in San Lorenzo.\nThe police are still trying to corroborate the story told by the cook and determine key points such as when the drugs were loaded onto the ship. They began reviewing three days of videos from the San Lorenzo port. Some media reports are saying they found traces of salt water on the bales, which corresponds to the story told by the cook that the bales came aboard while they were anchored in Montevideo, but the police are suspicious that the drugs would have been loaded on an inbound ship.\nMedia reports said the cook also told them that another ship had first been tagged for the shipment, but it was changed. He also indicated that additional drugs were to have been loaded in San Lorenzo, but they never materialized.\nOne technique the police are considering is that the drugs came aboard via a boat alongside loading supplies on the ship. Another would be a speedboat meeting the ship, and the drugs being hoisted onto the deck.\nSeveral of the major drug kingpins who would have led such an operation are in jail. The police are trying to determine who was behind this shipment and if a new leader is emerging for one of the cartels."

        "content": "\nThe European Commission is proposing two key strategies to further curtail the Russian energy market and move toward energy independence. While citing strong progress, commissioners said more must be done to break free and continue the pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\nAccording to the media reports, the proposal for the 17th round of sanctions enacted since the start of the war in Ukraine was distributed to the member countries on Tuesday, and today, May 7, discussions began on the scope of the package. Reports indicate it is not only focusing on the shadow fleet but also the companies and countries helping Russia avoid the current sanctions and further restrictions on exports of goods and advanced technologies that can be used by the Russian military.\nThe number of vessels and organizations included in the proposed package varies between reports, but most agree that more than 100 additional tankers could be sanctioned. That would bring to over 300 the number of vessels the EU has designated. Between 50 and 60 individuals and entities are believed to be targeted, including ones in China, Vietnam, Turkey, and Serbia, according to a story in the Financial Times.  Others could be included that are in the UAE and Uzbekistan.\nBloomberg is reporting today that the package may also target, for the first time, Litasco Middle East DMCC, the trading division of Lukoil based in Dubai. Bloomberg reports that Lukoil was the second-largest seller of Russian crude in the international markets in 2024. The package may also include the Russian insurance company VSK, but it will continue an exemption until at least June 2026 for Russia’s Sakhalin-2 energy project, which is reported to be vital to Japan.\nThe European Commission cited data showing that Russian oil imports have been slashed from 27 percent at the beginning of 2022 to just three percent of the EU market. Further, it points out that coal imports have been totally banned, and now it is moving to end gas imports. They cited data that gas imports fell from a market share of 45 percent (150 bcm) in 2021 to 19 percent (52 bcm) in 2024. However, they acknowledged that 2024 saw a rebound in Russian gas imports.\n“It is now time for Europe to completely cut off its energy ties with an unreliable supplier,” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  EU Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jorgensen joined the president in saying “No more,” citing Russia’s weaponizing energy, blackmail against member states, and using monies for its war chest.\nUnder the proposed plan, a roadmap is set out to gradually remove Russian oil, gas, and nuclear energy from the EU markets. Member states have said in the past that they needed the EU to act so that they could break long-term contracts. Under the proposal presented yesterday, the EC calls for ending new contracts with suppliers of Russian gas, including pipelines and LNG, at the end of 2025. This would include existing spot contracts. That step, they said, would slash by one-third the remaining supplies of Russian gas. The Commission proposed to stop all remaining Russian gas imports by the end of 2027. Attention would then turn to the phase out of nuclear energy and uranium.\nThe EU expects to replace up to 100 billion cubic meters of natural gas by 2030. They expect a decrease in demand by 40 to 50 bcm by 2027 while noting at the same time LNG capacities are expected to increase around the world by around 200 bcm by 2028. They note that it would be more than five times the current EU imports of Russian gas."

        "content": "\nOn Tuesday, the same day that the White House announced a truce with Yemen's Houthi rebels, another F/A-18 fighter went over the side of the carrier USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea. It is the second lost overboard and the third lost overall since the supercarrier deployed to waters off Yemen.\nThe fighter came in for a landing and touched down, but the arresting cable system failed and the aircraft went over the side, an unnamed official told CNN and AP. Two pilots ejected successfully, and they were rescued by one of the carrier's helicopters. They sustained minor injuries but survived. No injuries were reported aboard the carrier. The Navy has not officially confirmed the accident, and it was not immediately clear whether it occurred before or after President Donald Trump's announcement of a ceasefire in the Red Sea on Tuesday.\nLast month, an F/A-18 fighter rolled over the side from Truman's hangar deck elevator while it was being moved, along with the tractor that was towing it. Truman was turning hard to avoid an incoming Houthi threat, and the sudden maneuver was enough to send the unsecured aircraft overboard. One crewmember sustained slight injuries but none were killed or pulled over the side in the incident.\nIn December, one of Truman's escorts - the cruiser USS Gettysburg - accidentally shot down one of the carrier's F/A-18 fighters with an anti-aircraft missile. The friendly fire mishap occurred after an engagement with inbound Houthi drones and missiles, and Gettysburg appears to have mistaken the airborne fighter for a threat.\nTruman and USS Carl Vinson were engaged in \"round-the-clock\" operations against Houthi targets from March 15 through May 6, when the campaign ended with a ceasefire that the White House described as a \"capitulation.\" Truman has had her deployment extended twice, and was scheduled to head home at last sometime next week.\nThe Navy often acts to recover the wreckage of intact fighter aircraft from the bottom after a mishap in order to prevent foreign intelligence-gathering efforts. Wreck recovery efforts in the contested waterway have not yet been announced; if the ceasefire holds, the unarmed subsea construction vessels that are often used for these deepwater salvage projects could access the area without risk of Houthi attack."

        "content": "In an unusual move for the Trump administration, it is turning to the United Nations’ Security Council, calling for action to crack down on North Korea’s sanctions violations. It specifically cited data on North Korea shipping munitions, including artillery shells and rockets to Russia, and exporting coal and iron ore to China.\n“This Council needs to address these egregious violations of Security Council resolutions despite Russia’s and China’s efforts to obstruct the Council from updating the 1718 Sanctions List,” said Acting U.S. Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Dorothy Shea. She was speaking during a May 7 Security Council briefing on Nonproliferation and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea).\nShea highlighted independent evidence of the sanction-busting activities of North Korea while emphasizing that Russia last year vetoed the mandated renewal of the 1718 Committee Panel of Experts (referring to UN Resolution 1718 adopted in 2006 to impose sanctions on North Korea following its nuclear tests). Shea contended that China had tacitly supported Russia’s 2024 veto.\n“The United States urges all states to ensure their flag registries de-flag vessels for which there is evidence of involvement in sanctions-evasion activities, even if they are not formally designated on the UN’s 1718 Sanctions List due to the obstruction of these two committee members,” said Shea. “We also call on the 1718 Committee to facilitate the implementation of the Council’s sanctions on the DPRK, consistent with its mandate, by updating for the first time since 2018 the list of vessels designated under this regime.\n\n\nAmbassador Shea called on the UN Security Council to crack down on North Korea and its sanctions violations shipping munitions to Russia and commodities to China (US Mission to the UN)\n\nIn the coming days, Shea announced the U.S. plans to nominate for designation in the 1718 Committee vessels clearly identified during today’s briefing for violations of UN sanctions restrictions. The U.S. is pushing for these efforts as Greece is the current president of the council, and before Russia rotates into the leadership of the council later in the year.\nShea thanked the Open Source Center, which the U.S. said continues to investigate and provide credible reporting on violations and evasions by North Korea of the Security Council resolutions. The U.S. told the council that the Open Source Center is systematically examining hundreds of satellite images to build models tracking vessels and containers. The U.S. said the analysis shows billions of dollars’ worth of artillery shells, rockets, and munitions being shipped from North Korea.\nAn April 15 report by the Center entitledBrothers in Armsdetailed the munitions trade. It says that over 24,000 containers of munitions and related material, as well as over 100 ballistic missiles, were shipped from North Korea to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine.\nA new report released today calledBack in Blackdetails the coal trade. The analysis identifies six vessels that have made 18 voyages, all but one to China, carrying prohibited commodities. It reports that the vessels are using common evasion techniques such as switching off AIS signals to go dark, but that they cannot evade the satellites. The U.S. said today at the Security Council that Chinese authorities are looking the other way as Chinese companies import North Korean coal and iron ore in violation of the resolutions.\nThe actions by the U.S. come as the Trump administration has yet to have a permanent representative to the U.N. confirmed. Shea has been serving as Deputy U.S. Representative to the United Nations since her nomination last summer by the Biden administration, and previously was the Ambassador to Lebanon during the first Trump administration. Donald Trump last week said he would nominate his National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, to the position after he withdrew the nomination of New York Representative in the House Elise Stefanik in March 2025. In the past, Trump has acted independent and often questioned the value of the United Nations."

It comes as India seeks to become a powerhouse in international shipping, shipbuilding, and repairs.\nJapan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines is continuing the trend by expanding its fleet under the Indian flag. According to India’s Economic Times, MOL (India) has emerged as the country’s fourth-largest ship owner. It has a fleet of 11 ships operating under the Indian flag and staffed with Indian crews as per the requirements of the flag.\nIn April, the company reflagged its LPG carrierYamabuki(58,811 dwt) to India and renamed the shipGreen Sachi. Built in 2010, the vessel became the eighth LPG carrier the company has flagged in India. The ship had previously been registered in Liberia. Its move followed its sister ship, which becameGreen Sanviunder the Indian flag in November 2024.\nThe company, in March, when the management was transferred to the Indian company, highlighted it as a “valuable addition significantly expands our fleet capabilities and strengthens our commitment to serving the Indian subcontinent.” They said the vessel would play a crucial role in enhancing our regional operations, providing reliable and efficient maritime transport solutions.”\nIndia’s government the Economic Times highlights is taking steps to encourage the growth of its domestic fleet. The cabinet approved a subsidy scheme for vessels registered in India after February 2021 and budgeted a subsidy for moving crude oil, LPG, coal, and fertilizer for state-run firms on Indian ships.\n\n\nCMA CGM recently transferred the first of four containerships to the Indian flag (IRS)\n\nMajor shipping companies are responding to India as they look to increase business with the subcontinent.

The ships are currently registered in the Marshall Islands. The deal valued each vessel at $75 million, with delivery set for the third quarter of 2025.\nBW LPG India was established as a joint venture in 2017 and currently has seven ships. It reports transporting approximately 20 percent of India’s gas imports. BW cited the opportunities tied to India’s continued growth in LPG demand.\nThe newest arrival to the Indian ship registry is CMA CGM, which became the first major foreign carrier to reflag a containership to the Indian flag.CMA CGM Vitoriawas officially transferred on April 28. The company said it will register three more vessels in the coming months in India. They highlighted that the efforts underscore CMA CGM’s commitment to India and its ambition to further develop its presence in the country.\nThe Indian Registry of Shipping commented that this milestone, with the transfer of the CMA CGM vessel, marks a significant achievement in IRS’s growing engagement with major global shipping companies. They said it reinforces its standing as a trusted and recognized classification society on the international stage."

        "content": "\nPresident Donald Trump has switched nominees for the post of Maritime Administrator, withdrawing the nomination of Capt. Brent Sadler (USN, ret'd) and substituting Capt. Stephen Carmel, a former Maersk Line Ltd. executive with decades of commercial maritime experience. No formal announcement was made for the change; MARAD has been without a confirmed leader since former administrator Adm. Ann Phillips' resignation in mid-January.\n\"Stephen Carmel is solid - bottom line the nation needs leadership in MARAD ASAP. I have known Stephen for years and support him,\" said Capt. Sadler in a brief statement acknowledging the change.\nFormer nominee Capt. Sadler is a Navy veteran who currently works as a researcher with the conservative Heritage Foundation. He is an engineer by training and a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, with multiple Indo-Pacific submarine tours on his resume.\nNew nominee Capt. Stephen Carmel is a graduate of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and a former senior vice president at Maersk Line Ltd. (MLL), one of the most prominent U.S.-flag carriers in the Maritime Security Program (MSP). He holds a master unlimited license, and he previously sailed for Military Sealift Command and Maritime Overseas Corporation, securing his first command at the young age of 26. He is also a certified accountant and holds an MA in Economics and an MBA in International Finance from Old Dominion University, according to his biography for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Board of Visitors. He has also served on the CNO Executive Panel, Marine Board at the National Academies, and the Naval Studies Board.\nCarmel's nomination received swift support from the Dredging Contractors of America. In a brief endorsement, DCA CEO William Doyle said that \"Steve knows maritime, he knows the American Flag, and he sailed commercially in the U.S. Merchant Marine.\"\nThe head of the Maritime Administration holds responsibility for the Ready Reserve fleet, the Maritime Security Program, the Tanker Security Program, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and a range of grant and R&D programs supporting commercial maritime. The next appointee will inherit an agency primed and ready for renewal: High turnover and high retirement eligibility have left MARAD with scores of vacant positions. As of last fall, the agency had openings for 12 percent of all authorized positions, according to GAO - before the reduction in force initiatives under the current administration began."

        "content": "\nThe Getting to Zero Coalition, a non-profit focusing on decarbonization of the maritime industry, released its first benchmarking as a tool to assess and document the collective actions of members. While saying its goal is to increase transparency, promote collective accountability, and inspire actions, it shows that the industry has just begun to address the challenges that lie ahead.\nFormed in 2019, the group today has over 200 members, including leaders across the industry, governments, and non-governmental agencies. It received 76 responses from companies and used that to formulate its benchmark. It believes some clear trends have already begun to emerge in the first year’s data and that the value of the benchmark expands over time.\n“A general picture emerges of a Coalition that is grappling with many of the same challenges faced by the wider sector,” they write in the conclusions to the report. They identified a total of 26 actions and measured progress in broad areas ranging from creating enabling conditions to incentives in areas from finance to policy and operations, efforts by first moves, transitional investments, and the deployment of zero-emission shipping.\nAmong the key challenges that they found are shared across the industry is a lack of clarity around the IMO’s forthcoming mid-term measures and how they will impact the business case for investments. It also points to uncertainty about the relative competitiveness of various fuel pathways and the challenges of connecting future supply and demand for zero-emission fuels and shipping services.\nThey found that members are “stepping up” by promoting enabling conditions. They highlighted efforts at target-setting, advocacy for strong decarbonization policies, and improving emissions' transparency. The report concludes that “members are embracing their roles as leaders in the sector.”\nIt, however, finds that “progress remains weak” in efforts such as green premium-based offerings and green shipping corridors. They note these efforts are designed to overcome policy and economic uncertainties by supporting strategic commitments and providing risk and cost-sharing. Yet, while companies are involved in these efforts, they find that activities “remain at an exploratory level, and more needs to be done to deliver on the promise of these first-mover efforts.”\nAmong the five broad categories, it finds the most progress with creating enabling conditions (58 percent) followed by incentives and market-making (42 percent). First move efforts, mostly limited to demonstration projects and infrastructure efforts, transitional investments, and deployment of zero-emission shipping, each score between 23 and 26 percent.\nIt ranks the strongest progress with elements such as reporting and transparency, as well as pilot projects. Efforts such as zero-emission refits and commercializing zero-emission shipping services gained the lowest scores, under 10 percent.\nIt calls for the industry to focus on long-term transition planning for 2035 and beyond and to leverage best practices through knowledge sharing. It also recommends exploring and participating in innovative commercial arrangements to spread the costs and risks of the transition.\nGovernments are encouraged to strengthen international regulations by adopting predictable and reliable measures. They also call for implementing national incentives and infrastructure investments and highlight the need to develop national hydrogen strategies.\nThe Getting to Zero Coalition released the 2025 reportonline. It highlights that a clearer picture will emerge as year-on-year data becomes available, but says it can be a key tool to shape policy and incentivize the industry and policymakers."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "Erik Kravets",
        "content": "\nIn a development Wärtsilä calls a breakthrough in decarbonization, the company has announced the commercial launch of its much-anticipated onboard carbon capture system. Wärtsilä reports successful trials at sea and at its plant in Norway, and says the ability to capture CO2 from ship exhaust systems will have a major impact on the industry’s efforts to reduce GHG emissions.\n\"CCS is a game-changer for the maritime industry, and we are already seeing huge interest in the market for this solution,\" said Håkan Agnevall, President and CEO of Wärtsilä.\nAccording to the company's tests, the new Wärtsilä system can reduce vessel CO2 emissions by up to 70 percent - providing shipowners with an immediate way to meet carbon regulations, without waiting for costlier and less readily available green fuels. Based on testing, Wärtsilä estimates that the total cost comes to about $54-76 per tonne of CO2, including capital and operating costs. Any carbon-based fuel can work, and it's straightforward for the crew to operate and maintain, says Wärtsilä President of Marine Solutions Roger Holm.\nWärtsilä has been developing this technology since 2019, but the commercial launch follows the retrofit of the first shipboard system onboard Solvang ASA’sClipper Eris(18,000 dwt). The system has been in operation since theClipper Erisset sail from Singapore in February 2025.\nWärtsilä is among the biggest suppliers of engineered solutions in the maritime industry, and Holm says that the company is becoming a strategic partner for shipowners rather than a vendor of individual systems. That is especially true as owners look for guidance on how to make the green transition.\n\"We have the broadest offering portfolio in the maritime industry. We can do green fuel engines, we can do carbon capture, and we can do other efficiency improvements, like voyage optimization. So thanks to that total picture, we can have a different discussion than if you only have one tool in the toolbox,\" Holm says. \"It's really rewarding to talk to our customers from this strategic angle, more than being just an equipment provider.\"\nCosts and regulatory requirements are critical to picking the best options for owners, Holm says. Each shipowner will use CO2-saving tools like CCS to meet their own objectives, and each use case is unique. \"This is what we discuss with every customer we meet. How do you decarbonize in a way that you also optimize the financial feasibility? How do you decarbonize at the right speed? This is a key discussion we have with every single customer,\" Holm says.\nSince decarbonization is a long road, it often starts by building ships today that can be upgraded later when the market conditions are right. Solvang ASA,Clipper Eris'owner, is working with Wärtsilä on making its next generation of ships ready for later installation of CCS. This includes CCS-ready scrubber systems for HFO operation, as well as space and utility requirements for an eventual upgrade."

        "content": "\nChina's gray-hull naval fleet has joined in the pattern of close-quarters encounters between Chinese and Philippine forces in the South China Sea. In years past, these run-ins were almost always carried out by China Coast Guard and Chinese maritime militia vessels, and the PLA Navy kept watch from a distance. In at least one recent encounter, however, Chinese warships got close enough to a Philippine Navy vessel to risk a collision, bringing a heightened risk of direct conflict.\nOn Monday, the Philippine corvette BRPEmilio Jacintowas operating with two other government vessels at a position about 12 nautical miles off of Scarborough Shoal, a contested reef within the Philippine EEZ that is occupied by China. It is a frequent flashpoint for confrontations between Chinese forces and Philippine interests, including fishermen from Luzon.\nAsJacintotransited the area, PLA Navy frigateLiuzhoucut across her bow at close range, and frigateTongliaoheld position less than a shiplength offJacinto'sport quarter. The maneuver occurred in open water, and appeared to be an act of interference or intimidation, according to the Armed Forces of the Philippines. No harm came to the ship or crew, andJacintocontinued on her mission.\n\n“These reckless actions not only posed a direct threat to the safety of navigation of [Jacinto], but also violated the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs),” the AFP said in a statement.\nChina claims the western Philippine EEZ as its own under its \"nine-dash line\" policy, a claim invalidated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2016. In a statement, PLA Southern Theater Command spokesman Senior Colonel Tian Junli said that PLA forces had \"forcefully and effectively stopped the incursion\" of Philippine ships in the Philippine EEZ, and he reiterated China's claim that Scarborough Shoal is Chinese territory."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The UK is moving forward with another round of sanctions against Russian entities and the shadow fleet in what Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the “largest ever sanctions.” The announcement came as the UK was meeting in Norway with colleagues in the 10-nation Joint Expeditionary Force to discuss security issues for Northern Europe.\n“The shadow fleet operation, masterminded by Putin’s cronies, is not just bankrolling the Kremlin’s illegal war in Ukraine - the fleet’s languishing vessels are known to be damaging critical national infrastructure through reckless seafaring in Europe,” the UK said reporting it has listed 100 additional tankers. The UK also listed one Russian-flagged offshore service vessel, which it said is benefiting from supporting the Russian government.\nThe UK now attests to having sanctioned more shadow fleet ships than any other country. In December 2024, it also imposed sanctions against 133 tankers. The EU has also moved aggressively with its sanctions and reported this week it isworkingon a new sanctions package including more than 100 tankers. When the new sanctions are enacted, the EU will have sanctioned more than 300 tankers.\nIn addition to the vessels, the UK listed five executives working in the Russian energy sector who it says are supporting and benefitting from the oil sales. It is also listing two energy companies, BX Energy and Nord Axis, and added Norwegian insurance company Romarine and Russian insurance company Soglasie to the sanctions list.\nThe UK describes the shadow fleet as “decrepit and dangerous,” saying it was also moving to protect Europe’s infrastructure. It cites the damage caused to undersea assets by the tankers while highlighting the efforts of the Joint Expeditionary Force to monitor key infrastructure. Member nations include Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK.\nIn January, the group activated a tracking system known as Nordic Warden developed by the UK. It is being used to monitor activity in a region that includes parts of the English Channel, the North Sea, Kattegat, and the Baltic. NATO also moved along with its member nations to increase monitoring in the Baltic after the incidents that damaged the undersea cables.\nThe UK highlights that the drop in oil prices is putting further pressure on the Russian economy as the costs of the war have increased.\nA new report from S&P Global, however, shows that more Russian oil is moving on tankers owned or operated within the G7 as the price of oil has fallen below the price cap. S&P Global Commodities at Sea and Maritime Intelligence Risk Suitedata showsthat almost 1.3 million barrels a day were being lifted by the ships from the G7 nations, the highest since March 2024. They are also reporting that G7-linked tankers are carrying more Russian oil from the Urals than non-G7 tankers, the first time this occurred since July 2023, according to S&P.\nThe EU is expected to move ahead with its next round of sanctions in June and is reported to be looking to coordinate it with a similar action by the United States. Donald Trump has threatened to increase sanctions on Russia if they cannot achieve progress with the ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine."

        "content": "\nWhile crew satisfaction has stabilized, the latest edition of the Seafarer Happiness Index highlights the strains from aging vessels, safe manning issues, and a lack of training among the key concerns of seafarers. The quarterly survey run by The Mission to Seafarers, in collaboration with Idwal and NorthStandard, and supported by Inmarsat, is marking its 10th year, with the organizers saying it offers essential insights into the experiences and concerns of seafarers and the areas that require improvement.\nThe Q1 report shows an overall rise in seafarer happiness to 6.98 out of 10, up from 6.91 in Q4 2024, with the organizers saying overall it revealed a steadying in seafarer satisfaction. Traditionally, issues related to welfare, food, connectivity, manning, and shore leave were among the elements consistently cited by seafarers. The organizers are saying that despite pressure points, many seafarers continue to find fulfillment in their work. They point to teamwork and camaraderie helping with the experience while saying seafarers enjoy the technical aspects of their roles.\nThe latest survey identifies safe manning as the most critical concern for seafarers. Respondents described how diminishing crew sizes combined with aging vessel infrastructure were adding to the pressures. The Mission to Seafarers says many respondents reported having to implement triage systems for maintenance tasks, addressing only the most urgent repairs while routine upkeep falls behind. This, of course, raises safety concerns for the crew and the vessels. Slap-dash repairs aboard the containershipDali, for example, have become a central issue in the investigation into the ship hitting and destroying Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge.\nTraining also emerged as a concern in Q1. While many seafarers acknowledged access to some development opportunities, others expressed a desire for training that feels “more grounded in reality.” The Mission to Seafarers says there is a desire for more consistent, practical, and scenario-based instruction that builds real confidence, not just theoretical knowledge, especially in high-stress or emergency situations.\n“Addressing challenges like aging vessels, inadequate training, and restricted shore leave is not just a matter of welfare – it’s essential for operational performance and future-proofing the sector,” said Ben Bailey, Director of Programme for The Mission to Seafarers. “These issues are clearly interlinked. Neglecting seafarers compromises the reliability of global maritime trade.”\nThe impact of the workload is reported to be creating stress and lowering the seafarers’ happiness. The Mission to Seafarers points to long hours, especially during port operations, and says respondents also cited excessive administration burdens and constant pressure from shoreside management as negatively affecting morale.\nThey also repeat a persistent concern over the limitations of shore leave. The Mission says it is a deeply felt frustration among seafarers. Other issues, including prolonged contracts and limited connectivity, also remain a concern as they increase the sense of isolation and disconnection for seafarers.\n“While it is positive to see strong teamwork, pride in the profession, and some improvements in connectivity, there continue to be key challenges that shouldn’t be ignored,” said Yves Vandenborn, Head of Loss Prevention Asia-Pacific, NorthStandard. He notes progress in some areas of concern while saying, “Persistent overwork, stagnant wages, and patchy welfare support continue to have a negative impact on morale.”\nBased on the results and long-term insights from 10 years of the survey, The Mission to Seafarers says the industry must act decisively. It is calling for investing in vessel upkeep, prioritizing targeted, hands-on training, and ensuring crews have access to rest, support, and connections ashore and at home."

        "content": "\nYemen's Houthi rebels may have agreed to a ceasefire with the United States, but it appears to be off to a less-than-friendly start. On Wednesday, a Houthi spokesman said that the group had attacked the carrier USSHarry S. Trumanon the day of the ceasefire announcement, causing the loss of a $60 million F/A-18 Super Hornet strike fighter.\n\"The naval and UAV forces of the [Houthi group] carried out a specific military operation targeting the U.S. aircraft carrierTrumanand a number of its warships in the northern Red Sea with a ballistic missile and several drones,\" said spokesman Yahya Saree in a statement. \"The operation resulted in  . . . the thwarting of an air attack the American enemy was preparing to carry out on against our country [and] the downing of an American F-18 due to the state of confusion and panic the enemy reached during the targeting operation.\"\nU.S. defense sources have confirmed thatTrumanlost an F/A-18 on Tuesday, the day of the ceasefire announcement. Anonymous sources close to the Pentagon told CNN and AP that the carrier's arresting gear failed, resulting in the loss of a plane during landing. Both pilots safely ejected and were rescued from the water.\nSaree's claims could not be immediately confirmed, and have sometimes proven inaccurate in the past. If true, however, it would be the second F/A-18 loss attributable to Houthi action. Last month, an F/A-18 fighter rolled over the side fromTruman'shangar deck elevator while the carrier was turning hard to avoid an incoming Houthi threat. The sudden maneuver was enough to send the unsecured aircraft overboard. One crewmember sustained slight injuries, but none were killed or pulled over the side in the incident.\nSeparately, Houthi leadership signaled Thursday that the group's attacks on Israeli targets will continue, and that the organization still considers the United States to be an adversary.\n\"The aggression against our people's interests proves that the Israeli and American enemies are enemies of our people in general,\" said top Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi in a statement Wednesday.\nRamifications for Israel\nThough it is a close U.S. ally, the Israeli government was not informed about the U.S.-Houthi ceasefire arrangement before the announcement, according to The Jerusalem Post. Israel is the Houthi movement's primary target, and the group has vowed to keep launching missiles and drones at Israeli territory; the White House's side deal with the Houthis has reportedly caused consternation for Israel's government.\n\"Israel will defend itself by itself,\" said Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. \"If others join us—our American friends—all the better. If they don’t, we will still defend ourselves on our own.\"\nThe agreement comes in the midst of U.S. bilateral negotiations with Iran, brokered by the Sultanate of Oman without Israeli participation. Iranian officials have quietly claimed responsibility for pushing the Houthis into a ceasefire in order to smooth the way for Tehran's nuclear-treaty negotiations with the White House. Iran is the group's primary sponsor.\n“President Trump’s decision to halt attacks against the Houthis effectively leaves Israel alone in the campaign against the Yemeni terrorist organization,” said Danny Citrinowicz, research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, speaking to Times of Israel. “It is a further indication and reminder that the administration is working to realize its interests even if these do not coincide with the interests of the Israeli government.”"

        "content": "\nA contract has been awarded for the front-end engineering and design of the first U.S. temporary storage and liquefaction processing terminals for captured CO2. Known as COAST20 (Carbon Ocean and Storage Transport 20), it is an ambitious project that would provide a solution for the transport and storage of carbon emissions captured from Florida’s industry and be the kickoff for an industry that is also emerging in Europe.\nThe project is being developed by Aptamus Carbon Solutions, a subsidiary of Overseas Shipholding Group, and has identified a 15-acre parcel with access to an existing deep-water berth in Port Tampa Bay for T-RICH (Tampa Regional Intermodal Carbon Hub) for the handling of the captured CO2.\nIt would be connected to a discharge and regassification terminal at LBC Tank Terminals, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Transport of the CO2 would employ a 20,000-ton liquified CO2 tank vessel, which will be the first to be built in the U.S. The design calls for the first liquefied CO2 articulated tug-barge to be built in the U.S.\nAptamus has entered into an agreement with Entr, the consultancy arm of Aker Solutions, to conduct the front-end engineering and design for the COAST 20 project’s terminals. The concept for the Tampa Bay terminal calls for two 50 percent capacity liquefaction trains with a total throughput of 2 million tons per year and 30,000 cbm of LCO2 storage. The CO2 would be delivered to the facility from pipelines, rail, or truck, and exit on the LCO2 barge. The company’s website says the potential future throughput of the plant is as much as 8 million metric tons per year.\n“We are excited to bring our pioneering expertise in designing and building CO 2 terminals, and other first-of-their-kind carbon removal projects around the globe, to Florida,” said Knut Egil Pedersen, Vice President of hydrogen and CO 2 at Aker Solutions.\nThe receiving terminal would be located on the Mississippi River near Baton Rouge, adjacent to an existing dedicated CO 2 pipeline system for delivery to permanent underground storage sites.\n“Florida is the third highest CO2 emitting state in the nation,” explains Aptamus President, Jeffrey Ross Williams. “Entr’s development of the Port Tampa Bay hub and the LBC Tank Terminals site on the Mississippi River offers the ideal solution for managing captured CO2 in Florida, and we are delighted to partner with them for this critical project. COAST20 will also allow power generation companies to meet the increasing demand for electricity in Florida while managing their carbon output.”\nCOAST20 was selected in 2024 for an award to be partially funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and includes the design of the Port Tampa Bay intermodal hub site to collect captured CO2 from emitters across the state of Florida. Port Tampa Bay and LBC are also partners in the Aptamus COAST20 project.\nThe project is based on the determination that the Tampa Bay region is home to a high concentration of power-generating facilities and large industrial CO2 emitters. They believe that there are major operations that will become stranded emitters that require a solution for handling CO2 emissions. COAST20 is presented as a cost-effective solution."

        "content": "\nA federal court has ruled that the U.S. Navy is liable for damages in connection with the Red Hill fuel leak at Pearl Harbor in 2021, which contaminated a military base water supply system and affected thousands of servicemembers and their families.\n17 plaintiffs who filed a civil suit over health effects from fuel-contaminated drinking water are owed compensation, U.S. District Judge Leslie Kobayashi ruled Wednesday. She ruled that the Navy was negligent in its operation of Red Hill, resulting in the release of 19,000 gallons of jet fuel into an access tunnel - where an unknown amount drained into a water supply well.\nThe damages per person are comparatively small, ranging from $3,000 to $75,000. Kobayashi ruled that the plaintiffs were not entitled to compensation for economic losses or spill-related expenses, and she denied most of the plaintiffs' claims for ongoing medical care.\n“While the damages awarded by the court are disappointing, this is a step forward in our clients’ pursuit of justice, and we continue to review options to resolve the remaining 7,500-plus cases,\" said plaintiffs' lawyer Just Well Law PLLC in a statement. \"The Court rejected the Government’s argument that thousands of our clients were just psychosomatic and that there was not enough fuel to make anyone sick.\"\nMultiple plaintiffs told Hawaii News Now that the dollar value of the judgement was too low and \"disheartening\" for victims. \"It feels like the government was not held accountable for anything,\" one plaintiff told HNN.\nThe judge's ruling will provide a benchmark for other class-action suits filed by thousands of affected people. It broadly aligns with the Department of Defense's own findings: last year, the Pentagon's inspector general concluded that the U.S. Navy didn't understand the spill risks involved in operating its Red Hill fuel tank site at Pearl Harbor, and it repeatedly failed to respond when a major spill finally occurred, missing multiple opportunities to prevent harm to personnel. Site operators didn't have an accurate map of the facility and its piping, hadn't conducted response drills, and hadn't included the drinking water well or the possibility of a pipeline spill in their formal spill response plan, the IG's investigators found."

        "content": "\nBerge Bulk has become the latest ship owner to begin to test an onboard carbon capture system. Interest continues to grow in the technology as a means of maintaining the economic life of in-service vessels as the new emissions regulations emerge, as well as a possible approach for newbuilds during the period of uncertainty and lack of supply for alternative fuels.\n“Carbon capture is a key pillar of our decarbonization strategy,” said James Marshall, CEO of Berge Bulk. “While we remain committed to optimizing fleet efficiency, installing decarbonization technology, and switching to new fuels, we must also capture carbon at the same time. We’ve been actively capturing carbon through nature-based solutions on shore for many years, now it’s time to also start capturing carbon on board.”\nThe pilot project is taking place aboard the company’s 63,000 dwt Ultramax bulker,Berge Yotei. Delivered in 2020 and in the Isle of Man registry, the ship was built at the Imabari Shipyard in Japan.\nThe system being used in the pilot was developed by Value Maritime and integrates carbon capture into an exhaust gas cleaning system known as the Filtree System. It is designed to capture up to 15 tonnes of CO2 per day, representing a potential 30 percent reduction in emissions during operations.\nUnlike conventional scrubbers, the Filtree System removes both sulfur oxides and CO? from a vessel’s exhaust. CO? is absorbed into a reusable amine solution, which can be offloaded in port for regeneration or reuse. Potential applications include use in greenhouses, beverage production, and other industrial processes.\n\n\nCarbon capture system was integrated with the scrubber and easily installed on the vessel's funnel (Berge Bulk)\n\nBerge notes that while regulatory frameworks such as MARPOL and the EU ETS are still evolving, it is already contributing practical insights into how onboard carbon capture systems can be implemented, monitored, and scaled. The company, which owns, operates, and manages a fleet of over 100 vessels with a carrying capacity of more than 15 million dwt, emphasizes the need for collaboration across governments, ports, technology providers, and regulators to develop the infrastructure, protocols, and commercial models needed to support carbon capture at scale.\nValue Maritime was established in 2017 and began installing its system in 2021. It has recently completed installations on other large vessels. Eastern Pacific’s chemical tankerPacific Cobalt(49,886 dwt) installed the system in 2023. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines also recently installed the system on its tankerNexus Victoria(75,000 dwt).\nAfter some initial skepticism due to the need for storage and offloading CO2, the technology is gaining interest in the maritime sector expanding on the shore applications are large emitters. Wärtsilä just announced the commercial launch of its onboard carbon capture system calling it a breakthrough in decarbonization for in-service and new build vessels."

        "content": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control rolled out a further wave of sanctions again targeting Iran’s exports of crude oil and products to China, which remains the country’s largest buyer. In addition to sanctioning a third, independent Chinese oil refinery and six more tankers, the U.S. for the first time targeted terminal operators in China’s Shandong Province and two tanker captains it linked to the shadow fleet.\nIn February, Donald Trump launched his “maximum pressure” campaign and has repeatedly made threats to drive Iran’s oil exports to zero. Last week, Trump expanded the threats, writing on social media that the U.S. would impose secondary sanctions on buyers and would prevent the companies supporting Iran’s oil trade from doing business in the United States.\nIran has reiterated that it would continue the exports and grow its oil business. This was supported by data from commodity analytics firms Kpler and Vortexa that show Iran is currently exporting as much as 1.5 million barrels of crude oil per day.\nToday’s action targeted the third so-called “teapot” oil refinery just seven weeks after the administration sanctioned the first of these Chinese operators. These independent refineries are reported to purchase the majority of Iran’s oil exports. The U.S. is now listing the Hebei Xinhai Chemical Group, reporting that it has received multiple shipments and linking it to sanctioned tankersUrgane IandHornet, which the U.S. says made deliverers of Iranian oil to the refinery.\nTreasury is also targeting three firms for operating a port terminal at Dongying Port, China, which has received several shipments of Iranian oil from shadow fleet vessels since 2024. It cites the facility for receiving more than one million barrels of Iranian oil from shadow tankers, including the previously sanctionedCorona Fun,Viola,Seasky, andCH Billion. It is the first time the U.S. has listed terminal operators in the province.\nSix additional tankers,Star Twinkle 6,Lamd,Skadi,Big Mag,Impalas, andThane, were also added to the list. Four of the tankers are reported to be registered in Panama, and one each in São Tomé and Príncipe and San Marino. The U.S. cites examples of shipments as well as illegal ship-to-ship transfers, often to other sanctioned vessels.\nOFAC also designated two Indian nationals who it reports are working as the captain of sanctioned vessels. They allege that Lincoln Francisco Viegas has served since 2022 as master of two tankers transporting Iranian oil. Ketan Agarwal, the U.S. says, has served since 2017 as master of several vessels transporting Iranian oil.\nReuters is reporting today that the U.S.’s two prior efforts to sanction the Chinese “teapot” refineries are having an impact on the operations. The report says that sources told them the refineries are having problems receiving shipments and selling products. Trump has vowed to continue to increase the pressure until Iran agrees to a deal in the current nuclear talks and stops supporting its proxies across the Middle East."

        "content": "\nThis week, after major container ports on the West Coast reported less ship traffic due to falling imports, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters that a drop in boxship volume is a win for the American economy.\n\"That means we lose less money . . . when you say it slowed down, that's a good thing, not a bad thing,\" Trump said in response to a reporter's questions at a press conference Thursday.\nAfter the imposition of 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods last month, buying activity for goods for export from China to the U.S. plummeted, followed by a sharp drop in container bookings. \"Carriers reacted to the drop in exports out of China in the immediate aftermath of reciprocal tariff announcements by the US Government at the start of April by increasing blanked sailings,\" explained Xeneta's Peter Sand in a recent customer note.\nThe number of ships departing China for the U.S. West Coast has dropped sharply: the Port of Long Beach reports 30 blanked sailings in May and June, and the Port of Long Beach reports another 30. Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero confirmed to local NBC LA that volume is already down, and said that traffic hasn't been this slow since the pandemic.\nThe number of vessels isn't the full picture. Based on AIS, the boxships that are under way from China to the U.S. this week are riding an average of about two feet higher in the water than normal, says Flexport CEO Ryan Peterson - indicating that they are carrying less cargo.\nThe slowdown may not last long. The U.S. and China have begun much-anticipated negotiations on a new trade agreement, and this will eventually result in lower tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump confirmed Thursday. \"Right now you can’t get any higher. It’s at 145 percent so we know it’s coming down,\" Trump told Bloomberg TV."

The companies are saying they aim to “usher in a new era of human-machine collaboration,” which will enhance productivity and safety.\n“Unlike conventional robots that focus solely on repetitive tasks, these robots must be able to observe, reason, and make decisions,” said HD Hyundai Robotics Vice President Young-hoon Song. He explained that the goal is to have robots that will perform complex welding tasks in the shipyard environment.\nHyundai is partnering with newly-launched, Houston-based Persona AI, a start-up focusing on embodied artificial intelligence, and Vazil, a five-year-old South Korean company focused on robotics integration and manufacturing. The companies will work together to develop the prototypes by the end of 2026. They expect field testing and commercial development to begin in 2027.\nPersona AI, earlier this year, raised more than $10 million in pre-seed funding, according to InnovationMap. Two of its founders, Nicolaus Radford and Jide Akinyode, InnovationMap reports helped develop a NASA humanoid robot, and both are former employees of Nauticus Robotics, a provider of autonomous subsea robots. On its website, Persona AI highlights the potential for humanoid robots to provide scalable labor for tough jobs ranging from welding to assembly, fabrication, building, and mining.\nDevelopment of humanoid hardware and AI-based control and learning algorithms for the welding robots will be led by Persona AI. Vazil Company will develop the welding tools and build the industrial testing environment.\nHyundai has been working to develop the shipyard of the future, which it believes will incorporate automation and other key technologies. Its HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering company will support the deployment of the system, providing live shipyard settings and field engineering data. HD Hyundai Robotics will contribute welding-path AI training data and performance validation.\n\"Welding humanoids will not only boost productivity but also significantly reduce the burden on workers and greatly enhance safety,” said HD KSOE Senior Vice President Dong-ju Lee. “By developing robots optimized for shipyard tasks, we aim to set a new paradigm in shipbuilding automation. Our goal is a smart shipyard where humans and intelligent robots collaborate seamlessly.\"\nShipyards and other applications have been using welding bots to perform repetitive tasks on assembly lines. Vazil Company CTO Sungwon Kim highlights that they envision an application that will elevate shipyard automation to the next level. The goal is to enhance productivity and improve workplace safety in shipyards."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nMaersk, the largest publicly-traded container carrier and logistics company, cited the “increasingly volatile environment,” telling investors that it expects volume growth in the global container market will slow and possibly even be negative in 2025. The carrier reported, however, a strong start for the first quarter of 2025, which it expects to carry into the second quarter as customers build inventories before the full effect of the tariff war overtakes the market.\n“With trade tensions flaring up and uncertainty on the rise, global supply chains are once again in the spotlight,” said CEO Vincent Clerc. He believes Maersk is well-positioned because of its integrated shipping and logistics offering, which could help customers make the best business decisions in the face of current uncertainties.\nFirst quarter container volumes the company reported were stable versus a year ago, while it benefited from higher freight rates in Q1 2025. Profits for its ocean segment soared to $1.9 billion this quarter versus just under $1 billion a year ago. Costs have stabilized after last year when diversions around South Africa began due to the security issues in the Red Sea. Maersk said today it expects the disruption in the Red Sea will continue through the rest of the year.\nDespite the looming tariffs and volatility, Maersk said it expects market growth in the second quarter. While admitting that volumes on routes from China to the U.S. plunged 30 to 40 percent in April, Maersk said it believes customers are building inventories, which supported the second quarter, while pointing to uncertainty and the risk of contractions in the second half of the year if the tariffs are not rolled back.\nMaersk’s remarks came as Donald Trump heralded the U.S.’s first trade deal, which came from long-time ally the United Kingdom. Trump, however, told reporters that he recognized the tariffs on China would be lowered while still predicting a trade deal would be reached.\nDue to the unpredictability, Maersk, however, revised its outlook for the global container market saying growth would be lower than the previous four percent prediction. Its revised estimate set the low end of the range at a one percent contraction, “given the increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.”\nMaersk said the sequential declines it reported today were expected while it called Q1 “solid results.” Clerc told investors the company would be “doubling down on the work underway on automation and cost management to remain fit for what lies ahead.”\nDespite the increased uncertainty leading to a more cautious container volume growth outlook, Maersk reconfirmed its full-year guidance provided in February. It is still projecting earnings (EBITDA) of $6 to $9 billion but said its free cashflow would be negative by at least $3 billion.\nNear-term, Maersk said it was able to reallocate some capacity to other markets, which it said still had strong demand. Clerc said so far the trade war has mostly impacted the flow between China and the U.S. telling CNBC it has “not yet contaminated any of the other trade lanes.”\nClerc told Reuters that they were confident the supply chain would stabilize. He said “the dream of producing locally” for all the needs is not possible. While the trade war casts a shadow over the U.S. economy, he called the current tariffs prohibitive, predicting volatility ahead before the market stabilize."

        "content": "\nReports in Indian media suggest that on May 8, the Indian Navy may have launched an attack on Karachi's naval port as part of a broader retaliatory strike operation. The Indian and Pakistani governments have not confirmed the reports, and multiple Pakistani social media accounts deny that an attack occurred.\nThe possible naval strike follows Indian attacks on nine sites in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir early on May 7 - a response to the terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir on April 22, in which 26 tourists were killed. The conflict has seen a gradual widening of cross-border aerial attacks by both sides in recent days, with heavy use of drones and stand-off missiles.\nBriefing the media on the May 7 attacks across the Line of Control (the de facto boundary dividing Pakistani and Indian controlled Kashmir), Indian spokeswoman Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said that Operation Sindoor had been focused on hitting infrastructure associated with the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba organizations, which India believes were responsible for mounting the terrorist attacks.\nShe said that India had designed Operation Sindoor to be ‘focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted’. The attacks were also designed to deter further terrorist attacks, which India believes were imminent.\nFollowing the initial Indian attacks, which were launched with stand-off weapons from aircraft that did not cross into Pakistani airspace, there were heavy small arms and artillery exchanges across the Line of Control between Indian and Pakistani-controlled areas of Kashmir. These clashes had killed an additional 19 Indian civilians by the close of May 7.\nPakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed decisive retaliation. Pakistani sources reported that in the attacks over the land border, five Indian aircraft had been shot down and an Indian brigade headquarters shelled; eight civilians had been killed in the Indian attacks. The Pakistani reporting gave no indication that clashes had spread from the Kashmir area, but described an attack on May 6 in central Pakistan by the Baloch Liberation Army that killed seven soldiers as being carried out by ‘Indian proxies’.\nAt sea, Indian P-8I Neptune aircraft from Indian Naval Air Squadron 316 based at Hansa in Goa have in recent days been covering Pakistani naval live firing exercises southwest of Karachi. Early on, the Indian Navy is likely to have deployed a forward submarine screen covering approaches to Karachi, using carrier-launched aircraft from INSVikrant(R11) and INSVikramaditya(R33) to restrict Pakistani maritime surveillance efforts.\nThe main Indian naval bases on the west coast at Mumbai and Karwar are empty of ships, as seen in satellite imagery on May 6. The Pakistani Navy is likely to have deployed from its main bases in Karachi, Omarah and Gwadar, but ships are likely to be keeping sufficiently close to land so as to remain under Pakistani air cover.\nIndian officials told network NDTV that the Indian Navy \"conducted targeted operations in the Arabian Sea against Pakistan,\" but without specifying a strike on the naval base in Karachi. NASA'sFIRMSsatellite fire detection platform shows no recent heat signatures in Karachi's harbor area."

Italian officials confirmed the incident without providing further details.\nLocal media are reporting that a 39-year-old salvage diver, a Dutch national, died as teams were continuing the preparation to lift the 184-foot yacht, which is resting on the seabed off Porticello, Italy. They reported the diver was working underwater at the time of his death without providing further details.\nA specialized team was assembled for the complex task of raising the vessel, which is lying at a depth of 50 meters (approximately 164 feet). The effort is being supervised by the UK’s TMC Marine and involves Dutch companies Hebo and SMIT Salvage as well as Italian specialists. Reports are saying about 70 specialists are now on site for the operation, which is expected to take several weeks.\nWork began this week with a new underwater survey to determine the position of the yacht and its condition after the winter. It departed Italy on August 14 with a premier guest list headed by tech tycoon Mike Lynch. The vessel went down five days later while anchored offshore, killing Lynch, his teenage daughter, the chairman of Morgan Stanley International, Lynch’s U.S. lawyer, and others. Seven of the 22 people aboard died, while 15 were able to make it into a lifeboat and survived.\nOfficials hope that raising the yacht will help to answer the questions surrounding why the vessel went down. They know a strong storm hit the vessel, but believe it should not have been in danger of foundering even in those conditions.\nThe salvage team reports the vessel is in good condition, and their plan calls for removing the rigging from the 236-foot mast. They will store the removed pieces on the seabed for recovery after the hull. A steel sling will need to be placed to hold the hull in place and for the eventual lift.\nThe Italian Coast Guard has been on the scene, and reports indicate the salvage operation will now be delayed while an investigation is launched into the diver’s death."

The organization, which marked 20 years, is expressing concern and warning of the possibility of further incidents.\nWhile there has been a total of 50 incidents reported to ReCAAP since the start of 2025, they are highlighting that there were three incidents in close proximity in one hour and 15 minutes on May 7 and two other incidents in just three and a half hours on May 2. All the incidents were aboard vessels underway in the eastbound lane of the Singapore Strait near the western area near the Phillip Channel. Most of the incidents reported in 2025 have been in this same area.\nMost of the incidents are robberies where the perpetrators attempt not to interact with the crew or flee when they are spotted. ReCAAP, however, has warned that more of them are being seen with guns or knives, including two people who appeared to have guns when they were spotted among a group of five boarders on a Greek-owned bulker, Virgo, on May 7. The two boarders seen on the Wisdom Ocean bulk carrier Hui Shun No. 1 on May 7 had knives.\nThe incidents vary between a single person aboard the MOL Singapore chemical tanker Elm Galaxy to five people on the UAE-managed product tanker S M A on May 2. Both the S M A and the Galaxy reported engine spare parts were stolen, while the other vessels did not report anything missing. None of the crew were injured in any of the latest incidents.\nReCAAP notes its concern stems from the dramatic increase. This year it has received 50 reports compared with 14 incidents between January 1 and May 7, 2024.\nAs it is only a monitoring and coordination initiative designed to educate everyone, ReCAAP can only issue alerts. It is, however, again urging the littoral states to increase patrols and surveillance in the region. They said it is critical to respond promptly to reports from the vessels and to strengthen coordination and promote information sharing.\nFor ships transiting the area, ReCAAP advised intensifying vigilance and maintaining lookouts while in these waters. The greatest concern is in the hours of darkness.\nThe area between the Singapore and Malacca straits has become a hotbed for piracy and robberies. Across the whole of the Southeast Asia region monitored by ReCAAP, it lists only 58 incidents so far in 2025, with 50 in the area around Singapore."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Worn-out mooring lines that were not replaced on time are being called the reason a US-flagged cargo RoRo broke free from its dock and out-of-control hit a pier and dry dock at the Port of Bremerhaven in Germany. Germany's Federal Bureau of Maritime Casualty Investigation (BSU) issued a report concluding that if the lines had been properly maintained, the incident might never have happened.\nBSU analyzes the incident involving the RoRo cargo shipEndurance(49,000 dwt) built in 1996 and operated by ARC (American Roll-on Roll-Off Carriers). The incident occurred on March 13, 2021, when the vessel’s mooring lines broke, causing her to drift through the harbor and collide with a dry dock, among other things.\nInvestigators have now determined that the main cause of the line breakage was the worn mooring lines that were not replaced in good time due to an inadequate safety management system. Owing to the conditions of the mooring lines, coupled with offshore winds with gusts reaching speeds of up to 50 knots, the accident was most likely to happen despite preventive efforts by the ship’s master.\nThe Endurance was moored starboard side in Bremerhaven when the lines parted at about 0945. Investigators were able to establish that the master was aware of the weather forecast and conscious of the potential danger of mooring line failure. For this reason, he had taken appropriate precautionary measures against line failure by requesting tugs.\nNineteen minutes before the incident at 0924, the master had gone to the bridge because of the prevailing wind conditions at the berth. At 0930, he requested tug assistance and instructed two of his deck officers to inspect the lines. When the lines failed, he issued instructions to drop the starboard anchor, start the main engine, and raise the lowered vehicle ramp.\nBefore the arrival of the tugs, the 868-foot (264.6-meter)Endurancehad drifted toward the Lloyd Werft dockyard. The first two tugs arrived about eight minutes after the line failures and before the main engine was running, but could not prevent the allision. It was determined that the vessel was only about 120 meters (less than 400 feet), meaning the tugs did not have enough time and space to prevent the contact.\nThe line failure contributed to the material damage to the ship, the berth, and the dockyard. However, nobody was injured, and no pollution was reported. The damage on the ship included a crack above the waterline in the shell plating on the port side, a hole in the bulbous bow, and a dent and paint abrasions at the stern on the starboard side.\nBSU concluded in its investigation that the mooring lines were in poor condition. The vessel’s operator, ARC, had also arrived at the same conclusion in its internal investigation, determining that the condition of the lines may not have been consistent with requirements. The lines were damaged to such an extent that only two of the 14 lines met the requirements for mooring lines.\nFollowing the BSU investigation, actions have been taken to prevent similar occurrences. They include the procurement of berth analysis software by the Port of Bremerhaven. Expected to be deployed this year, the software is designed to trigger alerts that would help the port inspect a vessel's mooring arrangement.\nThe report also highlights that as of January 1, 2024, new internationally binding guidelines for the inspection and maintenance of mooring equipment, including lines, came into force. In particular, the vessel operator is now required to introduce a procedure for mooring operations, as well as the inspection and maintenance of mooring equipment, including mooring lines. A maintenance procedure must be implemented on ships so that worn lines are identified in good time before they fail. Maintenance must be carried out and documented on board."

The South China Morning Post reported the development saying that the captain of the containershipNewnew Polar Bearwas taken into custody in Hong Kong after appearing in court.\nThe 43-year-old Chinese captain of the containership, Wan Wenguo, appeared in a Hong Kong court on May 8, on one criminal charge for causing damage to the Balticconnector, a natural gas pipeline running between Estonia and Finland, and damage to a communication cable. The South China Morning Post listed the charges as “a breach of navigation safety protocols by failing to ensure the ship had enough anchors.” The captain also faces two charges of not making daily reports to the vessel’s owner.\nNews of the charges appeared to come as a surprise to the authorities in Finland and Estonia, which are conducting a joint investigation. Last month, the Finnish newspapers reported that the investigators had requested information from China and were still waiting for a response. Over the two years, there have been several reports that China was hindering the investigation, and while acknowledging the vessel had damaged the undersea infrastructure blamed the damage on bad weather.\nFinland’s National Bureau of Investigation issued a statement today saying its investigation with Estonia was ongoing. It noted cooperation with Chinese authorities while saying details about the developments would have to come from the authorities in China and Hong Kong. They acknowledged several meetings and exchanges of information with the authorities in China and Hong Kong.\nWan is a Chinese national, but the ship at the time was registered in Hong Kong. It was operating for a Chinese shipping company that highlighted the opening of the container route between China and St. Petersburg, Russia, using the Northern Sea Route through the Arctic.\nThe vessel was in the Gulf of Finland, starting a return trip to China, when on October 8, the gas and telecom lines were damaged. The Finnish authorities later recovered a broken anchor and reported a drag trail on the seabed. It was the first of the incidents that led to allegations of deliberate sabotage efforts in the Baltic.\nThe South China Morning Post reports the captain is being held pre-trial. The next hearing was scheduled for July, it reports, allowing time for further investigations."

        "content": "\nU.S. retailers and the logistics tracking services for shippers are sounding the alarm on the expected dramatic declines coming for import containers as the Trump tariffs go into effect. The National Retail Federation (NRF) released data predicting the first year-over-year decline in imports in 19 months, noting the tariff uncertainties were coming at an important time of the year in the buying cycle. Data software company Descartes says the data suggests sourcing patterns, tariffs, and trade risks are continuing to evolve.\nDescartes released data from its global trade software yet again highlighting that importers have been rushing to get goods into the United States ahead of the imposition of the tariffs. It reports that container imports were up 1.2 percent over March and better than 9 percent year-over-year, surpassing 2.4 million TEU. Descartes notes it was one of the strongest Aprils on record.\nThe data highlights the efforts to frontload shipments, especially from Asia where Descartes says imports from China were up 5.4 percent from March to April. They note that Chinese-sourced commodities included furniture, plastics, and machinery, all of which were targeted with the tariffs. Dramatic year-over-year gains emerged from countries such as Vietnam (32.5 percent) and Thailand (13.4 percent).\nDescartes believes it was having a direct impact on ports as well with it forecasting strong gains in volumes at Los Angeles (13.9 percent) and Long Beach (12 percent). It, however, notes volumes incoming at Savannah and Charleston were down as shippers focused on the faster trans-Pacific routes.\n“While container import growth remained strong in April, it may be, in part, because U.S. importers are continuing to pull shipments forward ahead of new U.S. tariffs, in particular the 145% tariff on Chinese goods implemented on April 9,” said Jackson Wood, Director, Industry Strategy at Descartes. “Since the new elevated tariffs do not apply to goods already in transit when the tariffs were implemented, the tariff impact may be reflected more significantly in May container import volumes.”\nIt believes this has been a factor in the 8.6 percent increase for U.S. imports in the first four months of 2025. Descartes highlights that China accounted for 33.4 percent of total U.S. inbound container volume in April.\n“We are starting to see the true impact of the tariffs on the supply chain,” predicts NRF Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold. He notes the tariffs “come at the most important time in the buying process” for retailers. Many retailers are pausing or canceling orders as a result, and small retailers, in particular, “are concerned about what to expect in the coming months and how to order for the future.”\nThe retailer’s trade association is forecasting a dramatic decline in imports starting in May down to 1.81 million TEU. The NRF predicts volumes will plateau during the summer between 1.7 and 1.8 million TEU per month, a decline of greater than 20 percent per month versus 2024 levels.\nThe NRF notes that imports have been elevated since last summer, first as retailers brought in cargo ahead of an October strike at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, and then in anticipation of an escalation of tariffs after the November elections."

        "content": "The ongoing changes to Carnival Corporation’s Italian cruise brand Costa Cruises are continuing as the line announced it will be transitioning its oldest cruise ship to new owners in 2026. The line has been significantly downsized since the 2020 pause in operations and the return to service after the pandemic.\nCosta announced that theCosta Fortuna(102,669 gross tons) will be transferred to a new owner in mid-September 2026. The identity of the new firm was not revealed. The ship is currently operating in the Mediterranean with cruises to Greece and Turkey, and for the winter of 2025/2026 is scheduled to be homeported in the Canary Islands.\nTheCosta Fortunawas built by Fincantieri and delivered in 2003. It is based on Carnival Cruise Line’s Destiny platform. It is 892 feet (272 meters) in length with maximum passenger accommodations of approximately 3,500 people. TheCosta Fortunawas among the first mega cruise ships for the brand and in Europe.\nWith the departure of the ship in 2026, Costa will have shed six ships from its fleet. Two of the brand’s newest ships,Costa VeneziaandCosta Firenza, were transferred to Carnival Cruise Line to launch a sub-brand Costa by Carnival, which is marketed as “Fun Italian Style.” The ships are operated by Carnival in the American market, while the brand also took over the olderCosta Luminosa. The ship, rechristenedCarnival Luminosa, is deployed between Australia and Alaska.\nCosta also sold its ship theCosta Victoriafor scrap early in the pandemic and sold theCosta Romanticato Celestyal Cruises, which later sold it for scrap. It also never reactivated the sister ship to theCosta Fortuna, theCosta Magica. The ship was sold to Seajets, who planned to relaunch it as theGoddess of the Nightfor Greek Island cruises marketed by a new brand Neonyx Cruises. After a disastrous report about the condition of the ship, the 2024 launch was scrubbed with the company promising to start cruises in 2025. So far, nothing has been announced for those cruises.\nOne of the pioneers in cruising, Costa claims a 77-year heritage dating back to when it was started by the Costa family to provide immigrant service to South America. In the 1950s, the company started cruising. Acquired by Carnival Corp., it was cited for its fast growth and success in the broad market for Europeans. However, Carnival Corp. has said it would be focusing on the brands with the strongest financial returns and began downsizing Costa. The brand has been rumored for possible newbuilds, but nothing has been announced.\nCosta highlights that it is following a strategic path, including investing more than €200 million in the last five years modernizing and upgrading its ships. With the sale of theCosta Fortuna, the company will have eight cruise ships, including two of the LNG-fueled cruise ships delivered in 2019 and 2021.\nThe fleet improvements will be completed in November when the company’s second-oldest cruise ship,Costa Serena(114,500 gross tons) finishes an extensive dry dock refurbishment. Costa reports they are adding a new food court with innovative restaurants and bars, updating the design for the main restaurants, redesigned pools and bars, and completely renovating suites.\nTheCosta Serenahas been deployed in Asia and was the company’s ship for China before the pandemic. In October 2026, she will depart Tokyo bound for Buenos Aires to replace the Costa Fortuna. The Costa Serena will cruise in South America in the winter of 2027 before redeploying to the Mediterranean for the summer of 2027."

        "content": "\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy announced the formation of a public-private partnership and funding for an effort to build the world’s largest liquid hydrogen carrier. The government views it as a key opportunity where South Korea’s shipbuilders can develop a leadership position building on its current strategy of focusing on high-value ships.\n“Liquefied hydrogen carriers are an area with high technical difficulty and very high initial technology development risk, so it is important for the government to play a leading role in securing a new source for Korean-shipbuilding,” said an official from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announcing the new project. “We will actively support the early acquisition of large-scale liquefied hydrogen carrier technology by organizing related laws and systems so that the technology we have developed can become a global standard.”\nThe government announced $39.5 million in funding in 2025 to launch the partnership which will involve the country’s three major shipbuilders (Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hanwha Ocean, and Samsung Heavy Industries) as well as experts from the ministry, universities, and research institutes.\nIt mapped out an ambitious schedule calling for the construction of a 2,000 cbm demonstration ship by 2027. It said the technology for a large ship would be completed by 2030 and the development of a 40,000 cbm vessel by 2032. They are calling for the commercialization of a large, 160,000 cbm vessel by 2040.\n\n\nKorea looks to build a competitive advantage to support commercial hydrogen vessels by the 2040s (MOTIE)\n\nTo complete the ships, they called for cooling technology for the hold saying it will require -253 degrees C, ultra-low temperature storage tank technology versus the -163 degrees C required for LNG. They envision a vacuum insulation system. For the propulsion, they are proposing using hydrogen evaporation gas generated in the cargo hold combined with a fuel cell, hybrid engines using an energy storage system.\nDuring the presentation, they recognized that liquified hydrogen carriers are highly difficult ships with no commercial examples having yet been developed. They highlighted 43 research and development projects currently underway involving 101 organizations, saying their goal is to unique the efforts into a single project.\nThe new task force will use the best domestic liquified hydrogen experts with the support of the Ministry.\nThey noted that the only hydrogen carrier that has been built is a small-scale demonstration vessel built in Japan. It has a 1,250 cubic meter tank. It too was built under a government-sponsored research program.\nThe designs for the Korean demonstration vessel call for a ship that will be 304 feet (92.8 meters) in length. It will have a capacity of 140 tons (2,300 cbm), making it the world’s largest and a key step in the development of this critical new market.\n"

        "content": "Canada is maintaining its tradition of honoring the heroism of sailors who took part in the Battle of the Atlantic and ended up paying the ultimate price. On May 4, the country commemorated the 80th anniversary of the battle that was the longest continuous military campaign during World War II and which claimed the lives of 4,600 Canadians.\nCanada has designated the first Sunday in May as the day navy families gather to commemorate the battle, not only to honor the struggle, sacrifice, and loss but also to celebrate the courage of its sailors in the face of daunting obstacles. This year, events were held across the country in order to keep the memories alive.\nThe Battle of the Atlantic, which lasted from the outbreak of hostilities in September 1939 until victory in May 1945, is credited with transforming the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) from a tiny, ill-equipped, and under-trained force into one of the largest navies. At the outbreak of the war, the RCN comprised only six destroyers, a handful of smaller vessels, and 3,500 sailors. By the time the conflict was ending, RCN had grown to over 373 fighting ships and almost 100,000 sailors.\n\n\n\nThe battle remains an important aspect of WWII. With continental Europe under Nazi Germany’s control, the United Kingdom stood alone against the Nazi threat. To sustain Britain’s war effort, supplies of food and war materials from the rest of the world had to be shipped there. The Nazi used all-out submarine warfare to try to cut Britain off and starve the island nation into submission, making no distinction between military warships and civilian merchant vessels.\nIn response, convoys were formed, with warships (escorts) protecting the merchant ships carrying the supplies. Canada was at the forefront in providing its warships to offer escort services. Over the course of the war, Canada alongside other allied naval and air forces fought more than 100 convoy battles and performed as many as 1,000 single ship actions against submarines and warships of the German and Italian navies. The RCN destroyed or shared in the destruction of 33 U-boats and 42 enemy surface craft.\nRCN suffered significant casualties. The country lost over 60 ships while over 2,100 sailors, 1,700 merchant mariners, and more than 900 aviators lost their lives. The battle also reached Canadian waters with 23 ships sunk in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the St. Lawrence River.\n“As we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic, we honor the bravery of the Canadians who served with unwavering resolve and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice. The Battle of the Atlantic left a lasting imprint on Canada’s national story and the identity of the RCN,” said Vice-Admiral Angus Topshee, RCN Commander.\nOn the 80th anniversary, Topshee recalled the bravery and inspiring action of the sailors of HMCSEsquimalt, the last Canadian ship sunk in the war on April 16, 1945. The sinking, coming just three weeks before the end of the war, remains a painful memory as 44 sailors, more than half of the crew, died within sight of their home port of Halifax.\nThis year’s ceremonies were more poignant as the number of living World War II veterans continues to decline.\nCanada's Veterans organization compiled a detailed history of the Battle of the Atlantic presentedonline."

        "content": "Offshore wind energy continues to be a key portion of the UK’s plan for renewable energy with the government announcing on May 9 that it will expand funding and the available areas in response to strong demand from the industry. The UK continues to be the leader in Europe and the second largest globally with nearly 15 GW currently installed, while the government has set a target to reach 50 GW by 2030.\nThis week, the plan appeared to be in jeopardy when Danish developer Ørsted said it had decided to shelve plans for the fourth phase of the Hornsea project. Located 75 miles off the east coast of England, the first phase of the project started generation in 2020 with 1.2 GW of capacity, followed by phase 2 in 1.4 GW in 2022. Construction is underway on Hornsea 3, which will add 2.9 GW, while the now-shelved fourth phase was to provide an additional 2.4 GW. Ørsted cited the continued increase of supply chain costs, higher interest rates, and an increase in the risk to construction and operation on the planned timeline.\nSecretary Ed Miliband, heading the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, countered today asserting that the government continues to receive strong interest for the development of offshore wind energy projects. He said hundreds of bids have been received in the latest government scheme, a “strong signal that industry supports the government’s clean power by 2030 mission.”\nFollowing higher than expected demand, the Energy Secretary said the government was going to increase funding in its Clean Industry Bonus program from the planned £200 million ($266 million) to £544 million ($724 million). The award winners will be announced shortly.\nThe Clean Industry Bonus program will provide financial rewards for offshore wind developers that prioritize investments in regions that most need clean energy. The government points to the opportunities to aid traditional oil and gas communities, ex-industrial areas, ports, and coastal towns. According to the government, the program will support cleaner manufacturers, new upgraded factories, port infrastructure, and more business for UK supply chains. This and other government support efforts are projected to spur up to £9.3 billion ($12 billion) in private sector investment over the next four years.\n“Now is the time to go further and faster to capture this unrivalled opportunity for green industrial growth,” said Claire Mack, Chief Executive at Scottish Renewables.\nLast month, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced they were accelerating £300 million ($400 million) in investment through another scheme, Great Britain Energy, to support the growth of the offshore energy sector. Since taking office in 2024, Starmer’s government has also increased the pricing subsidy and taken other steps to support the development of wind and other renewable energy sources.\nAt the same time, on Friday, The Crown Estate, which is responsible for the management of Britain’s seabed rights, announced it was also taking steps to expand offshore wind energy. It approved the Capacity Increase Program, which will maximize existing offshore wind lease areas for seven current wind farms. By amending the seabed rights, The Crown Estate estimates an additional 4.7 GW of energy could be generated.\nThe Crown Estate highlights that the projects were awarded rights in the Round 3 leasing that took place in 2010 or the 2017 Wind Extension program. All seven of the projects have existing grid connections and infrastructure, which The Crown Estate says will enable swift development, noting they are within pre-established offshore wind energy sites."

        "content": "\nPolice in New South Wales, Australia have arrested five people in connection with a one-tonne shipment of cocaine seized from a boat off the province's central coast.\nThe police were tipped off about a possible inbound shipment of drugs when they received word of a large cash purchase of a 13-meter motor cruiser from a seller near Sydney. In Australia, cash buys of ocean-capable pleasure boats are sometimes a signal of an imminent ship-to-ship narcotics importation attempt.\nThe provincial police and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) began gathering information on the people behind the purchase, and decided to track their movements. The authorities monitored the boat's passage northbound from Sydney via Nelson Bay and Port Macquarie; on Friday, the boat's operators headed back towards shore near South West Rocks, midway between Brisbane and Sydney. Officers swooped in with a police vessel at about 0930 Friday morning and seized the boat, arresting two men aged 24 and 26 who were operating it.\n\nCourtesy AFP\nAccording to the police, the boat contained 1,110 bricks of cocaine weighing a combined 1.039 tonnes. In Australia's ultra-lucrative cocaine market, the white powder is worth nearly four times its weight in gold - meaning this shipment was valued at about US$400 million (street value).\nThe police also stopped two vehicles and arrested three people on shore near the South West Rocks area. These three individuals have been charged with supplying commercial quantities of a prohibited drug and participating in a criminal group, and are being held without bail.\n\nCourtesy AFP\nFollow-up searches at properties in Newcastle and Catherine Hill Bay resulted in seizures of documents, cash and electronic devices. The investigation into the suspects and their associates continues.\n\"Australia’s vast coastline is attractive to organized crime groups, who attempt to exploit this by trying to import drugs using boats. The bad news for them is the AFP will continue to work together with our partners to target organized crime syndicates,\" said AFP assistant commissioner Stephen Dametto in a statement. \"Importation of drugs via the sea are inherently dangerous, and criminals using this smuggling method risk both their freedom and their lives.\""

        "content": "\nMorocco is further expanding its footprint in the African port sector with a new deal to modernize Liberia’s major ports. Last week, the Liberian National Port Authority (NPA) signed a modernization agreement with Tanger Med Engineering, a subsidiary of Tanger Med Group.\nAccording to NPA, the deal marks the start of the full-scale implementation of a comprehensive master plan for the Freeport of Monrovia and the Port of Buchanan. For the last year, Liberia - in partnership with China - has been developing master plans for all its ports, including the Freeport of Monrovia and Buchanan. Liberia said the goal is to enable the ports to attract investors for their expansion.\nThe deal with Tanger Med Engineering will see NPA improve the efficiency and capacity of Monrovia and Buchanan ports, as envisaged in the master plans. This includes modernization of container terminals, cargo berths and warehousing zones, as well as deployment of smart logistics platforms.\nIn addition, Tanger Med Engineering will conduct dredging works to enhance the ports’ ability to accommodate larger vessels as trade volumes in Liberia surge. Notably, Liberia acts as a maritime gateway for landlocked Mali and parts of Guinea. NPA is keen to retain Liberia’s competitive edge, as the port sector in West Africa is changing fast with huge expansion initiatives in Ghana, Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal.\n“This agreement is more than an infrastructure project; it is a national milestone as Liberia begins the implementation phase of an ambitious port redevelopment plan. We are improving Liberia’s competitiveness along West African maritime corridor,” said NPA Managing Director Sekou Dukuly.\nThe deal is part of a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU) signed last year between Liberia and Morocco on ports development. The partnership was between NPA and Marsa Maroc - a Moroccan port operator and a subsidiary of Tanger Med Group.\nAs part of its 2030 strategy, Marsa Maroc has been targeting key African ports. The operator is keen to expand its operations from its base in Morocco to become an international port developer. In January, Marsa Maroc registered two new subsidiaries - Marsa Djibouti and Marsa Benin - strengthening its position in the African logistics sector.\nMarsa Djibouti will help the operator acquire a stake in Damerjog Oil Free Zone Establishment (FZE). This investment will see Marco Maroc enter the East African market. In addition, it will have access to Damerjog Industrial Free Zone, where Djibouti has proposed to build a mega oil and gas port capable of handling 13 million tons of cargo.\nMarsa Benin is now operating Terminals 1 and 5 at the Port of Cotonou, after commencing operations in the country a month ago.\nTop image: Port of Monrovia (file image courtesy blk24ga / CC BY 3.0)"

        "content": "\nOn Saturday, just at the point when the conflict between India and Pakistan was threatening to escalate out of control, the United States brokered an immediate ceasefire between the two nuclear armed countries. The agreement was still holding as of midday Sunday, despite small-scale violations, and leaders from both sides have claimed victory.\nThe war between India and Pakistan had escalated significantly on Friday, with both sides conducting attacks deep across the border between them, focused primarily on air bases. Open warfare between the two nations followed Indian attacks on nine sites in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir early on May 7, which India said was a response to the terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir on April 22, in which 26 tourists were killed.\nThe conflict has been characterized by a particularly acute media war, with mainstream and social media on both sides putting out false stories, apparently not only in a bid to win favorable world opinion but also for the purposes of operational deception. Hence, media reporting coming from the region needed to be treated with extreme caution, with some open-source reporters steering clear for fear of spreading planted stories.\nThe first attacks were largely confined to exchanges across the Line of Control within disputed Kashmir and India claiming to be hitting only what it considered to be terrorist-associated targets. These attacks intensified, with both sides then attacking military targets well beyond Kashmir itself.\nOvernight May 9, both sides were using airstrikes, missiles and drones. A number of Pakistani airfields were hit, including in Lahore and the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, which houses the Joint Services Headquarters, the Pakistani Armed Forces entity directing operational activity. Heat signatures from the attack on the headquarters in Rawalpindi were visible in NASA’sFIRMSsatellite imagery.\nAll Pakistani airspace was closed to civilian flights. Indian spokesman Colonel Sofiya Qureshi acknowledged that Pakistan had attacked 26 targets in India overnight, including Indian airbases in Udhampur, Bhuj, Pathankot, and Bathinda.\nBoth sides had been moving ground forces forward into the Kashmir area, with India having mobilized reserve units from its Territorial Army.\nIndia & Pakistan issue multiple notifications for simultaneous naval firing exercises across various zones in the Arabian SeaDates08 - 13 May 2025 (IND)09- 12 May 2025 (PAK)pic.twitter.com/KeKJ1rapWg\nBoth India and Pakistan issued Notice to Mariner declarations giving notice of live firing exercises within their Exclusive Economic Zones, with the pattern of these declared no-entry zones suggesting that the Pakistani Navy has pulled back to deployment areas closer to its coastline.\nThere have as yet been no reports of any exchanges at sea. Given the escalatory trajectory of the conflict, it appears that naval clashes would have been the next escalatory step for both sides. India is likely to have attempted to replicate the success of its Operation Talwar blockade of Karachi, Pakistan’s main commercial port, which starved Pakistan of fuel and had a decisive impact of the conflict between the two nations in 1999.\nIndeed, India’s navy confirmed Sunday that it positioned its warships to strike Pakistani territory if needed, and that one of the potential targets was - and still could be, if hostilities resume - the port city of Karachi.\n“On 22nd April, the Indian Navy's Carrier battle group, surface forces, submarines and aviation assets were immediately deployed at sea with full combat readiness,” said Vice Admiral AN Pramod at a press conference Sunday. “Our forces remained forward deployed in the Northern Arabian Sea in a decisive and deterrent posture with full readiness and capacity to strike select targets at sea and on land, including Karachi, at a time of our choosing.”\nThe Indian Navy is likely to have deployed a forward submarine screen covering approaches to Karachi, using carrier-launched aircraft from INSVikrant(R11) and INSVikramaditya(R33) to curb Pakistani maritime surveillance efforts with their P-3 aircraft. The Pakistani submarine force, which is proud of successful attacks on the Indian frigates INSKhukri(F149) and INSKirpan(F144) in the 1971 war, will have attempted to cover the movements of these aircraft carriers.\nIt is not known if the Indian Navy has yet deployed any BrahMos extended-range anti-ship missiles, which it ordered last year; but with a 500 mile range, these missiles would have given the Indian Navy a significant tactical advantage in naval engagements. As reflected in the issuance of Notice to Mariners, the Pakistanis are likely to have kept their ships close in to the coast, so as to enjoy better protection from Pakistan's land-based air defense sites."

A small craft had collided with the vessel, and had previously attempted to collide with several other nearby ships as well.\nThe crew of the small boat were spotted transferring safely over to another small craft - leaving the boat unmanned before its final maneuver into the hull of the merchant ship.\nNo seafarers were injured, but the merchant ship remained at the scene for some time before proceeding on its commercial voyage, UKMTO said. While the ship was in the area, the crew received VHF calls from \"local authorities\" requesting that they stop and allow a boarding party aboard.\nNo detonation was reported by UKMTO. However, the incident bears hallmarks of Houthi bomb boat technology. Typically, Houthi unmanned bomb boats are piloted by a human skipper until the final approach, when the pilot engages a remote control system and abandons ship. A crew on a nearby support vessel guides the bomb boat the rest of the way to the target by remote control.\nIran appears to have supplied at least some of theguidance systemsfor Houthi drone boats, based on captured examples of the craft. Iran has also long experimented with unmanned craft of its own, and Iranian security forces are known to use misleading radio announcements to merchant shipping; during previous periods of heightened tensions, they have periodically engaged in boardings and hijackings."

        "content": "\nThe United States appears to be withdrawing a number of B-2 Spirit strategic long-range bombers from Diego Garcia, its Naval Support Facility in the British Indian Ocean Territory. A flight of three such aircraft were being tankered towards and across Northern Australia en route back to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on May 9.\nThe B-2 aircraft are likely to have been withdrawn following the recent Houthi declaration that it will cease its attacks on shipping in the Red Sea – even though the group continues to attack Israel.\nThe Houthis have indeed continued to launch missiles at targets in Israel, forcing an evacuation of beaches in Tel Aviv on May 9. A Houthi missile was successfully intercepted by Israel’s Arrow long-range air defense system, although an attempted interception by the U.S. THAAD system is reported to have failed. In retaliation, Israel is reported to have launched another attack on the Hodeidah port complex, which Houthi authorities have said was being brought back into operation after previous Israeli attacks.\nIn the Omani-mediated agreement between the United States and the Houthis, the United States had demanded an end to Houthi attacks on Israel, which the Houthis rejected. The United States nonetheless accepted the Houthi position, effectively stepping back from its air campaign without having achieved the political objective of forcing the Houthis to give up all extra-territorial missile and drone attacks.\nAlthough forced into the agreement by the US air attacks, the Houthis have managed to preserve enough of their remaining missile and drone capability to continue their attacks on Israel, and can paint the result as a victory for Houthi staying power in their support for Palestine.\nThe agreement also leaves the Houthis with sufficient capability to resume attacks on shipping at short notice, should it wish to accuse the United States of supporting the continued Israeli counter-strikes. That the Houthis retain an anti-shipping capability will not be missed by shipping lines, who are likely to seize the rationale to continue the longer routing around the Cape of Good Hope, given that this absorbs additional capacity in a shipping market where there is oversupply.\nThe fragility of the Houthi pause in attacks on shipping appears to have been recognized by CENTCOM planners, because the B-2 Spirit aircraft withdrawn from Diego Garcia have been replaced by at least four B-52 strategic bombers. The venerable B-52 has none of the B-2's stealth, but it is far easier tomaintainon a long forward deployment."

Four weeks ago, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered thestop workasserting that the permitting had been rushed and required further reviews.\nMolly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables Americas, in aninterviewwith POLITICO on Friday, May 9, called the situation “urgent and unsustainable.” According to the story, the company has been unable to secure a meeting with Burgum to hear his explanation and has not received the purported report that raised questions about the permitting. POLITICO notes that the report or further details have not been released by the Department of the Interior, which said the project required further review.\nBloomberg isreportingin a story on May 12 that the CEO of Equinor, Anders Opedal, and senior officials met with the US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. It says that the company has received no indication of a chance in stance from the Trump administration, which has vowed to stop the offshore wind energy industry.\n“If no progress is made within days, Equinor will be forced to terminate the project,” Bloomberg reports Morris said Monday. “We are still fighting every day to find a resolution.”\nEquinor highlights that it spent seven years in review of the project before gaining all the necessary approvals in 2024. Work started last year, and the company says the project is approximately 30 percent completed, with work on the onshore cabling and development of the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in New York progressing. Offshore work had been scheduled to start when the order was issued, and the company reported it complied by stopping the offshore projects.\nMorris is saying that the stop work order is costing the company $50 million a week. It has 11 vessels on standby and more than 100 people who had been scheduled to start the offshore portion of the project this spring. Work has continued onshore, but now the company says without information from the Trump administration, it will be forced in a matter of days to walk away from the project.\nEquinor says it has invested about $2.7 billion so far in the project that was budgeted to cost $5 billion with commercial operations beginning in 2027. As of the end of March, Equinor reported it had drawn around $1.5 billion under the project finance term loan facility and that it had provided guarantees for the equity commitment in the project financing. In a full stop scenario, the company said it would have to repay the $1.5 billion and would be exposed to termination fees towards its suppliers.\nEquinor is highlighting that this situation is larger than its project and about the administration honoring contracts and financial investments. Other companies, including Shell, TotalEnergies, and RWE, have already walked away from or paused their plans in the U.S. market citing the uncertainties and increased risks.\n“They are setting a dangerous precedent by stopping a project in mid-execution,” Bloomberg reports Morris is now asserting.\nSpeaking to investors during its quarterly report at the end of April, Equinor called the stop work order “unlawful.” Management said they were reviewing the situation andconsidering legal options.\nNew York state was quick and vocal in its objection and support of Equinor when the Trump administration ordered the stop work. Since then, 17 states and the District of Columbia filed suit in federal court challenging Trump’s executive order and the enforceability of the stop to the leasing process for offshore energy projects."

The provider of professional indemnity insurance settled a claim that it acknowledges was a lack of communication that led to a simple oversight.\nThe ship’s owner filed a claim for $135,000 in expenses and late fees it incurred when one of its ships was operating outside its normal liner schedule. It had scheduled special port calls and notified the liner agent of the inbound schedule, requesting that arrangements be made for the calls outside the regular service pattern.\nUsing the initial arrival plan, an agent scheduled the pilot for the ship and initiated the customs clearance for the ports. The agent, however, was heading out of the office on leave and handled the assignment over to a covering team.\nWhen the ship was delayed in its first port of call, the company notified the agency of a three-day delay for the first of the two scheduled discharge ports. The agency’s team adjusted the arrangements at the first port but omitted to make changes for the second port.\nThe problem only became apparent when the ship reached the second port, and there was no pilot available. The company reports it incurred the $135,000 expense due to the urgent need to finalize a pilot and late fees that were incurred. It requested reimbursement from the insurance company, placing the blame for the expenses on the agent’s mistakes.\nITIC reports that the agency cooperated and provided the documentation and acknowledged their omission in adjusting the schedule at the second port. “As there was no defense,” ITIC said it “honored the claim and reimbursed the full amount.”\n“A mistake like this highlights the need for clear internal communication and robust handover procedures,” said Mark Brattman, Claims Director at ITIC. “Our goal is to help members learn from such incidents and strengthen their operational procedures.”\nDespite the modernization of so much of the operations and the push toward electronics and digitalization, it highlights that much of the shipping industry remains concentrated on fulfilling basic daily tasks. A simple oversight resulted in the delay and expense for the vessel and ultimately the insurance provider."

The master made a distress call and reported that the vessel's pumps could not keep up with the water ingress.\nCoast Guard Sector Columbia River received the call and issued a broadcast to nearby shipping to ask for assistance. The command center also dispatched rescue boat crews out of Grays Harbor and a helicopter SAR crew out of Astoria, Oregon.\nShortly after the distress call, a good Samaritan came to the aid of the Captain Raleigh, and at 0830, just 15 minutes after the call, a Coast Goard boat crew was on scene. Minutes later, Captain Raleigh sank rapidly. Three crewmembers from the stricken vessel were already in their lifejackets and abandoned ship into the water, and were immediately retrieved by the Coast Guard responders. However, the master of the Captain Raleigh was reportedly still on board when it went down.\nTwo boat crews and the helicopter aircrew carried out a surface search for the missing captain. A nearby dredger from the Corps of Engineers diverted to assist with sonar search of the bottom, and quickly found the position of the missing fishing vessel.\nOn request from the Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy dispatched a helicopter with a salvage dive team from Air Station Whidbey Island. Surface conditions were unsuitable for diving until the evening; an attempt to access the wreck at 1800 hours was not successful, given debris, low visibility and strong underwater currents on the site.\nAt 2040 hours Friday, the Coast Guard called off the search for the missing captain.\n\"This is a tragedy for our fishing communities,\" said Capt. Justin Noggle, commander of Coast Guard Sector Columbia River. \"I’m thankful our Coast Guard crews were able to save the three crewmembers quickly, and our hearts are with the family and friends of everyone impacted by this tremendous loss.\"\nCommercial salvors have arrived on scene and are developing a salvage plan, the Coast Guard said. No significant pollution has been reported, and the site is relatively accessible: the boat is resting in 40 feet of water outside of the Grays Harbor navigation channel.\nU.S. fishing industry media outlets have identified the Captain Raleigh's master as Jon Stevenson, 44, a longtime member of the fishing community based in Newport, Oregon. The local organization Newport Fishermen's Wives has started acharitable fundraiserfor Stevenson's family."

It comes at a critical time as shippers consider steps to manage the Trump policies ranging from tariffs to port fees for Chinese-built ships.\nDP World, which has been operating in the Dominican Republic for more than 25 years, reports it signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of the Dominican Republic that calls for expanding its port and Free Trade Zone operations. The company will initiate negotiations with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and MSMES to finalize the expansion agreement.\nIndustry analysts have called for the development of a transshipment hub that could better serve the needs of the Caribbean. Wth the changes in U.S. policies, it could now also provide an alternative to transshipping cargo via the United States and promote economic development.\nDP World’s agreement calls for expanding the operations at the Port of Caucedo on the south coast of the island on the Caribbean Sea east of Santo Domingo. Since 2003, DP World reports it has invested more than $700 million in the development of the operations, including increasing capacity from 900,000 to 2.5 million TEU with three berths. It also operates a logistics center in the free trade zone with six warehouses.\nThe company highlights the strategic location of the facility noting that it handles more than 60 percent of the DR’s market share. It says that with proximity to the United States and duty-free access, the DR offers a compelling environment and the opportunity to become the transshipment hub for the region.\nThe plan calls for investing $380 million into the port to increase capacity to approximately 3.1 million TEU. It would expand the quay and breakwater to accommodate larger vessels, add new ship-to-shore cranes and yard equipment. An additional $380 million would be invested in the Free Trade Zone to add 225 hectares of development-ready land and infrastructure improvements.\nThe website for the operation notes that it has already become one of the most important ports in the Americas region and is among the top 15 ports in Latin America. DP World highlights that it has the opportunity to be a strategic location for the redistribution of cargo to the Caribbean, Central and South America, and the United States."

The results demonstrate the corporate strategy, which is expanding the technical nature and future orientation as the group expands its work in defense and launches its new “Underwater” segment focusing on submarines and naval systems.\nRevenues across the group were up by 35 percent to nearly €2.4 billion and contributing to a strong increase in earnings to €154 million (EBITDA) during the first quarter. The company reported all segments contributed, but especially shipbuilding which was up 53 percent. They also reported strong margin improvements due to growth in the defense segment, improvements in efficiency in cruise, and the first contribution from WASS Submarine Systems, which was acquired and consolidated at the beginning of 2025.\n“The first quarter of 2025 marks the best results in our history,” highlighted Pierroberto Folgiero, Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of Fincantieri. “The increase in revenues in the defense segment and the consolidation of our three dimensions - cruise, defense, and offshore - confirm the effectiveness of our integrated business model. We will continue to pursue our goals for 2025 with determination and beyond, actively contributing to the reindustrialization of the country and the strengthening of the European manufacturing system.”\nThe group highlights its long-term outlook as it booked orders valued at €11.7 billion, which it highlights was approximately three-quarters of the total booked in 2024. The total backlog is up 30 percent with 102 units on order. Among the orders this quarter was finalizing orders from Norwegian Cruise Line, Viking, and a new contract with the Indonesian Ministry of Defense. With growth in both the cruise and offshore orders, they highlight visibility up to 2036 from the orderbook.\nThe group is expanding its technical operations and focus on defense and complex systems. In addition to the launch of a new reporting segment from Underwater systems, they extended a 20-year partnership with Germany’s TKMS (Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems), which includes a modernization program of submarines for the Philippines’ Navy.\n“We will continue to pursue our goals for 2025 with determination and beyond, actively contributing to the reindustrialization of the country and the strengthening of the European manufacturing system,” said Folgiero. “Fincantieri is today a future-proof laboratory of heavy industry, a champion of Made in Italy ingenuity, committed to generating employment, competitiveness, and sustainable innovation along the entire value chain.”\nReaffirming its forecast for 2025, management pointed to the favorable macroeconomic trends in the cruise segment, the expected rise in defense spending, and the increasing demand for offshore energy. They said it created compelling business opportunities in both the wind and Oil & Gas segments, in part served by its Vard subsidiary, as well as the new opportunities in the underwater domain."

The latest encounter occurred in the Japanese EEZ, about 140 nautical miles, when a Japan Coast Guard cutter found a Chinese research vessel deploying a suspicious object and ordered it to leave.\nThe use of oceanographic research as a cover for espionage has a long and rich history, from the CIA's famousGlomar Explorerproject to Russia's notorious spy shipYantar. This gray-zone activity pattern extends across all of the world's leading naval powers, and China is no exception. As one example, China's Academy of Sciences has used its research vessels toplace and servicepowerful acoustic seabed sensors near Guam, for the purpose of studying typhoons and whales; the research devices happened to be well-located for tracking U.S. Navy submarines, and are likely used for that purpose, multiple analysts have noted.\nIn this context, China's neighbors pay close attention to the movements of its civilian research fleet - especially in sensitive areas, like the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands. On Sunday morning at about 0630, the Japan Coast Guard spotted the research shipHai Ke 001lowering a \"pipe-like\" object into the water at a position about 140 miles north of Taisho Island. The Japan Coast Guard issued a radio call and ordered theHai Ke 001to cease its activity, and the Chinese vessel complied, departing the scene and returning to the Chinese side of the EEZ median line.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard has also closely followed the movements of China's research fleet, especially in the contested waters of the western Philippine EEZ. On May 5, the PCG cutter BRPTeresa Magbanuaintercepted the Chinese research vesselTan Suo 3off Ilocos Norte, within the Philippine exclusive economic zone. The PCG radioedTan Suo 3and informed the crew that the Chinese vessel's operations were unlawful under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOSgives the coastal state the right to regulate oceanographic research within its 200-mile EEZ). TheMagbanuainstructedTan Suo 3to get under way and remain in motion.\n\nDeep Sea Warrior recovered aboard Tan Suo 3 (PCG)\nDuring this conversation, the PCG spotted a submersible approachingTan Suo 3.The sub was identified as the Deep Sea Warrior, a manned Chinese research sub with a maximum rated depth of 4,500 meters. An unidentified floating piece of equipment was also retrieved from the water byTan Suo 3'screw.\n\"These actions [are] clear evidence that the People's Republic of China are conducting illegal marine scientific research activities within the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone, lacking the legal authority to undertake such activities in this area,\" said PCG spokesman Jay Tarriela in a statement."

The shipbuilding industry is one of the hardest hit by the restrictions on exports of advanced technology and machinery to Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine.\nRussian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has spoken out on the efforts to fulfil the plans called for by President Vladimir Putin. Mishustin outlined today, May 12, at a meeting of the region premiers what he called an updated strategy for the development of the shipbuilding industry. In addition to expansion and modernization, one of the key goals is to develop the domestic capabilities to replace foreign shipboard equipment and create a domestic supply chain.\n“In the next six years, we will spend over 500 billion rubles ($6.2 billion) in federal funding for these purposes, which is a record figure for the industry,” said Mishustin. He said the priorities would be to support freight traffic via the Northern Sea Route and to establish logistics routes between Russia and friendly countries. They are also seeking to support inland navigation and expand river tourism.\nFirst Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov provided specific details on the plan, noting that they must replace the existing fleet that was built in the 1970s and 1980s. The strategy calls for building more than 1,600 ships by 2036 and more than 2,600 by 2050. Previous reports said they would build 713 vessels by 2030.\nThe plan focuses on large-capacity projects including crude oil tankers, gas carriers, shuttle tankers, and bulk carriers. Published reports said 51 of the vessels would be for the Northern Sea Route, while there will also be a focus on icebreakers and the fishing fleet, which would add 279 vessels. They also look to support the North-South route, which includes Caspian Sea shipping.\nTo achieve the ambitious building plans, Mishustin said they will need to build new shipyards, expand production capacity, and undertake R&D to attract investors.  They will need to overcome “structural barriers” within the industry.\nThe priority remains on fulfilling the state’s defense needs, with a new plan being developed for the Russian Navy. They look to coordinate the needs of the Navy with the goals of expanding the merchant fleet."

        "content": "Acting on information from the United States authorities, South Korea’s Busan Regional Customs made the second major cocaine seizure from an inbound vessel in just a matter of weeks. The authorities are working to determine if the shipment was bound for Korea or if they intercepted a larger smuggling operation.\nCustoms reported seizing 720 kg of cocaine from an unidentified containership as it was arriving on May 10 at the Busan New Port. The vessel, which is registered in Malta, was arriving from South America and was inspected after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration tipped off the Korean authorities of the possible smuggling operation. The seizure was said to represent 24 million doses, and the authorities estimated the street value at more than $254 million.\nThe vessel was detained, and the crew has been preliminarily interviewed. As part of the investigation, Customs said in a statement that it was working to determine “the origin and intended distribution route. We still don’t know whether Korea was the final destination or a transit point.”\nHistorically, South Korea has had a relatively low level of drug smuggling. Officials call the country drug-free to emphasize the success in limiting the smuggling of illegal narcotics.\nThe authorities, however, said this latest seizure again confirms that the smuggling plots are becoming larger and more involved. Less than six weeks ago, on April 2, Customs at the Okgye Port in the southeast of the country reported a seizure of one tonne of cocaine from a cargo ship arriving from South America, which they called at the time the largest drug bust on record for the country. It was hidden on a bulker which appeared to have made port calls in Mexico, Ecuador, Panama, and China.\nBusan authorities in January 2024 also caught 100 kg of cocaine. The cocaine was found in the sea chest of a ship owned by a Korean company, but testing in that instance showed the drugs had been handled by individuals other than the crew. The authorities speculated the cocaine had been hidden aboard the vessel in Central or South America and considered the possibility it was bound for China or Europe when it was intercepted in South Korea."

        "content": "The U.S. Coast Guard released a series of new rules on May 9 that it says are designed to streamline and consolidate the process for foreign ships to be certified under the American registry. It reflects the dual ambitions of the Trump administration to grow the American merchant marine and reduce excess regulations imposed by the U.S. government on industry.\nAccording to theannouncementfrom USCG, the process of reflagging into the American registry is being consolidated under a single program based on international standards. Historically, it has been considered to be an onerousprocessrequiring a demonstration of need, review and acceptance by the Maritime Administration and other government agencies, a planning process, and entailed inspection.\nUSCG reports thechanges to the processreduces pre-inspection plan review, which will result in avoiding scheduling delays and minimizing modification costs. They contend it will provide more job opportunities for American mariners.\nOne of the common means that foreign ships have entered the U.S. registry is through the Maritime Security Program established nearly 30 years ago by the Clinton administration. The U.S. Congress extended the program till 2035, guaranteeing 60 positions (all currently filled) for ships to operate under the U.S. flag and receive what MARAD calls a “financial stipend” (or incentive). It is to offset U.S. operating costs in exchange for making their ships and commercial transportation resources available upon request by the Secretary of Defense during times of war or national emergency. It provides a simplified certification process for ships to enter the U.S. registry.\nUSCG in the new iteration is offering foreign-built vessels the option of enrolling in voluntary sealift support without being in the 60 spots that receive financial incentives. They write that receiving payments as part of MSP enrollment is not a precondition for certification. This also includes vessels reflagging as part of the Ready Reserve Force recapitalization.\nThe change was reportedly spearheaded by Captain Cory Heard, who is the Chief, Office of Commercial Vessel Compliance from USCG, and heading an interagency team to support Donald Trump’s executive orders. Wayne Arguin Jr., Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy at the U.S. Coast Guard, writes online that simplifying reflagging and certification for foreign-built vessels is the “first of many (initiatives) as we work to Restore American Maritime Dominance.”\nThis comes as the Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands on Saturday, May 10, confirmed in a social media posting a report from Reuters that the Trump administration is reviewing an idea that was first floated a few years ago to create a second U.S. flag registry in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It would be an open registry administered by a third-party commercial organization.\nThe plan was put forward by a private group in 2021 calling itself the Center for Ocean Policy and Economics, andwinning supportfrom conservative groups, including in 2023 from the Hudson Institute, a conservative think-tank. The groups said it would be a way to bypass burdensome domestic regulations that restrict entry into the U.S. registry for foreign-built ships and deal with the limited U.S. shipbuilding capacity. They argue it would create jobs and support the development of a shipyard in the Virgin Islands for maintenance work. The Hudson Institute set a target for 250 U.S.-registered ships, a goal that has now found its way into the recently introduced legislation in the U.S. Congress to support reinvigorating the U.S. merchant marine and shipbuilding.\nThe U.S.’s leading maritime unions have repeatedly joined together to oppose the proposed open registry. The unions in the pastopposed the planas it would permit foreign seafarers to crew the vessels, a move they said made the plan nothing more than aployto generate registry fees.\nReports say the Trump administration is looking at it as a possible “bold, private-sector driven initiative.” Reuters wrote in an exclusive story on May 9 that the National Security Council was aware of the proposed USVI Registry and was possibly considering the plan."

        "content": "\nJust in time for the peak container shipping season on the China-U.S. transpacific route, the Trump administration has negotiated a deal with the government of China to relax unprecedented tariffs on bilateral trade. The U.S. will drop its net tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 percent down to 30 percent, well below the levels that many market participants predicted. China will drop its tariffs on U.S. goods from 125 percent down to 10 percent.\nThe temporary agreement is valid for at least the next 90 days while the two sides discuss permanent terms, giving U.S. importers a window to stock up on Chinese-made goods for the back-to-school and Christmas holiday shopping seasons.\nAfter April 2, facing unprofitable tariff levels, many American importers had stopped shipping goods out of China to await more favorable developments, hitting U.S. inventories and Chinese consumer-goods manufacturers hard. The slowdown will now shift in reverse as retailers move to rebuild stock. \"Get ready for a shipping boom,\" said Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen in a statement early Monday.\nStocks soared on news of the agreement, with the Nasdaq jumping by four percent by midafternoon. The Dow and the S&P 500 both gained about three percent. All three indices have now regained all of the losses incurred after the White House's April 2 tariff announcement; China-dependent consumer retail stocks showed particular strength, reflecting renewed confidence in their ability to source imported goods. Stock for toymaker Mattel jumped 10 percent, Best Buy rose six percent, and discount chain Five Below soared 20 percent.\n\"We believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025,\" said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, speaking to the WSJ. \"This morning is a huge win for the bulls.\"\nTrade-dependent container shipping stocks took off, regaining much of the lost ground of recent weeks. Matson, the Jones Act carrier that operates a specialty service from East Asia to the U.S. West Coast, jumped 19 percent in midday trading. Maersk's OTC stock traded up 10 percent, Hapag-Lloyd was up more than two percent, NYK by nearly four percent, and Yang Ming by one percent. Zim was a clear winner, with shares up by 14 percent.\n“We expect bookings from China to the U.S. to increase, which should help us . . . into peak season,\" Hapag-Lloyd told Reuters in a statement.\nThe reduced level of activity at West Coast gateway ports is still built into the forecast through the end of May: the dozens of blanked sailings that ocean carriers implemented on ex-China routes are a guarantee of fewer ships with less cargo arriving LA/Long Beach in the immediate term. The first San Pedro port activity rebound could be expected in two to three weeks at the earliest, reflecting the minimum transit time needed for a box from eastern China to reach California. Some analysts predict that the San Pedro ports could swing from light activity to significant congestion by midsummer as retailers rush to bring cargo in from China at comparatively affordable tariff levels.\nGene Seroka, head of the Port of LA, told the Wall Street Journal that he was less bullish about a spike in shipping volume. “I don’t see all of the normal cargo coming back to the levels that we had witnessed in recent weeks and months,” Seroka said. “Reason being, you’re not going to be frontloading at 30 percent [tariffs].”\nVeteran shipping analyst Peter Sand concurred. :It must not be ignored there is still a 30% tariff on imports from China to the US and this will be prohibitive for some businesses with lower-margin goods, so there will still be an adverse impact on ocean container shipping demand,\" he said in a research note Monday. \"It may also take shippers a little time to ramp up sourcing and manufacturing in China again if they took the foot off the gas following the 145 percent tariffs announced on 9 April.\""

Candidates, they contend, must repeatedly demonstrate the same competencies, first through years of hands-on assessments and then again on a seven-part written exam.\nThe sponsors say the shortcomings of the current process are discouraging new entrants and diverting time from more relevant modern training, like cybersecurity. Additionally, the exam, they said, lacks a modern review system, leaving graduates underprepared for the realities of today’s maritime industry.\n“Our mariners deserve a credentialing system that reflects the realities of today’s maritime industry—not outdated exams and unnecessary hurdles said Rep. Ezell. “This is about building up America’s maritime workforce and supporting the professionals who keep America’s maritime commerce moving safely and efficiently.”\nTraining and the credentialing process also emerged as an issue in the largerSHIPs Actproposed to the U.S. House and Senate for the second time this spring. The sponsors call it a comprehensive approach to restoring the U.S. merchant marine and include a portion of the legislation focusing on similar issues as this new proposal.\nThe call for the modernization of the credentialing program is also gaining the support of the Consortium of State Maritime Academies. G. P. Achenbach, Ed. Rear Admiral, U.S. Maritime Service and President of the group, highlights that the proposed legislation would reduce the redundancy between The STCW Code and the national exam. He said the effort would eliminate the requirement for the academies to dedicate time in the academic program on subjects that are outdated, and not currently used by professional mariners. Additionally, the group believes the legislative effort would substantially increase the value of the exam review teams (working groups) and contribute to alleviating the current mariner shortage.\nThe Merchant Marine Exam Modernization Act, if passed, would direct the U.S. Coast Guard to develop and implement a plan to modernize the Merchant Mariner Credentialing exam. It calls for the formation of a dedicated working group and requires action within 270 days after receiving the recommendations from the group."

        "content": "\nThe Royal Navy's top officer has been suspended from duty for an investigation into alleged misconduct, the UK Ministry of Defence confirmed last weekend. It is the first time in 500 years that a misconduct inquiry has been launched against its top uniformed leader.\nThe MoD has declined to comment further.\nBritish tabloid media outlets have previously reported that First Sea Lord Adm. Sir Ben Key had a consensual relationship with a female subordinate, and that the affar was disclosed to investigators by another officer. The Royal Navy strictly bans any sexual relations between commanders and junior personnel. If found to have committed an offense, Sir Key could face up to a reduction in rank and dismissal from the service.\nThe accusations have created a stir in defense circles in the UK, not least because Adm. Key was an outspoken leader on hunting down sexual misconduct in the armed forces. Just last year, he had called for \"zero tolerance for unacceptable behaviors,\" and said that there was \"no place\" in the Royal Navy for sailors who could not follow the service's \"values and standards.\" He is married with three children.\nSome supporters of Adm. Key within the Royal Navy told the Daily Mail that they believe the allegations were a \"stitch-up\" orchestrated by other high-ranking officers - though others disagreed. Adm. Key has been outspoken about funding and procurement issues, and at least one Navy source told the tabloid that the disclosure of the affair was a convenient way to silence him amidst infighting over the service's future direction.\nAdm. Key has served in the Royal Navy for more than four decades. He commanded a carrier, HMS Illustrious, and served overseas alongside American officers in the Iraq war. He was due to retire within months, to be replaced by Royal Marine General Gwyn Jenkins. UK tabloids report that Key was prohibited from retiring until after the inquiry had finished.\nSecond Sea Lord Vice Adm. Martin Connell has taken over command until the inquiry is finished.\n\"Across the board [Adm. Key] is very popular, very competent and the majority of the naval service are extremely shocked and really sad to see it potentially end like this,\" one senior source within the Royal Navy told Daily Mail.\nTop image: Katie Chan / CC BY SA 4.0"

        "content": "\nAn MSC containership,MSC Antonia(85,760 dwt) has been aground in the Red Sea for the past several days while a growing mystery is swirling around the vessel’s location and the cause of the incident. Speculation is growing that the vessel is possibly the victim of GPS jamming as multiple reports surface of widespread disruptions in the Red Sea region.\nThe interference is familiar to the industry with multiple warnings. It can cause vessels to deviate from their course or misinterpret their current location.\nWell-known industry analyst Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, mentioned the grounding in an online update writing, “the vessel track on AIS appears highly erratic, likely due to the GPS interference reported in recent days by UKMTO.”\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) on May 9 issued a warning that multiple vessels had experienced disruptions and electronic interference lasting up to several hours in the Red Sea across a broad area encompassing Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to Port Sudan. They warned it was “affecting navigation systems and requiring vessels to rely on backup methods.”\n“This is a clear and present danger for shipping,” wrote Ami Daniel, Co-Founder & CEO of predictive data analytics firm Windward. He warns of a “significant escalation in jamming capability,” citing Windward’s data that shows “that the average distance vessels ‘jump’ to when their AIS is jammed grew dramatically from 600km in Q4 2024 to 6,300km in Q1 2025.” Windward warns of GPS jamming incidents ranging from the Baltic to the Eastern Mediterranean, Black Sea, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Gulf of Aden, Sudan’s coastline, and China’s coastal waters.\n\n\n\nMSC’s published schedule for theMSC Antoniashows the vessel traveling between Jeddah and the King Abdullah Port in Saudi Arabia. MarineTraffic’s AIS tracking, however, shows the ship made a stop at Port Sudan and was bound for Jeddah. The reports say the ship, which is 997 feet (304 meters) in length with a capacity of 7,000 TEU, is aground approximal 100 nautical miles from Jeddah.\nVideos online show tugs attempting to move the vessel, which is sitting at an angle.  MSC has not released any details or commented on whether the vessel sustained damage.\nDatabases indicate the ship, which was built in 2009 and is registered in Liberia, has been operating for MSC since 2018. It recently received a good report in mid-April after undergoing a Port State inspection in Spain. No deficiencies were reported by the authorities, but the ship did make headlines at the end of August 2024 when it lost 46 containers overboard off the coast of South Africa in bad wintry weather. Another 305 boxes were reported damaged forcing the ship to divert to Cape Town to recover."

        "content": "Continuing its strategy to pressure Iran, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced the latest round of sanctions. The newest targets are a network of nearly two dozen companies, which the U.S. contents are mostly fronts or in support of Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics to provide funds through the transport and sale of oil products to China.\nU.S. officials outlined an elaborate effort linked to Sepehr Energy, which they reported is the main commercial affiliate of Iran’s Armed Forces General Staff.  Sepehr, the U.S. reports, often carries out its oil shipments through a series of “deals” between multiple front companies that it owns or controls, creating the illusion of non-sanctionable trade between separate entities. Many of the entities involved in Sepehr Energy’s oil shipments are part of an elaborate system of oil smuggling and money laundering, directly controlled by or acting on behalf of Sepehr Energy.\n“Today’s action underscores our continued focus on intensifying pressure on every aspect of Iran’s oil trade, which the regime uses to fund its dangerous and destabilizing activities,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.  He highlights that since Trump’s maximum pressure campaign on Iran was launched, the U.S. has taken 19 actions, sanctioning 253 individuals, entities, and vessels related to Tehran and its proxies.\nIncluded in today’s actions were a series of front companies based in Hong Kong that the U.S. says broker and receive the shipments of Iranian oil facilitating the transfer to the so-called “teapot” independent refineries in China. Separately, the U.S. has sanctioned three of those refineries as well as terminal operators. Between 2023 and 2024, the U.S. says the Hong Kong companies (Xin Rui Ji Trad Co., Star Energy International, and Milen Trading Co.) leased shore storage tanks holding the Iranian oil till it could be delivered to the refineries.\nBefore Sepehr Energy’s oil shipments reach China, the U.S. reports that the Iranian-origin oil is first obfuscated, typically through numerous ship-to-ship transfers, oil blending, and document falsification.  Sepehr Energy, they report, has consistently relied on CCIC Singapore to accomplish not only the necessary pre-delivery cargo inspections required before oil is transferred to China, but also to conceal the oil’s Iranian origins. CICC also has a sister company Huangdao Inspection, both of which have provided inspections to numerous sanctioned tankers transporting Iranian oil.\nThe U.S. also cites local agencies that handle tasks such as vessel berthing and organizing discharge operations.\nIt is also linking Sepehr and Iran’s Armed Forces General Staff to two tankers, the Cameroon-flaggedBalu(305,704 dwt) and the Panama-flaggedRoc(70,616 dwt). The registered owners of the tankers are in the Seychelles and Hong Kong. The U.S. sanctioned the tankers along with the shipping companies and commercial operators.\nAll of this comes as the U.S. and Iran completed a fourth round of negotiations mediated by Oman and as Donald Trump is visiting the Middle East on his first international trip since returning to the White House.  The U.S. and Iran have agreed to continue the talks with the Omanis to set the date for the next round."

The facility, which was built through a partnership between European Energy and Mitsui & Co., is being billed as the world’s first large-scale commercial e-methanol facility.\nSituated next to Northern Europe’s largest solar park—the 304 MW Kassø Solar Park—the facility integrates large-scale renewable power generation with carbon capture and utilization. By combining biogenic CO2 with green hydrogen produced on-site, the companies report that the facility manufactures e-methanol with up to a 97 percent reduced carbon footprint compared to fossil-based products.\nThe Kassø e-methanol facility is designed to support the direct decarbonisation of sectors that are otherwise difficult to electrify. The CO2 used in the production process will be captured from biogas plants and waste incineration. The plant has an annual production capacity of 42,000 tonnes.\n“The start of operations at Kassø marks a major step forward in bringing Power-to-X technologies into real-world use,” said Knud Erik Andersen, CEO of European Energy.\n\n\nThe plant draws power from the solar farm and uses captured CO2 in its production (European Energy)\n\nA.P. Moller – Maersk has contracted to be one of the first large users off taking e-methanol from the facility. It will be used to fuel theLaura Maersk, the company’s first containership capable of operating on methanol. The feeder operates in the Baltic/Scandinavia region, but so far has been using methanol, waiting for the supply of e-methanol to be developed at a commercial scale.\nWhile the plant will have the largest commercial output, it will overall be small compared to demand. Maersk, for example, said the annual output would fuel one of its large methanol containerships for one trip between Europe and Asia. However, the smallerLaura Maerskrequires 3,600 tons of fuel per year.\nThe e-methanol from the facility will also be used in industrial processes where fossil-based methanol has traditionally been standard. One such application is in plastics, where manufacturers aim to adopt more sustainable materials while maintaining safety and quality standards. The LEGO Group and Novo Nordisk are also offtakers of e-methanol from Kassø, using it to replace fossil methanol in the production of selected products."

The vessel departed Hong Kong that June with a work party of more than 400 Chinese gold mining laborers on board. The miners were headed to the gold fields of Victoria, which were home to a booming enterprise at the time.\nAfter the vessel delivered the miners to shore at the town of Robe, South Australia, the weather conditions deteriorated. On June 30, the ship's anchor windlass tore off and the anchor went with it. In heavy seas, theKoning Willem de Tweedegrounded offshore and began to break up. Only nine out of 25 crewmembers survived.\nShortly before the pandemic, the Dutch government agreed to fund a new search for the wreck site of theKoning Willem de Tweede.The hunt was led by the Australian National Maritime Museum, and after some initial field research, the team began a magnetometer survey in late 2022. The search revealed a location on the bottom with a very substantial magnetic signature - but diving the site proved difficult because of persistent poor surface conditions in the unsheltered bay. Followup trip in March 2023 encountered the same bad weather, as well as poor visibility.\nIt would be two more years before the researchers got the conditions they needed to examine the site. The fine sand of the bay made visibility a persistent challenge, but in March 2025, they got a weather window that was calm enough to see the bottom in detail. Lead scientist James Hunter discovered the ship's windlass, among other items, and found enough information to draw a formal conclusion. In May, the partners confirmed that they had found the wreck of theKoning Willem de Tweedeat a position just 1,300 feet off the beach at Robe.\nSA maritime history unearthed! ????

Dutch ship with links to early migration.#ShipwreckProject#KoningWillemdeTweedepic.twitter.com/fNv2aYIZDC\nHunter says that the site has excellent archaeological potential because of the rapid timeline of the casualty.\n\"The wrecking event was catastrophic and very sudden, so we’re very likely to find a lot of artefacts. No one had time to grab anything. Pretty much everything was lost – and is all probably still in the wreck, which can tell us so much about the ship’s crew and its passengers,\" he told Cosmos Magazine in 2023."

        "content": "\nFollowing the newly-announced pause on the White House's 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods, many American importers are rushing to pay a lesser amount and get their goods into the United States now, avoiding the risk that the levy might go up again in future negotiations with Beijing. Many Chinese manufacturers report new calls from American clients who want any inventory shipped as fast as possible, and who want to restart work on the orders they had canceled last month.\n“A client who has placed orders for May through August requested this morning that we resume production on the May order and deliver as soon as possible,” shoe factory owner Wang Jie told SCMP. Just one day after the tariff reprieve was announced, Wang's firm has already reopened a shuttered shoe production line.\nAn executive at a Shenzhen electronics manufacturer relayed a similar story to SCMP, with a minor change: the firm's U.S. clients want the goods made within 90 days, then exported to Vietnam, where the merchandise will be stored to wait out the results of future U.S. trade talks.\nJay Foreman, CEO of Florida toy firm Basic Fun!, told NPR that his firm had been holding back \"everything\" at factories and seaports in China while the 145 percent tariff was in effect. As soon as he got the word that the tariff rate would be cut to a \"manageable\" 30 percent, he called partners in China and began scheduling shipments to go out immediately.\nThe reprieve will mean greater selection for U.S. shoppers when the holiday season arrives. \"The 90-day window staves off a potential Christmas disaster for retailers,” Cameron Johnson, senior partner at China-based consultancy Tidalwave Solutions, told NBC.\nThe renewed demand for Chinese goods translates into more business for ocean carriers, and reports of increased slot bookings have started to come in quickly. \"Our ocean freight bookings from China to the US increased 35 percent in the first day since the trade deal. A big backlog is looming, soon the ships will be sold out,\" predicted Flexport's Ryan Petersen in a social media message.\nThe expected bump in shipping demand has prompted ocean carriers to raise their asking price for box slots on the transpacific trade lanes. Early attempts at rate hikes on China-U.S. West Coast services are in the range of $500 extra per FEU beginning this week, and as much as an extra $3,500 per FEU for next month's sailings."

In a concerted marketing effort, the authority is highlighting opportunities and adding financial incentives after a disastrous year in 2024.\nThe canal is a major source of foreign currency and income for Egypt. The country’s central bank recently reported that revenues from the canal in the fourth quarter were a fraction of the year earlier. It said the canal provided just over $880 million in fourth quarter revenues versus $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. For all of 2024, the canal provided only about $4 billion, down by nearly two-thirds from the record $10.3 billion in 2023.\nSpeaking last week to a meeting of representatives of 25 major shipping lines and agencies, Lieutenant General Osama Rabie, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, said, “We call on all shipping lines to seriously consider evaluating their sailing schedules and consider the possibility of gradually resuming the passage of some of their vessels through the region.”\nThe Suez Canal Authority is calling the developments in the security situation in the Red Sea “a good sign and a positive indicator that can be built upon to restore navigation in the region.” It said that it has begun efforts to communicate with its clients, including major shipping lines, ship owners, and shipping agencies, to discuss the impact of the positive developments in the security situation in the Red Sea region and its impact on the freedom of navigation.\nLieutenant General Rabie highlighted the Authority's ongoing efforts to keep pace with the rapid changes in the maritime transport industry and to flexibly address current challenges in the Red Sea region in the best possible way. During a TV interview, he mentioned the consideration for financial incentives, and hours later confirmed the Suez Canal Authority was moving forward with the proposal approved by Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\nThe Suez Canal Authority is offering incentives and discounts of 15 percent of the transit fees for containerships with a net tonnage of 130,000 tons and above. The offer begins on Thursday, May 15, and ships can take advantage of it transiting either laden or empty. The authority reports the offer will last for 90 days.\nSpeaking with the shipping companies, the authority emphasized that ships have begun to return to the canal route. It said that in March 166 vessels had made the transit. It remains, however, far below the canal’s peak when it regularly handled more than 60 ships a day and set a record of 89 ships in a day in August 2022.\nAmong the major carriers, CMA CGM ranked first in terms of net tonnage transiting the canal during the first four months of 2025. The Suez Canal Authority said it represented 19 percent of the total tonnage of containerships transiting the canal during the period, while CMA CGM’s representative said the carrier looked forward to increasing its use of the Suez Canal. The company said about a quarter of its ships transited the canal in 2024.\nMany carriers, however, have continued to take a wait-and-see attitude toward a return to Suez routes. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc last week, during the earnings report, projected the disruptions would continue for most of the year and said it would be “irresponsible” to rush back on to Suez routes. In addition to safety concerns, he cited the difficulties in adjusting the operations to the routes.\nThe Suez Canal Authority, however, is telling the industry it is ready and working to consolidate efforts and unite endeavors to ensure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea."

        "content": "\nAuthorities in Denmark have signed off on the world's first test program for \"remote pilotage\" - a high-tech method of remotely guiding ships without putting a pilot aboard.\nThe concept of remote guidance for vessels is not itself new. VTS operators remotely monitor traffic in congested waters and can send navigational safety advice to individual ships. But pilotage has always been an in-person task - until now.\nWorking with DanPilot, Danelec has developed a system that takes advanced data from the ship and enables pilots to provide guidance remotely. The advantages include improved pilot safety - no more pilot ladder and pilot launch - and less fuel consumption for ships. According to the partners, the new approach does not compromise on navigational safety when compared to in-person pilotage.\n“Remote pilotage makes our work safer and helps reduce both CO? emissions and operational costs for our customers. We have worked intensively towards this for six years, and now we can finally test it in practice. It has the potential to become a major paradigm shift in how pilotage is carried out,” says Erik Merkes Nielsen, CEO of DanPilot.\nFor now, the initiative is a limited test program run with the approval of the Danish Emergency Management Agency, and will be restricted to the Kattegat and the western Baltic - and only on transits that do not require compulsory pilotage. Pilots based at a control center in Randers, Denmark will operate the system for the next 18 months and will make about 50 transits over the period. If it works as designed, it could be rolled out further, within Denmark and abroad.\n\"Remote pilotage is not only a technological breakthrough – it is a strategic step towards safer and more sustainable shipping,\" said Danelec CEO Casper Jensen. \"Here, cybersecurity – a cornerstone of our technology – is a prerequisite for implementing the solution safely and at scale in the global maritime sector.\""

        "content": "Leaders from across the European Union reported that an agreement has been reached on the 17th round of sanctions on Russia and those who support the war effort in Ukraine. They took to the airways and social media to herald the agreement ahead of the proposed peace talks in Turkey on Thursday, May 15, while also threatening to increase the pressure on Russia if the talks do not proceed and the 30-day ceasefire does not come about.\n“I welcome the agreement on our 17th sanctions package against Russia,” wrote Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU Commission, on social media. “This war has to end. We will keep the pressure high on the Kremlin.”\nThe posting highlighted that the package would encompass an additional 189 shadow fleet tankers (France’s Foreign Minister said it is 193 tankers) as well as “further restricting access to battlefield technology.”\nThe package dramatically expands the number of tankers from the 73 that the EU had listed as of February. It also follows the UK, which last week also rolled out what it called itslargest sanction packagewith 100 tankers, bringing its total to over 230 listed vessels. Earlier reports had said the EU was targeting 100 tankers.\nThe full details of the new sanctions have not been released pending the official approval which is expected to come on Tuesday, May 20, when the defense foreign ministers convene. France 24 is reporting that the package also targets companies in Vietnam, Serbia, and Turkey that are reported to be supplying materials to Russia, as well as sanctions on Russian individuals linked to cyber attacks. Other elements reported by Reuters include 30 companies and 75 individuals linked to the Russian military and a specific element to sanction efforts that were linked to damaging subsea cables and other critical infrastructure.\nOfficials, however, are saying the package was “relatively limited” compared to previous packages, reports France 24, as they are finding it more difficult to agree on the targets.\nFrance’s Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Noël Barrot linked the latest package to Putin's refusal for a ceasefire. During an interview, he predicted the EU would have to go further, saying that it may require “devastating sanctions that could suffocate once and for all Russia’s economy.”\n“If Putin continues to dodge the planned peace talks in Turkey, we will turn up the volume again,” wrote Barrot on social media.\nS&P Global, however, last week highlighted that with oil having slipped below the $60 price cap, exports were coming from Russia on EU-linked tankers. In areportit wrote, that those tankers were carrying more of the oil exports than the shadow fleet. The EU, however, has also outlined its plans to end Russian energy imports setting 2027 as a key target and completing the phase out of gas imports by 2030."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has released a final report on the double near-grounding of a bulker near Sydney in 2022, and it roundly criticized emergency-management officials for a series of delays in dispatching a full-size response tug. With just three harbor tugs dispatched to help, all too small to be of assistance, it was up to the vessel's crew to save their own ship - and the absence of an oceangoing tug prolonged the risk, according to ATSB.\nOn July 3, 2022, the bulkerPortland Baywas moored at Port Kembla, New South Wales. A storm approached, and the master and harbormaster decided it would be safer for the bulker to weather out the conditions at sea.Portland Baygot under way and steamed to an area about 12-15 nautical miles off the coast, where she maneuvered at a slow bell or drifted with the engine off, rolling heavily in gale-force winds and heavy swell. Significant wave heights of about 15 feet were recorded at a nearby metocean buoy.\nAt about 0500 hours on the morning of July 4, an auxiliary blower onPortland Bay'smain engine broke down. This limited speed to dead slow ahead and effectively left the ship disabled, beam to the seas and drifting towards shore at 2-3 knots. For the next two hours, the crew attempted to make emergency repairs to the main engine, but were not successful.\nTwo hours later, at 0656, the chief mate made a call on VHF and informed the Port Kembla VTS center that the main engine had failed, and he requested tug assistance. The VTS center passed this information on to the ship's agent and notified the Port Authority of New South Wales of the ship's situation.\nAt this point,Portland Baywas just six miles off the coast and drifting at more than four knots towards shore. At this speed, the master noted, the ship would be on the rocks within an hour and a half.\nAt 0725, half an hour after the first distress call, the Sydney VTS center - which had overheard the radio traffic - made the first move to provide towage. After a few calls, local operator Engage Towage began preparing small harbor tugSL Diamantinato respond to the scene. Svitzer also began to mobilize the harbor tugBullaraout of Sydney. Neither vessel was designed for open-ocean towage in gale-force conditions.\n\nPortland Bay's AIS trackline on July 4, 2022 (ATSB)\nAs thePortland Baydrifted closer to shore, shallower water created an opportunity for emergency anchoring. At 0901-0915, the ship's crew let go both anchors, then stopped the engine. The anchors held in 150 feet of water, about one mile off the shore. However, the ship's ground tackle was not designed for gale-force conditions, and thePortland Baycontinued to drag slowly eastward.\nAt about 1010,SL Diamantinaarrived, and thePortland Bay'smaster asked it to push on the starboard side to reduce tension on the anchor cables. In heavy swells, the smallDiamantinahitPortland Bay'shull repeatedly, and the operation was discontinued to avoid serious damage. Instead, at 1040, the tug began a series of attempts to rig a tow using the ship's mooring lines (wire ropes). The mooring wires were connected to the tug's synthetic tow line three times, but parted every time in the heavy seas - first at 1158, then again at 1230, then again at 1304. Two other small harbor tugs -SL MartiniqueandBullara- soon arrived on scene and rigged their own towlines to the ship's bow, allowingSL Diamantinato step back.\nPortland Baywas still dragging slowly towards shore and was now just seven cables off the beach. The engineering crew was working as fast as possible to rig a repair to the blower system and get the main engine back online. These repairs appeared successful at last, and at 1430, the operator advised that the vessel was ready to make half ahead.\nAt 1538, with propulsion restored and two tugs connected,Portland Bayweighed anchor and got under way with engine ahead slow. But just nine minutes later, the engine had to be shut down again because of high temperatures and scavenge space fires, leaving the ship wholly reliant on the two tugs pulling on the bow.\nBullara'stowline failed at 1835, andSL Martiniquewas not able to continue the tow on its own. For the second time in a day,Portland Bay'smaster deployed anchors to avert a grounding.\nThroughout these evolutions, emergency response tugSvitzer Glenrockremained at berth at the port of Newcastle, 90 miles away. In part because of communication issues, this larger and more capable tug was not ordered to deploy until about 2000 - fifteen hours after the beginning of the emergency - and theGlenrock'screw did not get under way from the pier until 2230.\nSvitzer Glenrockbattled 25-foot seas and 40-knot waves on the way south, and at times the tug could only make a speed over ground of five knots. It finally arrived on scene at about 1300 hours on July 5, and the crew connected to the towline at 1515. Assisted by multiple harbor tugs,Svitzer Glenrockgot under way withPortland Bayin tow on the morning of July 6, arriving in the harbor at Port Botany that afternoon.\n\nPortland Bay arrives at Port Botany, July 6, 2022 (AMSA)\nBased on an after-accident inspection, ATSB found thatPortland Bay'sengine was operating with a leaky fuel injector, excessive cylinder lubrication and excess fuel injection, creating a buildup of sludge and deposits. In the heavy swells on July 3-4, engine load and RPM fluctuated widely, leading to turbocharger surge. One bent scavenge air non-return flap for the turbocharger caused reduced airflow. All this led to poor combustion, deposit accumulation and blowby, progressively degrading engine performance - and when the number two auxiliary blower went out, the engine no longer had enough airflow to make full speed. (An imbalanced impeller and worn bearing housings from a previous repair may have also contributed to the blower's failure.)\n\nDamage and deposit accumulation in Portland Bay's main engine (ATSB)\nIn ATSB's final report, the crew and operator came in for criticism for the two-hour delay between the time that the vessel lost propulsion and the time that the first call for help went out. ATSB also found fault with local and national authorities for their response. There were several hours of initial confusion over management until the Port Authority of New South Wales assumed control at 1020 hours on July 4. At that point, the vessel had already anchored.\nATSB took particular issue with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) for not activating the region's designated emergency response tug -Svitzer Glenrock- until 15 hours after the incident began. Even if theGlenrockwas based too far away to help immediately on the morning of the 4th, the delay in mobilizing the tug prolonged the emergency; it was the only asset in the region that was rated for the task and should have been activated right away, ATSB said.\n\"Whilst the first responding tugs received a lot of praise for their actions in what were really challenging conditions, ultimately the three tugs that were dispatched were harbor tugs,\" said ATSB chief commissioner Angus Mitchell. \"They were ill-equipped and not capable of the task at hand - nor were they ever going to be, based on what their known characteristics and capacities were. It was only the emergency deployment of the ship's anchors on two separate occasions that prevented the ship from stranding.\"\n"

He lost his life as the team was working to remove part ofBayesian'sboom or a part of its gigantic aluminum single-masted rig, at one time the tallest mast of its kind in the world. Local media report that he was killed by an explosion while using an underwater oxy-hydrogen cutting torch.\nDutch marine news outlet Schuttevaer reports that Huijben was working on removingBayesian'sboom. The team initially attempted to unbolt it, according to the outlet, but when this failed they opted to burn through it. It is believed that an explosion - possibly from hydrogen bubbles - caused a piece of metal to break loose and hit Huijben.\nAccording to commercial diving historianFrancis Hermans, the risk of igniting unburned hydrogen gas from an oxy-hydrogen torch has been known since at least World War II, when U.S. Navy salvage divers found that there could be difficulties with highly explosive gas accumulation in enclosed compartments when working inside of wrecks. This was reportedly among the reasons that Navy operators turned to the oxy-electric arc torch, which requires only oxygen in its gas supply and introduces no flammable gas into the working environment. Most commercial salvors followed suit in the following decades, according to Hermans.\nBayesian(ex nameSalute) was a 180-foot aluminum-hulled sailing yacht built in 2008.Bayesian'ssinking made headlines around the world, both for the unusual nature of the casualty and the high profile of the owner, British tech tycoon Mike Lynch. The ultra-modern megayacht departed Italy on August 14, 2024 with a premier guest list, including Lynch. The vessel went down five days later in a sudden squall while anchored off Sicily, killing Lynch, his teenage daughter, the chairman of Morgan Stanley International, Lynch’s U.S. lawyer, and others. Seven of the 22 people aboard died, while 15 were able to make it into a lifeboat and survived.\nA criminal investigation focused on the actions of the crew is currently under way, led by local prosecutors. Some marine engineers and naval architects have alsoraised questionsabout design factors that may have contributed to the outcome, including the tall mast and the location of downflooding points. TheBayesian'sbuilder has vigorously defended the safety of the vessel's design.\nA much-anticipated technical report on the sinking of theBayesianis due out from the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch this week, and will reveal more evidence. The full completion of the parallel Italian investigation will have to wait until the wreck is hoisted back to the surface for inspection."

Transnet has offered a raise of six percent per year for the next three years, but UNTU is seeking a raise of 10 percent in the first year.\nOn Wednesday, the union's membership voted overwhelmingly in favor of a strike if last-minute arbitrated talks do not succeed. The negotiations run through Thursday, at which point the UNTU could stage a walkout and paralyze the nation's main seaports.\nIt would be the latest in a long series of setbacks for Transnet. The state-owned company ranks among the world's least efficient port operators, and it is heavily burdened by debt. Theft, aging equipment, and alleged graft have hampered its operations for years. Its freight rail division - critical for parts of South Africa's mining sector - have underperformed for nearly a decade, crimping economic growth. Between 2017-2023, Transnet's coal-by-rail freight volume to the Richards Bay coal terminal plummeted by nearly 40 percent.\nTransnet obtained a $1 billion loan from the African Development Bank last year to support a business renewal plan, and it is recapitalizing some of its equipment. The list of investments includes seven new tugs for the ports of Durban, Cape Town, and Richards Bay.\nUNTU is the largest of several unions at Transnet.

        "content": "\nDespite the continued attacks by Russian forces, grain exports from the three ports in the Greater Odesa region have now exceeded pre-war levels, report Ukrainian officials. They stated that volumes have continued to grow steadily and are providing a critical portion of the country’s economy.\nOleh Kiper, head of the Odesa Regional Military Administration highlighted that since August 2024 more than 5,000 ships have used the maritime corridor to reach the ports of Odesa. He announced that revenues from the ports are making up 60 percent of the overall maritime-related economy for the country. He said this is despite continued attacks on the port infrastructure.\n“Even though we’re working ‘on the fly,’ we’ve increased our volumes – even in grain – to levels higher than before the full-scale invasion began,” said Kiper, according to a report from The Odesa Journal. “We are economically supporting the entire country today.”\nThe Odesa ports processed 120 million tons of cargo, including 76 million tons of agricultural products, using the maritime corridor. In 2025, it is reported to be over 28 million tons of cargo, including 15 million tons of grain. The other large export is metal products.\nThe maritime corridor they said is critical to exports because it keeps costs lower than the overland alternatives. This is especially important for markets in North Africa and Southeast Asia, the officials noted.\nKiper admitted that due to the attacks, the ports are not operating as efficiently as they did in the past. He said instead of loading a ship in 24 hours, it sometimes takes 48 to 72 hours. In some instances, he says, people are physically carrying products themselves to load the ships.\nThey said in 2024 alone the Odesa region had over 800 declared air alerts due to drone or missile attacks. Port operations were interrupted for more than 32 days, but they were still able to ship exports to 53 countries.\nThe growth in vessel traffic was steady during the first quarter of 2025, with a total of 659 port stops in the three commercial ports in Greater Odesa. They handled 204 vessels in January, 213 in February, and 242 in March. This was despite 35 missile and drone attacks on the ports, which included damage to the containershipMSC Levante Fand the bulkerSuper Sarkas.\nUkrainian officials said the success of the Black Sea corridor has contributed to an economic stabilization for the country despite the prolonged war. In March, the U.S. and Russia said they had reached terms for an agreement to stop the Black Sea attacks, but so far U.S. efforts to achieve a ceasefire have failed. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected the latest call for a ceasefire but proposed peace talks, which are scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday, May 15, in Istanbul."

        "content": "The first European-designed and built carrier for liquified CO2 to be used in a carbon capture and storage operation was launched on May 14 in the Netherlands. The vessel is being called a breakthrough designed to support a commercial-scale CCS project for the EU.\nThe launch took place at the Royal Niestern Sander shipyard. TheCarbon Destroy 1will have a capacity to transport approximately 5,000 tons of liquified CO2 as part of the Greensand Future project. The vessel will operate between the Port of Esbjerg in Denmark and the Nini West offshore platform, a depleted oil field in the Danish North Sea. The project, which is being led by INEOS, in March 2023, became the first to transport CO2 across international borders and completed a pilot injection of the CO2 beneath the seabed in the depleted field.\n\n\n\nCarbon Destroyer 1is based on Royal Wagenborg’s EasyMax shortsea bulker design and has been especially adapted for the handling of CO2 under pressure and at low temperature. The concept for the bulker class is a multi-purpose vessel with a cargo capacity of 14,000 tons, which was jointly developed by Royal Wagenborg and Royal Niestern Sander to produce a vessel requiring lower power output and achieving greater efficiency. The class is based on a design length of 492 feet (149.95 meters), a beam of 52 feet (15.9 meters), and a draught of 28 feet (8.6 meters), which also provided an enlarged cargo capacity.\nMads Weng Gade, CEO of INEOS Energy Europe, highlighted that “Carbon Destroyer 1will transport captured CO2 from across Europe, creating a virtual pipeline between the point of capture and permanent storage deep beneath the seabed of the North Sea.”\nWork has begun on a CO2 terminal to be located in the Port of Esbjerg, in the southwest of Denmark on the North Sea. The initial plan calls for captured CO2 from Denmark’s biogas plants to be delivered by truck to the terminal, where it will be stored and then transferred to the vessel.\n\n\nCarbon Destroyer 1 ready to launch (Greensand Future)\n\nThe vessel is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025 or early 2026, with its delivery coordinated to the projected start date for commercial operations for Greensand. The project calls for storing CO2 over 1,800 meters beneath the seabed. Initially, Greensand aims to capture, transport, and store 400,000 tons of CO2 per year. It has the potential to gradually increase its storage capacity by 2030. The project, which is a partnership between INEOS Energy Denmark, Harbour Energy, and Nordsøfonden, which is the Danish state’s subsurface company, reports that there is potential for permanent storage of up to 8 million tons of CO? annually.\nCarbon Destroyer 1is larger than the two South Korean-built vessels that were delivered at the end of 2024 for Norway’s Northern Lights CCS project. Those vessels each have a capacity to transport 7,500 cbm of LCO2. They have completed certification and as of last week, Norway’s Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Climate and Environment, the Norwegian Environmental Agency (NEA) and Norwegian Ocean Industry Authority (Havtil), have all given their consents for the first phase of Northern Lights. It now has all the required permits to begin injecting CO2 at its site in the North Sea off the Norwegian coast."

        "content": "Estonia’s efforts to inspect a shadow fleet tanker bound for Russia on Tuesday, May 13, caused an international incident involving the forces of Estonia, a Russian response, and NATO monitoring as it took place. Estonia today filed a diplomatic complaint with Russia, accusing one of its fighter jets of briefly violating Estonian airspace, as the Estonian Foreign Minister said the incident was “not acceptable in any way.”\nEstonia has asserted its right to inspect tankers transiting the Baltic under the international laws for maritime protection, which was also backed up by a European Commission decision requiring tankers to provide proof of insurance when transiting European waters. Last month, Estonia briefly held a tanker which it asserted was operating with a false registry and from the reports yesterday the Estonian Navy again attempted to inspect another suspicious tanker.\nThe crude oil tanker identifying asJaguar(105,000 dwt) registered in Gabon was inbound for Primorsk, Russia when the Estonian Navy contacted the vessel. The Equasis database reflects the same vessel as theArgent, registered in Guinea-Bissau with unknown managers and a registered owner in Mauritius. The vessel was listed last week by the UK in its sanctions which cited the tanker for transporting Russian oil. Reports indicate the vessel is affiliated with India’s Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the shadow fleet and a key player in the Russian oil trade.\nOn the video of the incident, the Estonian Navy can be heard telling the tanker its “request” was denied, and it should change course. (Unclear what the request was.) Reports indicate the tanker ignored the instructions, and it is unclear if it provided any documentation to prove identity and its valid insurance.\n\nThe Estonian Navy tried to intercept the JAGUAR tanker flying the flag of Gabon in the international waters of the Gulf of Finland, on the beam of Tallinn. The ship was bound for the Russian port of Primorsk.pic.twitter.com/Dqql92lx1p\n\nAs the incident unfolded, an Estonian Army helicopter and Skytruck (a prop-driven, Polish-built light utility aircraft used for surveillance) responded and were circling overhead. It is at that point that a Russian SU-35 fighter entered Estonian airspace overflying the area. The plane was reported to be in Estonian airspace for less than one minute, but the media is saying its transponder was turned off and it was not in radio contact with Estonian air traffic control. It had not filed a flight plan.\nEstonia does not have fighter jets and as such NATO provides air surveillance capabilities. In this case, it was the Portuguese Air Force, which has F-16 fighter jets at the Estonian military base in Amari, which responded and also circled the unfolding incident.\nEstonia’s Defense Minister told the media today that it had questions over the flag state of the tanker but ultimately decided “intervention was not worth” the situation in this case. The media is saying the Estonian Navy escorted the ship out of domestic waters, and the tanker continued to the Russian port.\nThe Foreign Ministry in Tallinn, Estonia, however, summoned the charge d’affaires of the Russian embassy today. The Estonians filed a protest and delivered a note protesting the violation of Estonia’s airspace. It was reportedly the first time in 2025 that Russia violated Estonia’s airspace. Margus Tsahkna, Minister of Foreign Affairs for Estonia, called it a “very serious and regrettable incident, which is completely unacceptable.”\nIt came as the EU today announced that an agreement has been reached for a new wave of sanctions, including nearly 200 more shadow tankers. Estonia and Finland have increased their monitoring after the damage to undersea infrastructure running between the countries."

        "content": "\nThe first vessel of the new segment of methanol-fueled bulkers was officially delivered in Japan on May 13. Owned by Kambara Kisen and operating under charter to NYK Bulk & Projects Carriers, the vessel was given the fitting name ofGreen Future.\nThe vessel was built by Japan’s Tsuneishi and is based on the yard’s successful Aeroline Ultramax dry bulk carrier design. The yard highlights that it adapted the design to add the large methanol fuel tank while maintaining the cargo capacity of the class. Methanol has a lower power density, requiring larger fuel tanks, and as a dual-fuel vessel, it will also have traditional fuel tanks.\n\n\nTsuneishi adapted its successful Ultramax design for the new fuel capability\n\nThe vessel is approximately 65,700 dwt. It maintains the standard Ultramax dimensions with a length overall of 656 feet (199 meters) and a Panamax beam. By maintaining the industry standard, Tsuneishi highlights that the ship maintains maximum versatility for its operations.\nBy using methanol, the vessel will be able to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by up to 80 percent, sulfur oxides (SOx) by up to 99 percent, and carbon dioxide (CO2) by up to 10 percent compared to using conventional heavy fuel oil. It is also prepared to use green methanol (either bio-methanol or e-methanol) when it becomes available on a commercial scale.\n\n\nThe new builker was built in Japan and floated out in November 2024\n\nThe vessel was launched on November 22, 2024, at the shipyard in Fukuyama. It is registered in Liberia.\nIt is the first adaptation of the technology to this segment of the shipping market as methanol capabilities so far are mostly limited to containerships and product tankers. DNV, however, calculates on its Alternative Fuels Insight Platform that a total of 53 methanol-dual fuel bulkers are currently on order out of a total of 369 methanol-fueled vessels on order due for delivery by 2030."

Port officials are confirming that the port was placed on a security alert after a tanker arrived with a Pakistani crew.\n\"The state government has been notified about the presence of Pakistani nationals, and the vessel will remain under constant surveillance throughout its stay at Paradip,\" said the local superintendent of police, reports the Times of India.\nThe situation began Wednesday morning, May 14, when the Hong Kong-registered crude oil tankerSiren II(298,078 dwt) arrived at the Paradip anchorage. The vessel, which is managed out of the UAE, is reported to have a crew of 25 aboard, mostly made up of Pakistanis as well as two Indians and one from Thailand.\nThe vessel is loaded with 196,580 metric tons of crude to be delivered to the Indian Oil Company’s refinery in Paradip. The vessel had previously made port stops according to the reports in South Korea and Singapore, and after reaching India was moored at one of the floating buoys approximately 12 miles offshore to begin its unloading process.\nAccording to the media reports, the security measures were intensified in the port when the authorities determined that most of the crew was from Pakistan. The agencies are reported to have conducted a thorough search of the vessel and conducted a verification of the crewmembers’ documents.\nThe two Indian crewmembers were reportedly permitted to go ashore, but the authorities ordered all 21 of the Pakistanis to remain on the tanker for the duration of the port stay. The port will remain on “high alert” till the vessel departs.\nThis comes as the uneasy standoff continues between the two countries after a week of escalating fighting. The countries agreed to stop their attacks on Saturday, May 10, but there have continued to be reports of skirmishes. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the country for the first time earlier in the week saying that India was fully prepared to respond with force if there were any further terrorist attacks.\nPakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif continues to insist that his country has acted responsibly. They deny involvement in the attack that killed 26 people in Kashmir on April 22.\nBoth countries declared a military victory when the ceasefire went into effect last week. Tensions, however, remain high demonstrated by the current situation with the crew aboard the tanker."

It would represent a nearly 10 percent increase in the land area for the port which is reported to be the largest multi-modal port in the South East.\nInitial concepts for the port expansion were filed with the local government, Thurrock Council, and released to the public highlighting the opportunity to create jobs and support trade in the Greater London and South East region. The port, which is one of the most historic in the UK, reports that it handles more than 16 million tons of cargo annually valued at more than £8.7 billion ($11.5 billion). The port supports Ro-Ro, container, forest products, grain, and bulk cargoes, as well as cruises.\n“This is an exciting time for the Port of Tilbury as we submit our plans for Tilbury3, which form part of our growth investment strategy to expand our operations in support of our customers’ growth markets in renewable power, recycling, and logistics,” said Stuart Wallace, CEO of Forth Ports Group.\nThe plan calls for developing a 100-acre brownfield site located to the east of the current port and adjacent to the 2020 addition known as T2. The section of the brownfield land is part of the old Tilbury Power Station and would be rehabilitated to accommodate a range of activities, including general industrial storage, warehousing and processing, a construction material and aggregate terminal, container handling and storage, and vehicle storage. It would be an addition to the Thames Freeport benefiting from tax site incentives to bring investment, trade, and jobs to the area.\nThe previous extension of the port, T2, obtained approval in February 2019 to build a new terminal. It was built on a 152-acre site, which was also part of the former power station.  T2 was designed as a satellite to the main port and supporting a Ro-Ro ferry terminal and a construction and aggregate terminal, and supported by new rail and road connections. T3 being adjacent would be able to take advantage of the infrastructure built for T2, which began opened in 2020.\nThe Port of Tilbury would develop detailed planning after gaining initial approvals from Thurrock Council. Port officials said the plan calls for a phased expansion. Work would begin in 2026 with a target of being fully operational by 2030."

        "content": "\nPennsylvania, located in the northeast United States, is extending a novel incentive program it operates rewarding carriers for each container they land in the state’s ports. According to state officials, the decade-old program supports tens of thousands of jobs and spurs economic growth.\nThe program began in 2015 and state officials report is a tool to compete with other East Coast ports in attracting new ocean carriers and new trade lanes to Pennsylvania. Due to end in June 2025, the state has decided to extend the program for two years, incentivizing shippers to move cargo through Pennsylvania ports.\n“Pennsylvania’s ports are critical to our transportation network and to our economy, and growth at the ports means growth in the Commonwealth,” said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll.\nThe program provides up to $1 million annually to participating ocean carriers. Since it was established in 2015, participants have sent over 3 million units of cargo through Pennsylvania ports, resulting in over $7 million in incentive funds awarded to nine ocean carriers.\nThe incentive is available for new service at a Pennsylvania port as well as for existing carriers. New carriers enrolled in the program receive $25 per new container unit loaded or discharged from vessels to a Pennsylvania port. Existing participants qualify for the incentive payment by exceeding established benchmarks, which the officials said helps retain business with an opportunity for rewarding growth.\nThe program also includes incentives for ocean carriers adding a new service line from Southeast or Far East Asia. Carriers would, for two fiscal years, earn $25 per container unit loaded or discharged if the container is coming from the Southeast and Far East Asia. Instead of the usual incentive cap of $250,000 per fiscal year for standard carriers, Asian carriers qualify for an increased cap of $500,000 per fiscal year.\nThe incentives aim to bolster the appeal of Pennsylvania ports in the global supply chain. Officials report that in 2024, PhilaPort, which owns terminals in the Port of Philadelphia and along the Delaware River, handled over 840,000 containers, while PSA Penn Terminals handled 357,000 containers. PhilaPort last year released an ambitious plan to revitalize the Philadelphia port as part of a program to grow cargo operations, and which will see the first cruise ship in decades to be homeported in Philadelphia starting in 2026."

The contracts, which are reportedly valued at more than £1 billion ($1.33 billion), had become a point of contention between Serco and its two unions leading to a possiblestrikeearlier this year.\nSerco reports it has been a key partner to the Royal Navy for nearly 30 years, providing critical services supporting military training exercises, trialing new maritime technology, and assisting the movements of Royal Navy ships in and out of harbor. Serco became the service provider in 2008 for the Royal Navy bases in Devonport, Portsmouth, Faslane, Great Harbour Greenock, and Kyle of Lochalsh, as part of the government’s move to privatize the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service.\nThe company reports it has been awarded three contracts for a range of services for the Royal Navy. The contracts, which replace existing services and expand into new capabilities, will commence later this year.\nThe unions Unite and Promise became concerned this year as the renewal process began for the contracts with the unions protesting the lack of consultation with Serco as the renewal process proceeded. The unions contended that the government was seeking to reduce the value of the contracts, which they asserted could translate into the loss of jobs for members. The unions announced they would strike in March 2024 but laterpostponedthe walkout when they said an agreement had been reached for a consultation process. The Royal Navy said it was a dispute between the employer and the union and would not impact its operations.\n\"We have been performing these duties to an extremely high standard for the last 28 years,” said  Anthony Kirby, Serco Group Chief Executive. “We now have the opportunity to modernize the fleet of support vessels to ensure that the Navy has the support it requires, day in, day out, to enable it to keep our waters safe.\"\nThe largest of the three contracts, valued at approximately £850 million ($1.1 billion) over ten years is for the delivery of in-port services for the Royal Navy’s bases at Devonport in Plymouth, Portsmouth, and for the Clyde, including Faslane. Services will include vessel towage, passenger transfer, and barge and tank cleaning services at Portsmouth and Devonport.\nAs part of the port services contract, Serco has agreed to obtain 24 new vessels on behalf of the Royal Navy. They will be brought into service over the next decade to modernize the fleet and replace the older vessels currently operated.\nA second contract is valued at approximately £110 million ($146 million) for the provision of offshore support to military training and exercises. This includes two specialist ocean-going vessels for regional and worldwide support.\nThe company will also provide inshore support to military training and exercises at the British Underwater Test and Evaluation (BUTEC), an underwater military test and evaluation range off the northwest coast of Scotland, and for Diver Training Support. This is in a third contract valued at £70 million ($93 million) over five years and also includes new work for Range Safety and Aircrew Training, which we will deliver in partnership with Briggs Marine.\nThe unions have not commented on the finalization of the renewal of the contracts."

Few details were provided but reports said it prompted a “pollution response procedure” to contain the spill.\nThe East Suffolk Council, the local government authority, posted alerts saying that it was working with partners in response to a “suspected deposit of soot into the water at the Port of Felixstowe.” Other reports warned that the shoot was also airborne and being carried by the wind. It was unclear which vessel might have been involved and if its was a release of scrubber washing from an emissions filtration system or from elsewhere o the vessel.\nResidents and the public were being warned to stay away from any soot. However, they were told if they came in contact with the soot on their skin or clothing, they should “remove all contaminated clothing and wash the skin, using soap and water, for 10 minutes.”\nThe East Suffolk Council later said that there was no evidence of pollution having reached the shoreline at Felixstowe. “Due to the direction of the wind, some sooty residues were reported on parked vehicles in Harwich. We can now confirm that any pollution of water should disperse naturally,” the Council advised.\nWhile the local government declared the incident closed, officials said there would be an investigation into the source of the pollution and a review of the response.\nLocated on the southeast coast of England, Felixstowe is the largest container port in the UK, handling nearly half the country’s container volumes. It also handles RoRo and break bulk cargo."

        "content": "The extended Red Sea campaign against Yemen's Houthi rebels exposed gaps in the U.S. Navy's supply chain for precision weapons, the service's top officer told a House committee on Wednesday. U.S. Navy warships launched hundreds of high-end air defense missiles at inbound Houthi threats over the past year, and the service has deployed an unpublicized number of Tomahawk cruise missiles and other land-attack munitions during counterattacks. During the Trump administration's intensified strike campaign - March 15 through May 6 - the U.S. expended at least $1 billion worth of weaponry in 1,100 airstrikes.\nThose strikes have created a dent in the U.S. Navy's weapons inventory that the defense industrial base will struggle to ramp up to refill, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby said earlier this week.\n“Precision-guided, long-range munitions like Tomahawk, Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, the heavyweight torpedo, all those ammunitions we need to increase production on,” he told the House Appropriations Committee, per Military Times. “But I’m also of the mind that we need to look at other vendors. They may not be able to produce the same exact specifications, but they might be able to produce a missile that’s effective, which is more effective than no missile.”\nAt top of mind is the need to deter China, the U.S. Navy's primary strategic competitor. According to the New York Times, the burn rate on Navy weapons stocks - and the vulnerability that this created in the event of a Pacific conflict - was one of the many factors behind the White House's decision to cease hostilities with the Houthis.\n“If we go to war with China, it’s going to be bloody and there’s going to be casualties and it’s going to take plenty of munitions. So our stocks need to be full,\" Kilby told the committee.\nThe White House's Red Sea strike campaign was designed to last 8-10 months,accordingto the Times; it was called off with a truce after less than two, even though the Houthis continued to launch attacks on Israel. The reasons for the shortened campaign went beyond missile inventories.\nThe Houthis turned out to be difficult to combat. During the operation, Houthi attacks forced the carrier USSHarry S. Trumanto take sudden evasive action at least once, resulting in the loss of an F/A-18 fighter over the side. In action over Yemen, high-tech U.S. forces never established full command of the airspace: The Houthis' rudimentaryair defense systemstook down about half a dozen MQ-9 Reaper drones, nearly hit several F-16 fighters, and forced one advanced F-35 stealth strike fighter to make evasive maneuvers. And even after weeks of U.S. airstrikes, the group retained some residual ability to carry out long-range ballistic missile attacks.\n\"They [the Houthis] took tremendous punishment. And, you know, you could say there's a lot of bravery there, that it was amazing what they took,\" said President Donald Trump, discussing the ceasefire last week.\nRecent evidence suggests that the group is rearming and rebuilding, and it continues to launch ballistic missiles at targets in Israel, including three attempted attacks reported earlier this week. Even attacks on shipping still appear to be on the table: In a statement Thursday, Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said that until Israel ends its operation in Gaza, the group will keep up a \"maritime navigation ban in the Red and Arabian Seas.\""

        "content": "\nChina's \"invasion barges\" may be even more capable than previously assumed, according to a new analysis published by the Wall Street Journal.\nIn January, multiple analysts (including H.I. Sutton) noticed a \"matching set\" of three unique vessels at Guangzhou Shipyard - all barges, all oddly equipped, and each one larger than the next. All three had jackup legs, a central open deck, and a giant hinged bridge section attached to the bow - long enough to span 400 feet when lowered. These vessels were quickly identified as amphibious logistics enablers, designed to bridge the surf zone and transfer high volumes of military cargo after a beachhead is secured.\nThe three barges were later spotted in a beach logistics exercise in Zhanjiang, China, and were photographed by satellite and by local bystanders. Social media images showed all three barges interconnected by their respective bridges, deployed in order of water depth capability - the smallest barge closest to shore, then the medium barge, then the largest barge with the longest jackup legs furthest out to sea. Linked together, they spanned a distance of more than 2,000 feet out into the water. All three were jacked up well above the waves, and appeared to be less affected by surface conditions than the fragile U.S. Navy/Army JLOTS system.\nIn a video review for the Wall Street Journal, former U.S. Navy officer and defense analyst Tom Shugart explained that the barges are even more concerning than they initially appear. A close inspection of their configuration - and of the activity conducted during the first exercise - suggests that they are designed to directly interface with up to five deep sea ro/ro ships at one time. The medium and large barges each have two fold-down platforms, which appear to provide an apron to receive the stern loading ramps of up to four typical ro/ro ferries. A civilian ro/ro ferry was spotted mooring alongside during the trial maneuvers, resting up against Yokohama fenders on the side of the middle barge.\nThe abundant ro/ro ramps are concerning, as China is widely expected to lean on its ro/ro ferry fleet to support an amphibious assault operation. At least one civilian ferry operator in the Gulf of Bohai trains for expeditionary military logistics.\nThe largest barge appears to be specially fitted to receive and offload another kind of ro/ro - the kind with a starboard quarter ramp, which is universally found on PCTCs. During the exercise, a diagonal-ramp ro/ro was indeed imaged alongside. The vast lane-meter capacity of a car carrier would be able to deliver hundreds of military vehicles per trip onto the jackup barge \"pier,\" and all of this equipment could be driven down the line of barges and onto shore.\n\"To be able to deliver vehicles at huge volume straight to the beach - without having to capture a port - changes the calculus of whether China could successfully invade Taiwan,\"  Shugarttold the WSJ. \"This could thin out Taiwan's defenses and make it harder to defend all the places [for an amphibious landing] that now exist.\""

        "content": "Without action to address price inflation, capital cost, and UK supply chain competitiveness, the UK’s offshore energy industry trade association OEUK warns the UK will fail to meet the government’s Clean Power 2030 (CP30) targets. The group is recommending a series of government investments building on the efforts launched by the Labour government since coming to power in 2024 while highlighting that the September wind allocation round (AR7) will have to be the biggest ever if the UK is to stay on course to meet the goals of between 43 and 51 GW of installed offshore wind capacity.\nIn 2024, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) published the Clean Power 2030 (CP30) report, setting out recommendations to the UK government on the design of a clean power grid by 2030. With a goal to accelerate progress to net zero by eliminating emissions that currently come from electricity generation, CP30 also aims to ensure that the heating, transport, and industry sectors are powered by electricity. Further, the association highlights its belief that the UK has the capacity to become a major exporter of wind energy.\nWind power is a key component of the UK’s energy system, its share of the UK’s electricity amounting to 29.5 percent in 2024. Of that, offshore wind contributed 17.2percent of total electricity generation.\n“Meeting the government’s 2030 target of 43 and 51 GW of installed offshore wind capacity means securing £15bn of private investment in offshore wind each and every year between now and 2030,” said Thibaut Cheret, OEUK’s Wind & Renewables Manager. “The government’s next Contract for Difference auction in Allocation Round 7 (AR7), which incentivizes new low-carbon electricity generating projects, will need to secure historic levels of renewable energy procurement.”\nThe group is calling for the government to “front-load” the initiative, starting with efforts to ensure that Allocation Round 7 (AR7) is the most ambitious auction round yet for the UK. The Association asserts that AR7 needs to clear a record 8.4GW of offshore wind capacity to maintain the course toward CP30.\nTo support the build-out of the generation capacity, OEUK highlights that the timely delivery of transmission infrastructure will be essential. They highlight that rebuilding the National Grid electricity transmission grid will be a massive task. They believe a grid investment program of £58 billion ($77 billion) will be required to support 50 GW of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030.\nInterconnectivity it notes will also be required. The group’s report says a North Sea integrated grid could save £37 billion ($49 billion) per year and cut wholesale prices by a fifth, and would avoid system duplication.\nIt is also calling for a further £65 billion ($86.5 billion) to be invested in UK offshore wind over the next five years. OEUK asserts that it has the potential to transform the growth outlook for the UK.\nWhile they believe there should be a focus on homegrown energy, making the most of UK resources, the association, however, also says there will be a continued role for gas-fired power generation to balance the grid. It is calling for the progressive deployment of gas with carbon capture and storage technology, and in due course converting to hydrogen-fueled power generation."

Firefighting efforts continued into Friday morning.\nAt about 1700 hours Thursday, a blaze was reported aboard the bulkerTrade, which was moored alongside at the AST Amsterdam Scrap Terminal in the Vlothavenweg area of the harbor. The city's fire department quickly upgraded it to a major fire incident and dispatched multiple fire engines and response vessels. A specialized marine firefighting unit from Rotterdam was also called up to advise on-scene.\nAt 0600 hours the next morning, the fire was still burning and growing in scope. It had begun in the number three hold, but overnight it had spread to the number four hold as well. First responders began emptying out the contents of the actively-burning number four hold onto the pier, then extinguishing the cargo on land.\nThe same strategy was not possible on the number three hold, fire agency Brandweer reported.

Residents reported a noxious smell along with the visible smoke.\nIn some areas where smoke was observed, residents reported a thin residue of soot on the ground. Local authorities advised that it is easily cleaned off of hard surfaces, but any edible plants or vegetable gardens contaminated with the substance should not be eaten.\nFire risk is a recurring issue with metal scrap cargoes, often because of the presence of discarded lithium-ion batteries. When damaged, Li-ion batteries can burn or explode, sparking a larger fire in combustible contaminants in the cargo."

        "content": "Following the announcement of the 90-day lower of the tariffs between the United States and China, there were multiple reports that shippers were rushing to move goods. While it led to a forecast of a surge in shipments following the recent drought, many across the industry are now questioning if a true surge is building while also noting it is unsustainable without further agreements.\nSpeaking on CNBC yesterday, May 14, the Port of Los Angeles’ Executive Director Gene Seroka pointed to likely “some pent-up demand” as feeding the temporary jump in reported container bookings from China. He notes that there was likely some finished product in warehouses or loaded containers when the 145 percent tariffs began, which has now been released into the system.\nData from container-tracking service provider Vizion highlighted just how quickly shippers move to get those products moving again while taking advantage of a relatively short window provided by the agreement between the United States and China. In the four days from May 9, just before the agreement, to May 13, Vizion’s data showed an 82 percent surge in container bookings from China to the U.S.\nVizion highlighted the surge comparing the China-U.S. bookings to a 29.6 percent week-over-week jump in global TEU volumes for the week of May 5, while noting that it remained down 21 percent year-over-year. U.S. import volumes they reported climbed 40 percent week-over-week in the same period.\nThe momentum has continued to build. Yesterday, May 14, Ben Tracy, Vizion’s VP of Strategic Business Development, wrote in a LinkedIn posting that a rolling seven-day average for bookings TEU between China and the U.S. was up 277 percent on May 13.\nThe CEO of Hapag-Lloyd confirmed the same trend speaking to investors on May 14. He said bookings between China and the U.S. had surged by 50 percent or more, while warning it might not last. “We see a surge that could be very short-lived,” said Rolf Habben Jansen, “but it could also last for 60 or 90 days.” He said it would depend on the outcome of the next phase of the trade talks.\nA manager at China’s Yantian Port, typically the busiest departure point for U.S.-bound cargo, told the Global Times that shipping companies have been inquiring about adjusting berthing schedules. Ships were being rerouted, Lin Risheng told the Chinese newspaper, saying carriers were working to take advantage of the 90-day tariff suspension.\nSpeaking on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street program on Wednesday, Seroka, however, noted the 90-day pause is “not a lot of runway in our business.” He said they had a 30 percent drop last week in expected cargo volumes and are projecting a 25 percent drop for the month of May.\nCarriers have blanked 17 out of 80 scheduled ship calls for May at the Port of Los Angeles. Another 11 of 80 have also been blanked for June. Seroka reports that ports all along the U.S. West Coast are seeing similar impacts from the tariffs.\nFor the Port of Los Angeles, 45 percent of its business is tied to shipments from China. Last week's drop was second only to March 2020 when the Port of Los Angeles saw a 50 percent drop as the COVID-19 pandemic began."

        "content": "\nThe government of India is stepping up deportations of certain ethnic groups, including members of the Rohingya people from Myanmar - and it appears that in an effort to assist the campaign, the Indian Navy may have forced 40 Rohingya immigrants to jump into the sea, according to the UN's human rights office.\nThe Rohingya are among the world's most persecuted peoples, and more than a million fled the Myanmar military's genocidal ethnic cleansing campaign in 2017. Most ended up in Bangladesh, but more than 22,000 have registered as UN-recognized refugees in India.\nThe Indian government takes a different view of their status: it has long treated the Rohingya as a threat to internal security, accusing them of terrorist ties. Legally, India does not have a \"refugee\" category for immigrants, and it is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention. The government considers all Rohingya in India to be illegals, and it periodically conducts limited deportation campaigns.\nIndia's latest push to remove the Rohingya appears to be more vigorous than previous attempts. Himanta Biswa Sarma, a member of the ruling BJP party, recently said that \"pushing back\" immigrants without using the legal system would be the \"new phenomenon\" going forward, and he called extralegal deportations an \"innovation.\"\nRights groups allege that Indian security forces have adopted an elevated level of brutality in recent deportation efforts. The case that is most concerning to the UN started in New Delhi last week. According to local human rights organizations, police detained dozens of Rohingya refugees in the city for processing on May 6. About 40 members of this group were reportedly blindfolded and flown 1,500 miles southeast to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, on the east side of the Bay of Bengal.\nThere, they were transferred to an Indian Navy vessel, which got under way for Myanmar's Tanintharyi region, about 300 nautical miles east on the other side of the Andaman Sea. On arrival at the destination, the Rohingya were given life jackets, forced to enter the water, and ordered to swim for shore on an island in Myanmar, survivors reported.\nThe deportees who were put into the water included teenagers, seniors and cancer patients, according to the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), India's largest rights group.\nAll of the Rohingya survived and made it to shore. Some of the survivors reported beatings and other mistreatment during their time in custody, consistent with other recent reports.\n“The idea that Rohingya refugees have been cast into the sea from naval vessels is nothing short of outrageous. I am seeking further information and testimony regarding these developments and implore the Indian government to provide a full accounting of what happened,” said Tom Andrews, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.\nIt is not the only incident of irregular deportation methods reported by India's neighbors. Last weekend, the Bangladeshi coast guard rescued 78 people who had been deported and abandoned in the Sundarbans, the wide and undeveloped river delta that separates the Bangladeshi and Indian coastlines. The rescuees asserted that they had been detained in Gujarat, flown to the border region by plane, then transported in a motor launch to Mandarbaria, a remote beach near the center of the delta's coast. They were abandoned there on May 9 and were discovered by local foresters on May 10. According to Bangladeshi police, one survivor had a broken arm and others had visible injuries. \"They had gone without food for several days,\" forest conservator Moshiur Rahman told The Business Standard."

        "content": "\nA much-anticipated report on the sinking of the superyachtBayesiansuggests that the vessel's ultra-tall mast may have played a key role in its rapid knockdown and sinking off the coast of Sicily last year. The vessel did not experience flooding until after the force of the wind on the bare mast heeledBayesianover far enough for water to come flooding in over the rail - not through a side door nearer the waterline, a scenario proposed by the vessel's builder.\nIn the early hours of August 19, 2024,Bayesianwas anchored off Porticello, Sicily to wait out windy weather at sea. Its centerboard was raised, sails were all furled, and consumables were low - about 10 percent of maximum.\nWinds at the anchorage began to pick up at 0300. By 0355 the wind had increased to 30 knots, and two minutes later theBayesianbegan dragging anchor. The skipper and chief engineer were awakened, and the crew began starting the engines and preparing to maneuver. At this point,Bayesianwas heeling 10-20 degrees to starboard from the force of the wind.\nAs soon asBayesianwas ready to maneuver, the skipper prepared to turn the vessel into the wind, which would make it less vulnerable to heeling. Moments later, the flying bridge awning tore off from port to starboard - and at 0406,Bayesiansuddenly and violently heeled over to 90 degrees to starboard in less than 15 seconds.\nOne deckhand was thrown over the side in the capsizing, and the skipper and four other people were injured. Four people belowdecks clambered up and out of the interior, and there was a scramble to open windows and doors to get out of the vessel's rapidly-flooding saloon.\nBayesianwas sinking rapidly, and a disorderly abandon-ship occurred as survivors attempted to get off the vessel. At about 0424, the skipper and a deckhand managed to free a liferaft from the port side and helped the survivors to clamber aboard. They watched the vessel slip below a few minutes later, then launched a parachute flare to call for aid. At 0443, they caught the attention of another nearby sailing vessel, which sent over a tender to retrieve the survivors.\nSeven people perished in the sinking, including owner Mike Lynch and his daughter. Several crewmembers face a criminal investigation by local prosecutors, and an attempt is under way to raise the yacht as part of the inquiry.\nAfter the casualty, the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch collected extensive physical and documentary evidence on the characteristics of the yacht and the prevailing conditions on the night of the capsizing.\nMAIB commissioned a team at University of Southampton's Wolfson Unit for Marine Technology to analyze all of the data. Assuming that the vessel was in the configuration in which it arrived in port, the Wolfson Unit found that the angle of vanishing stability for the vessel (zero righting moment) would be about 70 degrees.\nBased on the characteristics of the mast and stability condition of the vessel, the Wolfson Unit study found that if the wind was blowing directly ontoBayesian’sbeam, a gusting wind speed in excess of 63 knots would likely cause the yacht to heel beyond the point of vanishing stability, causing a knockdown and capsizing. Even at an apparent wind angle 40 degrees abaft the bow, a gusting wind speed of 73 knots would be enough to cause a capsizing.\nThe unit calculated that the bare mast - a record-holder for the tallest aluminum mast in the world - accounted for about 50 percent of the total wind heeling moment on the vessel.\nMet Office simulations of the weather conditions confirmed that a mesocyclonic supercell likely passed over the harbor that morning, with possible surface wind speeds in excess of 87 knots.\n\"The safety investigation has established that, in the assumed loss condition, onceBayesianheeled over to an angle greater than 70.6° (the angle of vanishing stability) there was no chance of a return to an even keel,\" MAIB concluded. \"The investigation has also established that, in the assumed loss condition, wind speeds in excess of 63.4kts on the beam were sufficient to knockBayesianover . . . These vulnerabilities (when in the motoring condition with sails lowered, the centreboard raised and 10% consumables on board) were not identified in the stability information book carried on board. Consequently, these vulnerabilities were also unknown to either the owner or the crew ofBayesian.\""

        "content": "\nEmden Werft and Dock, which has been a provider of repair and conversion services for over 100 years, is set to become Germany’s first maritime recycling facility. According to The Munich Eye, the shipyard located on the Ems River in Western Germany near the border with the Netherlands recently received final government approvals to add a recycling element to its business.\nThe approval process for the facility took approximately one year, and it is now ready to launch as EWD Benli Recycling in partnership with ReLog, a German recycling company. According to the reports, it has become the only company in Germany with the necessary permits.\nManagement of EWD Benli Recycling, the newspaper reports, sees a significant market demand for ship recycling. In its applications to the Lower Saxony Ministry of the Environment and the trade supervisory authorities in Oldenburg and Emden, the company highlighted the opportunities to recycle vessels from government agencies as well as inland water vessels, coastal vessels, and smaller passenger ships and ferries. Bjorn Sommer, who heads the dock company and now the recycler, reports they will be able to handle anything that can enter the port through the sea lock.\nThe yard reports it has begun following up on earlier inquiries it started receiving after announcing that it was filing for the permits. They said the operation in addition to serving vessels, could handle wind turbines and other industrial structures that could be moved to its facility.\nEmden, they emphasized, is well suited for the operation because the seaport is “storm proof” because of its location and the sea lock, and approved as an emergency port by the German authorities. The yard has sealed areas, modern docks, and cranes, all of which can be used to support the recycling operation and meet the requirements of the EU. They emphasized that they will focus on the retention and repurposing of raw materials from the ships.\nThe shipyard has been owned by the Bremerhaven-based Benli Group since 2020. It has strong experience with industrial plants, onshore and offshore wind turbines, and other industrial applications, which all might become clients for the recycling operation.\nThe EU has strict standards both for the environment in which vessels are dismantled as well as for the recycling of materials. Experts have highlighted that this has created a strong demand for the services and expect the recycling business for smaller vessels will grow in the coming years after fleets modernize to meet the emerging environmental regulations.\n"

The Coast Guard immediately dispatched its shipVikram, which was out on standard patrol, to investigate and effect the rescue.\n\n\n\nThe cutter located the small boat with six individuals aboard and later determined they were the crew from a small cargo ship that had been lost hours earlier. The vessel MSVSalamathwas transporting a cargo of cement and construction materials. It had departed the Mangalore Port on May 12 heading to Kadmat Island. Early on May 14, the crew told the Coast Guard the vessel had begun flooding, and it eventually sank. The crew members were able to make it into the small boat, but it appears no distress signal was issued.\nLocating the small boat, the Coast Guard sent one of its power launches and it towed the small boat to theVikran. The six individuals were taken aboard and given medical aid and brought to New Mangalore.\nThe Indian Coast Guard released the details saying it highlights the unwavering commitment to saving lives and securing the seas.\n\n\n"

According to a memo seen by USNI News, Acting Commandant Kevin Lundy reported the decision from Homeland Security to reduce the senior ranks among the service’s force.\nThe memo reportedly says that “the Department of Homeland Security has determined that there is redundant executive oversight in our force which hinders effective decision making.”\nIt reports that they have been ordered to reduce flag officer positions by at least 25 percent by the end of 2025, a move that would be consistent with similar efforts within the Department of Defense.USNI reportsthat there are a total of 46 flag officers in the USCG, 43 of whom are active and three on reserve duty. As such, that would mean that the reduction is targeting at least 12 officers.\nThe memo also reports that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled the results of the 2025 one-star admiral promotion board that would have elevated six Coast Guard captains to flag officers.\nAll of this comes after Secretary Noemtold an audienceof USCG senior leaders, “You are the finest fighting force,” adding that “funding the Coast Guard is one of my top priorities.” During her address, she praised the service’s specialized expertise in controlling, securing, and defending America’s borders and maritime approaches, including U.S. ports and waterways.\nShe told the audience that they were asking for the biggest overhaul of USCG since 1915 to transform and grow the Coast Guard through Force Design 2028. The initiative, according to command, is to create a more agile, capable, responsive fighting force. They promised the deployment of cutting-edge technology while also reforming Coast Guard acquisitions to rapidly deploy capabilities to execute missions.\nNoem and the senior leadership of USCG promised, “This initiative will address immediate workforce shortfalls and ensure the service’s ability to meet emerging threats.”\nThe basicdetails of the programwere announced at the beginning of April, with command promising additional rollouts in the coming weeks.\nVice Admiral Kevin Lundy was elevated to the commandant’s position in January after the Trump administrationdismissedthe Commandant, Admiral Linda Fagan.

The Israelis also warned of more attacks if the Houthis persist in their missile and drone launches. Israel also cited its past efforts at targeting terrorist leaders.\nEarly reports are saying that there were ten strikes split between the two ports. The IDF acknowledged the strikes with unconfirmed reports that Israel used 10 to 15 fighter jets and dropped more than 35 munitions.\nThe IDF is saying the ports are “severely damaged.” They said the strikes were “more intentional” and “more central” than those conducted previously by the U.S., which were highly targeted. They said the ports had been specifically targeted because they are being used to transfer weapons. It said that “Any hostile activity in these ports will continue to be prevented.”\nThe Houthis quickly issued a statement saying the bombing of the ports “will be met with a painful response.” They reported that 10 people were killed or injured, including one killed and three injured in Salif. They said the preliminary report showed six had been injured in Hodeidah.\n\nYemeni Houthi port moment ago ????Epic FAFO.pic.twitter.com/Vjp4COTh2Z\n\nThey reported that vital facilities, civilian facilities, and infrastructure were targeted. Residents in Hodeidah are saying they heard four loud booms and saw smoke coming from the port.\nReports are quoting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel saying, “Our pilots have successfully struck two Houthi terrorist ports, and this is just the beginning. There will be more to come. We are not willing to sit idly by and allow the Houthis to harm us. We will strike them much harder, including their leadership and all the infrastructure that enables them to harm us.”\nThe Israelis reportedly cited their efforts, which have already targeted terror leaders. The report referenced Deif and the Sinwars in Gaza, Nasrallah in Beirut, and Haniyeh in Tehran.\nThe strikes came after repeated drone and missile attacks fired by the Houthis and threats against Israel. The IDF issued warnings last Sunday (May 11) saying that the port areas of Ras Isa, Hodeidah, and Salif should be evacuated.\nIsrael apparently waited until Donald Trump had departed the Middle East after his state visit to strike the Houthis. The bombing of the ports came as the Houthis staged another of their weekly protest marches in their capital city of Sanaa.

Shipbuilder Ferguson Marine confirmed that the delivery of the second of the ferries,Glen Rosawill yet again be delayed by up to nine months, while costs will be ballooning yet further for the program.\nNew chief executive Graeme Thomson of Ferguson Marine has had to provide the update just days after taking over the leadership role of the builder. Sitting down earlier in May for an interview a week into the role, Thomson had said, “The shipyard's immediate priority is the build and delivery of MVGlen Rosaalong with its efforts to secure work for the shipyard and modernize its infrastructure and equipment.”\nRumors of additional problems in the build began to circulate in recent weeks as news also spread of further problems with the first deliveryGlen Sannox. The vessel, which was finally delivered in late 2024, is now reported to have avibrationproblem.\nOn April 30, the Scottish Parliament gave the nationalized Ferguson Marine a two-week ultimatum to provide substantive details on the delivery timelines and updated costs for the second shipGlen Rosa. It went on to express its frustrations and disappointment over the shipyard’s handling of the project.\n\n\nGlen Rosa was launched in April 2024 (CMAL)\n\nFerguson Marine started work on the CalMac ferry program in 2015 with the original deliveries scheduled for 2018 at a combined cost of £97 million ($123 million). However, the project became embroiled in controversies, resulting in cost overruns and delays. By November 2024, whenGlen Sannoxwasdelivered, the costs for both ferries had ballooned to over £400 million ($507 million).\nThe shipyard has blamed a flawed design concept by CMAL, repeated change requests, and supply issues for many of the problems. Part of the delays were also attributed to difficulties in completing the ferry’s LNG power system. The shipyard went bankrupt and was nationalized in 2019.\nFerguson Marine is now saying that while outfitting is underway, work remains especially on the complex systems for the LNG plant. Thomson further admitted that resources were diverted from the ship in 2024 by the prior management to completeGlen Sannox. The yard finallylaunchedGlen Rosain April 2024 and the previous update had said the vessel would be delivered in September 2025.\nThe yard is now reporting it will have the vessel “substantially complete” in the first quarter of 2026 before embarking on a commissioning plan and delivery between April and June. The new timeline is seven years late, but the BBC reports that when it pressed for a commitment, Thomson deferred, saying there would be a further review in six months.\nThe cost estimate forGlen Rosahas also soared, with the shipyard now reporting the ship will cost £172.5 million ($229.5 million) with an additional £12.5 million ($16.6 million) “risk contingency,” putting the total cost to £185 million ($246 million). The previous estimate was £150 million ($200 million). The ballooning amounts mean that both vessels will have cost over £460 million ($612 million), close to five times the original cost.\n“This is not a financial position we are comfortable with, and we will continue to review our plan, assessing our risks to identify opportunities to bring this cost down,” said Thomson.\nTheGlen Rosais being built for Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited (CalMac) to service the Arran route. The 102-meter (336-foot) dual-fuel vessel will be capable of operating on liquefied natural gas and marine gas oil and will have a capacity to carry up to 852 passengers plus at least 127 cars or 16 heavy goods vehicles, or a combination of both."

While everyone thought it was a spectacular scene as the vessel approached the famed Faraglioni rock formations off Capri, local environmentalists fumed, and one took out their smartphone to film the sail by.\nThe 54,700 gross ton cruise ship Silver Ray, operated by Royal Caribbean’s Silversea Cruises, turned out to be violating the maritime regulations of Italy. The ship, which is 801 feet (244 meters) in length and was introduced in 2024, has a draft of approximately 6 meters (20 feet). It accommodates 728 passengers catering to their every need in luxury.\nWith clear, warm skies and calm seas, the captain thought it would be a spectacular vision for the passengers to see the craggy rock formation that rises over 300 feet above sea level. Theyfilmed the sail byand posted it online.

They confirmed it had come within 500 meters (1,650 feet) of the rock structure. That was a failure to maintain a minimum distance under Italian regulations. As a result, the ship was fined €1,032 (about $1,100). The captain was also issued a formal reprimand by the Italian Coast Guard.\nWhile it seems minor, the authorities highlighted the incident 15 years ago when theCosta Concordiaalso decided to do a sail by. The cruise ship hit an uncharted rock and became a total loss. A total of 32 people died, although 4,200 were saved in a miraculous effort, and it caused reforms to maritime law and how Carnival Corporation manages all its cruise ships.\nThe Italian environmentalists pounced on this incident using it as an opportunity to call for more restrictions around the formation and the creation of a larger marine reserve. They highlighted that the previous efforts have resulted in developments, including the spotting of a rare monk seal, which was photographed in the preserve areas. They are also demanding that buoys be put out around the formation to prevent other ships from wandering into the area, either intentionally, like theSilver Ray, or unintentionally."

        "content": "\nAn Italian start-up, Newcleo, working with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri and design firm Pininfarina, has unveiled its concepts for a new generation of small, fission power plants that could provide the future power for shipping and other applications. A full-scale representation of the fourth-generation nuclear reactor was placed on display at a prestigious Italian design fair with the companies saying the aim was to redefine the social image of nuclear power.\nNewcleo, which was launched in September 2021, with more than €537 million (more than $600 million) of private funding, is working on concepts for small modular lead-cooled fast reactors. The company calls its concepts “the next step in the evolution of fission power plants.”\n“We believe the lead-cooled Fast Reactors technology is the most promising. In fact, lead characteristics enable design simplification (which in turn has economic benefits) and a high degree of inherent safety,” says Newcleo.\nThe fourth-generation small modular reactor, the company says, represents a revolutionary approach to the decarbonization challenge by offering the answer to the perceived problems of traditional nuclear power. The lead cooling system introduces passive safety systems that avoid the risk of nuclear accidents through the physical laws governing reactor operation. In addition, the reactor would be able to eliminate nuclear waste generated by conventional nuclear power plants through a virtuous multi-cycle system that allows it to be burned, generating clean, cheap, and virtually inexhaustible energy.\nNewcleo points out that much of the nuclear industry is focused on large-scale applications while it has a concept of an ultracompact and transportable 200 MWe module with improvements in energy density compared to other technologies. In the event of an accident, with Newcleo’s design, the liquid lead inside the reactor would solidify as it cools after coming in contact with the cold water, enclosing the reactor core in a solid casing and containing all radiation due to the shielding properties of lead.\nFincantieri, Italian classification society RINA, and Newcleo have been collaborating since 2023 to study applications for ship propulsion of Newcleo's technology. When they launched the project, they articulated a vision for placing a closed mini reactor on vessels as a small nuclear battery producing a 30MW electric output. The company said the concept would require infrequent refueling (only once every 10 to 15 years), very limited maintenance, and easy replacement at the end of life, with the whole unit simply being removed and replaced with a new one on the ship, and the spent unit taken away for decommissioning and reprocessing.\n\n\nConcept for the compact reactor was displayed at an Italian design fair (Newcleo)\n\nPininfarina oversaw the creative vision of the project. It reports that it infused sustainable design into the technological solutions, and brought for the first time to the nuclear industry a creative vision that mixes technical and aesthetic elements to promote their understanding to a wide audience.\nThe collaboration presented its vision at the prestigious 19th International Architecture Exhibition of the Venice Biennale. They put on display a full-scale representation using a vase shape and standing 18 feet, with an outer shell made of fiberglass. A portion of the reactor is open so that visitors can get a sense of how the technology would work.\nThe unveiling they said is a unique opportunity to show the world an innovative, unprecedented, and futuristic vision of nuclear energy, far from the narratives of the past and capable of inspiring a near future where this inexhaustible source of clean energy. Newcleo also states that it is actively pursuing a targeted acquisition strategy, incorporating key companies with strong capabilities in nuclear engineering, manufacturing, and waste management as it moves toward its goal of commercializing fission reactors."

The 47-foot vessel named Lucky Harvest was finally located more than 100 miles west/southwest of Guam.\nAuthorities in the Northern Mariana Islands declared the vessel missing on Tuesday, May 13, after it failed to arrive in Saipan late on Monday. It was traveling from Alamagan Island to Saipan when it was declared overdue and the local authorities requested the assistance of the USCG.\nThe cutter USCG Myrtle Hazard, which was on a patrol in the area, was diverted to a location approximately 38 miles northwest of Rota, which they believed was the vessel’s last known position. Early reports said there might have been some intermittent communication, but when no sign of the vessel was found, the USCG intensified the search.\nThe Coast Guard reported by Wednesday that a U.S. Navy Knighthawk helicopter had also joined the search efforts along with a P-8 Poseidon aircraft. It was in addition to the USCG aircraft and vessel, a Saipan-based Department of Public Safety vessel, and the missing boat’s sister vessel. A marker buoy was deployed to track ocean currents, and efforts to contact the vessel by cellphone and radio continued but were unsuccessful.\nWinds in the area were at 15 knots and the seas were generally reported to be running 5 to 7 feet.\n\n\n\nFriday morning, May 16, the USCG reports the Joint Rescue Sub-Center Guam received a distress signal from the Lucky Harvest’s emergency beacon and was able to pinpoint a location. It is unclear when the two individuals aboard the boat had activated the beacon, but USCG also reports the vessel was having electrical outages.\nApproximately three hours after receiving the signal, the U.S. Navy’s helicopter crew was able to spot the disabled and drifting boat. Pictures show the two mariners had written SOS on the roof of their boat.\nThe helicopter hoisted one of the two mariners to safety and continued to monitor the boat until the Myrtle Hazard was able to reach it. The cutter was to take aboard the second individual and tow their boat to port.\nThe Coast Guard is reporting that both individuals are in good medical condition after being brought aboard and meeting with teams.  They were gathering more information from interviews with the two individuals."

They have been detained in the country since November after the protest in which they used the ship to call for a strong international plastics treaty ban.\nThe protest was coordinated to the fifth round of negotiations for a UN Global Plastic Treaty that was taking place in Busan, South Korea. Greenpeace’s vesselRainbow Warriorwas conducting a “Sailing for Change” tour in Eastern Asia and coordinated a visit to the scheduled negotiations.\nThe four protestors set off from the mother ship on November 30 for one of the group's typical protests that involve banners to draw attention to their cause. The protestors displayed banners calling for the treaty and painted the words “Plastics Kill” on the side of the Panama-registered LPG tankerBuena Alba(3,146 dwt). Four activists, Sam Rodrigues (Mexican), Alex Wilson (British), Ash (Taiwanese), and Jens (German) also boarded the ship, which was at anchor, and climbed its mast to unfurl their banners.\n\n\nGreenpeace's activists atop the mast of the LPG tanker (Greenpeace)\n\nGreenpeace contends it was a peaceful protest and put no one in danger. They said the tanker was waiting to load chemicals at the Hyundai Daesan Refinery.\nThe South Korean police took the four into custody along with the captain of theRainbow Warriorand held them for nearly two days during the investigation. While they were released, they were ordered to remain in South Korea for the outcome of the investigation.\nToday, they appeared in the Seoul Central District Court for their first hearing. They are all being charged with obstruction of business and unlawful intrusion onto a vessel according to the Korean Yonhap news agency. They report that the court continues to prohibit the five from leaving the country.\nThe group staged a protest outside the court as part of a campaign calling for the release of its members so that they can return home to their families. They also called for a quick conclusion to the trial, and at the same time, repeated their calls for the Plastics Treaty.\nIt is the latest in a series of court cases involving Greenpeace activists for their incidents with ships. In September 2024, a Danish court fined the group for its efforts at blocking tankers they linked to the Russian oil trade, which were transferring or transporting crude oil in Danish waters. Greenpeace and Shell also settled a case in December after the group’s activists boarded and set up camp on an oil platform that was being transported into the North Sea. Greenpeace agreed to donate £300,000 ($383,000) to the RNLI, a charity that provides lifeboat search and rescue, lifeguards, water safety education, and flood rescue around the UK, and for its activists to stay away from Shell sites in the North Sea for periods ranging between five to 10 years."

        "content": "\nSouth Korea’s shipbuilding industry continues to seek opportunities to build business through cooperation while taking advantage of the U.S.’s efforts to restore capabilities and address Chinese domination in shipbuilding. On Friday, May 16, two of the country’s largest shipbuilders had the opportunity to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer while he was in the country for a meeting of Asian trade ministers.\nGreer was part of the U.S. delegation attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) two-day conference on South Korea’s resort island of Jeju. The ministers from the 21 member nations were in attendance while the conference also brought business leaders together. It also provided an opportunity for South Korea to advance its efforts to reach a new trade agreement with the United States.\nThe country’s interim leader met with Greer to discuss trade issues and the need to reach a new trade agreement. The government is using the opportunities with the shipbuilders as a key chip in the negotiations noting that South Korea is second only to China in shipbuilding.  Both HD Hyundai and Hanwha Ocean have already registered for a U.S. Navy maintenance program for auxiliary ships, and South Korea highlights its capabilities both in building U.S.-designed warships and large commercial ships.\nComplicating the trade talks are the pending elections in South Korea scheduled for June 3 to select a new prime minister after the turmoil of the past few months. Also, reports said the Trump administration may be trying to link the cost of maintaining 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea to the trade discussions.\nThe Executive Vice Chairman of HD Hyundai, Chung Kisun, and Hanwha Ocean CEO Kim Hee-chul were both able to conduct meetings with Greer to highlight their shipbuilding strategies, and in the case of HD Hyundai, it also played to U.S. interests highlighting its capabilities to manufacture port cranes. HD Hyundai reports that during its meeting, Chung introduced its affiliate HY Hyundai Samho and its crane manufacturing capability. He proposed that they could help to strengthen cooperation between the countries and diversify and stabilize the U.S. port equipment supply chain. Greer’s team has proposed tariffs against Chinese-built cranes as a follow-up to the “spy cranes” allegations that assert China could watch and control U.S. ports with its cranes.\nHD Hyundai reports that Chung told Greer, \"We deeply appreciate the United States' commitment to rebuilding its shipbuilding industry. HD Hyundai stands fully prepared and willing to contribute wherever our capabilities are needed.\"\nThe company also highlighted to Greer ongoing collaboration with U.S. defense shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries and proposed concrete areas of cooperation, including joint technology development, shipbuilding cooperation, and skilled workforce training programs.\nHanwha Ocean reports they discussed a wide range of cooperation measures in the shipbuilding industry with Greer including its strategy for supply chain stability and strengthening industrial competitiveness, focusing on expanding the shipbuilding production base and technology transfer in the U.S. Hanwha Ocean highlighted that it is planning to apply the smart production system of its Geoje plant to its recently acquired Philly Shipyard in the U.S. They also told Greer that it is also considering establishing additional production bases in the U.S.\nThe South Korean shipbuilders have been reaching out to the U.S., including hosting tours of their facilities with leaders from the Navy and the current and former U.S. Secretary of the Navy. Today’s meeting was reported to be the first “official dialogue” for the South Korean shipbuilders with the U.S. Trade Representative. Recently, reports have said the industry is already receiving strong inquiries since the USTR released its policy for port fees on Chinese-built ships and Chinese-built cargo cranes.\nSouth Korea, like Japan, is reported to be looking to capitalize on the Trump administration's interest in shipbuilding in its larger trade deal in response to Trump’s tariffs. South Korea says it agreed to a tentative goal of having a trade agreement with the U.S. by early July, but it may be slowed by the current elections."

        "content": "The Royal Navy is reporting for the first time that one of its advanced Air Defence Destroyers, HMSDragon, has downed a supersonic sea-skimming target. It was a test of a specially-modified Sea Viper missile system carried out during a month-long NATO exercise currently off Scotland.\nDuring the exercise, HMSDragon, the fourth of the Air Defence Destroyer class, commissioned in 2012, was working with other NATO ships conducting missile firing. For this test, they were working with an incoming high-speed target that was emulating one of the most advanced threats the Royal Navy could face. They said it was the first time the Royal Navy had confronted this type of target, which is significantly more challenging as it flies faster and carries out corkscrew and weave maneuvers.\nThe Sea Viper launched was a special telemetry version, designed to record measurements and valuable data to inform future operations. Just two and a half seconds after launch from HMSDragon, the missile accelerated to more than four times the speed of sound (Mach 4), and high above the water, it maneuvers at G-forces which no human could withstand. It obliterated the supersonic missile in what the Royal Navy is calling “a historic first.”\n\nA Friday fireball courtesy of@HMSDragon...In a burst of fire and smoke, the Type 45 destroyer launched a specially-modified Sea Viper missile at an incoming high-speed target which was emulating the kind of advanced threats seen around the globe today.\n\n“The successful Sea Viper firing as part of Formidable Shield 25 is a huge moment for HMSDragon,” said HMSDragon’s Commanding Officer, Commander Iain Giffin. “Not only does it prove thatDragon’s world-leading air defense capability functions as it should following an extensive maintenance period, but it also proves our ability to integrate and operate alongside NATO allies and partners.”\nThe Royal Navy highlights that HMSDragonhas only recently returned to active service after a more than two-year major refit. Starting in March 2022 in Portsmouth, the warship was receiving major upgrades to its weapons systems while also proceeding with the Power-Improvement Project. Two of the original diesel engines were removed and replaced with three more reliable, more powerful, and cleaner engines, adding 4,000 hp to the vessel and upgrading electrical systems.\nThe Royal Navy also reported in 2022 that it was proceeding with a £300 million upgrade project for the destroyers’ main weapon system. All six Type 45s destroyers, including HMSDragon, are receiving upgrades to Sea Viper and being fitted with the Sea Ceptor missile system. The Sea Viper Evolution, the Royal Navy said, covered the Aster 30 missile and the Sampson radar as well as the command-and-control system.\n\n\n\nEach of the destroyers carries 48 Sea Vipers, which have a capability of taking out a target at up to 75 miles. The system uses the distinctive radar system, the Sampson and Long Range, which can track targets as far as 250 miles away. The Royal Navy said the upgrade was designed to deal with the increasing threats posed by anti-ship ballistic missiles.\n“Seeing how farDragonhas progressed, both within the Warfare Department as well as the wider ship, is impressive,” said Lieutenant Commander Sarah Kaese,Dragon’s Senior Warfare Officer, who is on exchange from the Royal Australian Navy and is participating in the NATO exercise.\nA year ago, then Defence Minister Grant Shapps highlighted thatDragon’s sister shipDiamondhad deployed the Sea Viper during an attack by the Houthis in the Red Sea. Shapps pointed out it was the first time the system had been fired in hostilities since 1991 during the Gulf War.\nThe current demonstration was part of a NATO exercise involving 10 nations and more than 7,000 personnel, with ships, aircraft, and ground forces. The exercise started in Norway and has moved to Scotland. It will continue till the end of May."

        "content": "\nFollowing the Estonian Navy's attempt to intercept a Russia-bound tanker in the Baltic last week, the Russian Navy has intercepted and diverted a Greek tanker full of Estonian fuel oil in the Gulf of Finland, according to Estonia's transport administration.\nThe agency said that Russian forces had intercepted the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned tankerGreen Admirein the early hours of Sunday morning, shortly after the vessel departed the Port of Sillamäe. The seaport is right next to the Russian border, and the tanker's route took it into Russian territorial seas, where Russian forces detained it. The vessel was diverted to Gogland, a Russian-controlled island northwest of Sillamäe.\nAfter the detention, theGreen Admire'sAIS signal showed obvious signs of spoofing, as is common in this region: it appeared to relocate to the northern coast of the gulf, then maintained a circular course at twice its maximum sea speed, occasionally passing over land.\n\nGreen Admire's AIS track after her diversion to Gogland (CourtesyPole Star)\nIt is the first time that such an incident has happened, the ministry told local outlet ERR. The route thatGreen Admireused is an internationally-approved safety corridor for deep-draft shipping, and was agreed to by Russia, Estonia and Finland; going forward, Estonia's merchant ship traffic will be advised to follow a different and somewhat more challenging route to stay out of Russian waters.\n\"Today's incident shows that Russia continues to act unpredictably, which is why ships will be directed along an alternative route in the future,\" said Minister of Foreign Affairs Margus Tsahkna in a statement.\nThe detention may have been a response to an Estonian Navy intercept attempt last week. Estonia asserts that it has a right to inspect vessels transiting the Baltic for safety reasons, a response to the frequent deficiencies, questionable insurance arrangements and occasional false flagging associated with Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of aging tankers. On May 13, the Estonian Navy interdicted the sanctioned tankerJaguaren route to Primorsk, Russia, and ordered it to change course; however, it continued on its voyage, and the Russian military scrambled a fighter jet to the scene in response. Estonia filed a diplomatic complaint with Russia, accusing the jet of briefly violating Estonian airspace in a manner that was “not acceptable in any way.”\nOn Sunday, Tsahkna told TV news show \"Aktuaalne Kaamera\" that there was a clear link between the Estonian Navy interdiction of theJaguarand the Russian intercept of theGreen Admire.\n\"This is definitely connected to the fact that we have started to harass Russia's shadow fleet. I am not just talking about Estonia, but about Finland and other Baltic Sea countries more broadly,\" he said."

        "content": "\nIndia has launched a set of reforms aimed at strengthening its fisheries sector. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting with key stakeholders in the industry as India prepares to focus more on deep-sea fishing and increase seafood exports.\n“We attach great importance to this area and have worked extensively to improve infrastructure relating to the sector and also ensure greater access to credit as well as markets for our fishermen,” said Modi.\nGovernment data shows that India’s fish production has surged by 82 percent in the last decade, reaching 17.4 million tons in 2022-23 from 9.5 million tons in 2013-2014. This saw India become the third biggest fish producer in the world, with aquaculture representing the largest share of the growth.\nHowever, with the focus now on boosting deep-sea fishing, India is planning to venture into commercial krill fishing in the Antarctic Ocean. Two Mumbai-based fishing firms have reportedly announced plans to launch krill harvesting. Krill is a tiny crustacean that makes up the base of the food chain in the Southern Ocean.\nAccording to a report by the Times of India (TOI), the firms may attempt krill fishing this summer in the Antarctic (between December and February). “Till now, we did not venture into fishing there because it requires a huge investment. We have asked the companies to talk to those in other countries involved in fishing in the Southern Ocean. We will give them permits and also the Indian flag for their vessels,” M Ravichandran, secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) told TOI.\nAs a member of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), the international body in charge of conserving marine life in Antarctic waters, India has fishing rights in Southern Ocean. But until now, India has not been utilizing its fishing quotas in the region. India currently imports krill oil from Norway for use as a feed in aquaculture farms. In fact, the rising demand for krill as an aquaculture feed has led to a significant growth in commercial krill fishing in the last few years. Commercial fishing for krill reached a record 498,000 tons in 2023, with Norway and China leading in the harvest.\nCCAMLR has set a krill fishing limit at 620,000 metric tons per year. However, some scientists and conservationists are worried that catches are steadily rising towards the limit, especially as more countries become interested in krill fishing. Some of CCAMLR’s members (including China and Russia) are opposed to the creation of new Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Antarctica, which could be a win for biodiversity in the region."

        "content": "\nEstonia has approved a draft bill granting the first building permit for the construction of an offshore wind farm. The permit was granted to Saare Wind Energy, which is developing a project west of the coast of the island of Saaremaa, in the Estonian part of the Baltic Sea.\nThe planned offshore wind farm will have up to 100 wind turbines and the capacity to generate 1.4 GW of electricity. The farm is scheduled to be operational in the early 2030s. In addition, the project involves the construction of a transmission system with a connection to the Estonian onshore grid.\nAs the first offshore wind farm to get a building permit in Estonia, the Saaremaa project represents an important step towards clean energy production in the country, according to Jaanus Uiga, Undersecretary for Energy and Mineral Resources at the Ministry of Climate.\nThe building permit is valid for 50 years and allows the developer to proceed to the next levels of approval. These include applying for a building permit from the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority (CPTRA) and an environmental permit for special water use from the Environmental Board.\nHowever, the Ministry added that issuing a building permit does not mean the project will receive state support. Further, the Ministry has initiated building permit procedures for 11 more offshore wind farms, which have been submitted by OÜ Utilitas Wind, Five Wind Energy OÜ, Tuuletraal OÜ, UAB \"Ignitis renewables projektai 6,\" Liivi Offshore OÜ, the Environmental Investment Center Foundation (ELWIND), and Tuul Energy OÜ.\nEstonia also wants to expedite auctions and licensing of newly designated offshore wind areas, such as the Saare 7 site, 7 miles west of the island of Saaremaa. Early this month, CPTRA, the agency responsible for processing offshore wind farm licenses, announced that the auction for this area will take place in mid-June.\nEstonia is part of a cross-border cooperation with seven other Baltic Sea States, aimed at accelerating deployment of offshore wind energy by improving grid infrastructure in the region. Last week, the Baltic Offshore Grid Initiative (BOGI) published a joint roadmap for cooperation in the field of offshore wind energy and related regional grid interconnections. BOGI is a collaboration between transmission system operators (TSOs) from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden.\nThe potential for offshore energy generation in the Baltic Sea is approximately 93 GW, but less than 5 GW of the capacity is installed today. In April 2024, the Baltic Sea States signed the Vilnius Declaration, pledging to explore regional cooperation to tap the massive offshore energy potential in the region. The TSOs were given a clear mandate to develop a Baltic Sea Grid Map supported by cross-border electricity interconnections."

The survey found that women account for an estimated 19 percent of all employees in the maritime sector worldwide, with high variability among subsectors. Women dominate the field in public relations, marketing, advertising, crewing and recruitment roles, but still account for just one percent of the world's active seafaring workforce - reflecting both the opportunities and the longstanding challenges for women in maritime.\n\"Women remain a small fraction of the seagoing workforce, highlighting the urgent need for continued commitment andaction. We must redouble our efforts to foster a truly diverse and inclusive maritime industry — one where talent is recognized and nurtured, regardless of gender, to usher us into a new digital and decarbonized maritime era,\" said IMO Secretary-General Antonio Dominguez in a statement. \"At IMO, we will continue to push forward, through our flagship Women in Maritime program, now in its fourth decade, and by mainstreaming gender in all projects and capacity development activities.\"\nThe survey found that in the private sector, women account for 16 percent of the total shoreside and seafaring workforce. This is a remarkable drop from the level reported in the inaugural survey in 2021 - 29 percent - and likely reflects a change in the composition of the companies that responded. The survey was conducted online and was voluntary, and most of the organizations and firms that participated this year were new additions, making comparison between the two surveys difficult.\nNonetheless, the overall trend remains consistent: women can be found in shoreside roles - from entry-level to board level - but they face continued barriers to employment at sea. Out of the 179 vessel operators that participated in the survey, only 85 said that they actively employ women on their ships. One company was up-front about its approach: \"We do not hire women in offshore support vessels,\" the firm wrote in a free-response section.\nA recent survey of maritime professionals by the Global Maritime Forum found that 29 percent of women identified gender discrimination as a major barrier in their careers. However, the WISTA/IMO survey found that only 13 percent of respondents attempt to address discrimination through the use of bias training, and the majority of respondents do not have a gender equality policy.\n\"The data indicates the continuing presence of barriers such as gender stereotyping, workplace safety concerns, a lack of family friendly policies and the ongoing gender pay gap. We all have a duty to make the industry more accessible and inclusive, not just for future generations but for today's workforce,\" said WISTA International President Elpi Petraki in a statement. \"It is my hope that the 2024 Women in Maritime Survey results guide the actions we must take to bring about cultural change, as we still have a long way to go in our mission to improve gender diversity and break the gender bias.\"\nPetraki and Dominguez discussed the results in a symposium held Saturday at IMO headquarters, along with panel discussions on specific issues and individual perspectives (below).\n"

There is also growing condemnation of the deal for transferring the citizenship of the Chagos Islanders from the United Kingdom to Mauritius without any form of consultation - when Britain went to war with Argentina to defend the rights of Falkland Islanders to choose if they wished to remain British or not.\nA major weakness of the proposed deal is that once sovereignty is transferred, there will be no going back, and Mauritius could then choose to strengthen its alliance with China and allow Chinese encroachment over other islands in the Chagos Archipelago. China has track record (well-established in the South China Sea) of building up deserted islands for “civilian” purposes – then turning them into military installations.\nMauritius and China have a Free Trade Agreement, and the Chinese community in Mauritius has two members in Parliament. Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam has a much closer relationship with China than his predecessor, who started the negotiations with the United Kingdom. At a meeting on May 14, the new Chinese Ambassador Dr Huang Shifang pledged to strengthen Mauritius-Chinese relations, particularly in light of the “strategic advantages” which Mauritius enjoys. He added that there would be “broad prospects for future collaboration.” The new Mauritian government has hinted that it wishes to revive the Jin Fei and Yihai industrial zones, a joint project which collapsed when China did not deliver the new investment promised in the deal.\nMeanwhile, the Diego Garcia airfield remains busy. On May 18, four B-52s were visible on the South Apron, together with four F-15 fighters to provide local defense in the light of Iranian threats. The F-15 fighter presence was confirmed by Cdr. Matthew Comer, Chief of Media and Current Operations, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. The emerging local defense requirement reinforces the need for forward radar sites on the Chagos Islands to the north."

With offshore oil production expanding in Guyanese waters, the bill hopes to create national environmental safeguards to defend against the effects of oil pollution. President Irfaan Ali is expected to sign the bill into law soon.\n“Guyana, as a major oil-producing nation, must establish a clear authority for oversight, aligning with best practices and ensuring all operators bear full responsibility for environmental protection,” said Mark Phillips, Guyana’s Prime Minister.\nSome of the notable provisions of the bill include mandatory financial assurance by companies engaged in oil exploration and production. This financial guarantee will cover potential oil spills, ensuring that funds are promptly available for clean-up efforts. There will be penalties for non-compliance, including suspension of licenses.\nThe legislation designates the Civil Defense Commission (CDC) as the national authority responsible for coordinating response efforts and mitigating the impact of any spill. CDC will also oversee routine inspections and audits to identify and fix potential risks.\nAccording to the finance ministry, Guyana’s oil sector expanded 58 percent in 2024. This growth saw Guyana become the fifth largest crude exporter in Latin America after Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia.\nOil production in Guyana’s first offshore block is controlled by an Exxon Mobil-led consortium. The group produced an average of 616,000 barrels per day (bpd) last year from three operational FPSOs in the massive Stabroek block.\nThis output is set to rise to around 940,000 bpd later this year with a fourth FPSO, which was built by SBM Offshore and arrived in Guyanese waters last month. The FPSO,One Guyana,has a capacity of 250,000 bpd.\nThe backers of the oil spill legislation in parliament argued that the meteoric rise of Guyana’s oil sector ought to be balanced with the tightening of environmental protection laws."

        "content": "\nEgypt has concluded a series of deals with AD Ports and DP World which, taken together, have put the operations and revenue generation from Egypt’s principal ports and maritime logistic services into Emirati hands for the foreseeable future - in return for capital investments and payments up front.\nIn the latest deal, the Abu Dhabi Ports Group has signed a 50-year agreement covering the East Port Said industrial and logistics zone at the northern end of the Suez Canal, which allows AD Ports to build and operate a new shipping and cruise liner terminal. AD Ports has previously signed a 30-year agreement covering a multi-purpose port in Safaga, midway down Egypt’s Red Sea coast, and a 15-year agreement for two cement terminals in West Port Said and El Arish. AD Ports is also planning for two cruise terminals at Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh on the Red Sea, and is building an integrated logistics park at the Port of Alexandria.\nIn 2022, DP World signed a similar agreement covering the port of Sokhna at the northern end of the Red Sea, 25 miles southwest of the canal entrance at Port Suez. With an initial $80 million investment to build a logistics park, DP World is committed to building a second basin and jetty, with liquid bulk facilities, specialist warehousing, a sugar refinery and a livestock handling facility, all linked to a planned industrial zone adjacent. The first phase is already operational. DP World also signed a memorandum of understanding in late 2024 to build a free trade zone in Egypt’s New Administrative Capital.\nAD Ports is Abu Dhabi-sovereign owned, and DP World is Dubai-owned, meaning that UAE state entities will have a controlling grip on logistics in Egypt for some time to come. This fits in with the UAE’s strategic aim of dominating trade routes from the Gulf through the Bab el Mandeb to the Mediterranean, a trade route on which the UAE depends for survival. All along this trade route, the UAE has invested in military control, building airfields on Socotra, Perim and Asmara, and forming military alliances with governments and militias controlling the coastline. This strategy also serves a commercial purpose: as of last count, DP World handles about 10 percent of global container capacity, with operations in 34 nations around the world.\nEgypt has faced some criticism for indebtedness, for investing in ‘vanity’ infrastructure projects such as the New Administrative Capital, and for favoring military-owned companies in major projects. But for Egypt, concluding agreements such as those with the UAE entities brings capital investment into the country without affecting the formal external debt balance, and in time it will recover control of much-improved port infrastructure. For now, Egypt owes the International Money Fund $11 billion (the second biggest debtor behind Argentina), and its debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of 2024 was 91%. But this was down from 96% in 2023, and was a better ratio than that of the US (98%) or UK (98%).\nIn the immediate short term, Egypt’s principal fiscal problem is the loss of revenue from the Suez Canal, impacted by Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. Canal revenues have fallen from $9.4 billion in 2022-23 and $7.2 billion in 2023-24 to an estimated $1.8 billion in 2024-25. The US-Houthi ceasefire is unlikely to restore canal traffic to previous levels for some time. Egypt has invested $8 billion in improving the canal since 2014, and had hoped for a major boost in revenues as a return on its investment."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "Paul Benecki",
        "content": "\nReports from the continuing Omani-mediated talks between the United States and Iran suggest that after four rounds, negotiations are reaching a critical point, with progress now being dependent on either side giving way on redline positions.\nThe United States is said to be demanding that Iran must give up all uranium enrichment (whether for civil or military needs), and disperse current stocks of processed uranium. U.S. negotiators are also seeking an end to Iranian long-range ballistic missile development and a scaling back of its decades-old regional expansionism program.\nIran, for its part, seems willing to accept oversight of its nuclear program and to keep uranium enrichment to the 3.67% level needed for civil purposes. The International Atomic Energy Agency believes that Iran already has a 275-kilogram stockpile of 60% enriched uranium. Iran also recognizes that following the reverses suffered by its Axis of Resistance allies in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, its regional expansionism program needs to be scaled back for now - but probably hopes it can continue its efforts in a more covert manner. More than anything else, Iran seeks sanctions relief, without which its economy cannot recover - threatening internal unrest. Nothing motivates the clerical leadership in Iran more than threats to its grip on power.\nThe scene is set for a major negotiating stand-off. Within the Iranian political leadership, this impasse is being approached differently by the hardliners surrounding the Supreme Leader and by mainstream political opinion. The hardcore faction, heavily invested in the infallibility of the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, is trumpeting robustness and the strength of Iran’s position - despite recent setbacks.\nMainstream politicians are taking a less aggressive line, with commanders of the regular armed forces stressing the effectiveness of Iran’s defenses. In a speech made at the Bandar Abbas Naval Base on May 12, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff, outlined this essentially reactive posture, saying that all operational plans in southern Iran had been reviewed to ensure “full readiness to confront any potential attack.”\nGeneral Bagheri warned that US bases in the region used to mount any US strikes on Iran would be targeted. This would include Al Udeid (Qatar), Al Dhafra (UAE), Naval Base Bahrain, Dimona (Israel), Muwaffaq Salti (Jordan), Camp Arifjan (Kuwait), Ain al-Assad (Iraq), and also the Naval Support Facility on Diego Garcia.\nThis threat was also extended generally to the countries in the region that host the US bases, and to Israel should it join in such attacks. If Operation True Promise-3 were to be launched against Israel, Bagheri said it could involve a barrage “from a thousand to thousands” of missiles, which could cripple Israel’s “military, economic, and technical infrastructure all at once.” Even a limited attack mounted against a GCC country would have a devastating impact on economic confidence. Iran has at least 24 identified missile and drone sites in the western half of the country, spread from north to south. All feature underground storage bunkers, from which both drone and missile mobile launchers can be driven out, ready to go into action within minutes.\nBagheri has also sought to bolster the credibility of Iran’s missile and drone fleet. IRGC missile sites are being retro-fitted with upgraded Qassem Basir missiles, which have a maneuverable warhead with passive terminal guidance. It is likely this warhead was fitted to the Houthi Palestine-2 missile, which penetrated Israel’s Arrow-2/3 air defense system on May 4, impacting on waste ground within Ben Gurion International Airport. On this occasion the Qassem Basir likewise defeated the US THAAD system, and did so again several days later. The IRGC missile fleet is also being bolstered with Emad and Khorramshahr-4 liquid fuel missiles, both also with separable warheads and longer ranges.\nSuch threats have been heard before. However, there was a new emphasis: the general’s revival of the threat to international shipping in the Gulf and Straits of Hormuz, specifically to foreign warships and oil tankers. The general thought such attacks, which by implication would close the Straits of Hormuz, could lead to oil prices rising to “$150 to $200” per barrel. Ignoring the fact that the United States as the world’s largest oil producer is now self-sufficient, he thought this would “be a major shock to the global economy.” He also ignored the likelihood that the biggest victim from any closure of the Straits of Hormuz could be Iran itself, rendered unable to export any of its own oil.\nEvidence on the ground suggests that Iran’s armed forces are indeed focusing on defensive measures. Missile defenses on the Iranian-controlled islands in the Gulf have been strengthened, with extra missile boats deployed to reinforce coastal defenses. On May 18, most of the regular Navy’s replenishment ships, on which long-range deployments depend, were in port in Bandar Abbas, and the Navy’s Red Sea presence has been curtailed. Also present alongside in the Naval Harbor were all three Alvand Class frigates, IRINSAlvand(F71), IRINSAlborz(F72) and IRINSSabalan(F73); the intelligence collector IRINS Zaghros (H313); and one of the two operational Moudge Class frigates. Taken together, this deployment pattern suggests a focus on home waters, covering the Straits of Hormuz and approaches.\nThe Iranian Air Force also seems similarly preoccupied with defense, with its commander Brigadier Amir Hamid Vahedi reporting that “all Air Force bases are 100 percent fully prepared, both in terms of manpower and equipment, to defend the skies of the country.”\nThe day after his address in Bandar Abbas Naval Harbour, General Bagheri visited the nearby Defense Industries Organization fabrication shed adjacent to the ISOICO Bostanu shipyard, where he inspected two half-completed submarines, construction of which appears to have stalled.  The submarines look to be about 30 meters in length, and are probably of Iran’s light coastal Ghadir Class, of which Iran has about 15 currently in service."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Trade Representative’s office is conducting its public hearings today, May 19, as it also closes the comment period for the proposed fees on Chinese-built ships and other elements, including port cranes. As it moves to finalize the structure, the shipping industry continues to oppose the proposed fees, while individual companies report they have strategies to avoid the fees.\nThe plan for how to penalize China for its unfair trade practices in shipbuilding wasreleasedin mid-April after USTR, acting on a complaint from five U.S. unions, found that the Chinese government was unfairly subsidizing its shipbuilders. It said China had aggressively moved to dominate global shipbuilding to the detriment of the U.S. and others.\nThe April proposal was a revision that restructured some of the elements the shipping industry had found onerous, lowering the costs, but continues to improve fees on Chinese shipping companies and Chinese-built ships calling at U.S. ports. It added a universal fee on all foreign-built car and vehicle carriers and imposes fees and regulations to shift a portion of U.S. LNG exports onto U.S.-built ships.\nWell-known industry analyst Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, commenting on the likely outcome of the current hearings and comment period, concludes, “We might expect fewer revisions this time around.” He, however, warns that shippers should expect carriers will attempt to pass on costs in the form of new surcharges.\nThe lobbying group, the World Shipping Council, has continued itsstrong oppositionsubmitting comments in this round over its continued serious concerns. It asserts that a “tax on all foreign vessels far exceeds the authority of the USTR.” They have called the proposed fee regime “a step in the wrong direction” to rebuild the U.S. merchant marine, noting the fees are retroactive and potentially disrupting long-term investment planning among carriers.\nThe WSC’s opposition centers on the fees based on net tonnage, which it says disproportionately penalize larger, more efficient vessels and U.S. ports that made significant investments to expand their capacity. It calls the universal fee on all foreign-built car carriers an “arbitrary action,” asserting that it will do little to encourage U.S. maritime investment. It asserts the calculations are incorrect in the proposal and calls for a per vehicle fee that applies credit for exported vehicles on the same vessel.\nJansen, however, called the second-round proposal “more manageable from a container shipping perspective.” He, too, however, notes it still contains “problematic elements,” such as the fees on car carriers.\nShipping lines, however, have already begun to plan for steps to avoid the U.S. fees on Chinese-built ships. CMA CGM’s finance director on Friday told reporters that all shipping firms, including China’s COSCO, “would adapt.”\nCMA CGM notes that less than half its fleet of approximately 670 ships is Chinese-built. It said it would reorganize its operations to ensure that it does not pay the U.S. port fees.\nIf the second round only undergoes smaller modifications, Jansen notes it would come into effect in mid-October or 180 days after adoption."

The rusting platforms are part ofArizona'shistory, but they are deteriorating, and one has already partially collapsed.\nUSSArizonais a symbol of the sacrifices that American servicemembers made in the Second World War. On December 7, 1941, the battleship came under intense attack by Japanese bombers; the fourth bomb that hit the deck detonatedArizona'sforward powder magazines, tearing apart the bow and sinking the ship at her berth.\nToday, the USS Arizona Memorial honors the 1,177 crewmen who died in the attack. More than two million people come to pay their respects every year, and every sitting president has visited the site since the memorial's installation.\nThe two platforms that can be seen above the water at the memorial site were not part of the battleship when it was sunk; they were only attached to the ship to help salvors removeArizona’smain guns and other equipment for the war effort. Workboats would tie up to the platforms to support dive operations and to carry away much-needed materials salvaged from the wreck. Three gun barrels from USSArizonawere laterrelined and fittedaboard USSNevada, which used them against Japanese positions on Iwo Jima and Okinawa.\nIn October 2023, one of the aging salvage platforms partially collapsed, prompting the Navy to assess their condition. It became apparent that the platforms now pose a risk to the sunken battleship, and must be removed for purposes of preservation and environmental protection. From the Navy's perspective, the removal signals the completion of the heroic salvage operation that began in 1942.\nThis week, U.S. Navy salvors plan to start the work of placing containment buoys and anchors in the waters surrounding the memorial site, a preparatory step for the removal of the two mooring platforms. As the work proceeds, the Pearl Harbor National Memorial and local officials are closely involved to ensure that the project fully respects the ship’s historic importance and its sacred status."

        "content": "\nThe long-running mystery spill at the Port of San Juan is back, but this time, the Coast Guard has found the culprit and implemented a solution.\nOn April 11, Station San Juan conducted a patrol in San Juan Harbor and discovered oil pollution in the water between piers 2 and 3. The Coast Guard discovered an aging, badly corroded steel pipe that was slowly leaking heavy black oil into the harbor. It is far from the first such occurrence in the port, so the Coast Guard response team collected samples from the pipe to be analyzed at the Coast Guard Marine Safety Lab for comparison against past spills.\nTo deal with the leak, the service tapped the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and contracted Clean Harbor Environmental Services as the spill response contractor. On April 15, Clean Harbor crews plugged the aging pipe and placed containment booms around it.\nOn May 5, Sector San Juan received the lab results on the spill samples. The material had similar characteristics to the oil from the spills at Pier 9 (in 2024) and Pier 4 (in 2021), indicating a common source of petroleum oil for all three.\nSector San Juan and Clean Harbor crews continue to monitor the site and replace the sorbent material as needed. The interagency response team plans to conduct a subsurface assessment to look for a possible source, and will come up with a plan to clean up any remaining free oil to reduce the odds of future leakage on the waterfront.\n“The source of the oil discharge is being contained and, while contained, will allow normal port operations to continue at Piers 2 and 3 as our investigation and response efforts continue,” Lt. Cmdr. Ray Lopez, Coast Guard Sector San Juan Incident Management Division chief."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "In a surprising reversal, the Trump administration has lifted the stop-work order on New York’s Empire Wind offshore energy project. Norway’s Equinor issued a brief statement reporting that it has been informed by the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) that the order was lifted allowing construction activities to resume.\nEquinor had threatened to walk away from the project while a concerted effort was underway to permit the project to proceed. Reports are indicating that a broad array of political pressure came from a wide range of fronts, all calling for the project, which was reported to be 30 percent complete, to proceed. Contractors working for Equinor were set to start the offshore work at the site when the Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum instructed BOEM on April 16 to suspend the license pending further review. It was alleged that information showed the permitting process had been rushed by the Biden administration, although all the permits were issued by mid-2024, and the financial decisions were made before the end of 2024.\nNorwegian Finance Minister, Jens Stoltenberg, is reported to have participated in a meeting between Equinor and White House officials seeking to clarify the stop-work order and what would be required to resume work. Unconfirmed media reports, however, had said there was no clear indication at the end of that meeting.\nNew York State Governor Kathy Hochul had issued a strong statement condemning the stop-work order. Late on Monday, May 19, the Governor issued a statement on X saying, “I’ve been working with President Donald Trump to save this project and today learned we’ve been successful. Grateful for his partnership on projects that create jobs here in New York.”\nEquinor, in its announcement, included a statement from Anders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor ASA, highlighting the breadth of the coalition that had developed. In addition to thanking Donald Trump, Opedal cited the support of Governor Hochul for her constructive collaboration with the Trump Administration, New York City Mayor Adams, congressional leaders including Senator Schumer, Senator Gillibrand, Representative Garbarino, and Representative Goldman, as well as labor groups and other advocates that have maintained their steadfast support for the project.\n“I would like to thank the Norwegian Prime Minister Støre and Minister of Finance Stoltenberg for their support at a critical time, and that the Minister of Finance raised the situation with the U.S. administration,” added Opedal.\nThe restoration of Empire Wind 1 secures jobs for more than 1,500 construction workers, drives economic development, and advances one of the largest energy infrastructure undertakings in the past 50 years for New Yorkers, commented Doreen Harris, President and CEO of New York’s regulator NYSERDA.\nEquinor had called the situation “urgent and unsustainable,” with reports it was costing the company $50 million a week. It had 11 vessels on standby and more than 100 people who had been scheduled to start the offshore portion of the project this spring. Equinor said it has invested about $2.7 billion so far in the project that was budgeted to cost $5 billion and would be liable to repay $1.5 billion in project financing as well as potential cancellation fees from suppliers.\nAfter the stop-work order was lifted, Equinor reported that it will perform an updated assessment of the project economics in the second quarter. Empire Wind, it said, aims to be able to execute planned activities in the offshore installation window in 2025 and reach its planned commercial operation date in 2027. Empire reports it will engage with suppliers and regulatory bodies to reduce the impact of the stop-work order.\nThe project, which will be located 15-30 miles south of New York’s Long Island, will consist of up to 130 wind turbines. It will have a capacity of 2.1 GW.\nNews of the reversal is also likely to relieve some anxiety in the industry, which was surprised by the Trump administration's unexpected efforts to stop a project that was underway. The administration, however, is still reviewing the industry and has also taken steps to stop a pre-construction project in New Jersey by removing an EPA permit that impacted construction."

According to the partners, the bunker hub will be optimally located to serve major ports, including Port Houston, the Port of Galveston, and the Port of Texas City.\nThe plan calls for the terminal to be developed in two phases. The first would involve a 140-acre site and will target an initial capacity of 360,000 gallons per day. The companies are targeting the second half of 2027 for the initial product deliveries. A second phase would require an additional eight to 12 months and provide a total capacity of 720,000 gallons per day. It will be supported by two 3-million-gallon storage tanks.\n“After several years of challenging and complex work bringing together the engineering, permitting, and third party supplies for gas and power to the project, we are now comfortably ahead in the marketplace to be the first dedicated LNG marine fuels supplier in the U.S. Gulf,” said Josh Lubarsky, President of Seapath Group. “We have made a significant financial commitment to this project and, over the course of the last several years, have positioned GLBP to be the foremost clean fuel supply hub in the Galveston Bay/Gulf region.”\nThe project, which is expected to cost more than $300 million, had received the necessary authorization from Texas earlier this year. Currently, LNG is being supplied by JAX LNG located in Jacksonville, Florida. It has a capacity of 360,000 gallons per day and is supplying LNG to the ports in South Florida as well."

The vessel's AIS signal suggests that it has resumed its commercial voyage and is headed outbound through the Gulf of Finland.\nEstonia's transport ministry reported that Russian forces had intercepted the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned tanker Green Admire in the early hours of Sunday morning, shortly after the vessel departed the Port of Sillamäe. The seaport is right next to the Russian border, and the tanker's route took it into Russian territorial seas, where Russian forces detained it. The vessel was diverted to Gogland, a Russian-controlled, heavily militarized island northwest of Sillamäe.\nThe route that Green Admire used is an internationally-approved safety corridor for deep-draft shipping, but it passes through Russian territorial seas. Estonia's transport board has recommended against transiting through Russian waters en route to and from Sillamäe since 2022, the year that Russia invaded Ukraine.\nOn this particular voyage, the pilot advised against the vessel's planned course through Russian territorial seas, Estonian Transport Board maritime chief Kristjan Truu told ERR. The final decision on routing is always up to the master.\nRussian authorities also warned Green Admire repeatedly not to navigate into a designated \"dangerous area\" for shipping, and the vessel disregarded the warnings, Deputy Chief of the Navy Johan-Elias Seljamaa told ERR. The area closure had been in place for some time, and Russia had never enforced it before, he said. The ship had taken the same route on its arrival in Estonia without incident. The brief detention was the first time in recent history that Russian forces have interfered with Estonia's merchant shipping traffic, the transport ministry told ERR.\nThere is an alternative route through Estonian waters to reach Sillamäe, but it is surrounded by shoals and requires more course changes, and many vessel operators do not prefer it. For now, Estonian authorities are recommending that deep-draft shipping take the more complicated route and stay out of Russian waters.\n"

The group said that its decision to re-escalate was motivated by Israeli military operations in Gaza.\nThe Houthi communications center for Red Sea traffic said that going forward, the group will impose a long-distance naval blockade on Haifa. All vessels are \"prohibited\" from loading or unloading at Israel's largest seaport, spokesman Ahmed Salah said in a statement. Israel's other two major ports, Ashdod and Eilat, do not appear to be included in the \"blockade\" at this time.\nThe Houthis do not have the naval might to enforce a direct blockade in the Eastern Mediterranean, but they can target the fleets belonging to shipowners who trade to Haifa. Shipping interests who use the Suez route have to run the gauntlet past Houthi territory in Yemen, and even after a weekslong campaign of round-the-clock U.S. bombardment in March and April, the Houthis still have a meaningful capability to launch attacks on vessels passing by in the Red Sea.\n\"The presence of any vessels heading to the Port of Haifa, or having any indirect connection thereto, will expose your company and its fleet to sanctions,\" Salah said. \"In the event that your company is listed on the sanctions list, its fleet will be prohibited from transiting the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandab Strait, the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean. Moreover, it will be subject to targeting by the Yemeni Armed Forces wherever reachable.\"\nThe statement raises the risk level for all international shipping (with the possible exception of U.S.-flagged vessels, which were covered by the group's recent ceasefire agreement with the Trump administration). The Haifa \"blockade\" could easily result in collateral damage: while the Houthis have attacked vessels with documented links to Israel, they have also repeatedly attacked ships that have no clear Israeli ties - and they have even hit vessels linked to their own allies. Shipping interests have learned that almost any ship could become a targeted \"Israeli-linked ship\" in the southern Red Sea."

The four medium-sized liquified gas carriers will be among the first to be launched in a forward-looking effort by commodities trader Trafigura.\nThe order for the four vessels was announced in April 2024 as Trafigura proceeds to develop the opportunities with alternative fuels. The company highlighted its testing of LNG, methanol. LPG and biofuels, highlighting that it organizes over 5,000 voyages annually with around 400 ships under management.\nHD Hyundai Mipo reports that a final agreement has been reached on the dual-fuel propulsion engines for the vessels. The vessels will be capable of operating on ammonia when delivered starting in 2027. Work is expected to begin on construction in the second half of 2026, with the four ships delivered to the owner by 2028.\nThe yard highlights that the specifications of the vessels have also evolved as the designs were finalized. The ships will have an overall length of 623 feet (190 meters) and a beam of 98 feet (30 meters). They will be built at the company's Ulsan, South Korea yard.\nThe ships will have a transport capacity of 45,000 cubic meters of liquefied gas. This will include the potential to transport ammonia as well as LPG and vinyl Chloride Monomer.\nAmmonia, the shipyard highlights, can be stored in pressurized tanks (approximately 8 bar) or low-temperature tanks (-33 degrees C) without cryogenic technology, and when liquefied, it has a storage density 1.7 times higher than that of liquefied hydrogen (-253 degrees C) in the same volume, making it suitable for large-scale, long-distance transportation and storage of hydrogen.\nThe shipyard highlights that it received the first order for ammonia carriers in 2023. Last year, it highlighted receiving an AiP (Approval in Principle) basic design certificate for the gas carrier concept from DNV and had developed an “ammonia leak prevention system” to block even the smallest amount of ammonia from leaking outside the containment system. It also received design approvals for an ammonia fuel cell-based carbon-free electric propulsion system, an ammonia-propelled petrochemical product carrier, and an ammonia-propelled container feeder ship.\nTrafigura highlights its effort to develop new markets to lead the shipping industry toward decarbonization. It said it was committed to helping to develop the low-carbon fuels and vessels required to decarbonize global shipping.\n"

The conference concluded with a joint declaration by member states, which received welcome approval from EU shipbuilders and shipowners.\n“The Szczecin Declaration is a pivotal moment for Europe’s maritime industries, especially for the maritime manufacturing industry, which has been lacking political support and impactful measures for far too long, despite unfair competition from Asia,\" said Alberto Maestrini, chairman of shipbuilders' association SEA Europe. \"Europe must protect its maritime industrial base and cannot do without commercial shipbuilding if it wants to secure its naval capabilities, cross-fertilization between commercial and naval industry, and sovereignty.\"\nThe European Community Shipowners' Associations (ECSA), the voice of EU shipping, emphasized that - unlike comparable efforts in the United States - the Szczecin Declaration is not protectionist. Instead, it centers on investments in innovation and competitiveness, and emphasizes the \"level playing field\" of global (rather than European) regulations on shipping.\nThe declaration contains much to like for EU owners, ECSA said, including an endorsement of some of the association's main priorities:\n- a call for regulatory action to stimulate production of green fuels, which will be needed for compliance but are currently hard to source\n- measures to underwrite the cost of expensive clean fuel using ETS revenues\n\"We welcome the support for key priorities for the European Shipowners such as the need to de-risk investments in clean fuels and technology and to maintain a fit-for-purpose regulatory and taxation framework,\" said ECSA Secretary General Sotiris Raptis in a statement.\nSEA Europe welcomed the declaration's focus on key problems for European shipbuilding. The association thanked EU ministers for recognizing the strategic security and defense role of EU shipyards; the key role of decarbonization tech in positioning EU maritime manufacturing for leadership; the distortionary effects of non-EU nations' shipbuilding subsidy programs; the full dependence of EU owners on Asian yards for tonnage; and the restrictive effects of EU banking rules on EU ship financing.\n"

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has launched investigations into a pair of separate vessel fires that occurred in Puerto Rico over the weekend, according to agency representatives.\nThe more recent incident unfolded early Saturday at Puerto Nuevo Channel's N Wharf, where the Marshall Islands-flagged chemical tankerScot Stuttgartsuffered an engine room fire while berthed alongside. The tanker first reported an auxiliary engine fire to the Coast Guard at about 0345 hours.\nCrewmembers deployed the vessel's built-in fire suppression system, and the situation initially appeared resolved. However, about two hours later, dark smoke began coming out of the same area, suggesting a possible reflash.\nThe crew sealed off the compartment and activated the suppression system again. Shortly after, local firefighting teams arrived to confirm the blaze had been successfully contained.\nThis emergency followed an earlier incident involving the ferryBreezy Point,which transports passengers between mainland Puerto Rico and Vieques Island. According to officials, the vessel experienced a fire in the port side engine compartment Friday evening, shortly after arriving at Vieques with travelers aboard.\nThe Coast Guard received notice of the ferry incident shortly after 2100 hours, by which point all passengers had safely disembarked. When initial attempts to control the flames with portable equipment proved inadequate, crew members activated the vessel's integrated suppression system, successfully extinguishing the fire before municipal emergency responders arrived.\nThe incidents resulted in no reported injuries or environmental contamination, though monitoring continues as a precautionary measure. Coast Guard investigators from Sector San Juan continue examining both incidents.\n“Each of these vessel fires warrant investigations to learn causative factors and prevent future incidents from occurring with potential risk to human lives and impacts to Puerto Rico’s maritime transportation and marine environment,\" said Capt. Luis J. Rodriguez, Coast Guard Sector San Juan commander. \"I commend the crews from both vessels for their initial actions that led to the fires being extinguished, as well as the efforts of responding firefighting crews, which collectively led to preventing the loss of life and averting a more catastrophic outcome.”"

        "content": "The cruise industry continues its rush to ultra-large ships with MSC Cruises reporting the order of two additional 217,000 gross ton mega cruise ships from Chantiers de l’Atlantique in France. The line, which currently has 23 cruise ships in operation and two under construction, will add two additional ships to its World Class due for delivery in 2029 and 2030, each with a capacity for over 6,700 passengers.\nNews of the order was highlighted by France’s Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, who said the order represents an investment of nearly €3.5 billion ($3.93 billion) and more than 20 million hours of work. It was reported that MSC has supported €5.6 billion ($6.3 billion) in investments related to the recently delivered second ship of the class,MSC World America, and the third and fourth ships, which have been namedMSC World AsiaandMSC World Atlantic.\nThe ships add to an overall cruise ship order book that currently stands at 69 cruise ships with an estimated value of more than $55 billion, according to Seatrade Cruise. MSC was the second cruise company after Royal Caribbean International to surpass the 200,000 gross ton threshold. Carnival Cruise Line recently announced the first details for its Project Ace, which will build three 230,000 gross ton cruise ships, while Norwegian Cruise Line finalized its order for four 226,000 gross ton cruise ships.\nThe industry continues to increase the size of its ships both to realize economies of scale and to create space for new amenities. Today, May 19, Meyer Turku reported the world’s largest cruise ship,Star of the Seas(250,800 gross tons) for Royal Caribbean International began sea trials ahead of her delivery this summer. Royal Caribbean has two more ships of the Icon class on order, options for two more, and in France, one Oasis class ship is also on order. Disney Cruise Line also joins the mega ship group with the introduction ofDisney Adventure(208,000 gross tons) in December.\nConstruction work for the new MSC ships will begin in 2027, which would coincide with the delivery of theMSC World Atlanticfor which the yard cut first steel in March. She will be positioned in Port Canaveral, Florida for the winter of 2027-2028 to operate Caribbean cruises. She will be following theMSC World Asia, which is due in late 2026 and will start operations in the Mediterranean.\nMSC has invested approximately €18 billion ($20 billion) in 25 years building 19 cruise ships in France, including the November 2022 launch of the new class with theMSC World Europa. The companies highlight that the World class ships are among the most energy-efficient cruise ships using the latest-generation of LNG-fueled engines that are also equipped to use biofuels or synthetic renewable fuels. They also have shore power connections, advanced wastewater treatment systems, and a comprehensive onboard waste management and recycling system.\nThe World class, which measures 1,092 feet (333 meters) in length, is also highlighted for the broad range of amenities. It has 19 food outlets, 18 bars and lounges, dedicated areas for children and families, and one of the tallest dry slides at sea. It also combines a large open-air World Promenade with a three-level interior galleria with shops, lounges, bars, and restaurants.\nHaving entered the cruise segment 37 years ago, and initially with a rag-tag second-hand fleet, MSC has grown to be one of the largest global operators. In addition to the 23 cruise ships in the broader contemporary segment, the group launched an ultra-luxury brand, Explora Journeys, for which it is building six deluxe cruise ships. It is also an investor in passenger ferries in Italy, in addition to the larger commercial shipping segment of containerships and more recently car carriers."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nWith the ongoing challenges in the offshore wind energy sector impacting the economics and development of sites, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark have each announced revised approaches for their upcoming tenders to deal with as the Dutch termed it, the “deteriorating market conditions.”\nEuropean governments have been exploring different approaches and the levels of subsidies required to support the development of the sector. Denmark in January shelved plans for a tender while its parliament was exploring the model, as did Norway. Last week, the Netherlands’ Ministry of Climate Policy and Green Growth announced it was also revising its terms and that it would only be proceeding with one scaled-down site and deferring two others.\nThe Netherlands had originally planned to offer three sites in September, ranging between 1 and 2 GW of capacity. The Dutch government’s plans to proceed with the auctions on a “zero-subsidy” model ran into trouble. Major developers including Ørsted said they would not be participating in the upcoming round because they believed the sites would not be financially viable.\nCalling wind energy “indispensable” in the country’s current and future energy plan, the ministry said it was taking steps to make the auction more attractive to allow developers to proceed at a realistic price. Rules and criteria are being relaxed with the government simplifying the requirements for developers. They will also be providing a provision that the winning bidder will have the ability to revoke the permit in the first two years if market conditions are too bad.\nThe Netherlands will proceed with a single auction in September for a reduced size from 2 GW to 1 GW for the one project, Nederwiek Wind Farm Site I-A.  They said this would lower the risk for the developer. The planned sites at Ijmuiden Ver Gamma A and Gamma B, each of which would be 1 GW, will be deferred with tenders planned for a later date.\nLonger-term the government is looking to the release of a new action plan for the offshore wind energy industry. Among the steps being considered for the period starting from 2027 are financial support instruments. They cite the possibility of establishing minimum and maximum price guarantees.\nDenmark reports that it has decided to proceed with a new auction in September for 3 GW of capacity. The government is committing up to $8.32 billion over the 20-year life of the projects in subsidies.\nNorway is also restarting the bidding for its Utsira Nord area, accepting applications from developers till September 15. It had previously stopped this site, which will require floating wind turbines. It will offer three leases, each with a capacity of up to 500 MW, and the terms were established to recognize the early development stage of the floating wind technology.\nNorway will give the selected bidders two years to mature the projects after selection. It is also committing to up to $3.36 billion in subsidies to support the development and operation of the large-scale floating wind farms.\nGovernments are looking for new means to encourage offshore wind development despite the rising costs and supply chain problems. Earlier this month, the UK incurred a setback in its plans when Ørsted announced it had decided to discontinue the Hornsea 4 project (2.4 GW) in its current form. It cited several adverse developments relating to the continued increase of supply chain costs, higher interest rates, and an increase in the risk to construct and operate Hornsea 4 on the planned timeline for a project of its scale."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe American Association of Port Authorities continued to fiercely advocate for ports during its testimony and response to the U.S. Trade Representative’s proposal to add fees on Chinese-built ships, car carriers, and Chinese-manufactured port cranes. AAPA, which has been fighting against the fees on cranes, said today, May 19, during the USTR testimony, “raising tariffs on Chinese cranes another 100 percent will not magically revitalize an American crane manufacturing industry that has been nonexistent for decades.”\nAdvocating on behalf of port operators, AAPA CEO Cary Davis said the industry “still has serious concerns about the economic consequences” of the revised USTR proposal issued in April for the fees to punish China for its policies to control the shipping industry and logistics through its subsidies of shipbuilders and ZMPC, China crane manufacturer which dominates the industry. Davis acknowledged positive changes versus the first draft, but voiced strong opposition to the fees on crane imports and all foreign-built vehicle carriers. AAPA estimates the proposals could cost ports nearly $7 billion in fees.\n\"Applying a new 100 percent tariff to Chinese STS cranes will not create a domestic crane manufacturing industry out of thin air,\" stated Davis in official comments submitted to the Federal Register. \"It will only increase costs for public port authorities.\"\nAAPA called the proposed additional fees on Chinese-manufactured port cranes “a tax on port development.” It highlights that port operators can not “easily shop around for a better price,” because ZMPC controls 70 percent or more of the market, and the other manufacturers do not have the production capacity to replace ZMPC. It highlights that the only options are Mitsui, Konecranes, and Liebherr.\nThe trade group is calling on the USTR not to make the fees retroactive so that they cover cranes ordered before the April 17 release of the proposal. “Applying this tariff to cranes that are already contracted for delivery will not discourage China’s unfair manufacturing practices or encourage American manufacturing of STS cranes,” said Davis.\nAs an example, it cites the Port of Houston, which it says is facing “grim circumstances.” Houston has eight cranes at a cost of $14 million each ($112 million total) contracted for delivery in the spring of 2026. AAPA says that with all the proposed tariffs, Houston’s cost would skyrocket to over $302 million.\nIt is also calling for a one-to-two-year delay on the tariff while supporting an effort to have Congress establish a tax credit to encourage domestic production. It also points out ambiguities in the rules, such as whether cranes would also face the reciprocal tariffs and fentanyl tariffs separately imposed by Donald Trump. In 2024, the Biden administration also imposed 25 percent tariffs on Chinese STS cranes.\nAAPA is equally strong in its opposition to the fees on cars carried on foreign-built vessels, saying that if it had been in the first draft, there would have been strong opposition broadly across the industry. It says those fees will impose “severe harm on the port communities that specialize in the automotive trade.” While questioning if these fees are within the authority of USTR, it also points out that there is no method to distinguish imports from exports, as these car carriers offload foreign cars and load U.S. cars for export.\nSimilarly, it asserted to USTR that the quota of exported LNG on U.S.-built vessels is “infeasible and will cause instability.”\nAAPA told USTR it supports the idea of reshoring to the U.S. but said it must be done more strategically, not to hurt ports, American industry, and consumers. It was one of the speakers commenting today on the second draft of the fee proposal. USTR is expected to finalize the proposal and move forward with implementation, which could happen as early as mid-October."

        "content": "A shadowy, newly built LPG tanker that has been linked to efforts to fund Iran is potentially going to be sold under a new license issued today, May 20, by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The vessel has been stranded in an anchorage off Houston, Texas, for the past 11 months and in April was officially sanctioned by the United States.\nThe vessel, theTinos 1, has been a bit of a mystery, operating in the shadows of Iran and the efforts to raise money to support Iran’s military. It is a 93,000 cbm VLGC which was highlighted by its Chinese builders, Jiangnan Shipyard (a division of CSSC), as an advanced fourth-generation design. It is 230 meters (755 feet) in length with a service speed of 16.5 knots. The vessel was delivered on May 10, 2024, and it is reportedly owned by a division of CSSC on a lease-back agreement to an UAE-based company, Pearl Petrochemical FZE. It is registered in Panama.\nAccording to the U.S. Treasury, the newly delivered vessel proceeded in the spring of 2024 to the United States on its first voyage and attempted in June 2024 to load LPG in Texas. The vessel was to take on the cargo in Houston, and the U.S. reports it was to be sold to China. Treasury did not provide details, but said the vessel failed to load the cargo.\nOFAC in April 2025 moved to disrupt Iran’s gas trade and included Pearl Petrochemical FZE in its latestsanctions. It reported that the company was controlled but what it described as an “LPG magnate” who was operating a complex network of trades to raise money for Iran. According to the U.S. statement, Seyed Asadoollah Emamjomeh, his corporate network, and his son, Meisam Emamjomeh, have been responsible for shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian LPG and crude oil to foreign markets. All of them were listed along with the vessel.\nOFAC’snew licenseprovides for a number of transactions related to the vessel, including the sale of the ship, “provided the net proceeds of the sale be placed into a blocked interest-bearing account at a U.S. financial institution.” It is limiting the sale to the U.S. and the vessel’s entry into any new contracts with blocked persons.\nAs an alternative, OFAC is also making it possible for the safe docking and anchoring of the vessel, emergency repairs, and environmental mitigation or protection activities. They are also permitting actions for the health and safety of the crew and the provisioning of the vessel, bunkering, pilotage, towing, and similar services.\nThese sanctions were part of the Trump administration’s latest efforts, which were described as “maximum pressure” to stop the oil trade and funds reaching Iran. Trump has vowed to bring Iran’s oil sales to zero and to extend the sanctions to foreign parties involved in the trade."

        "content": "Months after having completed the acquisition of the Philly Shipyard, South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean is planning to invest more than $70 million to modernize and expand the shipbuilder’s operations to realize the opportunities as the U.S. looks to revitalize its navy and merchant marine. According to reports in the Korean media, the company detailed the plans to expand production at the Philadelphia yard during a tour with Korean stock analysts.\nThe Korean Economic Daily reports the company told analysts that it will increase the production capacity at the yard, which currently delivers about one ship a year, to a capability to build eight to ten ships per year.\nA team of 50 specialists is on site at the yard from Korea working with the newly installed management to assess current conditions at the yard and develop the plans for productivity improvements and modernizing the facilities. They are planning a technology transfer from the company’s Geoje Shipyard in South Korea and the implementation of new technologies such as welding robots.\nHanwha purchased the shipyard for $100 million, closing the acquisition in December 2024. Even before the deal was completed, it highlighted the opportunities to expand into additional government work, possibly as a components supplier building sections of ships with other yards for the navy or auxiliary fleet. With the SHIPS Act in Congress and the Trump White House calling for rapid growth of the U.S. fleet, the yard sees strong potential, including leveraging its expertise in LNG carriers to build the first U.S.-flagged vessels. The proposal from the U.S. Trade Representative includes a requirement for a portion of U.S. LNG exports to be conducted with U.S.-built and flagged ships.\nPhilly Shipyard was started in 1997 as a government partnership with Norway’s Kvaerner Shipbuilding division at a portion of the former Philly Naval Shipyard. In the early 2000s, production began, and the yard built product tankers and containerships. It reports that it has built half of the current Jones Act vessels in the U.S. since 2000. When Hanwha Ocean acquired it, the order book consisted of the five MARAD training ships, a rock installation vessel for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company, and three containerships for Matson.\nHanwha Ocean reportedly told the analysts that the site had lacked investment for many years. The yard is currently only operating the Number 4 dry dock for assembly and the Number 5 dry dock as an outfitting berth. Plans call for modernizing the Number 4 dry dock and rehabilitating the Number 5 dry dock to be fully functional for additional assembly space.\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper reported in April that a Congressional delegation visited the shipyard. The newspaper writes that management discussed the need for additional space. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware suggested that he would explore moving the stored vessels by the U.S. Navy adjacent to the yard to provide additional space for Hanwha Ocean. The company also said it was exploring industrial space across the Delaware River in New Jersey for the possible expansion of its operations.\nHanwha Ocean told the analysts during the tour that the goal is to increase revenues from the yard from the current level of $368 million per year to $4 billion per year by 2035. It will also look to more than double the current workforce to 3,000 employees over the next decade."

        "content": "\nCiting the new waves of drone attacks on Ukraine despite the reported progress made during a call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, the UK and European Union pushed forward with additional sanctions targeting more shadow fleet tankers as well as the enablers and other segments of the Russian economy that support the war effort. EU officials are calling the package approved today, May 20, by the European Council the “most wide-sweeping since the start of the war,” while the UK said it was also in discussions with counterparts to tighten the price cap on Russian oil.\nThe European Council approved the 17th sanction package since the start of the war, which had been outlined in the ministers’ meeting last week. Officials are highlighting that this round is “heavily targeting Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers, their operators, as well as a major Russian oil producer.”\nThe final list includes 189 vessels originating from third countries used in the Russian oil trade. The EU is highlighting that it has more than doubled the number of vessels included in the sanctions. The number of designated vessels now stands at 342, although experts have said as many as 800 or more vessels have participated in the trade.\nEU officials, however, are touting the success of their efforts, saying that since the oil price cap and shadow fleet sanctions began, Russia’s oil revenues have decreased by approximately $43 billion. Russia’s revenues, they are saying, were down nearly 14 percent in March 2025 compared to March 2023, and 20 percent lower than March 2022.\nWith today’s additions of 75 new listings (17 persons and 58 entities) in addition to the shadow fleet vessels, the EU says it has now imposed sanctions on over 2,400 individuals and entities. This includes operators of the tankers, oil companies, companies supplying the Russian army with drones, weapons, ammunition, equipment, components, and logistical support. They are also targeting foreign companies supporting Russia, including today adding three in China, one in Belarus, and another in Israel.\nThe UK cited the overnight attacks on Ukraine launched after yesterday’s call with Trump, as well as the 273 drones fired at Ukrainian cities on May 17. Today’s sanctions from the UK listed 100 companies and individuals across the Russian military, energy, and financial sectors, as well as 18 additional tankers. Last week, the UK announced it had also added 110 shadow fleet tankers to the sanctions.\nThe UK also listed a British national who is an accountant and broker, whom they accuse of buying tankers for Russia. The Financial Times reports that John Michael Ormerod acquired at least 25 tankers between December 2022 and August 2023, spending more than $700 million. The paper says the tankers were placed in corporations in the Marshall Islands, but were for Lukoil’s Dubai-based Eiger Shipping, and that the tankers transported more than 120 million barrels of oil from Russia.\nA lawyer for the accountant told the Financial Times that Ormerod’s purchases did not violate any sanctions. He said Ormerod had ended his involvement before any of the tankers were sanctioned.\nThe UK is also listing two Russian captains. They contend the individuals have been involved with the operations of the shadow tanker fleet.\nThe G7’s efforts at controlling the Russian oil trade, however, have been challenged as the price of oil fell below the $60 price cap. In May, oil traded as low as $57 a barrel and currently sits just over $62 a barrel. The UK confirmed it is working with its partners to tighten the oil price cap, saying they were exploring lowering the cap price close to the cost of production to “hit Putin where it hurts by striking at his oil revenues.”\nThe EU and UK had hoped the U.S. might join them in increasing the sanctions. Donald Trump, however, has said good progress was made on yesterday’s call to discuss a ceasefire as a step to resolving the war. Trump has threatened to increase sanctions but also promised Russia trade deals when the war ends."

The team plans to recover the rest of the vessel's rigging, then parbuckle the wreck and raise it out of the water. The objective is to uncover new evidence to support two parallel investigations into the cause of the sinking. Raising the yacht will also address the risk of pollution from remaining fuel in its tanks.\nA salvage project of this size and complexity is not without risks.

Based onBayesian'sdesign and her configuration at the time of the casualty,MAIB concludedthat the vessel would have been vulnerable to capsizing when exposed to wind gusts of as little as 63 knots on the beam. On the night of the accident, the vessel's mast was bare, its retractable keel was raised, and it had just 10 percent stores on board - a combination not covered by in the vessel's stability book."

        "content": "\nMalaysia Maritime reports an enforcement action that saw an MSC containership detained and its captain and second engineer taken ashore for questioning after the vessel anchored reportedly without permission. The authorities reported that if convicted, they could impose a fine of up to approximately $23,000, two years in prison, or both penalties.\nThe incident began on the morning of May 16 when the Area Control Centre identified what the authorities were calling a “suspicious vessel.” They began monitoring the movement of the containership at approximately 0920 local time, and by around 1320, the vessel was noted to be stationary.\nA maritime patrol boat was dispatched to investigate. It located the containership which had anchored about 22.5 nautical miles southwest of the town of Sekinchan, located north of Kuala Lumpur on the west coast of Malaysia in the Malacca Strait.\nThe Malaysian authorities published a photo of the vessel but obscured the name of the ship and did not release the details. It clearly shows MSC markings and corresponds with theMSC Olia(48,186 dwt), which is registered in Liberia. The vessel has a capacity of 3,760 TEU and, according to MSC’s online schedule, was coming from Jakarta, due in Singapore on May 17. The ship, built in 2007, has been owned by MSC since 2021, when it was acquired from Bernhard Schulte.\nMalaysia Maritime reports that its team boarded the containership and inspected the crew’s paperwork. It said there were 23 crewmembers aboard from various countries, and they all had “complete identification documents.”\nThey, however, reported that the “captain of the ship had failed to submit any documents of anchoring permission.” The captain, a 44-year-old Russian national and the second engineer were taken to the headquarters of Selangor State Maritime for “further investigation.”\nMalaysia and several neighboring countries are known for strict enforcement policies and have frequently detained vessels on similar charges. Security is a concern in the region, which is known as a hot spot for illegal ship-to-ship oil transfers involving Iranian shipments. The Malacca and Singapore Straits in 2025 have also seen a spike in robberies. In 2022, however, officials in Indonesia were compelled todeny allegationsin the media that the navy had been soliciting payments from detained vessels. Reuters reported that the payments were beingsolicitedfrom vessels stopped and charged will illegally anchoring.\nNo further details were released by Malaysia Maritime. The AIS signal for the vessel shows it is now docked in Port Klang."

At about 0310 hours on Tuesday morning, a fire broke out on the BBLT platform's cellar deck. The fire was brought under control by company employees who responded \"immediately,\" Chevron said. 17 people were injured in the accident.\nChevron's local subsidiary, Cabgoc, is focused on the safety of all other personnel and on getting to the root causes of the casualty. An investigation is under way, supported by Angolan regulator ANPG.\nBBLT is a bottom-fixed compliant tower platform located about 50 nautical miles off the Cabinda coast of Angola. The platform's rare design relies on a 1,200-foot flexible platform jacket, which is partially supported by its own buoyancy. The jacket can sway horizontally, giving it better resistance to wave action. Examples include Chevron's Petronius platform, Exxon's Lena, and BBLT.\nThe platform's maximum production capacity is 220,000 barrels per day. The effect of the fire on the timeline for resuming operations is not immediately known."

Due to enter commercial service in August, the ship will be slightly larger than her sisterIcon of the Seas, and at an expected 250,800 gross tons, she becomes the largest cruise ship in the world.\nRoyal Caribbean highlights that the sea trials mark a key milestone in the construction of the ship and come less than 100 days ahead of her debut in her homeport of Port Canaveral, Florida. Over a total of 11 days, more than 2,000 experts from the naval architecture, engineering, navigation, and design spaces are testing the ship across a wide range of areas, mostly focusing on technical operations.\nThe ship, based on its AIS signal, is currently in the Baltic undertaking its tests. The line reports this includes how the ship moves through the open water as well as testing engine performance. They are saying the new ship, which is 1,196 feet (364 meters) in length and has 20 decks, reached a speed of 25 knots while they were pushing its engine performance to the limits. TheStar of the Seaswill cover hundreds of miles during these tests.\nIt is the next critical step for the ship which was floated from the assembly dock in September 2024 and started its engines for the first time in February. She was fueled with LNG for the first time in April. After the sea trials, the ship will return for the final phase of construction and outfitting at the Meyer Turku shipyard in Turku, Finland. Another acceptance trial is anticipated closer to delivery and her August 2025 debut.\n\n\n\nShe followsIcon of the Seas, which is 248,663 gross tons. Introduced in January 2024, she became the largest cruise ship in the world. Each of the ships has a double occupancy of approximately 5,600 passengers (total occupancy of approximately 7,600 passengers using all berths) and a crew of 2,350. Royal Caribbean typically makes small changes to each ship in a class, with the later vessels becoming slightly larger in size, as is the case with Star of the Seas.\nThey highlight that the design features eight “neighborhoods” that are destinations in themselves, designed for families, children, suite passengers, entertainment, and other experiences. The ship will feature 26 dining locations and 18 bars and lounges. They are boasting of the fastest and tallest waterslides and seven pools, among the amusements aboard.\nStar of the Seasis the third of the line’s LNG-fueled cruise ships, and she will be offering 7-day cruises to the Eastern and Western Caribbean from the central Florida homeport. She joinsUtopia of the Seas(236,473 gross tons), which was introduced last summer and also sails from Port Canaveral.\n\n\nStar of the Seas went to sea for the first time on May 18 (RCI)\n\nRoyal Caribbean was the first to surpass the 200,000 gross ton threshold in 2009 with theOasis of the Seas(226,838 gross tons) and continues to expand in this ultra-large ship category. The company has built six ships in the Oasis class with a seventh on order at Chantiers de l’Atlantique. A third Icon class ship, namedLegend of the Seas, is being assembled in the building dock in Finland and will enter service next year. A fourth Icon class ship is on order for delivery in 2027, and the line has options for two more ships of the class.\nThe success of the ultra large ships has spurred MSC Cruises to introduce its World class (217,000 gross tons) with two ships in service and now four more on order. Disney Cruise Line will also introduce a 208,000 gross ton cruise ship in December 2025. Both Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line have ordered ultra-large cruise ships to be built by Fincantieri."

Risks have not gone away, but U.S. stakeholders are taking steps to address the threat.\n\"Widespread adoption of Multi-Factor Authentication and technical improvements against phishing have helped drive this change, but there is still much more work to do,\" Coast Guard Cyber Command said.\nCyberattack risks for maritime stakeholders remain serious. The Coast Guard responded to 36 reported cyber incidents in 2024, and the average cost per breach for victims came to about $4.9 million. 70 percent of incidents resulted in significant or very significant disruption for the targeted organization.\nPhishing remains the most common vulnerability for hackers' initial point of entry, and financial gain - using coercive techniques like ransomware - remains a primary motivator for attackers.\nThe risks of an attack spreading from shoreside IT networks to vessel computer systems is increasing, the service warned. In years past, ships were air-gapped, but with the advent of inexpensive satellite broadband and cloud computing, that is changing rapidly. \"Cyberattacks impacting a company’s enterprise network are now far more likely to impact shipboard Information Technology (IT) systems and potentially impact vessel operations,\" the service warned.\nThe agency devoted special attention to the risks associated with ZPMC's ship-to-shore cranes. These Chinese-built cranes dominate the world market for STS equipment, but they run on digital systems that are filled with security gaps, the Coast Guard warned - including operating systems and comms protocols that are outdated and are known to be vulnerable.\nThe most concerning elements, though, are certain crane models' built-in cellular modems and remote-access contract clauses, which could allow unwanted remote monitoring or control. (ZPMC is owned by the Chinese state, and is subject to Chinese intelligence-collection laws.) No such unauthorized activity has been detected, but neither has the service been focused on efforts to detect it; to date it has put staff time towards vulnerability identification rather than counterintelligence, the center said.\nThe Coast Guard believes that any malicious activity on ZPMC's cranes (if it exists) would be well-concealed within everyday network traffic, and operators will first have to implement cybersecurity best practices before they can root out any unknown intruders. In all events, the service advises minimizing remote access authorization for ZPMC or any other third party.\n\"Scrutinize contract language that requires remote access, installation of cellular modems, or other third-party maintenance procedures. Conduct routine physical audits to verify compliance with contractual agreements,\" the Coast Guard advised terminal operators. \"The partners with the best crane security postures have been aggressive in challenging these access requirementsthrough the contracting process.\"\nCriminal hackers are becoming more businesslike\nOn Tuesday, managed satcom service leader Marlink released its own report card for the second half of 2024, and it reported concerning results. Marlink's security centers are now seeing cybercriminals use more advanced, efficient tactics and more AI automation to accelerate their attacks.\nMarlink's security centers dealt with 50 managed major incidents across a global fleet of 2,000 vessels in the second half of the year, along with nearly 11,000 malware incidents and billions of lesser events. AI is powering cyber threat actors' evolutionary process, speeding up phishing campaigns and helping to write new hacking tools. Meanwhile, professional \"access brokers\" have created a growing hack-for-hire market, selling illegal access to corporate networks for other criminals to exploit.\n\"H2 2024 saw a marked evolution in cyber threats, as malicious actors adopted increasingly efficient, structured, and business-like approaches to cybercrime, putting additional pressure on the maritime industry,\" warned Nicolas Furgé, President, Marlink Cyber."

        "content": "\nAfter a request from U.S. deep sea mining startup Impossible Minerals and a new executive order from President Donald Trump, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has launched the process to hold a mineral lease sale for polymetallic nodule collection off the coast of American Samoa. If approved, it would be the first commercial license for deep sea mineral collection that has been awarded in a generation, and it could provide a test run for a sovereign licensing process that would sidestep oversight by the UN International Seabed Authority (ISA).\n\"Critical minerals are fundamental to strengthening our nation's resilience and safeguarding our national interests,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. \"By providing opportunities to responsibly access deep-sea mineral resources, we are supporting both American economic growth and national security.\"\nThe president's recent executive order - formulated with input from Canadian firm The Metals Company - drew scrutiny for proposing American permits for work outside of American waters. The order instructed the Commerce Department to come up with a U.S. leasing mechanism for areas beyond sovereign jurisdiction. For legal underpinning, the order taps the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act, an obscure statute from the 1980s. This Cold War-era law provides a pathway to unilateral resource recovery on the high seas, bypassing the ISA, which has jurisdiction under UNCLOS. (The U.S. has not ratified UNCLOS.)\nThis plan attracted criticism from environmental NGOs and from the ISA, whichhas arguedin favor of a UN-mandated licensing system for areas  \"the common heritage of mankind.\"\nThe most commercially compelling and easily-exploited resource base for deep-sea mining exists in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, midway between Central America and Hawaii, where polymetallic nodules can be found at high densities. This area is far from any exclusive economic zone, and is at the center of the public debate over deep-sea mining - and it is the main focal point for ISA's international regulatory work.\nThe most controversial section of the White House order targeted international resource areas like the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, but the same order also instructed the Department of the Interior to come up with a licensing process for resources within the U.S. exclusive economic zone, using Interior's separate authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). This is the authority that BOEM drew upon for Tuesday's announcement of a lease planning area off American Samoa.\nIn a statement, BOEM said that its planning process would follow all of the normal conventions of an OCSLA lease sale, just like an offshore oil or offshore wind lease. BOEM plans for a National Environmental Policy Act review, Federal Register notices, and opportunities for input from indigenous stakeholders, ocean users, industry, government and members of the public. The process will be closely watched at home and abroad, as other nations have an interest in making similar moves."

The release of unburnt methane is one of the critical challenges facing LNG operations, with environmentalists highlighting that methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe LNG industry assets that the newest generation of LNG marine engines are far more successful at reducing methane emissions. Researchers, at the same time, have been working to develop systems that could address the emissions to improve the long-term prospects for LNG.\nJapan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Marine Machinery & Equipment Co. reports working with Daihatsu Infinearth Mfg. Co. and its engine optimization technology, the companies developed a methane oxidation catalyst system. Onshore test equipment for the methane oxidation catalyst system for marine LNG engines showed promising results with a verified initial methane oxidation rate of 70 percent or higher.\nIn the next phase of the demonstration tests, the companies working with KEYS Bunkering West Japan installed the system on an in-service vessel. Testing began in May aboard theKEYS Azalea, a 2,352 dwt LNG bunkering vessel built in 2024 by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding.KEYS Azaleacompleted its first bunking in Hiroshima in April 2024 and provides domestic coastal transport of LNG to consumers in the Kyushu and Setouchi areas and LNG bunkering for oceangoing ships calling ports in the region.\nThe catalyst system for the demonstration test oxidizes slip methane contained in the exhaust gas of marine engines. Methane oxidation, the companies explained, is a chemical reaction in which methane (CH4) is converted into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) through reaction with oxygen.\nDemonstration testing will be conducted continuously for the next year as part of MHI Group’s strategic efforts to strengthen its energy transition business. MHI-MME and Mitsubishi Shipbuilding are a part of this strategy, and amid the increasing urgency for global decarbonization, the company says it will continue to work to reduce GHG emissions from marine vessels and contribute to the improvement of the environmental performance of ships on a global scale."

        "content": "\nA federal jury has convicted Adm. Robert Burke (USN, ret'd) on bribery charges related to post-service employment in the private sector. While it is commonplace for admirals to take positions with defense contractors after leaving the military, prosecutors alleged that Burke arranged a six-figure contract for his future employer before he departed the service. As a four-star admiral, Burke is among the highest-ranking officers ever convicted of a federal crime.\nThe story began in 2018, when training firm Next Jump received a subcontract from the Navy for a pilot program. The Navy terminated it the following year, leaving Next Jump without any military contracts. Next Jump's co-chief executives, defendants Yongchul \"Charlie\" Kim and Meghan Messenger, emailed Adm. Burke - at that point the vice chief of naval operations - in hopes of reestablishing the business relationship. An aide to Adm. Burke responded and asked them not to contact him again, given \"upcoming contracting actions.\"\nBeginning in late 2020, shortly after Adm. Burke became Commander Naval Forces Europe and Africa, Kim repeatedly tried to get in touch with him despite this order to cease outreach, according to charging documents. In April 2021, Burke agreed to take a call with Kim and his co-CEO on WhatsApp.\nDescribing the call after the fact, Kim said that Burke \"wants to work for us but we're asking for a deal first,\" adding that co-CEO Meghan Messenger \"felt slimy\" about the discussion, prosecutors claimed.\n\nNext Jump co-CEO Charlie Kim, a co-defendant in the case, circa 2018 (USAF file image)\nIn May 2021, Adm. Burke allegedly directed a staffer to search for money that could be directed to a contract for Next Jump's training services - even though Naval Forces Europe had not previously identified a need for such training. Shortly after, Kim allegedly laid out a job proposal for Burke: if the admiral secured a workforce training contract for Next Jump from Naval Forces Europe, and the admiral stayed in the Navy six months afterwards to promote the training service-wide, he would get a post-retirement job at Next Jump. The offer included a salary of $500,000 per year plus stock options, according to charging documents.\nBurke allegedly kept to this agreement. He and his staff allegedly arranged a $355,000 procurement solicitation that was designed to fit the parameters of Next Jump's \"On My Mind\"leadership training, resulting in a $257,000 subcontract award for the company. Kim, Messenger and their associates flew to Naples, Italy and Rota, Spain to deliver the training to personnel in Burke's command.\nBurke stayed in the Navy for six more months, and during that time, he allegedly promoted the training to other senior Navy officers (and to contacts in a foreign military) - without disclosing any employment agreement with Next Jump. He retired in May 2022, then started an executive position at Next Jump about five months later.\nBetween Burke's start date in October 2022 and January 2023, he earned about $125,000 in wages from the training contractor, prosecutors said.\nIn September 2023, federal prosecutors charged Burke, Kim and Messenger with conspiracy and bribery for this alleged arrangement. Burke was also charged with concealing facts related to the scheme, as well as official acts that affected his personal financial interests.\nKim and Messenger are scheduled to face trial in August. Burke's separate trial finished early this week: a jury in D.C. District Court found Adm. Burke guilty on all charges. Sentencing is scheduled for August 2025.\n\"When you abuse your position and betray the public trust to line your own pockets, it undermines the confidence in the government you represent,\" said interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, formerly a legal commentator on Fox News. \"Our office, with our law enforcement partners, will root out corruption – be it bribes or illegal contracts – and hold accountable the perpetrators, no matter what title or rank they hold.\"\nBurke's defense lawyer, Tim Parlatore - the personal attorney of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as a Navy Reserve JAG officer in Hegseth's office - told Military.com that the military and government investigation into Burke's case had been done incompetently, and that evidence had been hidden from the jury. Parlatore suggested that the verdict was wrongful, and that the prosecution had not presented the full story.\nKim and Messenger have yet to face trial, and they are pleading not guilty. Their attorney told The Washington Post that they had relied upon Burke and that Burke had misled them. \"I think it'll be embarrassing for the Navy,\" Next Jump attorney Reed Brodsky told the Post."

Two cadets were killed and dozens injured in the stern-first allision, which knocked down the tops of all three of the barque's masts.\nCuauhtémoc remains moored at Pier 37 on the East River as investigations continue. Salvors and surveyors have finished an initial inspection of the ship's structural condition, and have determined that it did not sustain any hull damage in the incident. This means that when weather conditions are appropriate, the tall ship can be relocated to a shipyard for repairs, NYC Office of Emergency Management spokesperson Aries Dela Cruz told local media. The move is expected by Sunday.\nNTSB is in the initial phases of collecting evidence, including surveillance footage, bystander videos, technical data, crewmember testimony and more. The agency says that it will not be commenting on probable cause while it investigators are working on scene, and that a preliminary factual report will follow when ready.\nMayor Eric Adams commended the New York Police Department and Fire Department for their speedy reaction after the accident, which likely saved lives. Marine units from both agencies were at the scene within minutes of the allision, providing aid and helping evacuate the injured.\n“There were 277 people on that vessel. That could have been a real tragedy if it wasn’t for the fast response on the New York side,” Mayor Adams said.\nThe accident occurred Saturday night as Cuauhtémoc was departing the pier, planning to transit south into New York Harbor and out to sea for a voyage to Iceland. It ran into trouble almost immediately. The vessel began backing away from the dock at 2020 hours, assisted by one tug (which was not connected by a hawser). The ship began to accelerate astern after it departed the pier, reaching a speed of six knots by about 2024 hours. At 2024:45, its masts hit the underside of the bridge.\nThe reason for its sudden astern acceleration is under investigation, and NTSB will be looking at data from its propulsion system for any sign of a possible mechanical issue. Members of the public who have video evidence from the scene of the casualty may contact NTSB at[email protected].\nThe Mexican Navy has confirmed that a \"specialized harbor pilot\" was on board the ship at the time of the casualty. New York State law requires foreign vessels to use a licensed Sandy Hook pilot to enter and exit the harbor; it is not known if Cuauhtemoc also had a docking pilot (a tug master with expert local towage and shiphandling knowledge) on board for the departure.\n"

        "content": "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has signed off on a revamp of the U.S. Coast Guard's management structure, starting with a long-discussed plan to hire a service secretary for USCG headquarters. The U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force all have civilian service secretaries appointed by the White House; the Coast Guard - part of the U.S. armed forces by statute, but housed within the Department of Homeland Security - lacks a secretary of its own, and is led by a uniformed officer.\n\"Now, more than ever, the American people need a strong and capable Coast Guard,\" said Noem in a statement. \"The Coast Guard must not simply evolve. It must revolutionize how it functions and operates to ensure decisive advantage over adversaries. This requires a fundamental change.\"\nThe service's strategic plan, Force Design 2028, would fundamentally change its organizational structure. A new service secretary - reporting to Noem - would be accountable for decisionmaking, oversight and procurement, much like the Secretary of the Navy. This would requirelegislation, and a bill has been introduced by oversight committee leaders in the House.\nThe plan also envisions a leaner headquarters operation with a \"more agile and strategically focused\" design. New program executive offices (PEOs, a familiar Navy construct) would take a \"systems-focused approach to acquisitions and sustainment.\" In contracting, the service secretary would have final authority over acquisitions, and the Coast Guard would take a more disciplined approach to the requirements process - a key driver of cost increases and delays in shipbuilding programs.\nAprevious memofrom Homeland Security instructed the Coast Guard to reduce the ranks of its flag officers by one-quarter, or about 12 positions. Noem also reportedly canceled all six planned promotions for new one-star admirals proposed for this year.\nThe new force design plan also calls for areas of significant investment and expansion. It would attempt to fill the service's manpower gap with new incentives and policies for recruitment, aiming to grow its military workforce by 15,000 members by the end of FY2028.\nThe plan also calls for strengthening Coast Guard Cyber Command. Within the same department, Homeland Security's own Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency - tasked with the same mission set for all nationwide enterprises - faces a proposed$490 million budget cutin FY2026 (along with undisclosedpersonnel reductions).\nThe Force Design 2028 plan also calls for investment in \"Coastal Sentinel,\" an AI-driven sensor network to detect threats; new IT systems for vessel registration, mariner credentialing and HR functions; and a rapid-adoption team to pick up new technology faster.\nNoem also confirmed that acting commandant Adm. Kevin E. Lunday will be nominated for Senate confirmation as the 28th commandant of the Coast Guard. He will continue in his acting capacity until confirmed.\n“Now is the time for fundamental change,\" said Lunday. \"Secretary Noem has said that we must reinvigorate the Coast Guard or risk strategic failure. I am honored to lead our Coast Guard men and women in this historic effort to renew the service for the future.”"

        "content": "\nLong one of the major concerns of the shipping industry, which was heightened by the growth of the shadow fleet, the Federal Maritime Commission announced that it is commencing an investigation into the practices of the so-called “flags of convenience” and the unfavorable business conditions that they create. The FMC reports it is concerned about the conditions created by the wide and uneven range of foreign vessel flagging laws, regulations, and practices, saying they could be creating unfavorable conditions in the foreign trade of the United States.\nIn adetailed presentationof the issue to be released in the Federal Register on May 22, National Maritime Day, the FMC highlights that some foreign countries have engaged in a “race to the bottom,” lowering standards and easing compliance requirements to gain a potential competitive edge in attracting ships to their registry. It believes that some nations are competing to lower the cost of registering and flagging vessels “beyond the point where they can ensure the efficiency, reliability, and safety of vessels.”\n“By offering to register and flag vessels with little or no oversight or regulation, countries may compete against one another to gain revenue from the associated fees and to minimize the expenses associated with inspecting vessels and ensuring compliance with appropriate maintenance and safety requirements,” writes the FMC.\nIt further calls out the approach of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in addressing the issue. The FMC contends that the IMO’s approach “has not brought about meaningful change nor deterrence to what is clearly a growing problem.”\nThe FMC says that patchwork policies and uneven compliance have proven ineffective and that “naming and shaming countries” does not prevent the practices. Instead, it says it leads to further concealment of illicit activities.\nThey are also highlighting the lack of standard definitions for terms used in the industry. It points to “flag of convenience, open registry, fraudulent registry, and shadow/dark fleet,” saying the inconsistent interpretations make it more difficult to enforce rules.\nAs the first step in its process, the FMC will open a 90-day comment period seeking input from all sectors of the shipping industry on the issues. It says that its current goal is to encourage comments from all interested parties.\nThe effort will also look to identify best practices that contribute to response and safe operations. It acknowledges that many foreign nations take great care in creating standards and have introduced steps to ease the process and cost of compliance.\nIt looks to obtain specific examples of responsible and unfavorable flagging laws. It also asks for comments on practices by owners and operators that undermine the efficiency and reliability of international ocean shipping.\nThe FMC asserts in starting this process, which it calls a “nonadjudicatory investigation,” that it has statutory authority to look at foreign governmental actions that are detrimental to third-flag carriers and can also create conditions unfavorable to shipping in U.S. foreign trade."

        "content": "\nOn Wednesday, North Korea's small navy expected to launch its newest warship with supreme leader Kim Jong Un in attendance - but it did not go as planned. The launch system at the shipyard malfunctioned, and the stern slid into the water while the bow remained on shore, causing extensive hull damage.\nIn comments carried by state-controlled Korea Central News Agency (KCNA), Kim took aim at every institution involved in the destroyer's construction - including the design bureau - and called the launch failure \"a criminal act.\" He called for \"political accountability\" for the \"inexperienced command and operational carelessness in the course of the launch.\"\nSatellite images of the site at Chongjin Shipyard show that the vessel was lined up with a side-launch ramp on the quayside in the days before the casualty. The Chongjin yard lacks a drydock or an inclined marine railway for launching. The infrastructure for the side launch method is affordable, but is not preferred for complex vessel construction: a side launch imposes larger forces on the hull and installed components, and as a dynamic, kinetic event, it is prone to mishaps - even capsizings, if the vessel heels over too far during launch. This complicates construction planning and may limit how much work can be done on the vessel before it is launched.\nThe accident described by KCNA appeared to describe a malfunction of the side launch system. Some sections of the bottom were \"crushed by the forces involved,\" KCNA said. The agency added that the officials responsible for the accident will be \"dealt with\" during the next meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in June.\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff assessed that the damage may have been more severe than admitted by the North: a spokesperson told media that the new warship was \"lying on its side in the sea.\"\nKim has instructed the shipyard to fix the vessel's hull before the next Central Committee meeting in June.\nThe newbuild is believed to be a sister ship or near-sister ship of theChoe Hyon, a first-in-class warship launched last month at Nampo Shipyard.Choe Hyon- a heavily armed vessel with the displacement of a frigate - is likely capable of launching ballistic missiles, and has 74 VLS cells in several sizes."

        "content": "\nThe European Council and European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement designed to enhance the mission statement of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). It was part of a broad effort by the governing bodies to address maritime safety, with this the final piece of the effort designed to clarify EMSA’s mission and provide for future challenges or evolving security issues at sea, such as cybersecurity and hybrid threats.\n“For over 23 years now, the European Maritime Safety Agency has proven to be an essential support to member states in ensuring safety on European waters,” said Dariusz Klimczak, Polish Minister of Infrastructure speaking on behalf of the members.  “Revising the agency’s mandate will better reflect EMSA’s current and future role and make the agency future-proof.”\nEMSA was created in 2002 in response to maritime incidents in the early 2000s. Its mission was defined as ensuring maritime safety, protecting the maritime environment, and addressing sustainability issues. It also works with the state’s coast guard and supports maritime surveillance and other digital services.\nThe new regulation will provide a more suitable legal basis for EMSA to fulfil tasks in the areas of maritime safety, pollution prevention and response, decarbonization, surveillance, and maritime awareness. Moreover, the agency will provide technical, operational and scientific assistance to member states and the commission.\nAs part of the new agreement, they are also creating the possibility for EMSA to take up additional tasks, at the request of member states and the commission. This was done in order to keep up with future developments in the maritime sector, which the representatives said is making EMSA more future-proof.\nThe provisional agreement will now need to be endorsed by the member states’ representatives within the Council and by the European Parliament. It will then be formally adopted by both institutions following final revisions.\nThe provisional agreement on EMSA concludes the legislative work on the maritime safety package, which also updated flag state and port state control provisions, revised rules on the investigation of maritime accidents, and tightened rules on pollution from ships. Those four directives were formally adopted by the Council in November 2024."

        "content": "\nThe draftsman's union for General Dymanics Electric Boat has agreed to a five-year labor contract with a hefty wage hike, heading off an impending strike. The union's members will see their pay increase by nearly a third by the end of the period, leaders said in an update over the weekend.\nUAW Marine Draftsmens' Association Local 571 represents 2,500 workers who draw up schematics for sub construction at GD Electric Boat, one of the two firms in the United States that can build nuclear-powered submarines. They make up about 10 percent of the company's workforce. Electric Boat holds contracts for the Columbia-class and the next generation of the Virginia-class attack sub, two of the Navy's highest-priority programs.\nThe $130 billion Columbia-class program is urgently needed. The Columbias will replace the aging Ohio-class boats as the platform for the nation's at-sea nuclear deterrent, the most survivable second-strike option in the arsenal. The UAW MDA's members did the detail design for Columbia, and they also produce the plans used on the shop floor for construction.\nGD Electric Boat initially offered the union a raise of 23 percent and improvements to retirement benefits. In April, the union said that the boost was not enough, and the membership voted to authorize a strike if talks did not produce a better package. A strike could have created further delays for Columbia, which is already more than a year behind schedule and hundreds of millions of dollars over budget because of supply chain and production delays.\nElectric Boat and union leaders eventually settled on a giant pay increase of 30.6 percent over five years, amounting to \"an increased value of $115,000 per member on average over the life of the agreement,\" according to UAW regional director Brandon Mancilla. It also continues retirement-plan policies as before, without the employer's proposal for a new tiered benefits system. The union conceded that it did not secure all of its demands for pension improvements, profit sharing and cost of living adjustments.\n\"The bargaining committees worked diligently to find common areas of interest that resulted in wage and benefits enhancements that positively impact employees’ quality of life, and achieve fair and equitable results,\" said Electric Boat VP of HR Shawn Coyne and Local 571 president William Louis in a joint statement. \"This package recognizes the essential role of the MDA members in the production of submarines for the U.S. Navy.\"\nThe wage increase means added cost for production, but Congress had already anticipated that labor costs at Electric Boat and other submarine industrial base suppliers would increase. The latest two-sub contract for Electric Boat and HII Newport News included adjustments for workforce incentives, addressing the substantial difficulty that the yards have had in finding and keeping skilled labor.\n“The strong wage package . . . reflects the goal of special funding Congress approved last December to help submarine shipyards recruit and retain the talented workforce required to execute our nation’s aggressive submarine construction plans,\" said Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT) in a statement.\nThe union's rank-and-file members still have to vote to approve the contract."

        "content": "The European Union moved forward yesterday with what it called “the most wide-sweeping” sanctions package on Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine and targeted the oil and gas industry. While the EU said it was focusing on Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers and their operators, it also included a major international operator, Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.\nDeep within the list of 189 vessels added to the EU sanctions, Bloomberg highlighted are three LNG carriers owned by the Japanese company and operating under charters to service Russia’s Yamal LNG project. The West has been targeting Russia’s gas trade by sanctioning vessels as it expands the efforts to stop the flow of money, which it says is funding the war effort and supporting the Russian economy.\nThe three vessels,North Light,North Moon, andNorth Ocean, are state-of-the-art carriers completed in late 2024 under long-term joint agreements. The ships were outfitted with ice-strengthened hulls and are over 93,000 dwt. Bloomberg tracked shipments from Yamal to China and Asia aboard the vessels, which are registered in Singapore and managed by a division of MOL.\nWhile emphasizing that the sanctions were designed to stop the vessels enabling the trade, the EU highlighted the shadow fleet operated by shadowy third parties. It is unclear if they were purposefully targeting one of the largest shipping companies in the world.  Officials, however, said its response is growing tougher as “Putin feigns interest in peace.” The EU said Russia and its enablers would face severe consequences the longer the war persists.\n“We intend to fully cooperate with the EU and Japanese governments in complying with the sanctions,” MOL responded in a statement to Bloomberg News. “We will consult with various parties and take appropriate measures.”\nThe shipping company said it would be reviewing the sanctions and assessing their impact on its LNG vessels. It is saying it is committed to complying with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.\nThe EU launched the sanctions targeting the gas sector as part of the 14th package introduced in June 2024. Russia responded with the use of vessels from the shadow fleet and ship-to-ship transfers. The EU is now moving to curtail Russian gas imports while promising to phase out the shipments bringing it to a close between 2027 and 2030."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "A consortium based in the UK is working on the designs for a new segment of the shipping industry specifically designed to support floating offshore wind installations. As the offshore wind energy industry moves toward its next phase, which will require floating turbines, it will also need a new type of vessel better suited to the challenges of positioning and anchoring turbines.\n“At present, the global fleet falls far short of what is required for serialized installation of floating turbines and their infrastructure,” explains Ian Godfrey of Tope Ocean, an engineering firm involved in the project.\nThe vessel concept focuses on a section of the floating wind installation process that is yet to be optimized. According to the project partners, the vessel will work with any of the three main anchor types for floating wind turbines being considered by the industry. Drag embedment anchors, they highlight will require installation by high bollard pull anchor handling vessels, while suction piles and driven piles, which require large subsea cranes to install them into the seabed.\nThe first feasibility stage has been completed for the Future FLOW Installation Vessel. It will meet the requirements of the next phase by installing the mooring lines onto the installed anchors, enabling quick connection to floating foundations towed to the offshore site. The design also incorporates low-carbon fuels, providing fuel efficiency advantages, a hydrodynamically optimized hull, and expanded mooring capacity.\n“We’ve reimagined the mooring installation process, designing a vessel focused on these new requirements,” says Simon Hindley of Solis Marine Engineering. “By combining an energy-efficient hull form with a low-emission powertrain, we can tackle high-duty construction tasks without relying on traditional, fossil fuel-powered vessels, improving the overall efficiency of the offshore construction activities.”\n\n\n\nThe vessel has been designed to maximize mooring line capacity while minimizing running costs. The selection of azimuth thrusters and reduced resistance to station-keeping and dynamic positioning efficiency is partnered with the alternative fuel choice of methanol. To maximize mooring line capacity, the vessel also has a large below-deck cable tank for synthetic mooring ropes as well as large chain lockers to hold the kilometers of chain expected for the floating wind industry.\nThe project is part of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition Round 4 (CMDC4), funded by the UK Department for Transport and delivered by Innovate UK. Consortium partners include naval architects Solis Marine Engineering, innovation specialists Tope Ocean, marine operations specialists First Marine Solutions, and Celtic Sea Power.\nThe consortium reports it is now advancing toward the next design stage, which will focus on the equipment for handling large quantities of synthetic ropes, weather-limit analyses, and regulatory and design challenges faced by methanol propulsion systems. The target is to secure an Approval in Principle from a major ship classification society by December 2025."

        "content": "\nThe Turkish Navy and drone manufacturer Baykar appear to have achieved a notable advance in the use of drones from flat tops during the recent Exercise Sea Wolf 2025, held in the Eastern Mediterranean in mid-May. The exercise featured Baykar’s TB3 drone, a navalized and upgraded version of the widely-exported TB2 drone, which also features a retractable undercarriage and folding wings to permit below-deck hangar storage.\nA Baykar corporate video shows three Bayraktar TB3 drones taking off and landing from the flight deck of TCGAndalou(L400), the Turkish Navy’s amphibious assault ship. Take-offs were achieved without catapult assistance, using the full 220-meter length ofAndalou’sflight deck, which culminates in a ski ramp. Landings without arrestor gear appear to be achieved using about 100 meters of flight deck. Baykar reports that both take-offs and landings were conducted autonomously, though the examples seen in the company video were conducted in fine weather and flat calm conditions without pitch or yaw. Flight operations appear to require a clear deck, which might not be necessary on a larger ship with an angled flight deck.\nThe TB3 drones each carried two Roketsan MAM-L precision-guided missiles, which were used to carry out attacks on a ground target. Developed specifically for use on drones and with a relatively small warhead, these 22-kg missiles have a stand-off range of 15 kilomters.\n#BayraktarTB3PT-3 & PT-4 ?????????ahlans?n Mavi Vatan,Kanatlar?m?zda bulut ve deniz!Let the Blue Homeland rise in glory,With clouds and seas beneath our wings!???????? MAM-L ?? TCG ANADOLU ???? ASELFLIR-500 & Aselsan CATS???? DEN?ZKURDU Tatbikat? | SEAWOLF Exercisepic.twitter.com/LF3XIOrTZA\nThe project to adapt the TB3 for flat-top operations was given particular urgency when in 2019, with the TCGAndalouproject underway, the United States dropped Turkey from the international team to build the F-35B – the stealth fighter which was to be deployed on the ship.\nBaykar’s technical achievement poses a number of interesting questions, not the least why Baykar has been able to achieve such rapid progress in operationalizing its TB3 for naval use while other navies have not progressed from trials and experimental development.\nWhilst the focus of Exercise Sea Wolf 2025 was on offensive use of drones, the TB3 has other attractive flight characteristics: an endurance of up to 32 hours, and a range of more than 500 miles at medium altitude. Carrying a multi-mode AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, as is being developed for the TB3 by Turkish company Arselan, a carrier strike group with a constellation of TB3s could have persistent, wide area surveillance, with redundancy and overlap.  Such a capability might be envied by the HMSPrince of Walesas it approaches the Red Sea, protected as it is for now by the helicopter-mounted Crowsnest radar system - in an environment where slow-moving aerial targets have proven vulnerable to Houthi air defense systems.\nFrom a capability perspective, where Baykar has led, others are sure to attempt to follow close behind. There may be a plethora of imitators, and hence a widening of the effectiveness of navies that never before had such a long-range strike capability. To illustrate, in February Indonesia ordered 60 TB3s and is contemplating acquiring a flat-top helicopter carrier. Among others, Australia, Egypt, Italy and Spain already deploy suitable flat-tops. Even the Iranian IRGC Navy might be able to fly and recover unmanned aircraft from the decks of its drone carrier, the converted container shipShahid Bagheri(C110-4)."

        "content": "\nTensions remain high in the Baltic with the latest incident involving a shadow fleet tanker transpiring late on Tuesday, May 20. Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other government officials reported that the Polish military had been used as a deterrent after a shadow fleet tanker was observed “performing suspicious maneuvers.”\n“After the effective intervention of our military, the ship sailed,” Poland’s Prime Minister wrote on social media. He said the vessel was a tanker in the Russian shadow fleet covered by the sanctions.\nPoland’s Ministry of National Defense provided additional details, saying that the tanker had been tracked with reconnaissance and that they had observed a tanker in international waters in the Baltic performing suspicious maneuvers. The tanker was in the vicinity of an undersea power cable connecting Poland and Sweden.\nA Polish aircraft was dispatched to the area. The patrol plane appeared to scare away the tanker.\nPoland’s state electricity transmission system, PSE, later reported that a cable was functioning normally. The Prime Minister, however, said theORP Heweliusz, a survey ship operated by the Polish Navy, was sailing to the scene. The Ministry of Defense confirmed that the vessel would carry out a survey of the sea floor in the area. In the past, other nations had been able to find trails left by anchors dragged on the sea floor that were used to damage undersea infrastructure.\nAn official speaking to Reuters later identified the suspect tanker as theSunsailing under the flag of Antigua. The Equasis database lists the vessel as a 159,000 dwt crude oil tanker owned by Turkish interests. Its AIS signal shows it was traveling from India and reporting a destination of Tallinn, Estonia.\nPolish officials said they would be conducting a meeting on Thursday at the country’s Maritime Operations Center in Gdynia to review maritime security. The Prime Minister is expected to attend.\nThe Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, Wies?aw Kuku?a, noted that NATO had already agreed to deploy additional naval assets in the Baltic after last week’s incident. Estonia tried to stop a shadow fleet tanker for an inspection, and the vessel refused to change course. At the same time, a Russian fighter jet briefly traveled into Estonian airspace in what is believed to be a defense of the tanker. NATO planes were also overhead observing while Estonia decided to escort the vessel from its waters.\nBaltic and Scandinavian nations increased their patrols of the region earlier this year after the incident in which Finnish undersea assets were damaged. There were several other incidents, all linked to shadow fleet tankers, which also resulted in NATO deploying additional resources to the region.\nIn the past week, both the European Union and the UK dramatically increased the number of sanctioned tankers in the Russian oil trade. Political leaders said the goal is to further restrict the Russian oil trade, while Russian officials have vowed to defend the tanker fleet.\n"

Secretary-General António Guterres called for international cooperation for global stability and respect for international law to improve maritime security.\nGuterres told the representatives of the largest nations that the world’s maritime routes and the people depending on them are sending a “clear SOS.” He spotlighted the Houthi attacks on commercial vessels, trafficking in the Gulf of Aden and the Mediterranean, and a myriad of crimes in the Gulf of Guinea as examples. He told the representatives that he believes the problem is getting worse.\n“Without maritime security, there can be no global security,” said António Guterres. He emphasized in the opening remarks to the Security Council that the world’s oceans are increasingly under strain from threats both traditional and emerging — challenges around contested boundaries, depletion of maritime resources, escalating geopolitical tensions — and warned that “no region is spared. As threats to maritime security are becoming more complex and interconnected, enhanced coordination and stronger maritime governance are essential.”\nBriefing the Security Council, the President of the Union of Greek Shipowners and Chair of the Board of the Neptune Group of Companies, Melina N. Travlos, warned that “shipping is increasingly being weaponized. Piracy,” she warned, “is evolving, not retreating.”\nHighlighting the statistics on crime, Travolos stated, in 2024, there were 116 reported incidents. She said it represented a 35 percent increase for 2023. She pointed to organized crime, as well as trafficking of drugs and individuals, along with the growing threat of cyberwarfare.\nDuring the debate, many nations took the floor to underline the importance of cooperation for global maritime security. They highlighted their individual concerns.\nThe United States, represented by its Acting Representative, Ambassador Dorothy Shea, used the calls for cooperation to highlight the Registry Information Sharing Compact founded by Liberia, Panama, and the Marshall Islands. She said it now includes 15 shipping registries representing more than 20 percent of the world’s flagged vessels. She said it is an important tool used for stopping flag hopping and helping to stop illicit practices, including UN Sanction Violations. She urged more registries to join the effort as a means of setting a global standard for compliance with international maritime law.\nRussia’s Permanent Representative, Vassily Nebenzia, however, used the meeting as an opportunity to criticize the West and cite efforts against the shadow fleet. Russia terms the efforts of the NATO countries as the emergence of “Baltic pirates.” It said Western countries are justifying their illegal actions at sea by creating artificial impediments and threats to maritime trade.\nHe said the actions of the “newly-minted Baltic pirates and their EU cheerleaders” are a “flagrant violation of the freedom of navigation and the right of peaceful passage or transit passage.” Russia, however, asserted that most of the issues being debated, which included transnational organized crime, illicit arms trade, drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal exploitation of marine resources, are not part of the remit of the Security Council.\nSecretary-General Guterres told the representatives that action is required in three areas. He called for respecting international law. Addressing the root causes of maritime insecurity and creating a partnership at all levels.  He said that the upcoming 2025 UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, will “provide an important moment for the countries of the world to take action.”"

It is in addition to two new vessels delivered to the company in 2025 and two more also scheduled for this year.\nThe company reported yesterday, May 21, that revenues for the first quarter had more than tripled to €65 million ($73 million) and that it has a contract backlog of nearly €2.5 billion ($2.8 billion). CEO Mikkel Gleerup said that the company’s investment in fleet expansion and project execution “are delivering tangible results.”\nThe company reports it is acquiring theBoqiang 3060, built for Shanghai Boqiang Heavy Industry Group by CIMC Raffles for a purchase price “significantly below the vessel’s estimated replacement cost.” Delivery is expected in the third quarter and the vessel will be renamedWind Keeper.\n“With the installed base of offshore wind turbines growing substantially, there is a greater need than ever before for reliable and flexible O&M support to ensure uptime and maximize energy production,” said Gleerup. “As an installation-capable, service-oriented asset, the Wind Keeper will be a valuable addition to our fleet.”\nThe vessel had beenhighlightedas an achievement for China’s offshore industry with new capabilities including the capacity to move and install towers as a single unit. It is unclear why the Chinese, which has a fast-moving installation market, decided to sell the vessel.\nCadeler highlights the vessel has a 2,200-ton Huisman main crane, Kongsberg’s DP2 dynamic positioning system, MAN-supplied engines, and a Siemens propulsion system. It has nearly 400-foot (120-meter) long jack-up legs. The company reports it will make further upgrades to improve the vessel’s operating capacity including the capability of supporting new installations in the 15 MW segment.\nThe company in March took delivery of its seventh operating vessel,Wind Pace, which along with its sisterWind Peakdelivered in August 2024, are the largest vessels in its fleet. Built by COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry (COSCO) shipyard in Qidong, China, they can transport and install up to seven complete 15 MW turbine sets per load or five 20+ MW turbines. They have 5,600 square meters of deck space, a payload capacity of over 17,600 tonnes, and a main crane capable of lifting 2,600 tonnes at 47 meters. Additionally, each vessel can accommodate up to 130 crew members and installation technicians.\nWind Makerwas delivered in January built at Hanwha Ocean Shipyard in South Korea. It is the first of two M-class wind installation vessels for the company withWind Moverscheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2025. They each have 2,600-tonne main cranes designed to install some of the heaviest foundations and wind turbine components and are designed to operate in water depths of up to 65 meters (213 feet).\nThe company reports it achieved a combined utilization rate of 55.3 percent in Q1 2025, which was in line with the expectations and reflected the scheduled drydocking and planned maintenance work scopes, plus time in transit for the new vessel deliveries. With a strong orderbook and growing global demand, Cadeler cites strong opportunities in the market despite recent reports of market troubles."

This comes as Russian officials have stepped up their verbal attacks on the EU’s efforts to reign in the activity of the so-called shadow fleet of tankers supporting Russia’s oil and gas trade.\nAfter revealing that it had used its military tochase awaya tanker acting suspiciously in the Baltic, Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters on Thursday, May 22, “Not everyone realizes how often critical infrastructure facilities lying on the bottom of the Baltic Sea are the target of sabotage or even terrorist activities.” He was speaking during a follow-up meeting to Tuesday’s incident taking place at the Maritime Operations Center in Gdynia.\nTusk said that the shadow tanker acting suspiciously near the power cable connecting Poland and Sweden was “not the first such situation that we have encountered.” He said he was very satisfied that in a very effective, discreet manner, it was possible to discourage the ship from any actions that could have caused damage to the power cable.\nHowever, he also told reporters, “We are still investigating whether any explosives were planted.” Poland reported that the Navy’s survey vesselORP Heweliuszhad been sent to the area after the incident. Tusk said there were currently no alarming signals but the process was proceeding. He also reported that during the meeting they decided to purchase surveillance drones for the Polish Navy.\nAt the same time, Estonia’s Prime Minister was questioned by the country’s parliament (Riigikogu) about the incident last week when Estoniaattempted to inspectanother shadow tanker that it suspected was operating without a valid registration. Prime Minister Kristen Michal cited the mandate given to the Estonian Defense Forces, the Police, and the Border Guard, asserting that “Estonia had legal grounds to inspect the vessel.”\nHe said the Navy and the other sections of the government would take steps to protect Estonia’s maritime space, including critical infrastructure. ERR news reports he told parliament that “the inspections will continue.”\nThe Prime Minister said Estonia was ready to board the tanker if it had entered Estonian waters. Instead, the decision had been made to escort the vessel away from Estonian waters. A Russian fighter jet had briefly entered Estonia’s airspace and NATO planes were also observing. Russia however contended at a UN meeting of the Security Council that Estonia was trying to seize the tanker, attempted to board the ship, and tried to ram the tanker when it failed to gain control of the tanker.\nRussia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia told theSecurity Council, “This habit of using NATO naval forces and assets for such illegal actions will do nothing but pave the way to military escalation and creation of serious challenges to maritime security.” He called the efforts “pirates of the Baltic Sea.” He also asserted that NATO and West was blocking the investigation to find the terrorists that damaged the Nord 2 pipeline.\nSpeaking to the media in Moscow on Wednesday, presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said according to Interfax that Russia would use all means available within the framework of international law to defend its ships in the Baltic Sea.\n\"As the latest events related to the attempted pirate attack on one of the tankers have shown, Russia has shown that it is capable of responding quite harshly,\" Interfax reports Peskov said.\nFueling the tensions are moves by the European Union and the UKexpanding the sanctionsagainst shadow fleet tankers. The EU highlighted that it more than doubled the number of sanctioned vessels this week after previously authorizing inspections of documentation and insurance for all ships passing through EU waters even if they were not making a port stop in the EU."

A new closed multi-purpose hall was completed for the construction of the multi-purpose corvettes to ensure good working conditions, while additional investments have been made in steel production, a launching barge, and heavy transfer ramps. The indoor hall was required for security during the construction.\n\n\nThe hull for the first vessel was completed in February 2025 (Rama)\n\nWork began at the end of October 2023 on the first of the vessels which the yard says will have no counterparts worldwide. Pohjanmaa-class corvettes will be equipped with advanced monitoring capacities for air, surface, and underwater surveillance and will be capable of laying navy mines, performing defense actions against surface vessels, submarines, and various airborne targets, and conducting maritime operations.\nThe design of the corvettes pays particular attention to shock resistance, noise levels, and stealth technology, highlights RMC. The vessels measure 117 meters in length and will have a crew of 70. They will have a speed of 26 knots.\nThe keel for the first of the vessels, a block weighing 56 tonnes, was laid in April 2024. Construction began on the second corvette in October 2024 while the hull of the first vessel was completed in February. Keel laying for the second vessel took place on May 8.\n\n\n\nThe technical part of the launch process was initiated at the beginning of May when the multi-purpose corvette was moved along the heavy transport ramp to the launching barge and transferred to the harbor. In the harbor, the ship was launched with the help of the barge and then towed to the shipyard’s dry dock for further work, including the mast installation.\n“The newly launched vessel is a strong indication of the close and goal-oriented co-operation between the Finnish Government, the Finnish Defence Forces, the Finnish Defence Forces Logistics Institute, the Finnish Navy, Rauma Marine Constructions, Saab and all our industrial partners”, states Timo Ståhlhammar, Project Director of RMC’s Squadron Project.\nRMC reports the Squadron 2020 project is proceeding on schedule. The building pace will accelerate as work on the second and subsequent multi-purpose corvettes progresses. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2029."

No one was injured, and the operator believes that it has identified the fault.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the all-electric tour boatFuture of the Fjordswas under way on the Aurlandsfjord, near Onstad, Norway. At about 1533 hours, the crew notified the regional emergency response center that there was smoke coming from a battery room. As a precautionary measure, the crew returned to the pier and began evacuating all 300 passengers on board. The vessel was emptied out by 1600, according to NRK, with no injuries reported.\nThe local fire department responded to the scene and treated it as a high-priority incident, given the risk of serious escalation if a lithium-ion battery bank were to catch on fire. Battery fires produce noxious smoke and high heat, and they are difficult to extinguish. A firefighting team entered the compartment and determined that the situation was under control, and they ventilated the space to clear out smoke.\n“The potential in such incidents is dramatic,” fire team leader Tor Mikkel Tokvam told state radio outlet NRK. “When something like this happens, we take it very seriously.”\nOn Wednesday, the vessel's operator told local outlet Firda that the problem had been identified: a capacitor in an electrical panel had shorted out and overheated, producing smoke without starting a substantial fire.\nFuture of the Fjordsis a 2018-built, carbon fiber-hulled tour vessel with a capacity of 400 passengers. It was the first all-electric passenger vessel ever delivered. On a full charge, it is capable of speeds of up to 16 knots for up to 2.5 hours. It recharges with shore power in as little as 20 minutes (with a specialized docking system).\nTop image: Future of the Fjords (Saertex / CC BY SA 4.0)"

        "content": "\nGreenland's government has issued a new mining lease to a French-Danish consortium for extracting anorthosite, a silicate mineral used for making aluminum and fiberglass. The license covers provisions for shipping, and the area includes a stretch of waterfront that could be used for industrial access at the ultra-remote mine site.\nThe new lease grants permission for development to Greenland Anorthosite Mining AS, a consortium led by French mining firm Jean Boulle Group. Other participants include  state investment funds from Greenland and Denmark; Greenland's public pension fund; and the Danish bank Arbejdernes Landsbank.\nThe site (63 18 N / 50 07 W) is located south of the capital of Nuuk on Greenland's rugged west coast, inland from the village of Qeqertarsuatsiat. According to the partners, the resource is uniquely large and of \"particularly excellent quality\" for making E-glass - the high-tensile silicate glass used for fiberglass reinforcement. High-grade anorthosite is a less carbon-intensive feedstock for E-glass than traditional sources, the firm says; it can also be used as an alternative to bauxite for aluminum production.\nThe site is at the end of a long fjord, and it includes a small stretch of waterfront. The lease agreement anticipates shipping access: it specifies that any vessels used to serve the project (for development or for export) must meet appropriate Polar Code provisions; must carry a properly-licensed local pilot; and must carry insurance from a P&I Group member.\nWhen developed, the lease area will be the second active anorthosite mine in Greenland. Under the lease terms, the partnership has to begin resource exploitation by the end of 2028 or seek an extension. If all terms are met, the lease will last for 30 years.\nThe lease agreement with a European consortium comes at a time of high tension with the White House over Greenland's mining rights and its continued existence as a sovereign territory. However, this particular application has been in the works with local support since at least 2020, long before the recent tensions began. Greenland Mineral Resources Minister Naaja Nathanielsen told media that despite the well-publicized American interest in the island's minerals, American mining companies have yet to commit to any investment deals - at least, not with the currently-available lease terms. Local rules require up-front investments in development, and it is not as easy in Greenland to acquire a lease and hold it for future use, Aalborg University associate professor Jesper Willaing Zeuthen told Newsweek."

At least one other firm considered placing a bid, but MSC ultimately secured a deal at a price of $760 million. Once the purchase is completed, MSC will launch a public tender offer for the remaining shares in the company, bringing the total transaction value to about $1.35 billion.\nWilson Sons has been in business in Brazil's ports and towage industry for more than 180 years, and has interests spanning the full breadth of the nation's maritime sector. It has Brazil's largest tugboat fleet, nearly two dozen offshore vessels through a joint venture, two offshore-industry terminals, two container terminals, a shipyard, a freight logistics division and a shipping agency, among other assets. The purchase would dovetail with MSC's acquisition of Brazilian coastwise carrier Log-In Logistica in 2021, giving it a foothold in Brazil's cabotage trade.\nIt is one of a string of acquisitions that the Aponte family - owners of MSC and Terminal Investment Limited (TIL) - is looking to add to its global ports portfolio. On Thursday, Hong Kong-based ports giant CK Hutchison confirmed that TIL is leading a consortium to buy out Hutchison's global container terminal network, amounting to more than 40 terminals. The transaction is said to be worth about $23 billion - assuming that Hutchison can overcome opposition from Chinese regulators."

        "content": "\nDespite reports in the Times of London that plans to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius had beenput on hold, the UK’s Prime Minister Kier Starmer signed a formal agreement on the transfer on May 22. A High Court order had temporarily delayed the signing ceremony earlier in the day.\nThe deal provides for an immediate leaseback of the strategic atoll of Diego Garcia and a surrounding 24-mile buffer zone to the UK, and it permits the continued operation of the joint UK/US base on the island for the next 99 years. The leaseback includes an additional 40-year extension, with a right of first refusal thereafter.\nThe UK will also have a veto on what development can occur on the other islands of the Chagos Archipelago, the nearby Marine Protected Area will be maintained, and there will be a ban on any other foreign or military presence across the area previously known as the British Indian Ocean Territory.\n\"If we did not agree this deal, the legal situation would mean that we would not be able to prevent China or any other nation setting up their own bases on the outer islands or carrying out joint exercises near our base,\" Prime Minister Starmer told media. \"No responsible government could let that happen.\"\nThe UK will pay Mauritius an annual rent of £165 million for each of the first three years, £120 million for the next ten years, and then £120 million (adjusted annually for inflation) thereafter.  The UK can withdraw from the agreement by withholding the annual rent, or - an unlikely event - should an attack be launched on Mauritius from Diego Garcia.\nUnder the agreement, the UK must give preference in support contracts on the Diego Garcia base to suitably-qualified Mauritian firms and workers. The US and UK authorities will have control of access, but a Mauritian official presence will be established on Diego Garcia to exercise the civil jurisdiction it will enjoy over the atoll.\nThe agreement also requires the UK and US to ‘expeditiously inform’ Mauritius of any attack mounted on a third party directly from Diego Garcia.\nThe deal received support from the United States, which has a deep strategic interest in access to Diego Garcia. The base is a key jumping-off point for air operations in the Middle East, and has provided a reliable launch pad for long-range strikes for decades. Its anchorage is also a secure, discreet location for U.S. warships, submarines and sealift vessels to berth and resupply.\n\"The Trump Administration determined that this agreement secures the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint U.S.-UK military facility at Diego Garcia. This is a critical asset for regional and global security.  President Trump expressed his support for this monumental achievement,\" said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement.\nThe deal was roundly criticized by opposition parties in the UK. \"Only Keir Starmer's Labour would negotiate a deal where we're paying to give something away,\" said Tory Party leader Kemi Badenoch, who called the payment agreement a \"surrender tax\" and a \"disgraceful sell-out.\"\n\"This is a vital military base. Mauritius is an ally of China,\" she said. \"Other countries may nod along, but behind closed doors, they must think we’ve lost our minds. Labour is turning Britain into a global laughing stock.\""

        "content": "\nOn Thursday, American shipping celebrated National Maritime Day, a recognition of the industry's past - and thanks to a resurgence of interest among federal policymakers, a hopeful outlook for the industry's future.\nCongress declared National Maritime Day in 1933, and it selected May 22 to commemorate the path-setting voyage of the SS Savannah from the United States to the UK. It was the first steamship crossing of the Atlantic, and it remains a symbol of American maritime ingenuity.\nThe day is an annual opportunity to recognize the sector's contributions to the economy and to national defense. American mariners, shipbuilders and operators have kept the nation safe and prosperous \"in peace and war\" since the days of the Founding Fathers; they have served during the United States' finest hours - not least during the Second World War, when 9,500 American mariners paid with their lives in pursuit of victory. In that era, joining the U.S. merchant marine was an act of bravery: Nazi U-boats and frigid Atlantic waters led to a higher casualty rate among mariners than among servicemembers in any of the armed forces.\nOn Thursday, seaports around the country held local events in recognition of National Maritime Day. At Port of Galveston, a daylong event (sponsored by Wallenius Wilhelmsen) invited members of the public to come down to the docks to learn about maritime job opportunities and to tour a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, USCGC Hawk.\nIn Washington, D.C., the U.S. Department of Transportation held a memorial ceremony to honor mariners past and present. Secretary Sean Duffy launched the event with remarks on restoring American maritime dominance on the global stage.\n???? Happening now:We’re live for our National Maritime Day Observance with@SecDuffy, honoring the mariners who keep America’s economy and security moving.Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance ???????? ????https://t.co/I0Y08LQIVw\n\"Maritime is back, baby!\" said Duffy, thanking President Donald Trump for a recent executive order to support American maritime. Duffy noted that China produced 1,800 merchant ships in 2022 - half the tonnage built in the world last year - while U.S. yards built five deep-draft hulls. \"We used to be the best. But we've let this industry peter out, taper off, and we've let our adversaries stand up and take the lead,\" he said. \"If you want to be a global superpower, you need to build ships in your country, and you need to be able to sail those ships with your mariners.\"\nThe Trump administration and its allies in Congress are moving to provide more support to the industry. The recent executive order directs the creation of a Maritime Action Plan (MAP) to revitalize U.S. maritime industries, and it encourages the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to take action on anticompetitive Chinese shipbuilding policies (as it is actively pursuing).\nIt also proposes a new Maritime Security Trust Fund for U.S. shipping, funded by tariffs, fines, fees or other dedicated revenue streams, and it encourages new investment in infrastructure at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.\nThe administration also backs a plan to support deep-sea mining, a new industry that could provide a previously-untapped source of critical minerals - a strategically important alternative to imports from China.\nIn Congress, the recently reintroduced SHIPS Act calls for 250 U.S.-flagged ships within 10 years through the creation of a Strategic Commercial Fleet program. To drive this expansion of U.S. merchant shipping, the act would require a portion of U.S. imports from China to be moved on U.S.-flagged ships starting in 2030. The bill has high-level support on both sides of the aisle, and is among the most prominent and far-reaching legislative efforts to revive American maritime's fortunes in decades."

In one week, China has put the world’s largest car carrier, with a capacity for 9,500 units, into service and now has launched the world’s first methanol dual-fuel car carrier.\nTheAnji Anshegdeparted Lianyungang, China on May 15 and with that became the largest car carrier yet placed into service. The vessel built for the state-owned SAIC Motors is the latest step for the company which is already the largest vehicle exporter from China.\nThe company which started exporting cars in 2001 skyrocketed to the leadership position by focusing on mid-range vehicles and now the growing market for EVs. In 2023 it reported exporting 1.21 million units, the third year in a row above 1 million units per year and bringing its export total to more than 5.5 million units. For eight consecutive years, SAIC has been the largest car exporter in China focusing on SUVs, sedans, MPVs, and pickup trucks in the international market.\nTo break through what the Chinese media refers to as a bottleneck of export capacity, SAIC launched SAIC Anji Logistics and started building its fleet of car carriers. With the introduction of theAnji Anshenglast week, the company reports it now has a total of 35 ships. This includes 15 ships in international trade, which will be increased to 22 in 2026, as well as nine ships in the domestic trade and 11 ships for river transport. The overseas ships are used to export cars primarily to Western Europe, Mexico, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The new ship currently bound for Bristol in the UK.\nThe new ship was built by China Merchants and is 228 meters (748 feet) in length. While it was built ready to use methanol as its primary fuel source, the honor of the first car carrier that will use methanol is going to theCM Hong Kongwhich was launched on May 21. The new vessel, also built by China Merchants Industry Group, is slightly smaller at 220 meters (721 feet) with a capacity for 9,300 cars. It will be operated by China Merchants Shipping as the first of two methanol-fueled vehicle (PCTC) carriers.\nChina Merchants highlights thatAnji Anshengemploys energy-saving technologies and intelligent low-carbon systems. TheCM Hong Kong, which is expected to be delivered in the second half of 2025, however, was outfitted with a complete methanol power plant. The main engine as well as the auxiliary engine and boiler are all designed to use methanol.\n\n\nCM Hong Kong launched this week is the first methanol dual-fuel car carrier (China Merchants)\n\nThe new ships follow the SAIC’s January 2024 introduction of the then largest Chinese dual-fuel vehicle carrier,SAIC Ajin Sincerity(18,200 dwt), which is powered by LNG. The vessel which is 200 meters (656 feet) in length has a capacity for 7,600 units.\nThe Chinese car companies are competing to expand their car carrier business. Rival BYD put its first car carrierBYD Explorer No. 1into service in 2024 with a capacity of 5,000 units which is also LNG fueled. Last month, BYD put its newest vesselBYD Shenzhen(25,376 dwt) into service with a capacity of 9,200 units only to be eclipsed by SAIC’s new ship. Chinese officials pointed to these vessels as a demonstration of the strong demand for their car market.\nThe title of the largest car carrier however will move back to Europe in 2027. Hoegh in 2024 introduced the 9,100-unitHoegh Aurora(25,563 dwt) but last year Norway’s Wallenius Wilhelmsen reported it would be upsizing eight of its new class of ships on order to be built in China. The eight ships in its new Shaper class will each have a capacity of 11,300 units. Hoegh, however, will be the fuel pioneer having received EU funding to make its newest vessel ammonia dual-fuel car carriers. It expects to take delivery on the first ammonia-fueled Aurora class vessel in 2027."

        "content": "A Mississippi River towboat went aground and sustained hull damage because the pilot left the helm for five minutes, according to the NTSB. It adds to a long line of human-error casualties on the Mississippi, where there is little room for error given the close quarters, strong currents and hidden shoals.\nOn July 29, 2023, towboat City of Louisville was under way on the Mississippi near Thebes, Illinois pushing a tow of 11 empty hopper barges. The overall length of the tow was nearly 740 feet long. The pilot - a 24-year veteran of the towing industry - took over the watch at 1100 hours, and the tow proceeded upriver at a leisurely speed of about four knots. River conditions were low, with the nearest river gage registering 7.4 feet.\nAt about 1442, the pilot got up and walked over to the port side of the wheelhouse, where he \"relieved himself into a bag\" while looking out the port side window. Once done, he threw the bag overboard and returned to the helm, arriving back at his position at about 1447, he told investigators.\nDuring the five minutes he was away from the controls, City of Louisville missed a turn and began passing west of her intended trackline. By 1447, the towboat was 95 yards too far to the west and headed about 10 degrees to port of the intended course.\nThe pilot put the rudders hard over 30 degrees to starboard, and the head of the tow began to swing. At the same time, the stern swung to port, further towards the west. The towboat - which was drawing about six feet more water than the empty barges - grounded on a rocky shoal at a position about 150 yards to the west of the intended trackline.\nThe hull of the towboat was breached in the grounding, and the engine room began to flood. The tow remained intact, but the towboat settled further in the water, and the crew could not move it off the rocks.\n\nDamage to City of Louisville's bottom plating (NTSB)\nAt about 1800 hours, an incoming thunderstorm prompted the crew to abandon ship, with assistance from first responders. Heavy rainfall caused the river stage to gradually rise, flooding the towboat's rudder compartment and the mess area.\nCity of Louisville was refloated and towed off for repairs in August, and inspections found that large sections of the bottom plating were badly damaged. The total cost of repairs came to more than $2 million. The vessel was later resold, then scrapped.\nAccording to NTSB, City of Louisville had a pilothouse alerter system that was designed to set off an alarm if the pilot did not move the rudder controls for a set period of time, adjustable between about 1.5 minutes and 10 minutes. NTSB only learned of the casualty seven weeks after the fact, and when agency inspectors finally arrived, they found that the power adapter for the alerter system was missing.\nThe last recorded check of the alerter occurred in January 2023, and the pilot told investigators that he was not aware that it existed; he had never heard it go off. NTSB could not determine whether the system was working at the time of the casualty, nor what time interval it may have been set for.\n\"A pilothouse alerter, when used as intended, is an effective tool that can help ensure a towing vessel operator remains awake and vigilant while on duty,\" NTSB advised. \"Established procedures for the operation and use of the system should be outlined in the company safety management system and should include the time interval for reset of the alerter system.\""

In recent months both countries have repeated claims to the area with each sending Coast Guard members ashore to take pictures with their national flags on the sandy outcroppings.\nThe Philippines Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources is saying that two civilian vessels and a team of researchers were conducting “a routine marine scientific research mission” in which they were collecting sand samples. Chinese state media responded calling it an “infringement” and saying the Philippine vessels illegally entered the area and teams had “unlawfully” landed on the reef.\n\nDA-BFAR condemns hostile actions by China Coast Guard against BFAR vessels in the area of the Pag-Asa Cays yesterday.pic.twitter.com/3paEhnagCy\n\nThe videos show the Chinese vessel using its water cannon before the two vessels bump. The Philippines is saying the Chinese Coast Guard vessel 21559 twice made contact with theBRP Datu Sanday. They are reporting the vessel’s port bow was damaged along with the funnel, and saying the lives of the civilian personnel onboard were put at risk.\nThey report, however, that the research mission was completed despite the “aggressive interference, dangerous maneuvers, and illegal acts by the CCG and Chinese maritime militia vessels.” The Bureau is contending that it was the first time the Chinese used water cannons in this area against a research vessel.\nThe Chinese media is saying the vessels were told to cease their infringements immediately and that they were violating China’s territorial sovereignty. They reported “landing on the reef to deal with the situation,” but made no mention of the use of the water cannon. They contend the Philippine vessels ignored multiple warnings and dangerously approached the CCG ship “causing a bump between vessels.”\n\nDA-BFAR condemns hostile actions by China Coast Guard against BFAR vessels in the area of the Pag-Asa Cays yesterday.pic.twitter.com/3paEhnagCy\n\nThe ambassadors of the United States, Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the European Union all posted messages of support for the Philippines online after reports of the incident. U.S. Ambassador MaryKay Carlson wrote that the Chinese vessel “recklessly endangered lives and threatened regional stability.” The Netherlands expressed concern about the use of the water cannons, while the UK condemned the “dangerous activity by the Chinese Coast Guard.”\nThe incident came the same week that the Chinese military reported that it had permitted but supervised a resupply mission to the grounded Philippine vesselBRP Sierra Madre. The Philippines maintains a base on the vessel which has been aground on the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands since 1999. The Philippines put the vessel there to maintain a presence in the disputed territory but the Chinese allege despite international recognition that the vessel is illegally grounded.\nA spokesperson for the Chinese military reiterated on May 20 that the Chinese Coast Guard would continue to carry out “rights-protection and law-enforcement activities.”"

        "content": "\nA number of recent satellite passes over Diego Garcia – historically part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, now part of Mauritius - have identified the presence on the airfield of up to six F-15 strike aircraft. There are normally no US aircraft permanently stationed on Diego Garcia, with aircraft deployed only for specific short-duration tasks and missions. The presence of the F-15s on Diego Garcia has been confirmed by official Indo-Pacific Command channels, which have specified that the aircraft in question are F-15Es with a dual air-to-air and air-to-ground/sea mission capability. This acknowledgement advertises that the deployment is meant for deterrence purposes, to warn off a potential adversary and to give notice that a threat has been identified and can be dealt with. The nature of the threat remains undefined, but there are a number of possibilities to be considered.\nIran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) specifically has referenced and threatened the US naval and air presence on Diego Garcia on numerous occasions, alongside general threats made recently to target any foreign bases from which the United States would mount an attack on Iran. Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, the IRGC Navy (Nedsa) commander, has said that converted tankersShahid Mahdavi(110-3) andShahid Bagheri(110-4) are configured to undertake long-range deployments and can be equipped with both ballistic missiles and drones. The Admiral noted that theShahid Mahdavihad “cruised in the area of American forces stationed on Diego Garcia” on a 40-day deployment through the Indian Ocean cruise, which ended on May 18, 2024. Both ships have demonstrated the capability to fire Fateh-313 missiles with a range of 500 kilometers, as well as medium-range drones.\nIn the latest satellite imagery available, both the Nedsa drone carriers were at anchor in the Bandar Abbas roads (Shahid Mahdaviat 27.0693N 56.1881E andShahid Bagheriat 27.0878N 56.2001E), and have been so since at least the beginning of May. However, while the threat focus is usually on these two ships, other Nedsa ships can also launch missiles and drones.\nAn article published by Iran’s Press TV on September 23, 2024, also noted that Diego Garcia would be within range of the IRGC’s Shahed-136B drone, if launched from Iran’s south-east coast.\nAt such range, neither the regular Iranian Navy nor Air Force could realistically press home an attack on Diego Garcia. In April 1981, during the Iran-Iraq war, the Iranian Air Force demonstrated that it had the ability to mount attacks in depth, destroying 25 Iraqi aircraft on the H-3 airfields close to the Jordanian border. Although the Iranians still have the very same aircraft in service, their reliability is now dubious, and the range to Diego Garcia is much greater, making such an operation unfeasible. The Iranian Navy is proud of its 86th Flotilla round-the-world cruise in 2022, but its frigates and the single operational Kilo-class submarine would be vulnerable and lack the support necessary to operate at long range.\nAny IRGC attempt to attack Diego Garcia would be limited in scope, and might yet rely on a novel attack concept not yet unidentified. To get close, they would have to rely on surprise and on remaining undetected in the deep ocean. But the Iranians are unlikely to know how effective US surveillance is - and with the F-15Es now protecting the island, are unlikely to want to try and find out."

        "content": "\nRussia’s tanker operator PAO Sovcomflot is citing the impact of the Western sanctions on the company’s results. It reported a significant drop in revenues and a loss for the first quarter of 2025 along with recording a non-cash impairment related to the fleet.\nThe U.S., UK, and EU have all stepped up their efforts targeting the shadow tanker fleet and Russia’s income from the oil and gas sectors. In announcing its financial results the company cited the impact and warned investors that the board of directors would be taking into account “significant changes in the external business conditions that have a direct impact on the current financial performance of the company” as it considers dividends. They said future decisions would be guided by the principle of capital adequacy.\nSovcomflot has previously acknowledged the sanctions, which it calls illegal, and early on after the start of the sanctions regime took steps selling ships and moving management to Dubai and elsewhere. It was also moving ships to registries such as Gabon but later flag hopping. Some returned to the Russian registry.\nIn today’s financial announcement, the company acknowledged that some vessels are now idled by the sanction. During the first quarter, it took a non-cash impairment charge of $322 million against the value of the fleet.\n“During the reporting period, unprecedented sanctions were imposed on the company and its vessels, which created additional commercial and operational difficulties in the operation of the fleet,” the company writes in its results announcement. “The company continues to work systematically to minimize the negative impact of sanctions restrictions on its activities, consistently adhering to high standards of maritime safety and the quality of maritime operations.”\nDespite the efforts, the company reported first quarter revenues were down by nearly a third (30 percent) to $278 million versus the previous quarter, or nearly by half versus the first quarter of 2024. Earnings were down 45 percent (EBITDA) versus last quarter driving the company’s bottom line to a loss of $104 million in the first quarter of 2025.\n“Despite these events, the company's business model demonstrates high stability due to the portfolio of existing long-term contracts and a diversified fleet structure,” Sovcomflot states in its report. It says the company has sufficient cash liquidity and a balanced capital structure that also allows it to maintain a stable financial position.\nBoth the UK and EU vowed this month to further increase the pressure on the Russian oil sector in an effort to reduce revenues and support to the Russian economy. The EU noted it doubled the number of tankers it had sanctioned to over 300 vessels while the UK added another 100 to its listing. The UK also said it was in discussion with Western allies about lowering the price cap the G7 imposed on the sale of Russian oil. The EU has pledged to make an effort to end its imports of Russian gas giving countries the tools to break long-standing contracts and dramatically reduce imports by 2027. The EU has pledged to break free of its Russian imports."

The platform is the country’s first decommissioning project.\nAn unconfirmed report in the Viet Nam News and appearing in the other local outlets says that one person was killed in the fire. Seven others were being reported as injured, although the official reports did not include mention of a death or injuries. Officials emphasized the fire was brought under control in 30 minutes.\nThe Song Doc oil platform was an important offshore development for the country discovered in 2006 and brought into production in 2008 by the national company PVEP POC, a subsidiary of Petrovietnam Exploration Production Corporation along with two investment partners. It was a relatively small site producing at its maximum around 28,000 barrels per day.\nFor the last decade of the operations, PVEP POC was the sole owner after the two investors left the project in 2013. They cited high costs which were said to make the well uneconomical. PVEP POC was assigned to continue the operations and deplete the well, which it reported happened in 2023.\nThe site officially ceased production in February 2024 with the company reporting it was capped. They submitted a plan for decommissioning and removal of the platform, which was approved by the regulators.\n\n\n\n\nWork was underway on the decommissioning with the reports saying a subcontractor was conducting a cleaning process at the site when the fire began on Wednesday afternoon. It is unclear how many workers were on the platform. The videos show a fireboat working to control the fire.\nThe company is reporting there was no pollution and the fire did not affect normal operations and production at the other oil and gas projects in the area. They said there would be an investigation into the cause of the fire.\nSong Doc is located approximately 125 miles south of Ca Mau Cape at the southernmost tip of Vietnam. It is in the Gulf of Thailand."

        "content": "The Philippine Coast Guard reports that the Department of Transportation has completed a deal to dramatically expand its capabilities with 40 new French-designed fast patrol boats. It is part of a broad effort designed to modernize and expand the capabilities of the Philippines Coast Guard.\nPresident Ferdinand Marco Jr. issued a directive to expand the operations of the Philippine Coast Guard in response to the emerging “complex maritime challenges.” The President cited the growth in maritime traffic, the rise of incidents of illegal activity at sea, and the tensions with China. With international support for the Philippines to increase its security, both France and Japan committed to the expansion of the Coast Guard. France and the Philippines reached an agreement in November 2024 which called for the new patrol boats.\nThe Coast Guard currently has 13 ocean-going patrol boats. Government officials have said with over 7,600 islands the Coast Guard is currently stretched thin. With international support, they seek to correct this and expand the effectiveness of the Coast Guard.\nThe contract was signed in Manila on May 22, calling for the construction of 40 fast patrol boats designed by OCEA Group based on the company’s successful FPB 110 MKII design. The vessels will be built of aluminum, 35 meters (115 feet) in length, and approximately 110 tons. The company reports the class operates at maximum speeds between 28 and 35 knots and at a cruising speed of 12 knots, has a 700 nautical mile radius. They are designed to operate with a crew of 17.\nOCEA reports the deal is valued at more than €400 million ($454 million). Under the agreement, the company will build the first 20 boats in France while it will also create a joint shipbuilding operation for 20 additional boats to be built in the Philippines. The contract is supported through a government-to-government agreement between France and the Philippines.\nThe Philippines and OCEA have an established working relationship. The company built four smaller 24-meter (79-foot) patrol boats on its FPB 72 design which started delivery to the Philippines in 2017. They are currently deployed for coastal operations. OCEA established a maintenance office in the Philippines and recently signed a 5-year renewal of the maintenance contract with the Coast Guard.\nOCEA also built the 84-meter (275-foot) BRPGabriela Silang, which when it was delivered in 2019 was the largest and most capable vessel in the Philippine Coast Guard. The company also has a contract with the Philippines for integrated logistic support and maintenance services for the patrol boat.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard says the new vessels are expected to enhance its maritime presence and rapid response capabilities. They expect the vessels will be used to respond to maritime threats, such as illegal fishing, smuggling, piracy, and maritime terrorism, as well as emergency response and relief during natural disasters and maritime incidents. The new boats will also enhance interoperability with the Philippines’ military, the Bureau of Fisheries, and international partners.\nJapan has also committed toexpand its supportfor the Philippine Coast Guard. Previously Japan had provided 12 patrol vessels. It also supported the construction of the current largest vessel in the fleet the BRPTeresa Magbanua(97 meters / 318 feet) which entered service in 2022. Japan will provide five additional vessels to the Philippines between 2027 and 2028."

The police said that the second officer who was alone on the bridge of theNCL Saltenadmitted during questioning that he had fallen asleep while navigating the vessel.\nThe individual is being identified as a Ukrainian citizen in his 30s who was on watch at the time of the incident. He has been charged under Norwegian law with “negligent navigation,” with the police stating that the law requires a ship to be navigated in such a way that there is no danger to life and health, the environment, or material assets.\nAIS signals tracking the vessel show that it entered Trondheim fjord normally with unconfirmed information that it was traveling at 16 knots. However, at the appointed spot where the vessel should have made a turn to starboard to enter Orkanger, it proceeded forwardgroundingafter 0500 Thursday morning.\nThe police report the investigation is proceeding looking at additional issues including whether the vessel was adhering to the work and rest requirements for the crew. The captain of the vessel as part of the standard procedure in the investigation has also been listed as a suspect in the case.\n\"On Friday, parts of the crew on board were interviewed. The focus of the investigation is to establish the sequence of events and determine how this incident could occur, as well as to assess whether the bridge was manned in accordance with applicable regulations,\" said Kjetil Bruland Sørensen, the prosecutor in Trøndelag Police District.\nThe police reported yesterday that they had taken control of documents from the vessel and its log for review. The Norwegian Coastal Administration is also being kept apprised of the investigation while it is also responsible for monitoring the vessel and the salvage efforts.\nEfforts to refloat the 443-foot containership were unsuccessful on Thursday with the Norwegian Coastal Authority reporting that geotechnical investigations had been ordered after media reports that there was a landslide along the coastline possibly linked to the grounding. One home was reportedly also ordered evacuated near the area where the ground collapsed to the left of the vessel.\nMedia reports are quoting the Norwegian Coastal Administration on Friday saying that a survey has also found damage to the vessel’s forecastle and some ballast tanks. They are saying the damage is not too severe that it will make the rescue more difficult but all the factors need to be accounted for in the plan. Also, the damaged tanks are only filled with seawater so there is no immediate threat of pollution but the Administration has a pollution control vessel standing by near the site of the grounding.\nThe shipping company is responsible for arranging the salvage but the Administration will review the plan. It is noting that it can ask the shipping company for additional measures as necessary to ensure preparedness to prevent pollution or damage.\nThe Administration expects the planning to require some time and it would then review the information. No timeline has been offered for when the vessel will be refloated."

        "content": "\nBangladesh has reportedly canceled a $21 million shipbuilding contract with India’s state-run Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE). The deal was signed last year between Bangladesh Navy and GRSE, and it involved construction of an 800-ton ocean-going tug, financed with a $500 million credit extended to Bangladesh by India for purchase of defense equipment.\nHowever, following the ouster of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last August, the country’s ties with India are in the doldrums. A week ago, India limited imports of ready-made garments from Bangladesh, blocking 11 traditional land routes for the trade. Earlier, India had also canceled a transshipment agreement that allowed exports of goods from Bangladesh to third countries. These trade restrictions are seen as a tit-for-tat move after Bangladesh banned imports of yarn from India by land routes.\nFurther, the withdrawal of the naval contract has been interpreted as another escalation in the deteriorating trade ties between the two countries. The cancellation of the tug order was made public through a stock exchange filing by GRSE.\n“In line with the Disclosure Requirements provision of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, we wish to inform you that the government of Bangladesh has cancelled the order,” said GRSE.\nDuring the reign of Prime Minister Hasina, India had been eyeing Bangladesh as a key market for its military exports. At the signing of the tug contract, it was hailed as a first major shipbuilding deal opening up Bangladesh market to Indian shipbuilders. GRSE had also signed a contract with the Bangladesh Inland Waterways Authority to build a trailing suction hopper dredger valued at $16.6 million.\nChina remains the largest supplier of naval equipment to Bangladesh. This defense cooperation has become even stronger under the leadership of Mohammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi interim leader, whose foreign policy appears to favor China."

        "content": "The United Kingdom is reliving the memories of World War II’s bravest evacuation mission with a flotilla of 66 “little ships” that sailed to Dunkirk in France for the commemoration of the 85th anniversary of Operation Dynamo. The Royal Navy escorted the original ships that took part in the daring 1940 rescue mission along with other pleasure crafts that celebrated the anniversary event.\nThe flotilla of the Little Ships of Dunkirk which included a diverse fleet of historic vessels departed Ramsgate Royal harbor crossing the English Channel to Dunkirk where they will re-enact the heroic Operation Dynamo voyage that occurred between May 26 to June 4, 1940, days described by historians as Britain’s show of heroism at her darkest hour.\nOver the 10-day period in 1940, about 850 private boats of all shapes and sizes sailed from United Kingdom shores through heavy enemy fire on a rescue mission to save Allied troops stranded on the beaches and harbor at Dunkirk as the Nazis swept through France. While the hope was that the ships would help rescue at least 40,000 soldiers, they achieved an incredible feat rescuing more than 338,000 soldiers. The operation saw more than 250 ships lost at Dunkirk.\nHistorical accounts by the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships highlights that for every seven soldiers who escaped through Dunkirk, one man was left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of the prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany and Poland where they were brutally treated including beatings, starvation, and murder. The rescue operation by the “little ships” is credited for turning a military disaster into a story of heroism, which served to raise the morale of the British soldiers during WWII.\nWhile the official name of the evacuation mission was Operation Dynamo, the historic event is today better known as the “Miracle of Dunkirk,” a name coined by wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill. On the 85th anniversary of the mission, the UK is witnessing the largest gathering of the small ships, fishing vessels, yachts, and pleasure cruisers accompanying the original 66 “little ships” to Dunkirk to commemorate the historic event. This marks the first time the “little ships” are recreating the historic journey since 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iconic ships were escorted across the English Channel by seven Royal Navy P2000 patrol boats. The Archer class vessels are attached to the Coastal Forces Squadron and are primarily designed for training and inshore patrol tasks. Organizers called this year's event the largest gathering of small ships, fishing vessels, yachts, and private pleasure crafts since Operation Dynamo in May-June 1940.\nCommemoration of the 1940 events was, however, darkened by the death of the last surviving and known naval Dunkirk veteran. Duncan McInnes, who was a telegraphist and served on Admiralty S-class destroyer HMS Saladin, died at the age of 105 last week in Australia.\n“This will be the first time when we’ve gone over when there are no veterans,” said Ian Gilbert, Honorary Vice Admiral, Association of Dunkirk Little Ships. “The little ships are the veterans because the living link has now gone and we have to keep these boats alive to keep the memory alive.”\nThe Association of Dunkirk Little Ships, which was established in 1966, is determined to preserve the memory and identity of the brave vessels by honoring their legacy. It does this by maintaining a present-day fleet and upholding the \"Spirit of Dunkirk.\" Every five years, the association commemorates the events of May 1940 by retracing the original route taken by many of the heroic little ships."

However, it will reduce the company’s capacity for possibly four years until new ferries can be introduced.\nHaving entered service in 1999,Araterehas been Interislander’s only rail-enabled ferry making 24 crossings on the Cook Strait route per week. The 184-meter (604-foot) ferry has a capacity of?600 passengers, 30 trucks or 230 cars, and 28 rail cars.\nOriginally, the ferry was built at a 150-meter (492-foot) length but underwent a NZ$52 million refit at the Sembawang shipyard in Singapore in 2011. The refit, which involved cutting the vessel in half to insert a new 30-meter (98-foot) midsection resulted in her capacity being increased from 360 to 600 passengers. Her gross tonnage increased from 12,595 tonnes to 17,816 tonnes.\nDespite being synonymous with Cook Strait crossing for years,Araterehas had a troubled career characterized by several technical problems, engine failures, and agroundingin June last year. Over the years, the ferry has experienced at least eight major incidents, including a breakdown due to engine failure during its delivery run from its Spanish shipbuilder to New Zealand. Due to her troubled history, speculations have been rife that the ferry is jinxed, resulting in the nickname “El Lemon.”\nThe most frightening incident occurred on June 21 last year whenArateregrounded while departing Picton ostensibly because the crewdid not knowhow to turn off the vessel’s autopilot when they realized she was heading towards the shore. The previous month, the vessel had received a new steering control system to work with the autopilot and integrated bridge navigation system. Investigators termed the grounding as a serious incident, but none of the 47 passengers and crew aboard were injured.\nKiwiRail has now confirmed thatAraterewill retire no later than August 30 to make way for infrastructure redevelopments in Picton in readiness for two new ferries that are expected to arrive in 2029. Apart from its troubled history, one of the other key factors in the ferry’s retirement is that she requires specific loading and unloading infrastructure, meaning she cannot use the other wharf in Picton. Building a temporary berth for her has been deemed too expensive and risks delaying the necessary infrastructure works. The government has previously stated that it would cost NZ$120 million to keepAraterein service.\nDemolition ofAratere’s wharf is expected to begin as soon as October this year, and no later than March next year to facilitate the construction of new infrastructure for the two new rail-enabled ferries planned by the New Zealand government. The replacement project however has been fraught with problems and cancelations causing controversy in New Zealand. The decision to acquire the new, identical ships was made after KiwiRail did an international search and failed to identify suitable second-hand ships to buy or lease. The company said it could not find vessels that would meet modern safety and environmental standards and the demands of the run.\nThe retirement ofArateremeans that until the new ferries arrive in 2029, KiwiRail will be operating only two ferries on the Cook Strait route,KaitakiandKaiarahi. In late June,Kaiarahiis set to go to dry dock in Singapore for major works before returning to New Zealand in mid to late August. AlthoughAratereis currently Interislander’s only rail-enabled ferry, the operator will be able to carry rail freight on the other two ferries using a road bridging process.\nKiwiRail has warned that the retirement ofAratereis bound to lead to job losses but is yet to determine the exact numbers. “Interislander’s transition from a three to two-ship fleet has a number of implications for the company and for our customers. The first impact is on our dedicated team and a formal consultation will begin with them,” said Duncan Roy, Interislander Executive General Manager."

        "content": "A Norwegian LNG tanker,Iberica Knutsen, briefly grounded on Thursday morning May 22, outside the German port of Murkan, but while the vessel quickly recovered environmentalists and other activists have locked on to the event to criticize Germany’s LNG import terminals. Germany moved quickly after Russia attacked Ukraine to establish FSRU terminals so that it could begin gas imports from the United States and elsewhere.\nThe vessel which was built in 2006 and operated by Knutsen Group was inbound from the U.S.’s Sabine Pass loaded with natural gas. It has a capacity of 138,000 cubic meters and is a standard-size vessel at 909 feet (277 meters) and an operating draft of 37 feet (11.4 meters).\nA local resident told a German reporter he was making his morning coffee shortly after 6:00 am on Thursday and looking out the window he noticed “that the tanker was in a place where it shouldn’t be and that it was moving strangely,” reports Berliner Zeitung. “I immediately suspected it was stuck.”\nThe resident said he watched over the next hour as three tugs worked to free the LNG tanker. The German water police (Wasserschutzpolizei) were also on the scene. After about an hour, the tugs escorted the vessel into the nearby anchorage. The water police report the vessel has been ordered to remain there while they investigate. It cannot move until a survey is completed of the hull.\nWhile, overall, it was a minor incident it sparked new calls for Germany to end its imports of LNG. Critics argue the terminals were rushed in response to the efforts to stop Russian imports. In the case of the terminal at Murkan, it is near the popular German resort area of Rügen Island. It was the only privately developed terminal set up by Deutsche ReGas.\n“Today's incident demonstrates that there is an urgent need to catch up on Rügen. We have long been pointing out the safety risks associated with LNG delivery and the operation of the terminal,” said Sascha Müller-Kraenner, Federal Managing Director of DUH (German Environmental Aid). “We demand an immediate halt to further deliveries and an independent review of the safety concepts at this site.\"\nCritics argue the terminal is underutilized and not necessary, especially because of its location. They point to data that said it was operating at just five percent of capacity. Deutsche ReGas has said part of the problem was unfair competition from the state-sponsored terminals. The company cut back on the operations ending the charter of an FSRU terminal.\nGermany however needs the import capabilities to replace gas imports from Russia, which previously came in via pipelines. The country was able to stockpile gas, especially imported from the U.S. to meet its strong demands during the winter heating season. It has promised to end Russian imports but that makes the FSRU terminals an even more important part of the energy supply."

        "content": "\nNorth Korean authorities are making good on promises to investigate all those involved in the failed launch of a new frigate at Chongjin Shipyard. Three managers for the project - the workshop head and chief engineer at the yard, as well as a midlevel administrative official - have been arrested as the inquiry proceeds.\nNorth Korea does not have an independent judiciary, and conviction is likely for those who are charged with a crime. North Korea's state-owned media has already indicated that from the party's perspective, the failed launch was a \"criminal act\" and \"unpardonable.\"\nPunishment in North Korea is often harsh: defectors, smugglers, dissidents and officials who fail to meet expectations may face execution. Recent examples include two nuclear power plant engineers who were killed for missing party-mandated technical targets, according to Daily NK, along with several dozen officials who were reported executed over the Yalu River flood disaster of 2024. Public execution by firing squad is not uncommon.\nLast week, North Korea's small navy expected to launch a new frigate with supreme leader Kim Jong Un in attendance. But instead of a celebratory event, the side launch system at the shipyard malfunctioned, and the vessel's stern slid into the  water while the bow remained elevated on shore. Satellite imagery suggests significant hull damage from the extreme forces that this abnormal event would exert on structural components. The vessel is now laying on its starboard side, partially submerged from the deckhouse aft, and it has been covered with blue tarps in an attempt to obscure the scene from surveillance.\nProlonged immersion in saltwater is destructive, and for a high-end warship, even a refloated hull can be a total loss because of damage to sensitive electronics and equipment. Despite the appearance of serious damage to the vessel, Kim Jong Un has ordered it restored by next month.\nThe newbuild is believed to be a sister ship or near-sister ship of theChoe Hyon,a first-in-class warship launched (successfully) last month at Nampo Shipyard.Choe Hyon- a heavily armed vessel with the displacement of a frigate - is likely capable of launching ballistic missiles, and has 74 VLS cells in several sizes."

It is the latest in a series of steps responding to international pressure to stop the notorious technique used by vessels trying to hide transactions of Russian and Iranian oil.\n“This new regulation reinforces Panama’s role as a flag state committed to maritime safety, operational transparency, and the prevention of fraudulent use of its registry, in full alignment with IMO regulations and the MARPOL Convention,” explained DGMM Acting Director, Engineer Rina Berrocal. “This is not just about safeguarding the reputation of the Panamanian registry,” she warned, “but about ensuring that our vessels are not used as platforms for illicit activities that undermine global trade and harm the environment.”\nUnder a resolution published this month, the PMA introduced rules it says are designed to create stricter controls and mandatory traceability for offshore STS transfers of hydrocarbons. Effective immediately, all Panama-flagged vessels with a gross tonnage of 150 or more must notify the flag state at least 48 hours in advance of any planned STS operation, providing detailed technical, logistical, and operational information.\n“This initiative addresses the growing use of opaque vessels to circumvent international sanctions, transport undeclared crude, or evade environmental safety regulations—practices commonly associated with what is known as the shadow or dark fleet,” said Berrocal.\nShips are required to provide details on the other ship involved in the transfer including its IMO number and flag. They must also declare where and how the transfer will be performed and confirm that it has a plan in accordance with the MARPOL convention.\nLast year, the PMA took steps to clean its registry and make the process of removing violators simpler. As the largest registry by the number of ships, Panama also had the greatest number of ships identified by watchdog groups as involved in the oil trade for Iran and Russia. Registry officials said they were making an effort topurge their ranksof suspect vessels and also have worked with other leading registries to identify vessels attempting to flag hop to avoid detection."

According to the company, fully electric vessels represent one of the most promising options for sustainable shipping and this vessel will be an important model to advance the technology.\nThe vessel, which is approximately 30 feet (9 meters) in length, is designed without an onboard diesel generator. It is powered solely by batteries charged from shore facilities located at the Keihin Dock’s Koyasu Shipyard in Yokohama City. The vessel has a capacity of up to 14 crew and is designed to support docking and undocking of tugboats at the Koyasu Shipyard.\nIn building the vessel, Keihin Dock, NYK’s sole shipbuilding subsidiary, had to overcome several key challenges. Among these, they highlight following the installation of the electric propulsion system, including the substantial battery modules, the vessel’s weight exceeded projections. To maintain balance, the team reconfigured the placement of the equipment and cabling. They were able to optimize internal space while ensuring stability.\n\n\nNYK expects to learn from the construction of the first battery-driven boat to enhance the technology (NYK)\n\nAlso, the company notes that the elevated temperature from the batteries and electric motors can increase fire risks. To effectively manage the heat, they implemented multi-layered water-cooling systems and integrated air ducts. They also enhanced fireproofing in the battery room and protection against hazardous gases along with improved ventilation.\nE-Creain addition to operating without emissions is also significantly quieter compared to conventional ships says NYK. The design features a compact hull that enables exceptional maneuverability in confined spaces. NYK says it is well suited to assisting with docking operations and vessel movement at the shipyard.\nNYK reports it is committed to advancing the implementation of new technologies to realize low- and zero-carbon vessel operations. It believes this new vessel program is driving innovative solutions and accelerating the implementation of new technologies.\nIntroducing fully electric propulsion systems to tugs and workboats NYK says is expected to accelerate maritime decarbonization efforts. The company plans to gain data and insights frome-Crea’s construction and operation that will be incorporated into its efforts to develop an electric-propulsion tugboat scheduled for completion in December 2026. The company also says it is committed to advancing and refining electrification technologies for its application to larger vessels.\n"

At the same time, the investigation into the circumstances of the grounding is continuing after the navigation officer was charged with negligence last week after it was learned that he had fallen asleep near the end of his overnight watch.\nThe vesselNCL Saltenreceived worldwide attention after it grounded Thursday morning, May 22, coming to rest justfeet from a private residence. The home’s occupant was awoken by a concerned neighbor to see the 886 TEU vessel resting on his lawn.\nAfter an initial attempt to pull the vessel free with tugs failed, the authorities ordered a geotechnical investigation after a landslide occurred not far from the vessel. Norwegian media reports there was a second landslide on the coast on Saturday with the results of the survey showing the area is made up of a form of soft clay. The composition is creating further complications in the efforts to refloat the ship along with some damage to the hull and ballast tanks.\nSunday salvage teams began removing containers from the vessel. Using the cranes on theNCL Salten, the containers are being placed on barges and towed to the destination port of  Orkanger. The Norwegian Coastal Authority is reporting that sufficient weight will have been removed for the next attempt to refloat the vessel on Tuesday. Two tugs are reported to be standing by to pull the vessel by the stern off the coastline.\nThe police are reporting that interviews continued with the second officer who is a Ukrainian national. He was charged in Norway on Friday with negligent navigation after he confirmed to the police had hadfallen asleep. The media outlet NRK is quoting investigators saying the officer began his watch at midnight and was in the last hour of the watch when the grounding happened before 0600.\nOne of the issues they are looking at is manning, work rules, and rest periods. NRK reports the navigation officer was alone on the bridge at the time of the grounding but there was an overnight lookout also on the bridge. The lookout had been relieved after sunrise which was at about 0420 that morning. NRK reports the work rules permit the lookout to leave at daylight, but alarms and monitors should be functioning when the officer is alone on the bridge.\nThe newspaper is reporting the officer told investigators that no alarms sounded before the grounding. NRK reports the police are still investigating and also are waiting to interview the captain. Due to the circumstances, the captain automatically is listed as a suspect even though he was not on the bridge at the time of the grounding. The captain they report has been too busy with the salvage operation to be interviewed.\nA review of the logs the newspaper reports shows that the vessel made a course change as planned after entering the fjord. However, a second turn to set course into Orkanger harbor was missed. The AIS shows the ship continuing forward at a reported 16 knots before making what one resident called a soft landing on his neighbor’s lawn."

        "content": "\nThe \"shadow fleet\" of tankers serving Russia, Iran and Venezuela are on average much older than the \"compliant\" tanker market, and many are overdue for scrapping. But with American and European sanctions on much of the fleet, it's hard for cash buyers and scrappers to buy these old ships for demolition and take them off the water. As these ships age out of profitable operation, they may have nowhere to go. That's a potential environmental and safety risk, says Lars Barstad, CEO of tanker giant Frontline - a risk that regulators may need to address soon.\n\"I think actually there needs to be set up some sort of rules for exemptions for recycling [for shadow fleet tankers]. And this is typically where IMO as a UN organization can take a strong initiative,\" Barstad said in an earnings call last week. \"The scary picture is that these vessels will sit somewhere in Southeast Asia . . . and just be kind of floating environmental bombs.\"\nThe risk is not theoretical, and there have been problems before. In 2023, the tankerPablo- sanctioned by the U.S. for carrying Iranian oil - exploded at an anchorage in Malaysia, blowing the main deck off and leaving three crewmembers missing. A suspected Iran-linked shadow fleet tanker,Ceres I,was involved in a dramatic collision and explosion off Malaysia in 2024. And many vessels in the Russia-linked dark fleet are known to operate without valid insurance for spills. There are hundreds of tankers in the shadow fleet that are blacklisted by the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) or the European Union, many aging fast towards retirement (or already past the typical point for retiring).\nIf these vessels could be exempted from sanctions, sold to cash buyers and scrapped - like normal \"compliant\" tankers - the demolition sales would generate more profits for the anonymous owners of shadow fleet tankers. These shadowy owners could then renew their non-compliant fleets with \"new\" secondhand tonnage. But it would also provide an industry service by clearing out old, dangerous tonnage that currently has nowhere to go.\n\"Hopefully, this is going to come up higher on the agenda from the regulators, hopefully higher than decarbonization. So have that conversation first and then we can talk on the decarb later,\" Barstad said. \"On timing, it's regretful that these processes take very, very long until they sit kind of in front.\""

The group calls it a strategic investment to support the region’s strong industrial and logistics growth.\nCMA CGM highlights it has been active in Vietnam since 1989 and today operates 29 weekly services from seven ports in the country. It is co-owner of the Gemalink terminal in Cai Mep, in southern Vietnam near Ho Chi Minh City, and the Vietnam International Container Terminal in Ho Chi Minh City.\nThe group has signed a partnership agreement with Saigon Newport Corporation to develop a new deep-water terminal in Hai Phone in northern Vietnam. A French colonial port dating to 1874, Hai Pong is near the northern border with China and one of the areas Vietnam is investing in for industrial and manufacturing development.\nThe agreement encompasses the design, construction, and operation of the Lach Huyen terminals 7 and 8, located in the strategically positioned Lach Huyen area in Hai Phong. The terminal will have a capacity of 1.9 million TEUs and is scheduled to open in 2028. CMA CGM reports it represents a total investment of $600 million.\nThe company says the project is designed to meet the sharp increase in container volumes in northern Vietnam—one of Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing economic zones. This partnership will enable CMA CGM to secure long-term capacity in a region that has become central to Asian supply chains due to its rapid industrial and logistics development.\nThe Port of Hai Phong celebrated last month the opening of Berth 4 with space for a containership and a barge. Six years after announcing the project, the facilities are now authorized to receive both domestic and international vessels for cargo handling and other related maritime services. Berth No.4 is 375 meters (1,230 feet) in length and is capable of accommodating fully loaded container vessels up to 100,000 dwt or approximately 8,000 TEUs, while the Barge Wharf is 150 meters (492 feet) in length and perpendicular to the container berth to handle barges with a capacity of up to 160 TEUs. The Service Wharf is 50 meters (164 feet) long and used for tugboats. It joins Berth 3 in expanding the port’s capacity.\nVietnam is working to expand its global exports. The government has been working on a trade deal with the Trump administration as it positions to benefit from the U.S.’s efforts to move away from Chinese imports."

Defense Minister Antti Häkkänen of Finland called it “unprecedented” during an interview on Finnish TV on Saturday, May 24.\n“A new feature is that Russia is protecting tankers from its shadow fleet in the narrow passage of the Gulf of Finland. There is military escort and the presence of armed forces. This is a completely new development,” said Häkkänen on YLE, Finland's national public broadcasting company.\nHe made the statement after Finland’s Ministry of Defense reported that two Russian military aircraft were suspected of violating Finnish airspace on the afternoon of May 23, 2025. Häkkänen said, \"We take the suspected territorial violation seriously and an investigation is underway.\"\nThe escalation appears to be in response to the moves by the EU and UK to sanction more tankers and the efforts by Estonia to inspect suspected shadow fleet tankers. On May 13, there was a brief standoff between Estonian forces and a tanker that they suspected was operating without a legitimate registry. The tanker refused to stop for an inspection and a Russian fighter plane entered Estonian airspace possibly to defend the tanker. In April, Estonia detained another suspected “stateless” tanker for several days.\nAfter the incident in May, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia called the actions “Baltic pirates” and accused the EU of being “cheerleaders” in the “flagrant violation of freedom of navigation.” Dmitry Peskov, Press Secretary to Vladimir Putin, also said that Russia would use all means to defend its ships.\nAs an example of the lengths the shadow fleet is going to, the tanker involved in the showdown on May 13,Jaguar(105,000 dwt) registered in Gabon, departed Russia’s oil terminal at Primorsk yesterday, May 25, bearing a new name. AIS signals show the vessel now sailing under the nameBlintand registered in Comoros. It would be the third name change for the vessel which began 2025 asArgent, switched toJaguar, and now toBlintall in a matter of months.\nThe EU recently enacted rules permitting the inspection of vessels sailing through EU waters even when no port stop was scheduled. After the recent incidents, Estonia’s Defense Ministry has said it would continue its efforts to inspect suspect vessels. It continues to claim the legal authority saying it is acting to protect the region including the environment from these vessels which lack insurance and often are poorly maintained."

        "content": "The Ukrainian ports of Odesa and Chernomorsk were both included in the current wave of Russian attacks, which have been called among the largest since the start of the war in Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement afterward claiming the strikes were justified as they were military targets and containers aboard a ship being used to import drones and other supplies.\nOleksiy Kuleba, Deputy Prime Minister for the Reconstruction of Ukraine, posted on social media calling the attack on Odesa civilian infrastructure. He said that Russia had struck a “peaceful, strategically important object that matters to the world’s food security.”\nAccording to Kuleba, one port worker was killed during the attack on May 23 which included two ballistic missile strikes on the port area in Odesa. He said that eight other civilian employees of the port were also injured with four in serious condition. Unconfirmed media reports later said the death toll increased to three people.\nDamage was reported to include windows and doors in the administrative buildings. Vehicles and other equipment were also reported destroyed. Pictures showed containers burning and reports of smoke plumes that could be seen for miles.\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense confirmed the strikes using Iskander-type missiles which they said targeted a containership carrying 100 containers of military cargo. They asserted the boxes were loaded with parts for unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, and artillery ammunition. Some of the containers were still on the unnamed ship and others were on the dock. They also said a container warehouse was targeted in Odesa. The report cited secondary explosions which they said were evidence of the ammunition in the containers.\nMedia reports highlighted that it was a daytime raid. They speculated that the Russian forces feared the equipment would be quickly moved out of the port making it more difficult to target.\nThey also claimed strikes on military facilities located in the port area of Chernomorsk. It was part of a series of attacks reported to be the largest aerial assault which reportedly included 367 drones and missiles targeting many sites in Ukraine including in the capital of Kyiv. In anger, Donald Trump wrote on social media that Vladimir Putin “has gone absolutely CRAZY!” Russia responded saying Trump is showing signs of “emotional overload.” Unconfirmed reports from Ukraine assert that Russia is launching a major new offensive despite Trump’s calls for peace talks and promises of a ceasefire.\nKuleba said this weekend’s attacks on the ports were a continuation of Russia’s assault on infrastructure used for grain shipments. He reported Russia has damaged or destroyed almost 400 pieces of port infrastructure and more than 30 ships. Ukraine says 106 civilian port employees have been injured during the fighting but did not report a number killed.\nThese attacks come after Ukraine highlighted that exports had returned to pre-war levels. In addition to grain, metal products and raw materials are being shipped. Container service was also restored with major carriers using feeder ships to move cargo in and out of the Odesa port area."

        "content": "\nNorth Korea's authoritarian government is looking for more officials to hold accountable for a failed warship launch at Chongjin Shipyard on May 21. The total number of those under investigation now stands at five people, and may continue to rise.\nThree middle managers were arrested and named on Saturday: Kang Jong Chol, the yard's chief engineer; Han Kyong Hak, head of the workshop for building the hull; and Kim Yong Hak, the deputy manager for administrative affairs.\nTwo more names emerged Monday: the manager of the Chongjin Yard, Hong Kil Ho, who was summoned for questioning; and Ri Hyong Son, a director in the Munitions Industry Department, who was arrested and likely faces more serious consequences. North Korean media outlet KCNA concluded that Ri was \"greatly responsible\" for the accident.\nNorth Korea occasionally executes personnel for low-profile offenses, like missing production targets, attempting to escape the country, or consuming media from South Korea. Failing to satisfy the expectations of supreme leader Kim Jong Un can be punishable by firing squad, according to analysts.\nKCNA claims that the shipyard will be able to fully restore the partially-submerged vessel by the end of next month, a timeline that would be virtually impossible for most shipyards in peacetime. According to KCNA, the ship was only \"scratched\" on the starboard side, without any \"bulge on the bottom of the ship\" and only very limited flooding in a \"rescue passage\" at the stern. Satellite imaging shows that most of the stern and starboard side are submerged, including parts of the superstructure.\nThe newbuild is believed to be a sister ship or near-sister ship of theChoe Hyon, a first-in-class warship launched last month at Nampo Shipyard.Choe Hyon- a heavily armed vessel with the displacement of a frigate - is likely capable of launching ballistic missiles, and has 74 VLS cells in several sizes. The loss of a sister ship would be a significant blow to North Korea's small navy."

Three crewmembers required First Aid after the ordeal in which an organized gang looted the ship and terrorized the crew.\nThe port agent for the cargo ship namedShejyoti(5,400 dwt) recounted the events that took place in the early hours of Monday, May 26. While there have been reports of other recent incidents in the port, this one was more aggressive and is the first report of injuries to the crew.\nTheShejyotiis owned by PNN Shipping Lines of Bangladesh and is reported to have been laid up in the port since June 2024 with mechanical troubles. The ship is 312 feet (95 meters) in length and currently has a crew of seven, including a chief officer.\nAccording to the report, a gang of 14 robbers boarded the ship from a fishing trawler armed with a range of locally made weapons. The crew were tied at the hands and feet while the gang proceeded to loot the ship. Three crewmembers were reported to have sustained injuries as the crew was beaten with the locally made weapons.\nThe gang stole rope, bearings, and a large quantity of fuel oil. They also took seven mobile phones from the crew as they ransacked the ship. Reports indicate they stole approximately $40,000 in fuel as well as approximately $18,000 in equipment from the ship along with the personal property of the crew.\nThe shipping agent is saying that this was the third time the ship in the Mongla Port channel had been attacked and looted.\nIn March, the Bangladesh Coast Guard reported the arrest of another gang of five individuals that it said was preparing to rob a ship in the Mongla port. Acting on the tip, they searched a small boat and arrested the five individuals who they said were armed with locally made sharp weapons. They also confiscated illegal narcotics and reported the gang had been involved in other robberies and the distribution of illegal drugs.\nIn 2022, the Coast Guard reported that it had apprehended another gang after they robbed a Liberian-flagged cargo ship that was anchored in the port. The thieves took rope, paint, and machinery which was recovered during the arrest."

The authorities continue to look at the work rules and manning to understand if they contributed to the navigation officer falling asleep near the end of his watch and causing the ship to ground.\n“We are relieved and happy that the salvage operation of the ship itself has gone so well, without complications or further damage to neither the ship nor the environment,” said Norwegian Container Line the charterer of the vessel. “NCL takes the incident very seriously,” the company said reporting it will continue its investigation after the vessel is brought to port.\nNorwegian media NRK reports lines were secured to the vessel shortly after 1000 on Tuesday morning and the refloating operation took just about 30 minutes. On Sunday and Monday, containers had been removed from the bow of the vessel to lighten it. This morning, the manager of the operation told NRK, “This went better than expected.”\n\n\nAfter being inspected, the vessel was towed to its original destination port (Kystverket)\n\nThe shipping company reported the vessel was being inspected by divers after it was refloated and before it was towed to port. It took about two hours to reach Orkanger, where the vessel was docked. NCL reports the remainder of the containers will be offloaded and that the ship will be more thoroughly examined. DNV is representing Cyprus as the flag state in the investigation. The Norwegian Coastal Administration reported it also had a pilot on board the tug, and that its the oil spill response vessel OVHekkingenand the coast guard ship KVNjordwere following the tow.\n“We know there are a lot of questions raised about the incidents. NCL will continue to support the police in their investigation once the ship is safe at port in Orkanger. There, NCL will also proceed with our own investigation,” said the company. “We kindly ask for your understanding that we will not be able to comment further until these investigations are fully concluded.”\nThe police reported after the salvage was completed that they would begin interviewing the captain of theNCL Salten. He had not been on the bridge at the time of the grounding, but they want to investigate rest periods, watch schedules, and manning on the vessel.\n\n\n\nLast Friday, the police charged the vessel’s second officer, a 30-year-old Ukrainian, with negligent navigation. The sole person on the bridge when the vessel grounded shortly after 0500 on May 22, the officer confirmed to the police that he had fallen asleep. He contends, however, that the alarms failed to sound on the bridge before the grounding.\nInitial reports said the vessel suffered damage to its bow and forward ballast tanks. There were also two small landslides on the shoreline and the local authorities ordered residents to evacuate. There were no injuries reported to the crew or onshore."

The Royal Navy highlights that it is a highly advanced vessel that is larger and more efficient than the older Type 23 that it will replace as part of a £10 billion ($13.5 billion) investment in the Fleet of Tomorrow.\nThe move from the building hall came five and a half years after the UK Ministry of Defence selected Babcock Team 31 (a partnership between Babcock and Thales Group) as the preferred bidder for a five-ship contract. The average production cost for the vessels was estimated at £250 million ($338 million) with the project set for 10 years from contract signing to delivery of the vessels.\nAt 5,700 tonnes displacement and 139 meters (456 feet), the ships will be 60 percent larger than the frigates they replace the Royal Navy highlights. However, they are highly efficient and will operate with 60 percent of the crew, around 120 compared with 180-200 with the older vessels. The vessels are designed for multi-role deployment ranging from deterring aggression and maintaining security to providing humanitarian relief supported by real-time data to supper immediate and complex decision-making.\n\n\nHMS Venturer is being placed on a Self-Propelled Modular Transporter and will in a few weeks be lowered into the water for the first time (Babcock)\n\nThe design was selected in September 2019 as a tough competition and the first steel was cut for HMSVenturerin September 2021. The keel for the second vessel, HMSActive, was laid in September 2023, and cut for the third vessel, HMSFormidable, in October 2024.\nBabcock built a new assembly hall specifically designed for these vessels. It measures over 147 meters (more than 480 feet). It is capable of supporting parallel build and assembly activity for two of the Type 31 vessels side-by-side.\n“HMS Venturer will be at the heart of the Royal Navy fleet, deterring aggression and supporting our Armed Forces,” said Minister for Armed Forces Luke Pollard during the roll-out. “She also represents the Best of Britain’s world-class shipbuilding heritage.”\n\nIntroducing HMS Venturer – the world’s first Type 31 frigate. Today, hundreds of employees came together to celebrate her most exciting milestone yet, as she transitions from the construction phase into final preparations for her entry into water.https://t.co/c87Io7QQ51pic.twitter.com/EgdZAyQuG3\n\nThe Royal Navy highlights that the 28-meter-tall doors of the building hall were opened for the first time to prepare for the rollout. It took nearly 12 hours to edge the hull out of the hall and on to the neighboring hardstanding. Later this summer she will be lowered on a special barge and floated off into the dock at Rosyth to begin the installation and testing of systems, sensors, and weapons.\nBabcock executives told the UK Defence Journal that they expect the frigate will spend the next six to nine months outfitting and then begin acceptance trials. They hope to have that done in the next 12 months and are working to handover the vessel to the Royal Navy as soon as possible.\nThe Type 31 class is based on Babcock’s Arrowhead 140 design. The company highlights that it is also using it as an export having already contracted with Indonesia and Poland for three vessels."

At the time, before the fall of then-President Bashar al-Assad, the IRGC used Latakia as a hub for their arms imports. IRGC cargos destined for Hezbollah and the Syrian regime were shipped into the port of Latakia, or flown in by Boeing 747 cargo aircraft flights using Latakia International Airport.\nOn its latest journey, theElyanaset off from Bandar Abbas on April 18, making a port call in Jebel Ali - notwithstanding the ship’s sanctioned status - and resuming her voyage on April 21. It is not known what cargo, if any, theElyanatook on at Jebel Ali. But the ship then took a leisurely 13 days to reach the southern end of the Suez Canal without making any declared port call. A transit from Jebel Ali to the Suez Canal normally takes six days. As it is equipped with deck cranes, theElyanawould be capable of offloading cargo at unsophisticated ports en route, potentially being able to do so in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen or in Sudan.\nAfter transiting the Suez Canal, theElyanamade for Tobruk, Libya, where she has been anchored for the last three weeks.\nThe port of Tobruk is managed by the forces of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls Eastern Libya and the country's oilfields, whilst the UN-recognized and Islamist-inclined government controls Western Libya and the capital of Tripoli.\nHaftar is supported by the UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the rebel RSF faction in Sudan, not normally regarded as Iranian allies. But Haftar is also supported by Russia, which is a close Iranian ally. The main backers of the recognized government in Tripoli are Turkey and Qatar.\nThe question of who is sponsoring theElyana’scargo, and who it is destined for, is thus a complete mystery. Likewise, who is turning a blind eye or conspiring to allow the delivery of the cargo is equally puzzling - which may be why theElyanais marooned at anchor with its cargo still unladen.\nThe only thing clear in the saga is that the consignor has been approved by or is sponsored by the IRGC. A degree of indecision on the part of the Tobruk port captain would therefore be understandable. In the past, cargos unloaded from suspicious IRGC-associated vessels, such as the IRISL shipsGolbonandJairan, havecaught firewith dramatic results."

        "content": "China is speaking out vehemently opposing plans by the Australian federal government to take back the leased Port of Darwin, terming the move as \"ethically questionable.\" The port has become the latest battleground over Chinese influence through port operations with Chinese officials asserting it is all part of the United States’ efforts and a plan to advance militarization in northern Australia.\nFueling the anger are reports in the Australian media that U.S. private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management is preparing to make a bid for the port’s operations which are currently under a long-term lease to Chinese operator Landbridge Group. Reports are pointing to the similarities between this proposal and the announced deal for BlackRock to acquire control of the two Chinese-run terminals at the Panama Canal and MSC’s role in acquiring Hutchison’s global terminal operations.\nChina is speaking out against the plans to take back the port as reports in the Australian media revealed Cerberus’ interest in Darwin. Media outlet ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) is reporting that earlier this month, a representative of Cerberus met with Darwin Port's management.\nThe Australianrevealedthe talks saying the New York-based firm is willing to slightly pay above the A$506 million (US$328 million) that Landbridge paid for the 99-year lease in 2015. Cerberus it is being pointed out has close ties to the Trump administration, with co-founder Steve Feinberg stepping down as the firm’s chief executive to become the Deputy Secretary of Defense.\nDarwin is one of Australia’s major ports for trade with the Asia-Pacific region. As a naturally occurring deep water port, the facility is strategically placed to be a vital link with the international marine shipping trade. With an annual throughput of 4.5 million cargo, the port is also a major supply center for Australian oil and gas projects.\nThe Port of Darwin was arecurring topicduring Australia’s federal elections earlier this month, with both Labor and the Liberal-National coalition promising to ensure the facility reverts to Australian control. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who managed to secure a second term, spoke of two options, one of which was to have an Australian-owned company take control of the port, or possibly nationalizing the port to being a government asset.\nLandbridge won the lease for Darwin port in 2015 signing an agreement with the Northern Territory government despite objections including concern voiced by the U.S. Landbridge committed to make investments to improve the port, but in late 2024 reported financial difficulties sparking discussions over the port’s future.\nChina's ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian released a strongly-worded statement on Sunday saying the contract between Landbridge and Northern Territories government must be respected. He contends it was an open and transparent bidding process, fully compliant with Australian laws and market principles. He asserts that over the past decade, the operator has made significant investments in maintaining and building the port’s infrastructure, optimizing its operations and management, and expanding its customer sources.\n“These efforts have brought remarkable improvements to the port, turning its financial situation from losses to profits and contributing positively to local economic and social development. Such an enterprise and project deserve encouragement, not punishment. It is ethically questionable to lease the port when it was unprofitable and then seek to reclaim it once it becomes profitable,” said Qian.\nToday, China’s newspaper Global Times released along editorialsaying Darwin has become a “political football” in Australian politics and saying the issue of control only surfaced “after so-called ‘concerns’ were voiced from Washington.”The newspaper asserts the port has been transformed over the past decade with about US$55 million in investments and upgrading port facilities.  It asserts if the Australian government takes the “drastic steps of forcibly taking back Darwin Port,” it would undoubtedly leave “enduring pitfalls for the country.” They call the choice between a prosperous hub for trade or the eye of a geopolitical storm a test of Australia’s strategic wisdom."

In a remarkable large-scale operation spanning more than 12 hours, first responders found and rescued all 10 crewmembers from the water.\nAt about 2100 hours on Sunday night, the bulkerCong Thanh 07was under way at a position about six nautical miles off Son Duong when it began taking on water in rough seas. The vessel sank in about 30 meters of water. The crew abandoned ship and began to drift with the current.\nSeven vessels were mobilized to participate in the search, according to the Vietnam Maritime Administration. The first survivor was rescued by a fishing boat at a position 17 nautical miles southwest of the location of the sinking, six hours after the casualty.\nAfter this initial rescue, the national SAR coordination center updated the search area to a 30-nautical-mile strip extending southeast from the place where the first crewmember was found. At 1200 hours, the search vesselSAR 631found and rescued six more individuals; good Samaritans found another three more, bringing the total to 10 survivors - the entire crew."

        "content": "\nMaritime Cook Islands has rapidly grown its open registry service over the past few years, and has an ambitious goal to amass one percent of all tonnage by the early 2030s. But the registry's commercial success has attracted scrutiny for its host government, the Cook Islands. After multiple reports of \"shadow fleet\" tankers on its registry, the Cook Islands has been ejected from a U.S.-backed information platform that helps registries track sanctioned vessels.\nLike many small sovereign states, the Cook Islands contracts out the operation of its ship registry to a private company - in this case, Maritime Cook Islands Limited,headquarteredin Rarotonga. Under private management, the registry has grown to encompass nearly 800 merchant ships within a matter of years.\nHowever, New Zealand's foreign affairs ministry has identified multiple \"shadow fleet\" tankers on the Maritime Cook Islands registry, and has repeatedly asked the Cook Islands government to address the matter. (New Zealand and the Cook Islands are closely linked through a compact of free association.)\nThe concerns began after a spurt of explosive growth at the registry. In the first half of 2024 alone, Maritime Cook Islands expanded its fleet by 140 percent, vaulting it into the top thirty flag registries by tonnage worldwide - largely by adding older tankers. Shadow fleet operators have generally built their ventures with older tonnage, purchased, renamed and reflagged.\nAs early as November 2024, New Zealand's diplomats raised \"deep concerns\" in security talks about an apparent pattern of sanctions evasion among certain Cook Islands-flagged tankers. Internally, New Zealand officials were concerned about the risks of an \"increasing number of problematic and sanctioned vessels\" on the Cook Islands registry, raising reputational and legal hazards that could arise if disreputable ships stayed on the list.\nNew Zealand may not be the only party with concerns. Earlier this month, Maritime Cook Islands learned that it had been removed from access to the Registry Information Sharing Compact (RISC), an international database designed to help registry administrators find and block sanctions violators. RISC was set up by leading flag states, including Panama and the Marshall Islands. Maritime Cook Islands said that it had not received an explanation about why that decision had been reached, except for an allegation of potential violations of terms and conditions of the service.\n\"MCI reached out to the founding members of RISC on 8 May 2025 and again on 13 May and again on 21 May. MCI has not had a response from any of them,\" Maritime Cook Islands told Radio New Zealand. \"MCI is at a loss to understand what possible violation has been committed.\"\n"

She deviated from the marked shipping lane, and at 0100, she went aground on a charted shoal, just outside the fairway on the south side of the Øresund Bridge. No injuries or spills were reported; the vessel has about 18,000 gallons of diesel fuel in her tanks and authorities are monitoring pollution risks.\nAfter the grounding, one crewmember was arrested on suspicion of gross negligence. According to local media, it is believed that at least one other individual may have been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the casualty. The crew are being interviewed and officials are gathering evidence from the vessel.\nThe damage to the hull could complicate salvage efforts. The authorities initially planned to refloat the ship and tow it to deeper water when a suitable weather window arrived, but the possibility of further damage or water ingress could require different response measures.\nAs of Tuesday evening,Ali Aykinremained aground on the shoal with two Swedish coast guard vessels just southwest of its position, AIS data fromPole Starshows."

Kevin Smith - program executive officer for unmanned and small combatants (PEO USC) - was relieved of command on Tuesday. The message was unusually specific: the Navy said that the action was \"based on a complaint substantiated by an Office of the Naval Inspector General investigation.\" It is very rare for the service to acknowledge an investigation when it announces the removal of a senior officer.\nPEO USC designs, buys and maintains the Navy's small surface combatants. This includes the troubled and truncated Littoral Combat Ship program; the much-delayed Constellation-class frigate program; and the service's endeavor to design, build and use unmanned vessel technology, like the proposed Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel (MUSV).\nThe decision to remove Adm. Smith was made by Dr. Brett Seidle, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, an experienced career official with years of service in running and auditing Navy R&D programs.\nFor now, Rear Adm. Smith's former command will be headed by its most senior civilian leader - Melissa Kirkendall, the executive director of the division. Kirkendall, an electrical engineer by training, has 30 years of experience in the Navy's R&D establishment. No uniformed officer has been named to step into Rear Adm. Smith's post.\nRear Adm. Kevin Smith spent much of his career in NAVSEA's Integrated Warfare Systems program office, working on the AEGIS system and then on the truncated DDG 1000 (Zumwalt) destroyer program. He ran the Constellation-class frigate acquisition program from its early phases through 2023, when he took over as head of PEO USC."

I hope their spread is tracked by the government.#oilspillindiapic.twitter.com/98wSutlZK4\nOn Saturday, the feederMSC Elsa 3was under way from Vizhinjam to Kochi with a cargo of 640 containers on board. It developed a severe list, and the crew abandoned ship in time to escape a capsizing. They were promptly rescued by the Indian Coast Guard and Indian Navy, and all survived.\nMSC Elsa 3went down with about 85 tonnes of diesel and 370 tonnes of fuel oil on board. The shipowner has hired T&T Salvage to mitigate the pollution risk and recover lost containers from the shoreline, and that effort is already under way, officials from the Mercantile Marine Department of Kochi (MMD) told media on Wednesday.\nAccording to the MMD, the vessel lost about 100 containers when it went down, and about 50 of them have washed up in and around the Kollam region. The ship is leaking a small quantity of fuel oil, and the Indian Coast Guard is applying dispersants to reduce the spread.\nThe responders are planning to empty the fuel tanks of the wreck to reduce the risk of further pollution. The oil recovery operation is already under way, and the salvors hope to complete the work by July 3. Operations to clean up the wrecked containers on shore are also in progress and should be finished by the end of this week, the MMD said.\nThe reports of raw plastic nurdles on the beach present a new hurdle. The tiny microscopic pellets are hard to clean up, and tend to intermingle with sand, sometimes reemerging months or years later. Birds and other wildlife often mistake the pellets for food and ingest them, along with any toxins that the pellets may have absorbed from the surrounding environment. The world's largest plastic spill, the release of 1,680 tonnes of nurdles off Sri Lanka in 2021, continues to pollute beaches and reefs near Colombo after years of cleanup."

The second-largest vessel of her kind, she arrived in the U.S. repositioning from Rotterdam and will be used to support the first phase of the offshore installation for Equinor’s Empire Wind offshore wind farm.\nThe vessel anchored between Jamestown and Newport drew a lot of attention from the local media and residents while opponents of offshore wind took to social media announcing the arrival of the “death star” (a reference to the Star Wars movies franchise).\nStanding at a height of up to 470 feet and capable of lifting up to 14,200 metric tons,Thialfwas the largest floating crane vessel in the world from when she was built in 1985 until Heerema Marine added theSleipnirin 2019. The vessel was mostly used to support offshore oil and gas projects but more recently has also been used for monopoles and other elements off offshore wind projects.\nA spokesperson for Equinor and the Harbormaster for Jamestown both confirmed to the Rhode Island media that the vessel is on a short layover for staging. She is conducting a crew swap and taking on teams before she heads offshore to the site south of Long Island for the Empire Wind project.\nShe arrived in the U.S. just a week after the Trump administration lifted a month’s long stop work order for the wind farm. Equinor had highlighted that the project was 30 percent complete and proceeding with its onshore work. Offshore work was scheduled to start this spring for the wind farm which is due to be completed by 2027.\n\nThe second-largest crane ship on the planet steamed into Newport Harbor Monday afternoon — and its arrival has environmentalists and fishermen sounding the alarm.The SSCV Thialf, a towering 661.5-foot vessel with a beam of 290 feet and a jaw-dropping height of 472 feet, is now…pic.twitter.com/PI0TsWvNs3\n\nAccording to the reports, theThialfwill be working to start the monopile installation for the 54 wind turbines planned for Empire Wind. It will also be placing the foundation for the offshore substation for the wind farm.\nThe manufacturing of the first monopile for Empire Wind was completed in November 2024 and in April Netherlands-based Sif reported that the first six of the 54 foundations have departed Rotterdam for transit to New York. The company had reported it was proceeding with the project during the month-long pause in the U.S.\nEquinor reported in 2022 that it had contracted with what is now Maersk Offshore for its newly-built wind turbine installation vessel to install the turbines for Empire Wind. The plan calls for the wind turbine components to be staged at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal and moved to the site on barges with tugs from Crowley.\nThe project projects that first power will be generated in 2026.

On their next deployment, members of the crew will have an Oura Ring personal health tracker - a small titanium ring that contains sensors for heart rate, body temperature, blood oxygen level and acceleration. Among other things, this data allows Oura to assess sleep quality and fatigue, which are the main targets of a new Navy study.\nFatigue is a constant theme in maritime casualty reports, and the U.S. Navy's two biggest losses of the past decade both had lack of sleep as a contributing factor. In the early hours of June 17, 2017, the destroyer USSFitzgeraldcollided with the container shipACX Crystal,tearing a hole measuring about 12 feet by 17 feet inFitzgerald'shull. Seven sailors were killed, and the survivors saved their ship only through heroic efforts at damage control. Barely more than two months later, destroyer USSJohn S. McCainstruck the tankerAlnic MCnear Singapore, killing 10 ofMcCain'ssailors.\nInvestigators found that the crews ofMcCainandFitzgeraldhad had too little time for rest. Aboard Fitzgerald, the watch officers had \"little to no sleep\" before the night of the casualty because of in-port events, an after-action report found. OnMcCain, records showed that the 14 crewmembers on the bridge during the collision had an average of less than 5 hours of sleep in the previous 24 hours, and one relevant individual had had no sleep at all.\nEight years later, Navy researchers are still working to develop better tools to help commands address fatigue. The health-data study aboard USSGerald R. Fordis an attempt to gather more information on how a long deployment affects the crew, researchers told Navy Times.\nOperational security informed the Navy's selection of hardware and software: after the Strava fiasco of 2018, in which a cloud-based personal fitness app disclosed the GPS locations of military personnel around the world, the Navy selected a product that would be more discreet. Oura Ring lacks a long-distance RF signature, researchers told Navy Times.\nThe ultimate objective is to give crewmembers a way to watch their own readiness, and at the same time, to give commanding officers detailed data on how their subordinates are affected by fatigue. “[We're] helping leadership on these ships understand how the mission is impacting the sleep and the recovery of their sailors, especially as they go on these deployments that involve a lot of stress,” Dr. Rachel Markwald of the Naval Health Research Center told Navy Times.\nParticipating crewmembers will get to keep their own Oura Ring if they wear it during more than three-quarters of the deployment."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe global merchant shipping industry is grappling with a fast-changing geopolitical landscape that is creating new risks and challenges, an emerging phenomenon that has the potential to reverse significant gains achieved over the past decade in terms of safety. Global insurer Allianz released its Safety and Shipping Review 2025 showing that although shipping losses have maintained a downward trend, the situation could change due to geopolitical headwinds.\nThe shipping industry continues to be the engine propelling the global economy, transporting 90 percent of international trade highlights the report. Despite its importance, Allianz says the industry is operating in an increasingly volatile and complex environment characterized by attacks, vessel detentions, and sanctions, as well as the fallout from incidents involving damage to critical sub-sea cables. In recent months, increasing protectionism and tariff wars have added another layer of risks.\nDespite the ever-present dangers, the industry is performing relatively well in terms of safety improvements reports Allianz. In 2024, the industry recorded only 27 large ship losses, which is a record low considering 35 ships were lost the previous year. The 2024 figure represents a 20 percent annual decline and a 75 percent decline in total losses over the past decade (105 in 2015). When compared to the 1990s, the level of safety improvements is dramatic. Two decades ago, the industry was losing over 200 vessels annually but managed to halve it a decade ago. Since then, there has been an impressive trend of decline in losses.\nAllianz is now warning that the gains could be eroded. The U.S.-China trade conflict, Russia’s growing shadow fleet, and emerging challenges brought about by decarbonization have the potential to offset the gains. The U.S. has come out aggressively with tariffs against China and also intends to impose port charges on Chinese vessels. The impact according to the report has the potential to create significant stress and disruption of supply chains, pressure on trade routes, and port congestion.\nRussia’s shadow fleet is another major threat to maritime safety and the environment. The shadow fleet, composed of older, poorly maintained oil tankers, has expanded rapidly since the Ukraine invasion. Today, it is estimated that around 17 percent of the world tanker fleet belongs to the shadow fleet, which is close to 600 tankers trading Russian oil alone. These vessels have been involved in tens of incidents including fires, collisions, and oil spills.\n“The relevance of political risk and conflict as a potential cause of maritime loss is increasing with heightened geopolitical tensions,” said Captain Rahul Khanna, Allianz Commercial Global Head of Marine Risk Consulting. “Total losses from traditional causes may have reduced over time, but we could be in a position where this positive trend is potentially offset by war and other political-related exposures. As an industry, we are in a better position with regard to traditional risks, but there is a renewed focus on geopolitical risks.”\nThough the shipping industry is facing an uncertain immediate future, 2024 was another year characterized by significant improvements. South China, Indochina, Indonesia, and the Philippines however maintained a negative reputation as the hotspot of losses. Together with the British Isles and the East Mediterranean and Black Sea, the regions reported four losses each and 169 cumulatively over the past decade.\nFishing vessels have replaced cargo ships in terms of losses, accounting for 40 percent of the total losses. Foundering continued to be the main cause of losses accounting for close to 50 percent, with fire being another major cause. Extreme weather was reported as being a factor in at least seven losses during the year with the average age of a vessel involved in a total loss over the past 10 years being 29.\nThe review shows that the number of reported shipping casualties or incidents around the world increased by around 10 percent in 2024, rising to 3,310 compared to 2,963 in the previous year. The British Isles saw the highest number at 799, followed by the East Mediterranean and Black Sea at 694.\nFor the industry, cases of fires remain a major concern with seven losses reported in 2024, the same number as a year earlier. Notably, there were 250 reported fire incidents during the year, up by 20 percent year-on-year and the highest total for a decade. Nearly a third of the fire incidents occurred on either container, cargo, or RoRo vessels. Critically, more than 100 of the total losses were caused by fires over the past decade.\nAllianz reports that while shipowners are trying to operate vessels safely within an ever-changing and dynamic regulatory framework, this is becoming increasingly difficult. It highlights that shipping choke points are increasingly coming under fire as geopolitical and regional tensions rise. The Suez Canal has for instance recorded a massive decline in transits due to Houthi attacks while the South China Sea, which carries one-third of global shipping, could see disruptions in the future. The same is transpiring in the Arctic waters, which have become focal points of international tension as countries seek control over emerging trade routes as the ice melts."

It is part of a larger strategy released today that seeks to build expanded ties between the European community with the South Caucasus and Central Asia that would counter Russian expansionism and the efforts by countries ranging from Iran and China to expand relationships in the region.\nRussia's war of aggression against Ukraine has shaped a degraded maritime security environment, with prospects to last even after the cessation of military hostilities writes the EU in describing the imperative for the new efforts. It highlights that mined areas in the littoral states’ waters, drifting mines, and other unexploded ordnance create serious risks to maritime security. It also notes the emergence of cyber and hybrid challenges as equally factoring into the overall maritime security environment in the Black Sea, affecting negatively the safety of shipping.\n“The EU is committed to help turn the Black Sea into a mine-free sea basin through enhanced cooperation with its member states, the Black Sea partners, like-minded countries, and partner organizations,” it declares.\nThe EU writes that maritime security in the Black Sea is essential for all areas of cooperation and that freedom of navigation and safety of shipping is essential for the development of transportation corridors supporting trade. It notes Ukraine’s success in developing its corridor for grain and other shipments and looks to encourage similar developments in the region.\nThe plan does not propose a specific location for the hub but outlines a role in building maritime situational awareness through monitoring efforts. It would include a focus on submarine cables and offshore assets including gas and wind energy infrastructure. It would also focus on the dangers created by the shadow fleet of tankers involved in the Russian oil trade.\nThe EU notes its roles and responsibilities in the Black Sea region are increasing as it looks to forge closer cooperation with Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Turkey, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. It notes that Ukraine as well as Moldova and Georgia had expressed interest in joining the EU while it looks to develop a more coordinated approach with Turkey, which is already a member.\nThe strategy for the Black Sea region focused on enhancing security and stability writes the EU, as well as fostering sustainable growth and promoting environmental protection. In addition to the Maritime Security Hub, it is calling for a Connectivity Agenda to develop regional information sharing and networks for transport, energy, and digital networks. It also calls for aiding coastal communities that are experiencing both war-related environmental damage and are in danger from climate change.\n“Today we adopt a new Strategy for the Black Sea – a region of great strategic importance to the EU with many countries vying for EU membership,” said Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission. “Against a backdrop of Russia breaching airspace, attacking ports and shipping routes, naval mines, front and center of this work is improving security in the region.”\nAfter re-election in 2024 as president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, had called for a broad strategy to address the challenges of the Black Sea region. She said in announcing the plan that the EU would work with its “neighbors to foster security and stability in the region.”\nAs a next step, the European Commission is proposing a ministerial meeting with partner countries to advance the cooperation."

The overloaded fishing vessel entered the Greek search and rescue zone on June 13, and the Hellenic Coast Guard dispatched patrol vessel LS-920 to the scene.\nOn June 14, the fishing vessel capsized and sank; 82 bodies were recovered, 104 survivors were saved, and up to 500 people were presumed dead.\nSurvivors alleged that LS-920 attempted to tow the Adriana. During the third and final tow attempt, survivors told media, the Adriana capsized. The Hellenic Coast Guard strongly disputed these accounts and maintained that no towing attempts occurred. The agency refused to launch its own internal disciplinary investigation, even after the Greek government's ombudsman asserted that LS-920's crew may have violated the law.\nIn May, nearly two years after the sinking, the deputy prosecutor of the Piraeus Naval Court concluded that there was enough evidence to charge the crew of response vessel LS-920. The commanding officer of the patrol vessel has been charged with \"causing a shipwreck,\" resulting in the deaths of 82 people - the number of bodies recovered from the scene. The 16 members of the crew face charges of \"simple complicity\" for following the commanding officer's orders. Four officials, including the then-head of the Hellenic Coast Guard and the head of the National Search and Rescue Center, were charged with exposing others to danger for their role in the LS-920's operations.\nUnder Greece's judicial system, the charges mean that the suspects will now be questioned by prosecutors at the Piraeus Naval Court. The prosecutor will then decide whether to bring the case to trial.\nIn addition to the facts of the night of the sinking, the prosecutors will likely explore accounts of an alleged cover-up.Beginning immediately after the sinking, some survivors said that they were instructed by Hellenic Coast Guard officers not to talk about any alleged \"towing attempt.\" The agency also told investigators that on-scene video and VHF recordings of the casualty - the only hard evidence of what happened that night - were missing. VHF recordings were later leaked to the press."

        "content": "Work-related fatigue among seafarers has increased, despite efforts to monitor work and rest regulations on ships reports a new study by Cardiff University. According to the researchers, seafarers working both on cargo and cruise ships highlighted issues related to health and welfare that should be improved.\nThe analysis, from the Seafarers International Research Centre, was based on anonymous questionnaires and interviews with 1,240 cargo ship workers and 1,202 cruise sector crewmembers. Professor Helen Sampson, director of Cardiff University’s Seafarers’ International Research Centre highlights that the results were being released within days of reports of a watch officer falling asleep and the cargo ship he was navigating running aground in Norway, narrowly missing a house.\n“Despite better monitoring of staff work/rest hours, fatigue remains an intractable problem for seafarers,” says Professor Sampson. “Evidence shows there are many instances of work/rest hours records being falsified to conceal overwork – but even when the Maritime Labour Convention is followed, seafarers can still be left without enough rest. An overhaul of work/rest hours regulations is long overdue. The regulations need to be changed to provide for an uninterrupted rest period for all seafarers which is aligned with the recommended levels of sleep for adults.\"\nThe data from the study reveals that more than a third of cargo ship crewmembers who were on board a ship when they completed the questionnaire reported that they had not had enough sleep in the past 48 hours. Seafarers stated that they did not get enough sleep because of the number of hours they worked, the patterns of work they observed, their port duties, vessel movement, and noise.\nProfessor Sampson reports that these issues have increased since similar data was collected in 2016 and 2011. A higher number of cargo ship workers she reports also described insufficient sleep due to work-related anxiety, general anxiety, and homesickness than in previous surveys. Insufficient sleep as a result of work-related anxiety was a particularly acute problem among senior officers.\nOther findings show that in almost one in five cases, cargo seafarers who had experienced a serious injury or illness did not have medical attention when they needed it. There was normally no access to a qualified medic on board, with patchy telemedical assistance being provided until they arrived in port.\n“It is also clear that access to medical care on board cargo ships is woefully inadequate, with no medically qualified person on board in the event of an emergency,” says Sampson. “Having a trained medic on board would ensure workers are not left suffering for long periods if they are injured or ill when far from land.”\nThe reports also focus on the experiences of cruise ship workers, with just under half of the 950 participants who were at sea when surveyed feeling they had not had sufficient sleep in the previous 48 hours. Work hours and work patterns were the main reasons for insufficient sleep. Almost one in 10 cruise workers also described a medical condition that they attributed directly to their work, although most had access to a qualified doctor on board.\n“There are many areas where improvements can be made to protect the health and wellbeing of seafarers in the cruise and cargo sectors,” concludes Sampson. “The provision of facilities which seafarers can use for therapeutic purposes such as baths and saunas, increased access to shore leave, and the provision of good quality food would all be important inclusions in a holistic effort to protect and promote seafarers’ health and wellbeing.”\nThis research was funded by the Stiftelsen Sveriges Sjömanshus (Swedish Seamen's House Foundation) and received some additional support from the Sjöbefälsföreningen (Swedish Naval Officers' Association trade union)."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The Dutch Safety Board is calling for an overhaul of the systems used for responding to maritime emergencies. It completed a nearly two-year review of the response to the 2023 fire aboard the vehicle carrierFremantle Highwaypointing to a lack of training and coordination which contributed to a delayed response and the likely injury of several crewmembers aboard the vessel.\nThe report concludes that the emergency response system is not properly organized so calls are not properly prioritized and the different organizations are not working together in their response. They concluded that the vulnerabilities of the system only become apparent when there is a complex request for assistance that demands a coordinated response from multiple organizations.\nThe case of theFremantle Highwaywas one of those complex requests. The failure of the system saw seven crewmembers feeling compelled to jump from the burning ship from heights of up to 30 meters (nearly 100 feet). The board concluded that the focus had remained for too long on firefighting rather than moving to search and rescue to evacuate the seafarers in a timely fashion. As a result, the crewmembers were trapped unable to reach safety and the lifeboats were rendered unusable. Six crewmembers jumped suffering injuries and a seventh also jumped despite a KNRM (Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution) captain urging them not to jump due to the dangers. All the crewmembers were injured from jumping into the ocean and one later died of his injuries.\n“The Dutch Safety Board has repeatedly pointed out in recent years that the Coastguard Center is insufficiently capable of assuming control when it needs to collaborate with other parties,” says Erica Bakkum, a member of the Dutch Safety Board. “It does not help that several ministries share administrative responsibility for the Coastguard. That setup makes it harder to take rapid action.”\nThe report of the fire aboard theFremantle Highwaywas received just before midnight on July 25, 2023, but the board says “assistance was slow to materialize.” The priority was placed on firefighting without aerial support to determine the level of severity. It was not until 0200 that a Coastguard surveillance aircraft with thermal imaging reached the vessel and determined the full extent of the spread of the fire. The crew requested evacuation at 0230 but it took another 45 minutes for helicopters to reach the vessel.\nThe safety board in reviewing the timeline found that the helicopters assigned to pick up the specialized firefighting unit were left waiting in Rotterdam for over an hour and the team hesitated to board due to a lack of clarity on whether the fire could be safely engaged. The helicopters were sent to the vessel without the firefighting team.\nA lack of communication and coordination also created onshore delays. Hospitals were not notified till shortly before the injured arrived. Ambulances had to wait outside the airport for 15 minutes because entry gates were locked.\nThe board concludes that the lack of early aerial support directly contributed to the problems. It also says the decision-making process was bogged down by incomplete communications between the Coastguard and other agencies.\n“The system for responding to incidents in the North Sea needs to be put in order as soon as possible,” the report concludes. The Safety Board is advocating for the appointment of a mandated director who can coordinate the necessary improvements in the response to emergencies. They are calling for the Ministries of Infrastructure and Water Management, Defense, and Justice and Security to work together to collectively put the emergency response system in order as quickly as possible.\nCurrently, the board says it is unclear which scenarios actually require the deployment of the maritime firefighting team. In the case of the Fremantle Highway, it concludes the situation involved an “undesirable degree of interference between the tasks of maritime firefighting and rescue.”\nThey are calling for establishing a digital exchange of information between the Coastguard Coordination Center and the others involved in the emergency response chain of command. The center’s assessment and decision-making processes, training, and exercises have to be linked and improved. They are also calling for clarifying which scenarios require firefighting versus rescue and applying an approach to address the potential for interference between the different teams’ deployment."

        "content": "The skipper of a training sailboat operating in Germany was injured when the vessel was caught in the wake of a tanker as it was entering a lock on Saturday evening, May 24. The skipper was injured when the rigging collapsed as the vessels collided in the lock and the mast was damaged on the sailboat.\nThe 11.5-meter (38-foot) sailboatElbe Expressbuilt in 2016 is employed for sailing instruction in Hamburg and the surrounding areas of Germany. School operator Yachtschule Eichler highlights that it is an agile vessel “ideal for sailing instruction because it conveys the physical feeling of sailing a large dinghy.” It is certified by the German Maritime Accident Insurance Association (Seeberufsgenossenschaft) and used for cruises on the Elbe River, North Sea, Atlantic, and Baltic Sea.\nThe vessel was directed into the lock at Brunsbüttel on Saturday evening but became caught in the wake of an unnamed tanker that had already entered the lock. The mast of theElbe Expresshit the deck of the tanker and broke.\n\n\nMast of the sailboat broke and the rigging fell to the deck injuring the skipper (Yachtschule Eichler)\n\nThe collapsing pieces of the rigging trapped the skipper of the vessel against the rail of the boat and the Brunsbüttel fire brigade had to be brought in with equipment to free her. She was airlifted to a local hospital. The company reports the skipper is bruised and suffered a broken rib but avoided more serious injury and has been released from the hospital.\nThe operator reports that these types of incidents are unfortunately a relatively frequent occurrence. The tanker had fenders to prevent serious damage to the vessel but unfortunately, the incident still occurred. The company reports it is in a dialogue with the Federal WSV about how these types of incidents can be avoided in the future. It also warns boats not to enter the lock until the situation in the chamber is safe.\nThe authorities are not proceeding with a further investigation. After an initial review, the company reports, it was determined the skipper had acted correctly attempting to prevent the incident in the lock.\nTrips with theElbe Expresswere canceled while the company was waiting for a new rig from Denmark. They expect the vessel to be repaired and back in service next week."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nOn Wednesday, a panel of three judges at the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Donald Trump's sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariffs are unlawful, finding that his orders exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This 1977 law provided the legal basis for the administration's largest and most ambitious tariff rates, but the text of the statute does not mention tariffs, and it had never been used in this way before.\nThe Trump administration immediately filed a notice of its intent to appeal the decision. The president's levies on specific types of goods - cars, metals, auto parts - remain intact, as they rely on a different statutory authority.\nThe court ruled in favor of 12 states and five businesses that had sued to block the April 2 tariff hikes. If the ruling stands, the trade court's decision could have profound effects on American shipping, commerce and manufacturing. The April 2 executive orders imposed steep country-specific tariff rates, followed by a series of rapid adjustments and pauses - the latest as recent as last week, when the president threatened a 50 percent tariff on goods from the EU. The order would unwind these tectonic changes.\nHowever, the judges noted that the president has alternatives. Under a separate statute, the Trade Act of 1974, the president has a clearly-defined power to enact tariffs of up to 15 percent for up to 150 days. That as-yet-unused statutory authority remains open to the administration.\nIt is unclear how the ruling would affect trade, and it raises practical questions. If the administration's high tariff rates are rapidly unwound, per the court's order, it could upend business plans to relocate manufacturing out of high-tariff countries (especially China). And the White House - which is attempting to negotiate \"90 deals in 90 days\" with foreign trading partners - would be suddenly without its largest source of leverage."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "A court in Italy has ordered six activists with the organization Mediterranea Saving Humans to stand trial related to the 2020 rescue of 27 migrants who were stranded in the Mediterranean on the product tankerMaersk Etienne. A lawyer for the NGO is reporting that it is the first time one of these cases has been ordered to go to trial with previous attempts at prosecution stopped either during investigation or at preliminary hearings.\nThe Italian government has taken an aggressive stance against the NGOs operating in the Mediterranean in an effort to stop the influx of migrants and refugees. The groups which operate more than a dozen rescue vessels contend they are being harassed. After Giorgia Meloni became Prime Minister of Italy in 2022 new rules were put in place giving the Coast Guard added authority over the landing of the migrants. The NGOs contend they are being sent to more distant ports in an effort to disrupt their operations and the ships have been subjected to frequent port inspections.\nThe new case is being complicated by allegations that the NGO profited from the rescue. Three months after it removed the 27 migrants that had been aboard the tanker for 38 days, Maersk Tankers made a donation of approximately $140,000 to Mediterranea Saving Humans, which reports said was to cover the costs associated with the rescue. Prosecutors are alleging the group’s organizers profited from the donation.\nOn August 4, 2020, the product tankerMaersk Etienne(37,000 dwt) responded to a call for assistance from a small boat about 70 nautical miles north of Libya and acting on instructions of Maltese rescue coordination officials, took the boat's 27 occupants aboard. However, the tanker then found itself in astandoffwith Malta which refused to give permission for the migrants to be landed. The tanker highlighted it did have the facilities to care for 27 people and required assistance.\nMediterranea Saving Humans responded by sending its vesselMare Jonio, a 1972-built tugboat, to provide aid. Aboard it had a doctor to offer basic medical care. The refugees weretransferred to the tugboatbut Malta continued to refuse permission to disembark the individuals. They were finally landed in the Italian port of Pozzallo on Sicily.\nThe captain of theMare Jonioand three crewmembers are among those being charged with aiding illegal immigration. Among those that the court ordered remanded was the doctor from the rescue boat. It has also remanded the founder of the group, Luca Casarini, a prominent left-wing activist and critic of the government.\nThe NGO responded saying its team had done nothing wrong and it is the latest case of harassment against its efforts. They allege that prosecutors have been asked several times to pursue cases or to arrest the heads of the organization but grounds were never established. They say that judicial police reports have been prepared and allege a campaign of slander and spying. It recently came out that the founder’s phone had been hacked with spyware.\n“We will not be frightened by anyone,” said Casarini after today’s court hearing. “We know very well what we have done: we have helped 27 people, left in the middle of the sea for 38 days. This trial will become an opportunity to ask ministers, governments, and authorities to account for why these people were left in the middle of the sea.”\nThe group says it will not be intimidated. After the 2020 rescue, its vesselMare Joniowas held and not able to return to sea till June 2021 but since then they report having conducted dozens of missions. Today, they also announced an agreement with the German group Sea-Eye to take over theSea-Eye 4, a 1972-built offshore supply ship that is being renamedMediterraneanto continue its rescue missions. At 931 gross tons, it is significantly larger than theMare Joniowith the group highlighting that it is doubling its rescue efforts.\nThe court in Ragusa (Sicily) has set October 21 as the date for the first hearing in the trial of the six individuals."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nWhen the University College London's Energy Institute used detailed modeling to evaluate the IMO's highly complex new carbon price structure, they came to a surprising conclusion: if proven safe, dual-fuel ammonia propulsion will be the least-cost alternative for shipowners who want to comply with the rules in the 2030s and beyond - and it reduces the risk of fuel unavailability, too.\n\"Although there are significant complexities and uncertainties in what was agreed [at IMO MEPC 83] in April, even conservative projections of how remaining policy details will be finalised results in a ‘no brainer’ choice for shipowners in dual fuel ammonia,\" said Dr. Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at the UCL Energy Institute.\nUCL's 40-page study illustrates what owners are quickly finding out: a winning business strategy for carbon compliance is going to require a lot of math.\nThe IMO is not planning a simple flat tax on bunker fuel. Instead, ships will be expected to meet an emissions intensity standard, which gets more strict over time. If owners meet the standard, they pay the IMO nothing. If they emit too much, they can comply by paying a tax (remedial units) at prices that will rise at a yet-to-be-determined pace. Alternatively, they can overcomply and sell their emissions credits (surplus units) to other owners, and collect yet-to-be-determined subsidies (rewards) for using low-emission fuels.\nThe details for these factors change over time, so a business plan for the 25-year lifespan of a newbuild has to account for different compliance requirements and cost structures in the 2020s, 2030s and 2040s.\nInitially, UCL found, LNG dual-fuel ships will have an edge on cost. But as the emissions intensity standard gets tougher in the mid-2030s, the cost of compliance for LNG will go up. Ammonia dual-fuel ships begin to win out because they can burn blue ammonia, made from cheap natural gas with the added bonus of onshore carbon capture. Running a ship on blue ammonia will generate a lot of IMO surplus units, which can be sold to other shipowners to offset the cost of the fuel.\n\"Blue ammonia, which also benefits from the low gas price outlook modelled, is the only fuel with an abatement cost lower than the initial [remedial unit] price and the only fuel capable of generating significant volumes of [surplus units] into the mid-2030s,\" UCL concluded.\nThis is enough to make the ammonia dual-fuel strategy the winning business case, even before taking expected IMO rewards for zero and near-zero fuels into account, according to UCL.\nOptionality adds another bonus in an uncertain landscape. With a dual-fuel ammonia hull, the operator can burn fossil bunker fuel; biofuel; blue ammonia; or e-ammonia, made with green electricity. This means the operator can pick from the best available pricing in the markets for natural gas, oil, biofuel or green power, depending on how the energy market fluctuates.\nThe study's findings would put LNG in second place, and the authors included a warning that LNG bunkering infrastructure investments could prove unnecessary if ammonia takes hold (a cautionary note that UCL has sounded before). The authors also discounted the possibility of onboard carbon capture, noting cost and infrastructure requirements.\n\"Despite any early dominance LNG may achieve in the late 2020s, its prospects become more challenging by the early 2030s. LNG's relatively high emissions intensity presents a fundamental constraint—it cannot generate surplus units (SUs) without onboard carbon capture and storage technology,\" found UCL. \"Consequently, LNG dual-fuel (DF) ships must rely on either lower-emission drop-in fuels (such as bio-LNG, bio-marine gas oil, or e-LNG) or accept penalty costs.\""

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThere has been a growing focus in many destinations around the world on the challenges as cruise ships get larger and efforts to limit or even ban large cruise ships grow. A small town in southern Alaska, Sitka (population 8,300) however bucked the trend by rejecting proposed cruise ship limits.\nA popular cruise ship destination because of its heritage as a Russian outpost in Alaska, Sitka like many ports has grappled with the surge of passengers during the summer busy season. The cruise passenger problem has grown more acute in the small town as the number of visitors more than doubled over two seasons in the years 2022 and 2023. At its peak, the city can receive as many as 13,000 or more visitors a day so that they exceed the number of residents.\nOpponents of the cruise ships have been fighting for years to have a public referendum, and they succeeded on their fourth try with a special election called for May 28. The sole issue on the ballot was proposed limits on cruise ships. They called for a daily limit of 4,500 visitors and an annual limit of 300,000 visitors. In addition, they were proposing implementing a permitting system for ship visits and requiring that one day each week be without large cruise ships.\nTown fathers however surprised with a total of nearly 3,000 votes cast, higher than the last regular elections and less than 10 percent from their all-time high for a special election. The unofficial results showed 73 percent of the people rejected the limits with only 27 percent (773 people) voting in favor of the proposed limits.\nThe private operator of the dock however did admit that more than a quarter of the voters supported limits and it said that it was working with the town on possible solutions. Historically, Sitka was an anchorage port with passengers having to land by tender which helped to disperse some of the crowds. The dock, which handles two large cruise ships at a time, requires shuttle buses as it is five miles away, and that people say is part of the problem creating congestion.\nThe dock operator and tour operators report they are working to build more options to better disperse passengers. They are also working with the cruise lines to stagger the arrival and departure times of the ships and brought in new smaller shuttle buses to also disperse the crowds. Also in a memorandum of understanding with the city, they proposed a limit of 7,000 daily passengers and not accepting ships with more than 1,000 passengers at the dock when the limit would be surpassed.\nThe outcome of the vote is different from elsewhere in Alaska where efforts to limit cruise ship arrivals have gained momentum. Juneau, a larger city with a population of 31,500, and the trade group Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) agreed to daily limits. Other smaller towns, such as Ketchikan (population 8,000) have also discussed the best steps to manage the volume of visitors.\nIn 2024, an estimated 1.68 million cruise passengers visited Southeast Alaska, making it a record year for tourism in the region.  The Alaska Travel Industry Association however calculates when cross-gulf and other destinations are included along with the ferries the total in 2024 was 1.785 million people by ship which was two-thirds of the total 2.7 million visitors to the state in 2024.\nSome early forecasts for the 2025 season which began in April projected a leveling off this year due to capacity constraints, but the Port of Settle forecasted the number could reach as high as 1.9 million cruise visitors from May through October 2025. The following year, 2026, will see further growth as both MSC Cruises and Virgin Voyages launch their first Alaska seasons and for 2027 MSC’s luxury brand Explora Journeys has also announced it will be joining the market. Most analysts agree that Alaska will remain one of the top summer cruise destinations."

        "content": "With strong advance bookings and a positive outlook, the cruise industry is moving forward with the planned but delayed large revitalizations of existing ships. Brands including Royal Caribbean’s Celebrity Cruises, MSC Cruises, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings’ Regent Seven Seas Cruises have each recently announced large investments into existing ships in the fleet in addition to their newbuilding efforts.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the industry in 2020, plans for the modernization of ships in the fleets were put on hold and canceled as the cruise lines worked to reduce capital expenditures. None of the major brands canceled new ship orders and recently they have placed the first large cruise ship orders since the pandemic. Now with strong demand from travelers, the lines are resuming their efforts at revitalizing existing ships.\nThe strength of the industry was highlighted last week when the trade group Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) released its 2025 State of the Industry report. It is projecting approximately nine percent growth in passenger counts for its member lines or a total of 37.7 million passengers in 2025. Especially encouraging was the fact that nearly a third (31 percent) of passengers in the past two years on its members’ ships were first-time cruisers.\nCelebrity Cruises announced today, May 29, that it is resuming its efforts at modernizing its Solstice class cruise ships. Built by Meyer Werft, the first of the ships,Celebrity Solsticeentered service in November 2008 and was scheduled for a large refit as part of the $500 million Revolution program launched in 2018. The program was deferred mid-way due to the pandemic, but now the company reports it is launching a new investment program spending more than $250 million on the five ships of the Solstice class.\nCelebrity Solstice(121,878 gross tons) will be first with an extensive dry dock renovation in early 2026 and introduce her new amenities in March 2026. Celebrity reports they will be adding eight new experiences, four new spaces, reinventing outdoor spaces, and a ship-wide stateroom and suite upgrades. All the 1,479 staterooms will be upgraded as well as adding new entertainment venues, an elevated sports bar, a new Italian restaurant, a redone steakhouse, and more. renderings also show a new livery matching the newbuildCelebrity Xcel.\nMSC Cruises is undertaking the most extensive renovation since it stretched cruise ships a decade ago. TheMSC Magnifica(95,128 gross tons) had been scheduled to be lengthened by 75 feet adding 215 cabins in 2021 at a cost of $143 million. Now the company reports she will undergo a substantial dry dock refurbishment before the summer of 2026. Included in this will be the first time the line has retrofitted its suite enclave concept, the Yacht Club, onto an existing ship.\n“The MSC Yacht Club is one of our most highly regarded products, loved by guests for its outstanding level of service, elegant spaces, and exclusive facilities, so we are proud to be bringing this toMSC Magnifica,” said Gianni Onorato, CEO of MSC Cruises. “The extensive remodeling is the largest we’ve undertaken in the last ten years and underlines our commitment to offer our guests the best possible guest experience across our entire fleet.”\nAmong the changes are 63 suites on the ship which will make up the new club as well as a private sun deck, lounge, and restaurant for the suite club. Other changes include an upgraded spa and fitness center and changes to the spaces dedicated to children.\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings also recently announced that two ships for Regent Seven Seas Cruises will undergo extensive renovations.Seven Seas Mariner(48,000 gross tons) introduced in 2001 will go into dry dock in Marseille, France in November 2025.Seven Seas Voyager(42,300 gross tons) completed in 2003, will go into dry dock in late April 2026. The company plans investments to refurbish staterooms and upgrade public areas to prepare the ships to match the new cruise ships it introduced in the past few years and is currently building at Fincantieri in Italy.\nOther cruise lines are planning similar large investments into existing ships to upgrade them to rival newbuilds. At the same time the industry has according to Seatrade's estimates more than $55 billion in new orders for 69 or more new ships due by the early 2030s.\n"

The Norwegian Maritime Authority reports multiple deficiencies were found on the ship and it is being held at the dock in Orkanger until plans are finalized to move the vessel to a repair yard.\nThe inspection confirmed that the Bride Navigation Watch Alarm System was switched off before the vessel grounded. The second officer who has been charged with negligent navigation admitted to falling asleep on watch but contended alarms did not sound.\nThe Norwegian newspaper NRK is quoting a spokesperson from the Norwegian Maritime Authority saying if the alarm had been turned on, the accident might never have happened. They point out that the system is designed to prevent this type of accident. The AIS track shows the vessel failed to change course in the fjord and proceeded straight at a reported speed of 16 knots before it came to rest on the lawn of a shoreside home.\nThe Port State inspection further found that the ship’s ISM system did not meet requirements. The authority did not provide details but said the ship was given three months to correct the problem with the ISM system.\nHowever, the ship must repair the bridge alarm system before it can depart Orkanger. Further, the authority wants written confirmation from Cyprus as the flag state of the vessel before it can move to a repair yard. They confirmed the earlier reports that the hull suffered damage during the grounding.\nIn addition, they also cited the vessel for a problem with its emergency exits. The authority found that the hatch from the engine room is too heavy and difficult to open from the inside. The ship has 14 days to repair the exit hatch.\nThe Norwegian Maritime Authority says it has been monitoring the salvage operation with an inspector aboard the ship. It is now coordinating with the shipping company and the flag state on the next steps in the salvage efforts.\nThe ship is operating under charter to North Sea Container Line on a feeder route along the Norwegian coast that connects to Rotterdam and Hamburg. The company emphasized that the accident seriously while reporting that the ship is owned by Waterway Shipping and operated by Baltnautic Shipmanagement, both incorporated in Lituania.\nTheNCL Saltenwas refloated on Tuesday, May 27, after having grounded on May 22. After being towed to the dock, they were offloading all of the containers from the ship while the surveys continued. The police also reported that they planned to interview the master of the vessel after the salvage operation was completed."

        "content": "On Wednesday, a federal appeals court approved a request from the Trump administration to keep the White House's elevated tariff levels in effect until after litigation plays out at the appellate level. The decision means that the administration's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs will still be charged to importers, at least for now.\nThe temporary stay puts a hold on a ruling announced yesterday by the U.S. Court of International Trade. In that ruling, a three-judge panel found that the administration had no authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariff levels of its choice on an unlimited number of nations. IEEPA contains no mention of tariffs, but the administration had used this statute as the legal basis for its April 2 tariff announcement (and subsequent rate reductions and rate hikes).\nIn its appeal, the administration said that the Court of International Trade's decision to vacate its sweeping high-rate tariffs would interfere with ongoing trade negotiations, removing the president's leverage to extract concessions. The temporary stay allows those negotiations to continue as before, though with added uncertainty: the appellate process is only just beginning, and it is as-yet unknown whether the administration will prevail or the Court of International Trade's decision will be affirmed.\nEven if it loses its appeal, the White House has alternatives. Under a separate statute, the Trade Act of 1974, the president has a clearly-defined emergency power to enact tariffs of up to 15 percent for up to 150 days. For steeper tariff rates or longer timetables, the White House could ask Congress to pass legislation to delegate more tax and tariff authority to the president, or to set a new tariff schedule into law."

        "content": "\nFinnish authorities have nearly completed the nearly six-month criminal investigation into the damage to the subsea power cable believed to have been caused by a shadow fleet tanker while the national energy company reports progress on repairing the cables. The Helsinki Times reported last week that Finnish grid operator Fingrid expects to spend between €50 and €60 million ($57 to $68 million) on repairs to the Estlink2 power cable running between Finland and Estonia.\n“The repair is highly complex,” Fingrid’s Head of Submarine Cable Operations Kimmo Nepola told the Helsinki Times. He said about a kilometer (nearly two-thirds of a mile) of damaged cable must be replaced.\nThe cable was damaged on December 25 and the authorities quickly linked the interruptions to the shadow fleet tankerEagle S(74,000 dwt) registered in the Cook Islands. The police reported that one of the vessel’s anchors was missing and later recovered from the sea floor. It was believed the tanker dragged the anchor for up to 50 miles. The vessel was detained with reports that 32 deficiencies were found during a port state inspection. The vessel was finally released and escorted out of Finnish waters on March 2.\nInitially, eight crewmembers were ordered to remain in Finland. Five were released with the vessel while three continued to be suspects in the incident.\nThe Chief Inspector for the National Bureau of Investigation, Risto Lohi, told the Helsinki Times that three individuals remain as suspects. The report says the investigation is in its final stages. A statement is expected to be delivered to prosecutors shortly.\nFingrid reports a repair vessel has been operational in the Gulf of Finland since mid-May. It says the weather has been favorable for the work but vessel traffic makes it a more complicated operation. They aim to restore power transmission on the cable by mid-July.\nThe incident raised international awareness of the threat to key undersea infrastructure and contributed to new efforts to monitor and protect critical cables. Scandinavian and Baltic countries increased their patrols and later won an agreement from the European Union to contribute to the efforts. Despite that, there have been several additional incidents where the authorities feared undersea cables were being targeted.\nThe crude oil tankerEagle Swas among the vessels added as sanctions have been increased on the shadow fleet. The increase in sanctions and efforts to inspect vessels operating in the Baltic has contributed to increased tensions and recent reports that the Russian Navy has begun escorting shadow fleet tankers in the Baltic."

The companies are discussing the potential sale of a 49.99 percent stake in Eni’s CCS portfolio to the BlackRock company while analysts highlight it as a demonstration of the growing investor interest in the sector.\nThe companies have signed an exclusivity agreement signaling progress toward a confirmatory due diligence phase says Eni. It reports the terms under negotiation call for Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) in addition to acquiring the stake to also support investments in the Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage projects in the Eni portfolio. GIP, which was acquired by BlackRock in 2024, invests in infrastructure and energy including offshore wind projects.\nCCUS is drawing strong interest as an application in the efforts to reach decarbonization and climate goals. Europe has been at the forefront with projects already getting underway in Norway and Denmark and the UK working to develop applications for its key industrial zones.\nEni has already assembled a portfolio including a key role in the UK’s HyNet industrial cluster project in the northwest of England. Eni ismoving forwardwith the Liverpool Bay CCS project, having received key approvals and recently working on the four planned offshore platforms for the project.\nIt is also participating in the UK’s Bacton Thames Net Zero initiative that would store carbon in the depleted Hewett gas field off the North Norfolk coast on the central east coast of England and the North Sea. The project aims to store at least 10 million tonnes of CO2 per year from industrial emitters.\nThe portfolio also includes rights to the Ravenna CCS project in Italy which is billed as the country’s first capture project. Eni also has future rights and through its Eni Next investment arm is working with companies developing new CCS technologies. It is also participating in a European Union initiative involving 44 oil and gas companies to advance carbon storage initiatives.\nZacks Equity Research writes that the potential Eni – GIP partnership could “serve as a model for how legacy energy companies monetize transition-related assets.” It also says it signals “strong investor appetite for such infrastructure as Europe’s regulatory and climate ambitions intensify.”\nEni reports the agreement with GIP follows a thorough selection progress involving several prominent players. It said they found “strong interest,” and that it confirms the great appeal of its CCUS business and growth prospects."

The port of Chattogram remains open but many smaller vessels have been forced to seek shelter with forecasts that the strong conditions will continue for at least another day.\nAs of mid-day on Friday, May 30, the weather service was reporting that nearly eight inches of rain had fallen in the past 24 hours. That was in addition to more than nine inches in the previous 48 hours. At the same time, winds were reported at between approximately 30 and 40 mph with forecasters warning of a two-to-four-foot tidal surge along the coast.\n\n\n\nThere are widespread reports of flooding and tin roofs being blown from houses. Operations at the main airport have also been delayed. The poor conditions prompted officials to raise warnings at both the ocean port and inland areas.\nContainer operations were slowed but proceeding at Chattogram but lightering operations were largely suspended. Smaller vessels used for the transfer of cargo have been forced to seek shelter inland according to the reports stopping much of the cargo operations.\n\n\n\nAt least four vessels have been driven ashore in the storm. Near Anwara on the eastern coast south of Chattogram, two vessels were reported to have been blown from the anchorage. A local official told the news reports that “The vessels lost control due to strong waves at sea and crashed into the shore.”\nOne vessel, theNavimar-3is reported to be a tugboat that was under arrest for the non-payment of fuel bills. In addition, a cargo barge,Mermaid-3, was also driven onto shore.\nTo the north at Chattogram, theAl Herem, a smaller tanker, was driven ashore sitting on the rocky coast. Reports indicate the vessel dragged its anchors.\nAnother vessel, theB-LPG Sophia(6,665 dwt) was an LPG tanker that was heavily damaged in October 2024 during a transfer operation offshore. It was being used to ferry LPG from larger vessels to the onshore terminal. The ship was burnt out and rising at anchor. The 380-foot (116-meter) hulk was also driven from the anchorage landing on the shoreline near Chattogram.\nOfficials are warning the weather conditions are not expected to subside until at least Saturday, May 31."

The resulting combination is set to create one of the largest publicly traded diversified maritime groups.\nThe transaction is valuing Golden Ocean, the largest listed owner of large-size dry bulk vessels, at approximately $1.4 billion. Under the agreed terms, the shareholders will receive .95 shares of CMB.TECH. After the merger, CMB.TECH shareholders will own approximately 70 percent of the shares of the combined company which will continue as CMB.TECH with Golden Ocean becoming an operating subsidiary.\nPresenting the rationale for the combination, management cites the creation of a diversified shipping company that will be more resilient and positioned to lead in the industry’s decarbonization efforts. CMB.TECH currently has more than 160 vessels, including, 30 dry bulk carriers as well as tankers, containerships, offshore wind, and workboats. Golden Ocean has more than 90 dry bulk vessels with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13.7 million dwt. With a fleet of more than 250 vessels and a projected market cap of $3.2 billion, the combined company will rival Frontline as the largest publicly traded shipping company and dwarf other shipping companies.\nThe deal, however, has been called into question by analysts and investors after pressures emerged on the dry bulk sector. Golden Ocean reported a week ago a net loss of $44 million for the first quarter of 2025.\n“Our first quarter results reflect a weaker market environment, with softer charter rates and lower trading activity impacting our performance, in addition to our current intensive drydocking schedule. These headwinds were not unexpected given the seasonal slowdown and increased macroeconomic uncertainty, including the disruption caused by recently announced trade tariffs,” said Peder Simonsen, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Godel Ocean.\nHe however asserted that the fundamentals underpinning of dry bulk shipping remain intact, in particular for the Capesize segment. He points to limited fleet growth, shifting trade patterns, and infrastructure-led demand in key regions as continuing to support a constructive medium-term outlook for the group.\nAlexander Saverys, who will remain CEO of the combined company, has in the past spoken of a strategy of using conventional shipping to drive the company's efforts to become a leader in ammonia and hydrogen as maritime fuels. CMB.TECH has established ammonia and hydrogen fuel offerings and some of the first ships to operate on the emerging alternative fuels.\nThe merger remains subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval and a vote by Golden Ocean shareholders. The companies report they expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2025."

The UK is proceeding with charges of manslaughter for the death of a Filipino seafarer working aboard the vessel at the time of the allision.\nVladimir Motin, age 59, a Russian citizen from St. Petersburg, made a brief appearance via video from Hull where he remains detained. During the hearing conducted by London's Central Criminal Court (the “Old Bailey”), Motin was asked to confirm his identity. He then entered a plea of not guilty.\nDuring the brief appearance, the captain was assisted by a Russian interpreter. During a previous hearing, the court had to adjourn until an interpreter could be found to assist Motin.\nAfter the brief hearing, Motin was ordered to remain in jail with the next hearing scheduled for September 10. A tentative trial date has been set for January 12, 2026.\nUK prosecutors so far are only perusing the charge ofmanslaughterin the case although the maritime investigation into theallisionand subsequent fire that heavily damaged both vessels is continuing. All the seafarers were rescued from theStena Immaculatein an operation that included privately contracted crew transfer vessels working in the offshore wind sector as well as HM Coastguard and boats from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).\nOne crewmember from theSolong, 38-year-old Mark Angelo Pernia of the Philippines, was reported missing. An unsuccessful search was launched. It was later reported that he likely had been working at the bow of the containership when it struck theStena Immaculateand the fireball erupted from the jet fuel loaded on the tanker.\nThe UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branchreleased initial resultsat the beginning of April from its ongoing investigation into the “very serious marine casualty” that occurred on March 10. Critical details were confirmed including that Motin had been the sole person on the bridge of the containership when it hit the anchored tanker. He had resumed watch at 0700 after at most seven hours off the bridge after the vessel’s departure from Scotland.\nThe ship was sailing at about 15 knots and likely encountering patchy fog. Under the regulations, MAIB highlighted, the containership was required to have a lookout during darkness or when it was encountering limited visibility such as fog.\nMAIB emphasizes with the release of its initial information that the findings were preliminary and that the investigation into the accident was ongoing. It stated among the factors it would be exploring are “the navigation and watchkeeping practices on board both vessels, manning, and fatigue management.”\nThis incident again raised awareness of these issues and this week, researchers released a report highlighting thatfatigue and anxietyare increasing for seafarers. The same issues of manning and fatigue are also being investigated in the grounding of another smaller containership in Norway. The second officer who was along on the bridge navigating the vessel confirmed that he hadfallen asleeptoward the end of his watch and shortly before the vessel grounded.\nIn the past few years, there have been several incidents in the North Sea and Baltic highlighting similar issues. Vessels were reported to be operating with a single officer on the bridge who became distracted before collisions or other incidents."

        "content": "\nIn a surprise announcement that leaked out on Friday, May 30, Newport News Shipbuilding is furloughing about two percent of its workforce – 471 salaried employees – effective immediately. The shipyard which recently highlighted for the first time it would be simultaneously working on building two massive Ford-class aircraft carriers is citing the need for increased accountability and efficiency.\nNews of the furloughs is being widely reported by the media in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia which points out that Newport News is Virginia’s largest industrial employer. The reports said the company employs approximately 26,000 people and was conducting hiring efforts. Virginia Business reports the company added about 3,000 people in 2024 and had said it expected a similar increase this year.\nThe company confirmed the action in a statement sent to the Virginia media. “After careful review of our salaried workforce and business needs, we have furloughed 471 salaried shipbuilders across HII‘s Newport News Shipbuilding division,” the statement said. “This decision was not made lightly given its impact on affected team members. We take this step, however, to increase accountability and efficiency, and to improve overall performance in meeting our current and future commitments to the U.S. Navy.”\nThe shipbuilder is emphasizing changes in the industry and during the first quarter report, its parent company HII announced that Newport News’ revenues had decreased by 2.6 percent ($38 million) in the quarter. It cited lower volumes in aircraft carriers and naval nuclear support services, partially offset by higher volumes in the Columbia-class submarine program.\nThe company had recently reported securing new government contracts but the Trump administration while promising increases in military spending has been putting pressure on efficiency and cost-cutting. The Department of Defense has promised to increase efficiency while the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has a stated objective to modernize information technology, maximize productivity and efficiency, and cut wasteful spending.\nNewport News in December christened the thirteenth Virginia-class submarine it has built for the U.S. Navy. That followed repositioning the under-construction carrier Enterprise in the dry dock to create a position to start work in 2025 on the next carrier, the Doris Miller. It also announced the acquisition of a South Carolina-based complex metal fabricator specializing in the manufacture of shipbuilding structures, modules, and assemblies to expand Newport News’ capacity.\nThe furloughs will impact engineers and other salaried positions at the shipbuilder and are currently expected to last up to five months. The company spokesperson is emphasizing that it is a temporary non-work, non-pay status, not terminating or reassigning any employees. However, they cannot work for contractors during this period. They were informed of the action the media reports said in an email on Friday and told it was effective as of Monday.\nThe spokesperson told the Virginia media that the company would continue to evaluate its staffing needs."

It follows the delivery of her sister ship,Mein Ship Relax, in February, and a recent order from another TUI Group company Marella Cruises for two new ships.\nThe relationship with TUI Group was established in 2018 with the order of the two cruise ships known as the InTUItion class for Mein Schiff, which is a partnership between TUI and Royal Caribbean Group focused on the German-speaking market. Fincantieri highlights the ships each of which is approximately 157,650 gross tons, as a first-in-class project developed by the shipyard enhancing the modernity and sustainability characteristics that TUI Cruises promotes in its operations.\nThe new ships are 1,070 feet (326 meters) in length with 1,945 passenger cabins and accommodations for 3,984 passengers and 1,535 crew. In addition to being the largest ships of the fleet, they have innovations for relaxation, 14 restaurants including more variety and a new Asian restaurant, and redefined spa and wellness areas. The ships feature the cruise line’s first two-deck “freedom suites,” as well as introducing inside, outside, and balcony cabins for solo travelers.\nThey are designed for operations either on LNG or Marine Gas Oil (MGO), making them the first LNG-fueled ships in the Mein Schiff fleet. TUI has highlighted that they are a future-proof design with the ability to utilize low-emission fuels such as bio- or e-LNG when the alternatives become available in sufficient quantity for commercial operations. TUI last year also introduced a cruise ship built by Meyer Turku that is ready for future operations on methanol fuel.\nThe two cruise ships from Fincantieri feature catalytic converters meeting Euro 6 standards, a steam turbine, using the residual heat from the diesel generators, as well as an electrical shore-power connection. They are also being equipped with an innovative and highly efficient waste treatment system capable of transforming organic materials into recyclable components through a thermal process.\nAfter a christening ceremony and blessing in Monfalcone, Italy, the floodgates were opened on the dry dock to floatMein Schiff Flowfor the first time on May 30. They are reporting it required around 130 million liters of water to enter the dock for the successful flotation.Mein Schiff Flowwill be moved to the outfitting berth and is due to enter service in the summer of 2026.\n\n\nNaming ceremony for the first cruise ship Mein Schiff Relax (TUI Cruises)\n\nHer sister shipMein Schiff Relaxwas celebrated with a spectacular naming ceremony early in April in the port of Malaga, Spain. More than 12,000 people attended the event which included two other ships from the fleet,Mein Schiff 5andMein Schiff 7, also docked in the port. The event concluded with a 120-meter (nearly 400-foot) rocket line launched from the bow of one of the ships.\nMein Schiff Relaxis the eighth ship for the brand, all new builds, and will be joined by the ninth ship whenMein Schiff Flowstarts operations. The brand has grown rapidly having operated its first cruises in 2009.\nFincantieri received the order for two cruise ships, the first new builds for Marella Cruises (a brand owned by TUI Group) at the end of March. Carnival Corporation also placed an order in April for Mein Schiff competitor AIDA Cruises, the first for Fincantieri, while the yard also has confirmed orders for its first cruise ships over 200,000 gross tons to be delivered to both Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line. It will build seven ships under those contracts with deliveries scheduled into the 2030s."

        "content": "\nAfter campaigning on a promise to accelerate the U.S. energy industry, the Trump administration issued its first final LNG export approval which went to Sempra Infrastructure’s proposed Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project. The permit granted by the Department of Energy would make it possible for the second phase project to export LNG to countries that do not have a free-trade agreement with the United States.\nThe Trump administration has been fiercely critical of its predecessor’s pause on LNG export permits, terming the move “reckless.” Following the finalization of the 2024 LNG Export Study, which the administration is praising for confirming that LNG exports support the U.S. economy, strengthen allies, and enhance national security, the Department of Energy (DOE) has moved to support the expansion of the industry.\nThe Port Arthur LNG facility is promoted as having the potential to become one of the largest LNG export facilities in North America. Phase II of the export facility has been in the works since September 2023 when the Biden administration issued authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The project is expected to include two liquefaction trains capable of producing approximately 13 Mtpa of LNG, which would double the total liquefaction capacity of the Port Arthur LNG facility up to 26 Mtpa.\nPhase 1 of the Port Arthur LNG project is currently under construction and consists of trains 1 and 2, as well as two LNG storage tanks and associated facilities. Sempra reports construction of the project continues to progress, and they expect commercial operation for train 1 in 2027 and train 2 in 2028.\nDOE is hailing the issuing of the permit for Phase 2 as another critical step in expanding the U.S.’s LNG industry. Sempra however highlights that the project remains subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These include completing the required commercial agreements, securing and/or maintaining all necessary permits, obtaining financing, and reaching the final investment decision.\nSempra also operates the Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana, which has been exporting LNG since 2019, and is currently constructing the Energia Costa Azul terminal in Mexico, which will begin commercial export operations of U.S.-sourced gas as LNG beginning in 2026.\nIn authorizing the exports, DOE has relied heavily on the LNG Export Study that was released by the Office of Fossil Energy & Carbon Management in December last year and had a public comment period through March 20 this year. Part of the findings in the study is that the U.S. has a robust natural gas supply that is sufficient to meet growing levels of exports while minimizing impacts on domestic prices, growing LNG exports increase gross domestic product and expand jobs while also improving trade balance. It also asserts that increasing LNG exports enhances domestic and international global security with no discernable impact on global greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhile Port Arthur Phase 2 marks the first final approval, the administration had previously issued four LNG export authorizations. This includes one to Commonwealth LNG's proposed export facility in Louisiana, and another to Venture Global's CP2 project also in Louisiana. Energy Secretary Chris Wright says the administration has approved a total volume of exports of 11.45 Bcf/d.\nThe U.S. has been the largest exporter of LNG ahead of Qatar and Australia. Qatar however is preparing to open its North Field Expansion project starting in 2026. By 2030 it expects to double production to 142 mtpa."

She was moved to the Dutch port in December 2020 after having been laid up in the UK at the onset of the pandemic.\nPreviously, it was reported that she had been offered for sale and various rumors circled of efforts to save the ship which is one of the last ocean liners and the oldest ocean-going cruise ship. She was placed on the auction block in 2021 with a minimum bid of €10 million but failed to receive sufficient bids. In 2023, it was rumored that the ship had been sold for scrap, but the owners denied it saying they were still working on plans for her future.\nThe ship was ordered at the close of World War II as one of the first modern passenger liners. Limited by post-war shortages of materials and the capabilities of Scandinavian shipyards, Swedish American Line which had operated well-known luxury liners before the war, was limited to a 525-foot liner that at 11,700 gross tons would be a workhorse carrying cargo and mostly tourist class passengers. She was designed for year-round Atlantic service and sailing to Scandinavia she was given an ice-reinforced hull and bow which would forever seal her legacy.\n\n\n1950s vintage post card view of the Stockholm\n\nShe entered service in February 1948 asStockholmand was rebuilt in 1952 expanding her accommodations, but she had a mostly unremarkable career. Swedish American added a new modern liner in 1953 meaning Stockholm could also occasionally sail cruises.\nHer legacy came however on the fateful night of July 25, 1956. Outbound from New York to Scandinavia, she was near the Nantucket Lightship when the Italian linerAndrea Doriaemerged out of a fog bank making a turn across the course of theStockholm. While the ships had radar available the technology was in its early stages of development, far less advanced than current systems. The ice-strengthened bow of theStockholmtore through theAndrea Doria'sstarboard side causing a fatal wound. A massive sea rescue effort saved most of the passengers aboard the Italian ship, which sank the following morning, while the badly damagedStockholmlimped back to New York for repairs. A total of 51 passengers and crew on the two liners were killed in the tragedy.\n\n\nStockholm returned to New York badly damaged after her collision with the Italian liner Andrea Doria (USCG photo)\n\nSwedish American rebuilt the ship but retired her four years later selling her to an East German group that used her as theVolkerfreundschaftfor cruises for trade unionists and Community Party members. Retired by the Germans in 1985, she ended up in Italy where in a project reportedly heavily subsidized by the government she was rebuilt into a modern cruise ship. She was stripped to the steel and given a new diesel power plant as well as sponsons along the hull.\nMostly unrecognizable, she returned to service in 1994 and operates cruises for various companies under multiple names includingItalia Prima,Valtur Prima,Caribe, andAthena. She was renamedAzoresin 2013 by her latest owner/operator, and three years later was chartered to the UK’s Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV) who changed her name toAstoria. She continued to cruise building a loyal following because of her quirky history but CMV planned to retire her by 2020. The pandemic however brought her career to a premature close.\nUnlike the vessels that were owned by CMV,Astoriawas operating on charter so she reverted to her owners, which by that point was a Portuguese bank that had financed her last owners. An investment group acquired theAstoriabut later abandoned plans to rebuild her due to advanced age. Since 2021, she has been listed for sale.\nDue to her age, and reports that her interiors are in poor condition after years of being laid up, it is unlikely that she would be reactivated. She is to be sold to the highest bidder with the speculation that would be a cash buyer or a scrapyard.\n\n\nNear the end of her career, although heavily rebuilt, the sheer of the liner hull is still visible (Pjotr Mahhonin photo-CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nTop photo byNiels Johannes-CC BY-SA 4.0"

        "content": "The abandonment of vessels and their crews is running significantly ahead of the rate in 2024 and is on track to a new record warns the International Transport Workers’ Federation. The association of transport unions is reiterating its long-standing call for more action and a crackdown both on shipowners and the registries that fail to respect seafarers.\n“Abandonment is a growing, systemic problem,” said Stephen Cotton, ITF General Secretary. “Behind every number is a human being who has been failed by the industry and the governments responsible for regulating it. The fact that we're on track to break last year’s appalling record is a sign that urgent reform is needed.”\nThe ITF calculates that vessel abandonment is up 33 percent year-over-year in 2025. It says as of May this year it had recorded 158 cases of vessel abandonment, up from 119 at the same point in 2024. These cases represent more than 1,501 seafarers who have reached out to the ITF for assistance, many of whom were left unpaid, without food, water, or access to ports, often for months at a time.\nThey highlight in 2024 its inspectors and teams were able to recover $13.5 million for abandoned seafarers. Last year, it said there was arecord 3,100 seafarers abandoned. In total, the ITF reports in 2024 it recovered more than $58.1 million in unpaid wages due to seafarers. Already in 2025, they report ITF inspectors have helped to recover $4.1 million for seafarers affected by abandonment.\n“We’re dealing with owners who walk away from their obligations, often while sub-standard registers look on and do nothing,” said Steve Trowsdale, Head of the ITF Inspectorate. “In many cases, it's impossible to identify the owner, and flag states are either unwilling or unable to act. This is what makes the rise in cases so dangerous – impunity is growing across the board.”\nAs the number of cases climb, the ITF says it is increasingly concerned by the limits on enforcement. It calculates that half of the world’s fleet operates under a “flag of convenience,” and notes that more than 80 percent of abandoned vessels are also operating under a flag of convenience. The ITF highlights that it has a list of 45 countries that provide a flag of convenience. It added Tuvalu and Guinea-Bissau to its list of problematic registries that lack enforcement along with the 2024 addition of Gabon and Eswatini. In 2023, it added San Marino to the target list.\nThe group is calling for reforms to the registry system to ensure that every vessel can provide transparent, traceable links to its beneficial owner. The ITF says registries must be “armed – and willing – to detain and penalize those who walk away from their crews.”\nThe leading members of the International Maritime Organization have alsoraised concernsabout the proliferation of suspect flags that do not properly enforce regulations. In addition, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission just over a week ago announced that it wasstarting an investigationinto these registries. It, too, cited the lack of regulations and enforcement saying it had the potential to create unfavorable conditions in the foreign trade of the United States.\nWhile the Maritime Labor Convention stipulates basic standards for wages and transportation for seafarers to and from their ships and homes, enforcement remains a problem. Flag states have a legal responsibility when vessel owners and operators abandon their crews or fail to pay their wages and provide basic welfare conditions. States such as Australia highlight their efforts during port state inspections, but frequently it falls to the unions and charities to aid abandoned seafarers."

While it is a regular operation for the navy, awareness has increased since the recent incidents in the Baltic with undersea infrastructure and the continuing concern over the shadow fleet of tankers.\nOne of the recent deployments involved monitoring the Russian “intelligence gathering ship”Yuri Ivanovwhich the Royal Navy reports was loitering in the waters off the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. In addition, a Russian corvette was also monitored as it was escorting merchant ships through the English Channel.\n“Monitoring activity on the seas and seabed around the UK is one of the core roles of the Royal Navy’s 2nd Mine-Countermeasures Squadron,” said Lieutenant Commander James Bradshaw, Commanding Officer of Hunt-class minehunter HMSHurworth, which was deployed as part of the monitoring in the English Channel. “This operation was all in a day’s work for the ship’s company who have shown great professionalism.”\nThe Russian spy ship was tracked from the Outer Hebrides where it was spotted following the completion of NATO’s exercise Formidable Shield which took place in the region. NATO had reported that it would be the largest live-fire naval exercise in Europe. It had begun in Norway earlier in the month and later moved to the waters off Scotland. It involved NATO, UK, Norwegian, and U.S. forces with both air and sea assets deployed from a total of nine nations.\nTheYuri Ivanovis one of two 95-meter (312-foot) surveillance vessels Russia placed in operation in 2015. The U.S. has reported in the past that the vessel is equipped with antennae and electronics intended to provide intelligence-gathering, surveillance, electronic warfare, command and control, communications, fleet management, and signals intelligence capabilities tacking naval assets and can also perform air defense missile systems detection and tracking.\nThe Portsmouth-based Type 45 destroyer HMSDragonwas deployed to monitor the vessel and track its movements. It also deployed its Merlin helicopter to collect information about the vessel’s activities. They continued to track the vessel until it headed north toward its home base in the Arctic.\n\n\nRussian corvette being tracked by the Royal Navy during a transit through the English Channel (Royal Navy)\n\nLate on May 18, HMSLedburywas also dispatched to monitor the Russian Steregushchiy-class corvette RFNStoikiy. The UK shadowed the Russian warship which was sailing west through the English Channel. It later met up with two merchant vessels,Sparta IVandGeneral Skobelev, which were returning from the Mediterranean the Royal Navy reports.\nHMSHurworthtook over the monitoring on May 19 off Brighton and watched theStoikiyand the two merchant ships. The operation concluded on the afternoon of May 22 when the vessels entered the North Sea.\nThe Royal Navy also reports that during the English Channel transit, it deployed aircraft from the Naval Air Squadron at Culdrose. Aircraft and warships from NATO allies were also involved."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nResearchers based in California studied the electronic reservation system established for containerships and have now concluded that the digital port queuing system is low-hanging fruit that can help drastically cut shipping emissions. They are the latest to endorse versions of slow steaming for vessels while warning that ports and liners are clinging to the archaic “first-come, first-served” approach.\nThe starting point for theirresearchfocused on the fact that the commercial shipping industry contributes nearly three percent of global greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions and approximately two percent of global carbon dioxide (CO2), making it a major accelerator of climate change. The researchers said that while shipping is coming under intense pressure to decarbonize, the industry has failed to utilize a system that is the easiest to implement and which can cut GHG emissions by 16 to 24 percent.\nWorldwide, ports continue to rely on the century-old “first-come, first-served” system for ship berthing. Typically, vessels continue to race across the ocean and then line up and idle at ports as they wait to be unloaded. The researchers write that “first-come, first-served” incentivized a practice known as “sail fast, then wait” where vessels rush to reach their destination port to secure a place in the berthing queue. As port congestion around the world has grown, vessels can wait at anchorage or loiter near ports at low speed for hours, days, or even weeks.\nIn normal times at busy ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach, it was typical to have as many as four vessels backlogged and waiting for a berth. At the heart of the pandemic, the backlog for the Southern California portsballoonedto over 100 vessels and even today major ports around the world still have large backlogs.\nThe ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach implemented aqueuing systemin 2022 that assigned predetermined positions when vessels departed their last port of call. Essentially, the system means that containerships get a spot in line based on when they left the last port of call. With their place in line secure, vessels delivering cargo to the ports do not have to rush during their trans-Pacific voyage, giving them the luxury to reduce speed which in effect meant burning less fuel and creating fewer emissions.\nThe researchers at the University of California believed the system is low-hanging fruit that can have the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions. The team was able to substantiate this conclusion and make a new case for slow steams after applying a bottom-up emissions model using vessel technical specifications and automatic identification system data from 10,000 voyages by 1,157 containerships across 6.5 years (2017–2023). The voyages represented more than 47 million miles of traffic crossing the Pacific.\nBy comparing emissions before and after the new queuing system was implemented at Los Angeles and Long Beach, the team observed 16 to 24 percent reductions in emissions per voyage post-implementation. The researchers published their findings in the journalMarine Pollution Bulletin.\n“Integrating digital queueing represents a straightforward win within the broader technology and digital transformation initiatives that ports and logistics companies are already pursuing, offering an easy-to-implement solution that could scale globally as ports modernize and streamline their operations to reduce emissions,” said Douglas McCauley, a marine ecologist UC Santa Barbara.\nHe added that if other ports deploy the system, this could offer a relatively simple pathway for the maritime industry to contribute to emissions reduction efforts. Notably, the system does not require massive investments or time to deploy. At Los Angeles and Long Beach, the world’s ninth busiest port complex, the system was up and running in just one month.\nThe researchers highlight that additional fine-tuning of the queueing system may yield even bigger climate wins. A case in point is tweaking the system slightly so ships traveled at an average speed of 17 knots instead of 18 knots across the Pacific, something that has the capacity to shave off another approximately 308,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, translating to an additional nine percent reduction."

        "content": "\nHaving made its way south through the Suez Canal on May 25, ships of the Royal Navy-ledPrince of Walescarrier strike group (CSG) have been spotted twice in satellite imagery, proceeding south at relatively slow speed down the Red Sea. The transit through the Canal was covered by two UK P-8 Poseidon MRA1 aircraft operating out of RAF Akrotiri.\n\n\nProgress of HMS Prince of Wales (R09) down the Red Sea (Google Earth/CJRC)\n\nOn May 28, the flagship HMSPrince of Wales(R09) was seen in the sea area between Yanbu and Jeddah (at 22.788744N 37.672278E), alongside HNoMSMaud(A530), from whom she was taking on supplies. Heading northwards during the replenishment operation, the two ships were being trailed by a frigate, probably HMSRichmond(F239). Indicative of flight operations being carried out, RAF KC-2 Voyager refuellers were active over the Red Sea during the preceding days.\n\n\nHMS Prince of Wales conducting a replenishment at sea on May 28 with HNoMS Maud, trailed by HMS Richmond (Sentinel-2/CJRC)\n\nFurther imagery on May 30 showed the CSG in battle formation, now between Jeddah and Jizan, and with HMSPrince of Walesat 19.711N 38.697E. In the imagery, cued by @Schizointel and @MT_Anderson, it was possible to identify HMSDauntless (D33), HMSRichmond(F239), Canadian HMCSVille de Quebec(F332), Spanish ESPSMendez Nunez(F104) and the Norwegian Nansen Class frigate HNoMSRoald Amundsen(F311). On the flank of the CSG was an unidentified Arleigh Burke destroyer, and @MT-Andersen has also spotted a second Arleigh Burke destroyer in the Red Sea area keeping company. Absent was the Norwegian logistics vessel HNoMSMaud(A530), without which the CSG would be unlikely to make a dash through the Bab el Mandeb, unless hereafter it relies solely on RFA Tidespring (A136) for support instead. The CSG is already in range of Houthi drone and missile systems, and is well south of the stand-back area from which US Navy CSGs have recently conducted operations against the Houthis.\nIf all proceeds to plan, the CSG is likely to be through the area of greatest risk well before knowledge of this becomes public. That a move into the Gulf of Aden is imminent is probable, given that the Houthi ceasefire regarding ships in the Red Sea is still holding, negating any immediate requirement to deploy the CSG’s firepower. But this is also likely because two RAF KC-2 refueling aircraft, and probably also P-8 Poseidon MRA1 aircraft, have now been forward deployed to Oman, from where operations in the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea can be better supported than from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.\nThe Royal Navy announced in April that HMSPrince of Waleswas departing leading an international Carrier Strike Group for an eight-month mission to the Indo-Pacific. Defence Secretary John Healey reported it would be the UK's biggest naval deployment of 2025."

        "content": "Swedish authorities are trying to understand why a second bulker grounded in the Øresund area in less than a week. The incident on Saturday, May 31, was just 40 miles to the north of where a bulker went aground on Sunday, May 25, but so far there are few similarities between the two incidents.\nA bulker flagged in Panama,Meshka(35,829 dwt) was southbound in the shipping channel coming from Tarragona, Spain to the small Russian port of Vysotsk near the border with Finland. According to Swedish media reports, the Swedish Maritime Administration’s traffic center (VTS) spotted that the ship was outside the shipping lane and warned the ship around 1000 on Saturday morning. The crew either ignored the warning or did not have time to respond and change course.\nThe vessel which was traveling only with fuel and ballast however had a draft of seven meters. It ran aground in an area with only three meters of depth.\nThe rescue authority dispatched two vessels to investigate and the Swedish Maritime Administration and Coast Guard both responded. It was determined that none of the 24 crew aboard had been injured and there was no immediately apparent damage or oil leaks from the ship. The Coast Guard was assigned authority while the others were standing by in case they needed to become involved.\nThe Coast Guard reports it conducted sobriety checks and found no suspicions of drunkenness among the crew. They were still interviewing the crew to understand what caused the grounding. It reported on Sunday that it has initiated a preliminary investigation regarding a lack of good seamanship in connection with the grounding. The investigation has now been handed over to the Swedish Prosecution Authority.\nThe vessel is near Landhrona, Sweden which is north of Malmö where the other bulkergrounded last week. Divers were sent down on Saturday evening, and they reported no visual damage but said most of the hull which measures 180 meters (590 feet) is on the sandy bottom. The Coast Guard reports the vessel has approximately 938,000 liters of oil and lubricants in its tanks.\nThe authorities are remaining on the scene but said as long as the vessel remains stable, the responsibilities rest with the shipowner, a company based in Dubai. They will need to develop a salvage plan and submit it for approval.\nOne similarity between the two vessels that grounded is that both have a history of deficiencies reported during port state inspections. The Meshka had 23 deficiencies during a September 2024 inspection at the British port of Immingham. UK authorities detained the ship for 18 days after identifying structural issues, fire safety problems, and crew training issues. The ship however had a clean inspection in May in Spain.\nThe other bulker,Ali Aykinremains aground on a shoal near the Øresund Bridge. Swedish authorities confirmed during the week thathull damagehad been identified and that the ship had taken on water. A salvage plan is being prepared and reviewed for the ship."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Department of Defense confirmed on Friday, May 30, that the dismantling contract for ex-USSEnterprisehas been awarded. It marks the official end to the process that began several years ago after the first U.S. Navy nuclear aircraft carrier was decommissioned in 2017 and the debate began on her final fate.\nIncluded in the listing of contracts finalized by the Department of Defense is the awarding of $536 million in a fixed-price contract to NorthStar Maritime Dismantlement Services for the dismantling, recycling, and disposal of ex-Enterprise. It is a Mobile, Alabama-based partnership between NorthStar Group Services and Modern American Recycling and Radiological Services announced in November 2024 as one of the bidders for the contract. The other competitors were in Newport News, Virginia, and Brownsville, Texas with it noted that only Brownsville had a ship-recycling specialist experienced in disposing of U.S. Navy’s conventional aircraft carriers. The decommissioned aircraft carrier USSJohn F. Kennedyarrived in Brownsville on February 2, 2025, for dismantling after being towed from Philadelphia.\n\n\nEnterprise was present at some of the most important moments in modern U.S. Navy history (USN)\n\nDoD reports thatEnterprise“will be dismantled in its entirety, and all resulting materials will be properly recycled or disposed of. Specifically, hazardous materials, including low-level radioactive waste, will be packaged and safely transported for disposal at authorized licensed sites.”\nThe process of disposing of the carrier began in 2022 with the Navy releasing a report thatexplored the optionsincluding continuing to hold the vessel in lay-up or dismantling. The following year, the Navy confirmed that it preferred to dismantle the carrier using a commercial facility so as not to lose precious space and capacity in its own shipyards.\nEnterprise's nuclear reactors have been defueled, but there are still \"legacy radiological and hazardous wastes\" on board the Navy concluded in its analysis. During the dismantling process, the hazardous components will be separated and properly contained for shipment to a storage site. North Star will be responsible for dismantling the other sections of the ship. DoD reports the work will be performed in Mobile, Alabama, and is expected to be completed by November 2029.\nIt will be an economic boost for Mobile. The city is already reporting a mini-surge in tourism after the liner ssUnited Statesarrived at the MARS facility. The liner is being prepared in Mobile for a planned reefing. The Mobile Chamber of Commerce last year said it opposed dismantling the carrier in the area fearing the potential of a mishap or contamination.\n\n\nUSS Enterprise with nuclear-powered escorts USS Long Beach and Bainbridge, the world's first all-nuclear task force (June 1964, USN)\n\nKnown by her nickname “Big E,” the carrier was a symbol of the United States' naval power. She remains the longest naval vessel ever constructed, though she is outranked by the Nimitz and Ford-class carriers when measured by displacement. She has a length of 1,123 feet (342 meters) at the flight deck and has a displacement of approximately 94,000 tons.Enterprisehad an acknowledged top speed of over 30 knots, although it was rumored she could operate at much faster speeds.\nBig E was present at some of the most important moments in modern U.S. Navy history, including the blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis; aerial combat and bombardment missions during the Vietnam War; the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy during the fall of Saigon; the bombing of Al Qaeda and Taliban installations after 9/11; and duty in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. She also participated in the early space program tracking John Glenn’s orbit of the Earth in the Friendship 7 capsule.\nShe was commissioned in 1961 and was to have been part of a class of nuclear carriers. Instead, the Navy learned from her and went on to build the Nimitz class, which remains the hallmark of the nuclear navy.Enterpriseserved with distinction through the 1960s before a fire in 1969 and an overhaul in the early 1970s. She received life extension refits in the 1990s and in 2008 which lasted till 2010. She began her final deployment in March 2012 and was officially listed as deactivated in December 2012.\n\n\nDeactivated in 2012, Enterprise is seen here in her 2013 move into lay-up in Newport News, Virginia (USN)\n\nSettling the disposal of the ship took on greater importance as the Navy now looks to the deactivation of the first Nimitz class carriers in the coming years.Enterpriseis to provide a model for the Navy as it moves forward into the Ford class. The legacy of Big E will be celebrated as about 14 tons of steel salvaged from CVN-65 will be incorporated into CNV-80, the third Ford-class carrier which fittingly will be the next USSEnterprise."

It surpasses the 1,305 migrants who made it across the Channel on September 3, 2022.\nSo far this year, approximately 14,600 migrants have made it across the Channel, the highest figure recorded for the first five-month period, and putting 2025 on course to have the highest number of illegal entrants since the Norman Invasion of 1066. This presents a particular problem for Britain’s Labour Government, as reducing illegal migration across the Channel was a key election manifesto promise. Delivery was supposed to demonstrate an administrative efficiency which Labour officials asserted was lacking in the previous Conservative administration.\nThe influx on May 31 overwhelmed the UK’s maritime services. With Border Force vessels fully occupied transporting illegal migrants rescued from the Channel to safety in Dover, fishing boats were called upon by the Coastguard to rescue a number of other boats at sea that had got into difficulties. The RNLI lifeboat from Dover was also spotted by onlookers bringing people to shore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organizers of the smuggling trade tend to intensify their operations during calm weather when they are able to grossly overload the disposable rubber boats used to make the crossing.\nNotwithstanding the dangers involved in cramming so many aboard, the French police do not prevent departures of the boats from French beaches, and the smuggling organizers know that once the boats reach the median line in the Channel, their occupants will be rescued by the British Border Force and carried to safety.\nEven in calm weather, the Channel crossing is extremely hazardous, as the Channel is one of the world’s busiest sea lanes. The area where the migrants are attempting the crossing is approximately 30 miles between the French and British coasts. If the weather deteriorates during the crossing, the overloaded rubber boats are easily swamped in a rising swell. Beside the risk of drowning, acute for the infirm and young children on board, there is also a risk of hypothermia even in the mildest of English weather.\nBritish government attempts to curtail the traffic have focused on identifying and prosecuting the organizers of the smuggling traffic. Given however the laws of supply and demand, the lucrative nature of the trade means that arrested smugglers are soon replaced. Nor is there a shortage of customers, as the cost of an illegal passage across the Channel is considerably cheaper than securing legal entry, and can also be quicker.\nIllegal entry is also attractive because once arrivals set foot on dry land and claim asylum, they become eligible for food, hotel accommodation, and national health services while their asylum applications are processed, which can take many years."

It joins others including Estonia, Finland, and the European Union which also introduced new monitoring efforts including checking insurance documentation for vessels sailing through the Baltic.\n“We see more and more problematic events in the Baltic Sea and it requires that we not only hope for the best, but also plan for the worst,” said Ulf Kristersson, Prime Minister of Sweden, in a posting on social media. “Now we have made an important decision to protect the Baltic Sea from the Russian shadow fleet… Security can't wait.”\nAccording to the government, the new regulation that it adopted aims to combat the shadow fleet and thereby improve maritime safety and environmental protection. The Swedish Coast Guard and the Maritime Administration are being tasked with collecting insurance information from ships that pass through Swedish territorial waters or the economic zone regardless if they are scheduled to make a port call in Sweden.\n“We are now increasing surveillance in the Baltic Sea,” said Minister of Justice Gunnar Strömmer. He pointed to the shadow fleet circumventing international rules and threatening safety.\nSweden’s action follows the European Commission which in April adopted arequirementthat all vessels, including those merely passing through EU waters without entering an EU port, provide insurance information.\nEfforts to check documentation and insurance information have led to increased tensions in the Baltic. Estonia’s effort at stopping a tanker it suspected of operating without a legitimate registry led to abrief showdownthat included a Russian warplane making an unauthorized entry into Estonian airspace. Similarly, Finland has recently reported that a Russian warplane entered its airspace while Finland’s Defense Minister said the country would continue its efforts to monitor the movement of shadow fleet tankers in the Gulf of Finland.\nThe EU in particular has continued to apply pressure on the shadow fleet. It has now sanctioned over 300 tankers while there has been talk of further actions aimed at Russia’s oil trade.\nRussia’s Permanent Representative at the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia referred to the actions as “Baltic pirates” and their EU “cheerleaders,” during a speech to the UN Security Council. He said the “inappropriate behavior of EU countries sets a very dangerous precedent.”\nThe Russian Navy has reportedly begun escorting some shadow fleet tankers on their passage away from the oil terminals and into the Baltic."

This comes as the cable operator reported that it will be able to restore commercial service at the end of the month.\nA subsea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia went dark on Christmas Day 2024 along with damage to other communications cables. The authorities suspected a shadow fleet product tankerEagle Sthat was operating in the Russian oil trade. The Cook Islands-flagged vessel was missing one of its anchors which was later retrieved from the seabed along with the reports that teams found indications that the anchor was dragged along the seabed for over 100 kilometers, severing the power link and four undersea telecommunications cables.\nFingrid and Elering announced last week that repair work on EstLink 2 is progressing faster than planned and that the electricity interconnector will return to commercial use on June 25, about three weeks ahead of the originally anticipated mid-July date. The section of the cable that was damaged has successfully been cut out, with about a one-kilometer-long spare cable being used to connect the undamaged sections. The works are being aided by favorable sea conditions.\n“Both the preparatory and repair works have progressed well, and there have been no setbacks. The construction of the first repair joint will be completed today (May 30), and construction of the second will begin next week,” said Reigo Haug, head of Estlink operations.\nAt the same time, Yle Svenska, the Swedish-language service of Finland’s national broadcaster, reported that it had learned thecriminal investigationinto the incident has also been completed. Police were working on the theory that the action was “gross sabotage and gross disruption” of the power and telecommunications cables. The Helsinki Times highlights that under Finnish law, aggravated sabotage can carry significant prison sentences, especially when it involves deliberate damage to national infrastructure. Disruption of telecommunications traffic, if deemed aggravated, is also treated as a serious criminal offense.\nProsecutors confirmed to Yle that they have received thousands of pages of information. They said it would take two to three months to review the details of the investigation and make a determination. The attorney general will ultimately decide if they proceed with an indictment and trial.\nThe news outlets report that the captain and the first and second officers of the Eagle S remain under suspicion. The police previously only confirmed that three crewmembers had been ordered to remain in Finland. Originally, nine crewmembers were detained but the others were released in March along the with the vessel.\nProsecutors will have to determine if there is evidence that it was an international act to damage the cables. Others have contended that it was simply poor seamanship and an accident.\nFollowing the release of the vessel, the Finland and Estonia utility companies Fingrid and Elering said they would sue the ship’s owner to cover repair costs. They had agreed to the release of the tanker saying that the trial could last up to five to six years. The companies are covering the cost of the cable repairs which reports said could end up costing €60 million ($68 million).\nYle reports that a tentative preliminary trial date is set for late August or early September should prosecutors decide to proceed with the case."

        "content": "A month after the first attempt to sail to Gaza was stopped when their vessel was attacked, the activist group Freedom Flotilla Coalition has launched a second attempt this time using a smaller private sailing vessel. The group set out from the Italian port of Catania, Sicily on June 1 with the declared intent to challenge Israel’s ongoing blockade of Gaza.\nThey set out this time with extensive media attention saying that they are “a peaceful act of civil resistance. All the volunteers and crew aboard theMadleenare trained in nonviolence. They are sailing unarmed,” the group said in a statement. They said they understand the risk of interception by Israeli naval forces.\nThe ID number they supplied for the vessel they are callingMadleen(named the group says for Gaza’s first and only fisherwoman) corresponds to a UK-registered 18-meter (59-foot) sailing vessel namedBarcarole. The Coalition says they put aboard an advanced tracking system which currently shows them sailing at 5.7 knots. As such, it would take them a week to complete the 1,000-nautical mile trip to Gaza.\nOn board, the group says are volunteers from multiple countries, among them a member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan, climate justice activist Greta Thunberg, and according to some reports Irish actor Liam Cunningham. The ship is reported to be carrying urgently needed supplies for the people of Gaza, including baby formula, flour, rice, diapers, women’s sanitary products, water desalination kits, medical supplies, crutches, and children’s prosthetics. The group acknowledged to Reuters that it is a limited but symbolic amount of relief supplies.\n\n\nThe first attempt was on the German excursion boat they named Conscience (Freedom Flotilla Coalition)\n\nThis is the second attempt after they tried to take a larger 120 dwt German coastal cruise ship previously used for excursions from Malta. The vessel they namedConsciencewasattackedthe group contends by the Israelis disabling the ship and starting a fire. Malta assisted in putting out the fire and afterdelays, theConsciencewas towed by an Italian tugboat to Libya. Reports have said they hoped to repair the ship once it reached port.\nBefore the previous attempt, the group said it had attempted to limit media coverage. This time they are broadcasting the location to draw international attention. They are calling for a guarantee of safe passage and encouraging media coverage."

        "content": "\nIndonesia is continuing its aggressive enforcement efforts to crack down on illegal fishing. The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries reports in the latest effort it has impounded two Malaysian fishing vessels suspected of engaging in illegal fishing in the country’s territorial waters in the Malacca Strait.\nThe two vessels were interdicted by the patrol boat Hiu 6, which is based at the Belawan fisheries supervision station, North Sumatra. According to the official account, one vessel, KM SLFA 4584 had three Indonesian crewmembers and a load of around 150 kg of mixed fish. The other vessel, KM SLFA 5210 had four Indonesian crewmembers and 300 kg of mixed fish.\nThe authorities said that the vessels lacked permit documents from the Indonesian government. In addition, the vessels were reportedly found to be using fish trawling gear, which is prohibited in territorial waters. They alleged the vessels were using trawls that were prohibited.\n“Preliminary investigations show that the Indonesian crew worked in Malaysia without following proper procedures. There is a possibility they paid bribes to cross our border and enter Malaysia illegally,” said Pung Nugroho, the ministry’s director of marine resources and fisheries monitoring.\nThey allege it is part of a larger, ongoing problem in the region. The crewmembers they said might have been motivated by high salaries to enter Malaysia and work on the vessels.\nThe seizure of the two Malaysian vessels adds to a list of other foreign fishing ships arrested this year. Between January and May, the Ministry reported that it has arrested 13 foreign fishing vessels, consisting of five from the Philippines, three from Malaysia, four from Vietnam, and one from China.\nIn the past decade, Indonesia has run a spirited campaign against illegal fishing within its vast waters. One of the notable moments was the highly publicized anti-IUU fishing campaign led by the former maritime and fisheries minister Susi Pudjiastuti. The campaign gained global attention especially after Indonesia decided toblow up and sink vesselssuspected of illegal fishing. Between 2014- 2016, Indonesia reportedly blew up over 170 vessels as a warning to foreign fishing fleets engaged in illegal fishing.\nWhile IUU fishing in Indonesia has gone down significantly, the government insists that routine patrols are essential for compliance with the fishing laws. As the world’s largest archipelago, Indonesia is prone to illegal fishing due to its vast EEZ. At the peak of illegal fishing in 2011, studies show that 20-38 percent of Indonesia’s wild seafood exports had been caught illegally by local fishers and foreign fishing fleets. Indonesia estimated that illegal fishing activities cost its economy at least $3 billion annually in lost revenue."

        "content": "\nA team of volunteer researchers and divers working off the coast of Alaska succeeded in mapping the 1908 wreck site of Alaska’s second-worst maritime disaster (in terms of lives lost) and recovering the bell of theStar of Bengal. Built by Harland & Wolff, the shipyard famed for later building theTitanic, the vessel was lost 117 years ago located on the remote Coronation Island, approximately 80 miles west of Wrangell, Alaska.\nThe first successful research expedition to the wreck site wasreported by Willian Urschel, the captain of the research vesselEndeavourwhich is operated by the nonprofit organizationAlaska Endeavour. During the summer season, it is used for student expeditions while in the shoulder periods, it does professional expeditions.\nThe wreck of theStar of Bengalhad remained a mystery. A team of divers visited the site in 2022 but did not manage to carry out any major surveys due to poor weather. This year, aboardEndeavour, the team returned to the site and during a 10-day period managed to locate and document the hull frames and plates, four anchors, the windlass, and other machinery. They also located and raised the ship’s bronze bell.\nThe ship which was 1,694 tons had been built in 1874 in Belfast, Ireland for the British trading company JP Corry & Co. as a 264-foot iron three-masted merchant sailing vessel. She was acquired by the Alaska Packers Association in 1906 and would become a workhorse for the association transporting cannery workers and supplies to Wrangell, Alaska in the spring and bringing the workers and canned salmon back to San Francisco in autumn.\nOn September 20, 1908, the ship was traveling through the Sumner Strait in Alaska for its return to California for the winter. It was under tow by two small tugboats, theKayakand theHattie Gagewhen they encountered a strong storm.\nHistorical accounts indicate that a combination of high winds, no communication, and mechanical failures forced the tugboats to sever the tow lines. TheStar of Bengaldropped anchor but the anchor dragged. The ship was broken on the rocks of Coronation Island approximately 80 miles west of Wrangle.\nAboard the ship were 138 men – 106 cannery workers and 32 crew and 2.5 million one-pound cans of salmon from the Wrangell cannery. The sinking caused the deaths of 110 of the people on board including 96 of the canary workers. The majority of deaths were Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino laborers.\nThe bell was recovered as a memorial to the ship and has been sent for conservation at the Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation at Texas A&M University. It is expected to return to Wrangell where it will go on display at the Wrangell History Museum. The wreck ofStar of Bengalwill also be nominated for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places."

        "content": "\nArctic shipping in the Russian-controlled Northern Sea Route (NSR) is poised for major growth this year, with a record number of vessels applying for permits. Voyages in NSR are open in the warmer months, during the summer and autumn from July 1 to November 30, when the ice has receded or has thinned.\nWith navigation in the route set to open next month, the state-controlled nuclear energy firm Rosatom said that it is expecting a 50 percent rise in voyages by foreign vessels this year. Rosatom controls the Russian icebreaker fleet and is in charge of operations along the NSR.\n“There is a clear upward trend in international interest in NSR. In 2025, foreign companies are expected to conduct at least 1.5 times more voyages through NSR compared to the previous year,” Rosatom told Reuters.\nRosatom added that as of May 27, 196 applications had been submitted for vessel navigation along NSR, including vessels sailing under foreign flags. The bulk of the fleet will be vessels transporting liquefied gas from the Russian Arctic gas projects such as the Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2. For the summer navigation, around 30 LNG carriers have been granted permits to transit NSR. However, there are concerns that at least five sanctioned carriers are part of this list, according to the NSR Administration registry under Rosatom.\nWith the West tightening economic sanctions against Russia, there has been a rise of shadow fleet exporting sanctioned Russian oil and gas to international markets. In the Baltic Sea, the shadow fleet is seen as a threat to maritime safety in the region, with several reports of sabotage operations on the undersea cable infrastructure.\nThe opening of the NSR in the coming weeks is likely to see some of the shadow fleet shift to the route. Russia has been marketing NSR as shorter than the Suez Canal route, reducing travel time between Europe and Asia. However, expansion of the icebreaker fleet and Arctic port infrastructure is needed to make the route competitive.\nLast year, NSR hit a record cargo volume of 38 million tons, up from 35 million tons in 2023."

        "content": "\nThe international effort to maintain security in the Arabian Sea is reporting another significant drug seizure again aided using new technology. Last week, the UK Royal Navy frigate HMSLancaster, which was part of a CTF 150 routine patrol in the North Arabian Sea, identified a suspicious small cargo dhow transiting the area.\nThe British frigate reports it secretly shadowed the suspect through the Arabian Sea for more than 24 hours. As part of the operation, it deployed for the second time the Royal Navy’s new Peregrine drones. The command of theLancasterdescribes them as “mini helicopters which conduct reconnaissance stories for hours and feed live information to the vessel’s operation room.\" The same vessel highlighted in March that it had used the system for thefirst timeduring a drug seizure.\nAfter further monitoring of the dhow using a drone, the Royal Marines went into action. A boarding team of 42 commandos was embarked into two sea boats and in what the command called “a pincer movement,” the dhow was interested. Overhead, Royal Marine snipers were monitoring the operation from the frigate’s Wildcat helicopter.\n\n\n\n“This is another example of whereLancasterhas delivered at range, in isolation, utilizing her own organic assets,” reported Commanding Officer Commander Chris Chew. “Whether they come in the form of her Wildcat, our uncrewed air system Peregrine, embarked intelligence team, or her Royal Marine Boarding Team, they delivered on operations in support of the Combined Maritime Forces and New Zealand-led Combined Task Force 150.”\nSearching the suspect vessel, the team found 50 packages containing one ton of heroin, 55 packages containing 660kg of hashish, and 6 kg of amphetamine tablets. The drugs are estimated to have a street value of over $36 million.\n“This is the largest value in narcotics interdiction we have made under our New Zealand command this year,” said Royal New Zealand Commodore, Rodger Ward, who is also the Commander of CTF 150. New Zealand took over the command of CTF 150 from the Pakistan Navy in January as part of the rotating command.\nWhile it was the second time in two months thatLancasterhas interdicted high-value drug trafficking in the Arabian Sea, last week was far larger than the previous one. In March, the frigate seized heroin and amphetamine valued at more than $6 million from a dhow.\nCTF 150 was established in 2002 as one of the five operational task forces under the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF). The CMF operation is reported to be the world’s largest international maritime partnership. It involves 46 nations.\nSince July 2024, ships working in support of CTF 150 have carried out at least five successful interdictions against cases of drug smuggling in the Arabian Sea. In the recent past, the waters of the Arabian Peninsula have become synonymous with drug trafficking, with CTF 150 confiscating over $1 billion worth of illicit narcotics since 2021."

The carrier which just a few years ago had been expected to enter early retirement instead sailed over 63,000 nautical miles, spending five months in combat with the Houthi rebels, and completing what has been termed “the largest airstrike ever conducted from an aircraft carrier.”\nThe strike group departed for deployment in September 2024 with the cruiser USSGettysburg, and destroyers USSStoutand USSJason Dunhamescorting USSHarry S. Truman. Aboard were nine embarked squadrons of Carrier Air Wing 1.\nThe first portion of her deployment was routine with the vessels dispatched to the North Sea to participate in NATO’s Neptune Strike 24-2 exercise. They visited Portugal, Norway, and Italy and made port calls in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Spain, France, Croatia, and Greece. However, the mission changed in mid-December when the group was ordered into the Red Sea region.\n\n\n\nUSSHarry S. Trumanrelieved USSAbraham Lincolnand her carrier strike group which had been waging the campaign against the Houthi militants in Yemen following the USSEisenhower. They were engaged for more than a month and became the target of the Houthis before the militants announced they would honor the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. On multiple occasions, the Houthis claimed to have chasedTrumannorth in the Red Sea with missile and drone assaults.\nThe carrier group was briefly sent back into the Mediterranean before being redeployed back into the Red Sea. On February 1, the strike group delivered 124,000 pounds of ordnance against targets In Somalia, which is reported to be the single largest strike from a carrier. Following that, the Truman Strike Group started what became a sustained 52-day assault on the Houthis. During that period over 1,000 targets were struck before the U.S. announced a ceasefire in mid-May.\nThe deployment was extended by the Pentagon before the decision to bring the carrier home in late May. According to the Navy, during the deployment, the strike group completed more than 13,000 sorties and 25,000 flight hours.\n“For more than 50 days, the crew operated on the front lines, thwarting numerous attacks, and never gave up the fight,” USNI News reports Captain Chris Hill, the second commanding officer of theTrumanduring the campaign told reporters. “In fact, they employed more than 1.1 million pounds of ordnance against the enemy.”\n\n\n\nIt was an eventful deployment forTrumanas she was not only under frequent attack by the Houthis. She collided with a cargo ship as she prepared for a transit of the Suez Canal which led to her captain being relieved and replaced by Hill who had just finished a similar mission aboard the Eisenhower in the Red Sea. TheTrumanalso lost three aircraft, one was shot down in December in a friendly fire incident with USS Gettysburg, one was lost overboard while it was being towed and the carrier took evasive maneuvers during a Houthi attack, and a third lost when the arresting wire failed to stop the fighter jet.\nAt a total of 251 days, it was not the carrier’s longest deployment. USNI News reports she spent 285 days at sea in 2022.\nOn her return to base in Norfolk,Harry S. Trumanis slated to begin an extended overhaul and refueling. In 2019, the Navy had contemplated retiring the carrier instead of proceeding with the life-extension overhaul. The multi-year project follows similar recent overhauls for USSGeorge Washingtonand USSJohn C. Stennis."

        "content": "MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company has become the first shipping company to deploy its mega ships to the African continent. The company made history in late April and early May when the service was inaugurated with two of the recently built 24,000 TEU class containerships arriving in the ports of Ghana, Togo, Cote d’Ivoire, and Cameroon as part of the deployment on the African Express service.\nSince the introduction of the latest segment of ultra large container vessels, carriers ranging from MSC, CMA CGM, and Hapag-Lloyd to Evergreen and OOCL have used the massive vessels for Asia to Europe routes. The ships were designed to maximize capacity around 24,000 TEU per vessel and with the maximum dimensions for a transit of the Suez Canal and the ports of Northern Europe.\nMSC highlights that transferring two of these vessels for service to West Africa will help to reshape the economic development of the region. It is expected the service which connects China and South Korea to West Africa with port calls also in India will boost trade volumes both for imports and exports. MSC points to the surge in Asia – West Africa trade and customer demand. The company also highlights the service as part of its commitment to African economic development.\nThe expanded service kicked off with theMSC Dilettawhich reached West Africa in late April. Built in China in 2021, the vessel is 235,228 dwt. It is registered in Liberia and operates under a long-term lease from Chinese finance companies to MSC. It has a capacity of 23,964 TEU.\nMSC Dilettamade a call in Lomé, Togo, where MSC’s TIL division is a partner with China Merchants for the operation of the Lomé Container Terminal. This vessel also called in Abidjan in Cote d’Ivoire.\nShe was followed by theMSC Turkiyewhich was also built in China and delivered to the company in 2023. It is one of the largest containerships in the world with a capacity of 24,346 TEU. The ship is registered in Liberia and 281,458 DWT.\nLomé port officials highlighted that while the port had handled calls for other large containerships this is the first regular deployment. In the past, the largest containerships deployed on routes to West Africa were in the 366-meter (1,200-foot) length while both of the MSC vessels are 400 meters (1,312 feet) in length.\nPort officials highlighted the development of their facilities and the technical challenges of handling vessels each more than 100 feet longer than previous ships.\nThe Lomé Container Terminal is the largest container port in West Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. It is also the fifth largest in Africa having handled approximately 1.7 million TEU last year.\nWith the growth in Africa, carriers have expanded their services with for example CMA CGM transferring in larger capacity vessels as it deployed its 24,000 TEU ships on the European routes. Both MSC and CMA CGM also made large investments in acquiring terminals and logistics operations in Africa in recent years."

President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on companies in the trade imposing secondary sanctions on anyone trading with Iran for oil and gas.\nThere has been a lot of attention on India’s energy imports with most of the focus being on its large importation of Russian oil. At times, India has responded to U.S. sanction threats blocking listed shadow tankers while it also has acted to support the insurance market for shadow tankers.\nIn anexclusive report, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Adani is now being investigated for a possible role in the importation of Iranian LPG. The newspaper tracks the movements of LPG carriers that it asserts are using well-known evasion tactics including AIS spoofing to disguise lifting and carrying products from Iran.\nThe Wall Street Journal tracked shipments into the Mundra port in India which is operated by one of the Adani companies. Adani Group and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp highlighted in 2018 the development of the gas terminal in Mundra port. They reported a capacity to handle five million tons of LNG per year and India’s prime minister Narendra Modi traveled to the port to mark the commissioning of two gas pipelines.\nAdani responded to The Wall Street Journal denying any “deliberate engagement” to avoid sanctions or illegal trade with Iranian-origin petroleum products. A spokesperson confirmed to the newspaper the company is in the LPG business calling it small but growing for Adani.\nThe newspaper reports the U.S. Justice Department is investigating the activities of several LPG tankers delivering product to India.\nAdani Group is run by Gautam Adani who is the wealthiest person in India and has close ties to Prime Minister Modi. The Wall Street Journal reports his companies are valued at $150 billion.\nThe company has been accused of other issues in the past but none have been proven. One report said the company was violating Indian securities laws. There have also been unproven allegations of fraud, and bribery.\nAdani Group has called the allegations baseless and lies. The Wall Street Journal reports the company hired U.S. lawyers to lobby the U.S. government in hopes of bringing the government investigations to a close."

        "content": "The government of Panama issued a statement rejecting the claims of critics that its flag registry has failed to take sufficient action to stop vessels supporting the Iranian oil trade by citing its removal of vessels from the registry. As the largest registry by the number of ships, approximately 8,500 vessels, Panama has come under scrutiny for the number of shadow tankers or vessels transporting Iranian oil that are operating under its flag.\nThe statement details the actions taken by the Panama Maritime Authority (AMP) over the past few years to purge the ranks of its registry. It is a frequent topic that has often drawn criticism. Today, the AMP asserts that it has de-flagged more than 650 ships from its registry since 2019. In the past, it has discussed the changes to rules and efforts to speed up the cancellation process.\nIt also reports that last October it took a further step empowering the AMP to unilaterally remove vessels from its registry if their owners appear on international sanctions lists. Today, they claim this has resulted in the cancellation of 214 vessels representing more than 12 million tons over the past eight months.\nThe statement came after long-time critic, the NGO United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), renewed its calls for Panama to increase its efforts to stop its support of the Iranian oil trade. UANI CEO Ambassador Mark Wallace asserted that the registry has a “lack of consistent, proactive enforcement,” which the group says permits Iran to continue to earn billions from the oil trade.\nUANI asserted that its analysis shows that one in five vessels suspected of transporting Iranian oil, or 17 percent of the 542 vessels the group has listed, sail under the flag of Panama. The group points to the fact that the U.S. and others continue to list vessels registered in Panama when they announce sanctions.\nThe AMP has highlighted its efforts over the past few years to increase the oversight of its registry and remove violators. In the past, they noted it was a slow process.\nStarting in 2019, the AMP has taken steps such as establishing rules that sanction vessels for deliberately deactivating Long-Rage Identification and Tracking or their AIS signal. Recently, the AMP also established new rules for the reporting of planned ship-to-ship oil transfers, another technique favored by shadow tankers to obscure the source of oil.\nPanama was also instrumental in working with other registries to establish information sharing. The program was aimed at notifying other flags when a registry cancels or initiates a sanction or cancellation process. It was designed to crack down on the practice of flag hopping to avoid cancellation or other penalties.\nIn responding to the critics, the registry highlights that it follows IMO and United Nations standards and maintains close collaboration with the United States. During the Biden administration, the U.S. State Department met with Panama to discuss enforcement and the crackdown on vessels that were violating sanctions.\nThe Government of Panama notes that the AMP carries out investigations into compliance. It also highlights that the efforts go beyond tankers to also include a focus on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing."

One person was sent to the hospital while multiple vessels worked to stabilize the barge and prevent it from sinking.\nThe Dutch fuel bargeBeringzee(82 meters / 269 feet) was underway at mid-day on Friday, May 30, between Antwerp and Vlissingen in the Netherlands, when it was being overtaken byContainerships Nord(20,200 dwt / 1,400 TEU). Authorities are still investigating how it occurred, but the barge was run over by the containership causing it to begin taking on water and leaking fuel.\nKNRM, the Dutch rescue service, responded and reported that one person was seriously injured in the collision while the captain and one seafarer both ended up in the water. A large-scale rescue operation was launched, including the KNRM lifeboats Jan van Engelenburg and Zeemanshoop, a Coastguard helicopter, a Coastguard aircraft, police boats from both the Netherlands and Belgium, a patrol vessel from Rijkswaterstaat and several tugboats.\nThe captain of the inland vessel managed to bring the seriously injured passenger to safety from a part of the ship that was quickly taking on water. He also was able to rescue the sailor who had fallen into the water.\n“The captain had sustained injuries and swallowed a lot of water during the rescue operation,” reports KNRM. He was taken by boat to shore and treated by an ambulance crew along with the injured sailor.\nA Belgian police boat arrived at the scene and the seriously injured person was taken on board along with an ambulance nurse, who was part of the helicopter crew. The nurse was lowered to the police boat by the Coast Guard helicopter and the patient was taken to hospital by helicopter.\n\n\n\nBarges were placed alongside theBeringzeeto stop it from sinking and the fuel was being transferred to one of the barges. Reports indicated that there was a leak of likely a lightweight diesel fuel. It was expected to evaporate in the river.\nThe containership sustained only minor damage but was ordered to move into the anchorage to await an inspection. AIS signals show it is back underway as of Monday. It had been traveling from Antwerp to Dunkirk, France at the time of the collision.\nDelivered in 2018, Containerships Nord was the first LNG-fueled ship to enter the CMA CGM fleet. The French company had recently completed the acquisition of the Germany-based Containerships and the vessel was the first of four LNG feeders ordered for the European service."

        "content": "\nA Strategic Defence Review (SDR) commissioned by the British government and to be published on June 2 has set a course for a doubling of the United Kingdom’s nuclear attack submarine force.\nThe Royal Navy is currently deploying its seven-strong fleet of Astute nuclear attack submarines. The sixth boat in the Astute fleet HMS Agamemnon (S123) was launched last October, and the final boat HMS Achilles (S125) is due to enter service in late 2026.\nThe 12 new AUKUS submarines to replace the Astute class will be built by BAE in Barrow in Furness, where the fabrication facility is being doubled in size so as to be able to turn out a new submarine every 18 months. The AUKUS design will be common to both the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy, who are scheduled to take at least eight AUKUS submarines, to be built by a joint venture by ASC and BAE at the Osborne Naval Shipyard in South Australia.  The first British AUKUS submarine is likely to be delivered in the late 2030s, and the first Australian submarine in the early 2040s.\nWhile the AUKUS design is a long way from being fixed, the submarines are likely to feature both vertical launch tubes for missiles and forward launch tubes for torpedoes. Although nuclear-powered, there is currently no intention for the AUKUS submarines in British service to perform the nuclear deterrence role. With the UK’s nuclear deterrence currently provided solely by the four boats of the Vanguard Class, this role will be taken over by four new Dreadnought Class submarines, the first three of which are already under construction in Barrow - the first of class HMS Dreadnought is likely to come into service in 2032. However, the SDR has recommended that the UK’s nuclear capability be broadened, so it is possible that the vertically-launched missiles on British AUKUS submarines could eventually be armed with nuclear warheads. The Royal Air Force is also likely to be re-equipped with nuclear weapons, a capability dropped in 1998, with F-35A aircraft to be procured for this purpose.\nAmongst 62 SDR recommendations, all apparently accepted by the British government, one of the first to be implemented will be a significant increase in explosives, missile, and ammunition manufacturing capability, with four new factories to be commissioned, dispersed across the UK.\nThe SDR has come in for some criticism because the review has made recommendations based on an assumption that UK defense spending will increase to 3 percent of GDP. The government has not yet specified by when this target pledge will be honored."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nTwo days after a bold attack on Russia’s strategic bomber fleet, Ukraine is reporting it has attacked the Kerch Strait bridge from the water. While the attack appears to have been more superficial than previous efforts by Ukraine, it is the latest response to peace talks that appear to be floundering and Russia’s increased assault on Ukraine.\nUkraine’s security force SBU posted messages and images online reporting that attack which reportedly was conducted at 4:44 a.m. local time. Ukraine says no civilians were injured but claimed to have damaged the underwater supports. There was some online speculation that the attack was staged using underwater drones, while the SBU said the operation had lasted several months and involved agents mining the supports.\nThe SBU reports the equivalent of 1,100 kg of TNT was used. It claims that the supports were severely damaged at the water level. Local reports said the bridge was closed for an inspection but unconfirmed reports said it was at least partially reopened. Russia’s Defense Ministry did not acknowledge the attack but earlier said the bridge was closed to clear debris after it downed Ukrainian drones.\n“We hit the Crimean Bridge twice in 2022 and 2023. So today we continued this tradition underwater,” wrote the SBU on social media. “The Crimean Bridge is an absolutely legitimate target, especially considering that the enemy used it as a logistical artery to supply its troops.”\nRussia constructed the 12-mile bridge after occupying the Crimea Peninsular in 2014. It provides vital rail and roadway links to the region, which has made it a repeated target for Ukraine. They have also attacked the ferries used to cross the Kerch Strait.\n\n??? ??????? ???? ????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ??????? ????????? ???? — ????? ???? ??? ?????!???????? ??????? ???????? ???????. ?????? ??? ?????????? ????? ????? ??????????? ??’????.??https://t.co/Rf4fR7QDXkpic.twitter.com/wgsS4HoCbc\n\nWhile global pressure continues to push for a ceasefire and peace agreement, Ukraine reported Russia launched 112 drones overnight but claimed to have shot down 75. The attacks were reportedly widespread across Ukraine mostly hitting civilian infrastructure.\nThese attacks came after Ukraine and Russia met in Istanbul on Monday for the latest round of peace talks. Ukraine is reported to be continuing to call for a 30-day ceasefire but has also added demands for the release of all prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children in Russian territories.\nMedia accounts suggest Russia presented one of its most stringent set of demands including Ukraine’s withdrawal from all the areas Russia occupies. Russia is also demanding that Ukraine stop receiving foreign weapons and end its mobilization."

Details of the incident remain vague, but it is a well-known area for piracy with the authorities warning vessels to use caution while transiting the region.\nAn unidentified cargo ship was boarded sailing according to the official account approximately 75 nautical miles northwest of Santo Antonio in São Tomé and Príncipe. Security consultants are placing the vessel 118 nautical miles northwest of Bonny, Nigeria.\nThe master of the vessel which reports said is registered in Curacao was in contact with the Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade in the Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG) security operation providing updates as the situation unfolded. MDAT-GoG issued an alert reporting the boarding took place Saturday, May 30 although some reports said it started on Friday, May 29.\nInitial indications were that seven armed perpetrators boarded the vessel with what appeared to be guns. The majority of the crew mustered in the citadel where they were able to monitor the incident as it unfolded using the vessel’s CCTV system. The perpetrators left the vessel and by May 31 MDAT-GoG was reporting the ship had been searched and confirmed no boarders remained aboard.\nOne seafarer was reported injured in the incident and in the confusion, it was unclear if it was the first or second engineer. Later reports confirmed it was the second engineer who was also missing, apparently kidnapped by the perpetrators.\nThe chief engineer of the vessel was later located onboard. The first engineer was among the crew locked in the citadel.\nAn inspection of the vessel reports the perpetrators also damaged some of the equipment on the bridge. Local authorities boarded the ship to assist the crew and according to the reports were escorting the ship to a port of refuge.\nSecurity analysts have warned that while overall piracy has declined in the Gulf of Guinea, this area has become a hotbed of piracy activity. In April, another vessel reported being boarded and the crew’s belongings and other property were taken while the perpetrators were aboard for four hours. In March, there was a report of shots fired when pirates boarded a bitumen tanker. Family members reported that 10 crewmembers were abducted from theBITU Riverin that incident."

The move which is designed to advance key initiatives in sustainability and digitalization was announced after French President Emmanuel Macron conducted a two-day visit to the city-state during his tour of Asia at the end of May.\n“This collaboration reflects our shared commitment to advancing sustainable, innovative, and secure maritime solutions,” said Eric Banel, Director General for Maritime Affairs, Fisheries and Aquaculture in Singapore. “Both France and Singapore, as global maritime hubs and key worldwide players in innovation and engineering, recognize the strategic importance of strengthening cooperation in port digitalization, green shipping, and maritime safety and security.”\nFrench shipping company CMA CGM will also be joining in with the initiatives. It will participate as it seeks to support fuel innovation and the adoption of digital standards for the industry.\nOne of the key pilots will focus on supporting the adoption of biomethane. Working to advance maritime decarbonization, the partners will explore the development of a bio-methane supply chain and certification program.\nThey are planning the first bio-methane bunkering trail which will take place in Singapore. They will develop a certification framework similar to the efforts Singapore undertook to develop the first ammonia bunkering. The port conducted the first ammonia bunkering as a marine fuel in March 2024 and working with CMA CGM will conduct the first for bio-methane.\nThe French shipping company will also support an initiative between France’s HAROPA Port, the operator for the ports of Le Havre, Rouen, and Paris, and the Port of Marseille-Fos authority to advance digitization. This initiative will focus on port call optimization and maritime digitalization testing ship-to-shore data exchange to automate and streamline port clearance processes. By reducing manual documentation, they believe the industry will improve the timeliness and accuracy of operational data. They will look to support efforts to have internationally recognized data standards."

The FPSO will help double the gas output from Turkey’s deepwater Sakarya gas field, which is currently producing 9 million cubic meters(mcm) of gas daily.\nOsman Gazi’s maximum natural gas processing capacity is 10.5 mcm and has a transfer capacity of 10 mcm. With the installation of the vessel, the Sakarya gas field will reach a daily production of 20 mcm, which will help meet the natural gas needs of 8 million households in Turkey, according to Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar.\nIn the past few years, Turkey has intensified efforts to expand natural gas production in the Black Sea. The country, which imports over 90 percent of its energy needs, wants to cut the import bill by developing domestic resources.\n\nTürkiye'nin ilk yüzer üretim platformu#OsmanGazi, Filyos Liman?'na ula?t?! ????????pic.twitter.com/ytfInElRFe\n\nIt is part of these plans that in 2023 the state energy firm TPAO acquired the FPSO from the floater specialist BW Offshore. The platform arrived in Turkey last year in September onboard Boka Vanguard, a semi-submersible heavy transport vessel owned by Boskalis. The platform has been undergoing technical preparations at a shipyard in Çanakkale city. It was floated out on May 27 and docked at the Port of Filyos in the Black Sea on Saturday.\nThe FPSO is 298.5 meters long, 56 meters wide, and has a personnel capacity of 140 people. The natural gas processed on the platform will be delivered on land via a 161-kilometer-long transmission line. It will then be fed to the national grid in a ready-to-use form.\nThe FPSO adds to the growing list of vessels that Turkey has acquired recently to boost its energy security. Turkey launched its first drillship, Fatih, in 2017, followed by Yavuz in 2018, Kanuni in 2020 and Abdülhamid Han in 2021. Fatih helped in the discovery of the Sakarya gas field in August 2020.\nLast month, Turkey announced the discovery of a new reserve of 75 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas in the Black Sea. The reserve was discovered during drilling in the Goktepe-3 well, at a depth of 3,500 meters.\n"

The Hellenic Coast Guard reported the incident but did not supply details on the people who are believed to be migrants or their attempted destination.\nThe first reports of the unfolding situation came from some of the 200 passengers aboard the interisland ferryBlue Star Xios. They reported that the 14,000 gross ton ferry was stopped early Sunday morning and had put down a boat possibly searching for migrants.\nThe authorities reported that a distress call came from the sailboat which was located approximately 14 nautical miles off the island of Karpathos in the southeastern Aegean. Reports said the weather conditions were mild with wind considered to be a fresh breeze at around 20 knots.\nBuilt in 2007, the ferry is 141 meters (462 feet) in length. It has limited accommodations carrying a total of 1,700 passengers mostly in seating. It is a RoRo with a garage.\n\n\n\nPassengers from the ferry posted videos online showing the sailboat coming alongside packed with people. Reports indicate between 70 and 75 people were taken from the overloaded boat onto the ferry. A Greek coast guard vessel was reportedly standing by during the operation.\nGreece has had a tumultuous relationship with the influx of migrants and frequent disputes with Turkey which accuses Greece of driving back the migrants. In the latest development in the struggle over the flow of migrants, prosecutors in Greece last week charged 17 crewmembers from a Hellenic Coast Guard cutter for their involvement in a 2023 incident in which another overcrowded boat overturned. Only about 100 people survived, while 72 bodies were recovered and there were accusations that several hundred went down with the boat. The Coast Guard had been tracking the boat and survivors accused a patrol boat of contributing to the loss of the boat.\nInternational organizations have been critical of the organization of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean to handle the flow of migrants. They have called for reforms to organize and coordinate the rescue efforts."

Japanese conglomerate Marubeni, which is a large vessel owner and has a 20-year relationship with Gearbulkk, agreed to purchase the remaining shares which will make it a minority investor alongside Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.\nThe Jebsen family embarked on the road of exiting the company in June last year agreeing to sell a 23 percent stake to Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. When the deal was completed in January, the Japanese company had increased its shareholding to 72 percent. Gearbulk had reported in October 2024 that it was negotiating the sale of the additional stake to Marubeni.\nThe family retained a 28 percent shareholding in Gearbulk which it has now agreed to sell to Marubeni. Gearbulk was established by Kristian Gerhard Jebsen together with three partners in 1968 and today operates the world’s largest fleet of open hatch gantry crane and semi-open jib crane vessels. The value of the transaction with Marubeni was not disclosed.\nJapanese trading and investment conglomerate reports that it will aid in providing Gearbulk with its vessel ownership capabilities and global network. It intends to contribute to the sustainable enhancement of Gearbulk’s corporate value to further strengthen and expand its vessel ownership and operation functions. In collaboration with MOL, the company has set goals of also pioneering new business domains in open hatch vessel operations, the ultimate objective of which is to maximize revenue opportunities and drive further growth in its shipping business.\nHeadquartered in Switzerland, Gearbulk maintains market leadership in open hatch shipping, a specialized segment of the dry bulk sector. Together with its joint venture, G2 Ocean, it owns and operates a fleet of 59 vessels that are purpose-built to carry forest products and other unitized breakbulk cargo like pulp, steel, and aluminum ingots. The design of the vessels also allows for the loading of project cargoes, including wind power equipment and heavy cargo, on deck or hatch covers.\nOn April 30, Gearbulk released its 2024 Integrated Report and ESG Report indicating that the company managed to sustain focus on financial resilience in a year that was marked by market volatility. It acknowledged that its financial performance during the year was weak due to losses in the open hatch segment despite positive contributions from non-core activities. Being privately owned, the company is not obligated to make its financial statements public."

News of his passing at age 70 was released on Monday afternoon by MTI Network, which Lawrence remained as founder and chairman at the time of his death.\nThroughout his career, which included a stint at Lloyd’s List before going on to lead the Connecticut Maritime Association for more than 30 years, founding Marine Money, and MTI Network, was all about being a staunch supporter of the maritime industry and a source for discussion and information. Lawrence is remembered for his steadfast support of the industry and push to drive the industry forward.\nLawrence joined the Connecticut Maritime Association, a non-profit that represents aspects of shipping and international trade, in 1988 and became the face of the annual CMA Conference held each March. It is known for bringing together leaders from, as the organization describes it, “bunker brokers and tug-boat operators to lawyers and underwriters, to ship owners, brokers and managers, shippers and merchants of all kinds of cargo.” A membership-driven organization it also seeks to mentor the future with its education foundation and the Commodore Gala Dinner of which Lawrence was a familiar face at the event promoting the best of the industry. In 2018, when he stepped away from the leadership of CMA, he highlighted that the organization would be in good hands with Informa to continue its mission.\nProfessionally he also was a founder in 1988 of Marine Money and served as Chairman for the organization which is recognized as the source of information in ship finance. It also hosts conferences to bring together industry leaders. He also co-founded MTI Network, a crisis communication network for the maritime industry, in 1990.\nHis colleagues at MTI said of him, “Jim was always a much-loved and deeply respected member of the MTI family. Over the years, he worked on numerous high-profile incidents, offering invaluable advice to clients both in the U.S. and internationally. He was not only a trusted advisor but also a prominent figure in the U.S. maritime industry.”\nHis support of mariners and the industry extended further. For 15 years, he also served on the board of the Seaman’s Church Institute. An ecumenical agency based in New York City, the Church is dedicated to promoting the safety, dignity, and improved working environment for seafarers and providing critical support. Lawrence in the last few years also became a board member of the OPA 90 Forum, a non-profit organization supporting the industry with OPA 90 (the U.S.’s Oil Pollution Act of 1990).\nLawrence’s unwavering support and dedication to the maritime industry earned him the U.S. Coast Guard’s Distinguished Public Service Award in 2019.\n“Jim was always a consummate professional, but to us, he was always Jim – incredibly energetic, hugely good fun, and incredibly knowledgeable about the shipping industry,” writes his colleagues at MTI Networks. “Whether climbing Mt Kilimanjaro or providing sensitive advice to clients he was a force to be reckoned with and will be missed by us all.”\nThe Maritime Executive joins with the industry to remember the lasting contributions of Jim Lawrence. We extend our condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues on the loss of a steadfast and loyal supporter."

Explaining the approach, they highlighted that steel should not be exported and melted down, but instead, it can be reused in Norway and Europe as new building material.\nA partnership of Norwegian industry looks to create an alternative to the export of ships to Turkey, which currently holds the EU’s only large-scale ship recycling capacity. They highlight that seven Norwegian shipyards have developed EU-approved capabilities for decommissioning end-of-life ships and the upcycling of the material.\nHöegh Autoliners is working with Nordic Circles for the national project which they report will “revolutionize the handling of decommissioned ships.” Applying the process without melting and exporting the material, they report will lower emissions by up to 97 percent.\nAs part of the agreement, Höegh Autoliners will send up to eight ships for recycling in Norway. They report the value of the agreement at NOK 1.3 billion ($128 million) with the first upcycling in 2026 to be conducted by AF Offshore Decom in Vats, Norway.\n“With this agreement, we ensure sustainability from cradle to grave and lay the foundation for a new green industrial adventure in Norway,” said Sebjørn Dahl, COO of Höegh Autoliners. “We are extremely proud of that.”\nThe group highlights a strong and emerging opportunity for ship upcycling citing reports that a doubling of decommissioning assignments is expected driven by new climate regulations and an aging fleet. Norway, they note, has the fifth largest merchant fleet by value and when including the EU’s share, they foresee the potential to address 45 percent of the world’s merchant fleet."

While the crew of the towing vesselBaylor J, Tregrewas unable to maneuver in an attempt to save the vessel due to overwhelming towline force, the report also highlights the lack of an emergency release and some issues with the vessel that might have accelerated its loss.\nThe towboat, which was built in 1997 and 67 feet long, was towing a 260-foot long barge loaded with a production platform and helideck bound for an offshore site. They had departed Houma, Louisiana, but due to the height of the platform were required to sail offshore instead of the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway.\nIt was midday on May 13 with the vessel approximately 60 miles from its destination. The weather was good with 3 to 4-foot seas and wind of 9 to 13 knots. The crew had checked weather reports and was receiving information from its shoreside office. They had a report of possible thunderstorms. The tow was traveling and 4 to 5 knots.\nThe mate was navigating when he observed a storm forming and made changes to the course but the line of thunderstorms appeared to shift to a circle and the wind began to intensify “at a very quick rate.” It was possibly hailing but they never determined if a waterspout had formed. The captain and mate later estimated for investigators that the winds could have been 85 to 100 mph (74 to 87 knots).\nThe vessel was losing speed and had started to heel. The mate was attempting to reposition the vessel but as the situation quickly deteriorated the vessel was heeling at 45 degrees. They had lost sight of the barge in the storm but it had moved alongside the towboat with the crew later reporting the line was taught “like a banjo string.” The captain ordered the mate to turn the barge loose. He attempted but reported to the captain it was impossible. The NTSB highlights in the report that the vessel did not have an emergency release and none is required under the regulations. Even if the mate had been able to reach the controls in the doghouse, it required the winch engine to be running, which it was not.\nThe captain was attempting to change the heading but by then the port quarter of the towboat was underwater. They believed the starboard rudder and propeller were out of the water. They made a distress call and moments later the vessel lost electrical power and the engines stopped running. Seas were now 6 to 7 feet.\nThe crew had to climb out of the tilted wheelhouse and one deckhand fell into the water. The others had to follow as the vessel sank. The self-deploying liferaft worked and they were eventually able to make it to the raft. The emergency beacon was also located and the Coast Guard was able to rescue the four crewmembers, although one suffered minor injuries.\nWhen the towboat was recovered, the NTSB reports some of the fiddley blowers on the second deck were missing and might have contributed to the flooding. Also, some of the sealing gaskets were found deteriorated on the exterior doors.\nThe casualty, which resulted in $2 million in damages, they attributed to the overwhelming towline forces during the storm and the inability to complete an emergency release of the barge. The heeling became unrecoverable for the vessel."

He was elected as an openly gay San Francisco supervisor in 1977 and was outspoken before he was murdered in San Francisco City Hall on November 27, 1978, along with San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, by an ex-supervisor named Dan White.\nThe Navy decided to name the new class of oilers after prominent civil rights leaders and activists. The class is still under construction, although the Navy has published names for the additional ships. CBS is reporting that in addition toHarvey Milk, renaming is under consideration for two vessels named after U.S. Supreme Court Justices, USNSThurgood Marshalland USNSRuth Bader Ginsberg, as well as USNSHarriet Tubmannamed for an abolitionist leader and others including USNSDolores Huerta, USNSLucy Stone, USNSCesar Chaver, and USNSMedgar Evers.\nCBS spoke with former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and San Francisco resident Nancy Pelosi who called the rumored action “shameful” and “vindictive.” Reuters is quoting U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as calling the actions “disgusting” and “blatant discrimination.”\nTrump and Hegseth have both called for restoring the focus on warfighting and promising to rid the military of all DEI efforts (diversity, equity, and inclusion). Hegseth also ordered the military to stop marking celebrations such as Black History Month and to purge DEI references from all areas ranging from libraries to materials and programs.\nThe Navy has rarely renamed active vessels. It has a long tradition of naming vessels after elected officials and prominent veterans and people in society as well as geographic locations. In 2023, the Navy renamed two vessels, USSChancellorsvilleand USNSMaury, as part of a Congress-directed effort at removing names associated with the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War. It also took the names of Confederate generals off military bases, which was reversed by the Trump administration in March."

        "content": "\nIndia has finalized a new round of international partnerships aimed at strengthening its shipbuilding sector and the launch of its first domestic polar research vessel. It is part of the declared strategy of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India a powerhouse in international shipbuilding.\nDuring an official visit to Norway this week time to coincide with the Nor-Shipping Conference, India’s Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal held talks with Japan’s Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Terada Yoshimichi. On the agenda of the meeting was deepening maritime ties between India and Japan. The two ministers reviewed the progress of a possible partnership deal between Indian and Japanese shipyards.\nSonowal expressed India’s interest in leading Japanese shipbuilding companies such as the Imabari Shipbuilding, JMUC, Kanagawa Dockyard, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to explore joint ventures and collaborative arrangements with Indian yards.\nHe also attended the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Limited (GRSE) and Norway’s Kongsberg Maritime. This partnership is critical as GRSE embarks on the design and construction of India’s first-ever polar research vessel. Kongsberg, a maritime technology specialist company, will provide design expertise for developing the research vessel.\n“Japan’s expertise in shipbuilding and ship repair is well recognized, and I see a great scope for collaboration in this area. We also invite Japan’s Big Three maritime companies, NYK Line, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, and K Line, to explore joint ventures and investment opportunities in India’s growing maritime sector,” stated Sarbananda Sonowal.\nJapan has been engaged in railway infrastructure development with India but now is interested in the maritime sector. Mutual collaboration in shipbuilding and training of seafarers is welcome, commented Yoshimichi.\nImabari Shipbuilding is already looking into a greenfield investment in India’s Andhra Pradesh state. In February, Imabari’s President Yukito Higaki led a high-level delegation to meet Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, where the two parties discussed potential investments in shipbuilding.\nLast year, Andhra Pradesh finalized a maritime policy, which is offering incentives for the creation of yard infrastructure. The state has adopted a cluster-based approach, zoning off land in specific port areas for allocation to shipbuilding and ship-repairing companies. The land may be provided for a long-term lease (30-60 years) at a nominal rate.\nIn a roundtable with the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association (NSA), Sonowal called for the owners to consider investing in India’s maritime sector. The minister recognized that Indian shipyards currently hold 11 percent of NSA’s order book. “We request for further expansion of orders, including leveraging on India’s ship breaking credit note scheme.”\nIndia has already made strong inroads into the Norwegian shipping community building for example the autonomous barges for ASKO Maritime, a division of a Norwegian grocery chain. In April, India’s Udupi Cochin Shipyard delivered the first dry bulk vessel, Wilson Eco 1, to the Norwegian Wilson Ship Management. The vessel is the first in a series of six 3,800 DWT cargo ships, which Wilson ordered at the yard in June 2023.\nIndia has also been courting the South Korean shipbuilding industry encouraging partnerships and development of yards in India. Major shipping companies including CMA CGM, Maersk, and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company have also been courted with proposals for ship repair and shipbuilding at India’s yards."

        "content": "\nThe shipping industry is rushing to build new capacity in Vietnam as the country works to expand its role as a manufacturing base competing with China. Two international players, CMA CGM and DP World, are highlighting their investments to build new capacity focusing on internal logistics with new river – sea transport operations.\nVietnam has already successfully positioned itself as a cost-effective alternative to China and now looks to leverage the Trump administration's efforts to reign in China by presenting itself as a strong alternative. Reports are that Vietnam was quick to open tariff negotiations with the Trump administration. South Vietnam, home to the Mekong Delta Key Economic Region and the Southern Key Economic Region has become a driver for Vietnam’s manufacturing and export economy.\nOne of the challenges is internal infrastructure. The government has been calling for developing inland waterway transportation as a means of linking the manufacturing areas and ports.\nDP World currently operates the Saigon Premier Container Terminal in Ho Chi Minh City with an annual capacity of 400,000 TEU and the only RoRo port in the south. It announced a new partnership with VIMC Lines, one of the units of Vietnam National Shipping Lines. They said the program known as the Mekong Express will enhance connectivity between the key economic regions in the South.\nThe companies mark the launch of the new Megong Express river service at the end of ay. Hey will be operating two trips per week combining river and sea routes with the ability to move hundreds of containers per week, including reefers.\n“DP World is committed to building an integrated, seamless supply chain ecosystem in Vietnam – an increasingly important market in the Asia Pacific region as well as globally,” said Glen Hilton, General Director of Asia Pacific for DP World. “With the Mekong Express, we are meeting the demand for an efficient and reliable service. This transport route will contribute to promoting economic development not only in the Southern region but also throughout Vietnam.”\nThe companies highlight that the water route is significantly shorter reducing an approximately 230-mile trip to 125 miles. Travel time for containers will be reduced from 48 hours to 15 hours. The service connects to Cai Mep Port and Cai Cui Port. They are also exploring extending it to the port operations of DP World and VIMC at two locations in Saigon.\nCMA CGM announced last month its planned investment to expand port operations to the north of Vietnam. The company has also signed an agreement with Gemadept, a key logistics and port operator in Vietnam, to establish a new joint venture, Green River Transport. It will operate the previously announcedelectric bargethat CMA CGM is building for transport in Vietnam. The new joint venture will manage transport in the Mekong Delta.\nThe barge is due to enter service in 2026 and it will be powered by a charging station being built at the Cai Mep port near Ho Chi Minh City. It is the country’s main container gateway. CMA CGM highlights that it operates 29 weekly maritime services from Vietnam.\nNike has agreed to be the first customer of the new electric barge service. It will use the service for its logistics flow between its Vietnam manufacturing locations and the Gemalink container terminal."

        "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing its investigation and release of data from the 2024 incident in which the containershipDalidestroyed Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge. In April, it posted the transcript of the VDR and crew interviews, which are now getting extensive attention in the Baltimore media.\nThe full74-page transcriptof the voice conversations was posted following the NTSB’s outline of the information in a March press briefing. Unlike the formal briefing, the actual wording shows the panic, terror, and frantic situation as multiple commands were shouted and the pilots and crew struggled to manage the situation.\nIt ends with the now fateful call by the pilot to the U.S. Coast Guard. At 0129:37 the senior pilot calls from the bridge of theDali, “This theDali. We have a major problem. The Key Bridge is down. I repeat. The Key Bridge is down. ummm Coast Guard. Coast Guard. This is container shipDali. you copy?”\nIn the minutes that follow they frantically try to contact officials, determine what happened, ask if anyone was injured, and start to second guess the situation. There were two pilots, a senior pilot and a trainee, and the trainee lets out what the transcript says is a “quick nervous laugh,” and the pilot remarks “Now this is a problem.”\nThe transcript followed much of the day including the power failures that prior afternoon while the vessel was at the dock and the subsequent briefing to the master. The master tells the chief engineer to write up the situation in full detail for the office but hours later when the pilots board after midnight they are told everything is good. They have a casual conversation as they prepare to push off. At about 0039 theDaliis underway with two tugs, which are released at 0107 with the captain of the tugBridget McAllistersigning off by wishing theDaliand the pilots a “safe trip.”\nThe alarms sound at 0124:59 with the pilot asking immediately does the ship still has steering and he is told yes. Immediately they are calling for the bosun and telling him “Go forward fast.” The bosun is told to prepare and later at 0127:14 to drop the anchor.\nAt 0126 the pilot is heard making the first call telling the port to close the bridge and 30 seconds later he is calling asking if the McAllister tug is still in the area. When he reaches the tug and realizes they are out of distance, he tells the master “hammer down,” to get back fast implying they need immediate help.\nIn the final moments, the pilot desperately calls out at 0128:59 for full bow thruster to port. The second officer responds, “No. It’s not working.”\nThe anchor chain is heard at 0128:59. Six seconds later the transcript lists “sound of groaning/cringing,” which it speculates is the pilot. Nine seconds later the sound of the bridge collapsing is reported while the transcript shows the pilot and the training shouting expletives.\nIn the moments that follow the officers, crew, and pilot begin to recover and start responding.  Later in the post-accident interviews, the ship’s second officer speculated if they could have allowed the anchor to be dropped earlier and if it would have prevented the allision. The helmsmen, the transcript of his interview shows, would not speculate and said he had no opinion."

        "author": "Intelsat",
        "content": "Denmark was a pioneer in the development of the offshore wind farm energy sector more than 30 years ago and now it has issued the first permits to extend the service life of some of the farms. The decision comes at a critical time as several wind farms are facing the expiration of their original 25-year licenses.\nThe Danish Energy Agency approved the extension of the electricity production permit for the Samsø Offshore Wind Farm by ten years. When the Samsø Offshore Wind Farm was established in 2002, the electricity production permit was limited to 25 years. After that, the wind turbines had to be removed by the plant owner, Wind Estate. The ten-turbine park with a total capacity of 23 MW can produce electricity equivalent to the electricity consumption of 20-25,000 households.\n\"With this decision, Samsø Offshore Wind Farm can continue to produce green electricity rather than being dismantled and decommissioned. It is gratifying for the green transition and sustainable from a resource perspective, as long as the plant can continue to operate in a responsible manner,” said Deputy Director Stig Uffe Pedersen, Danish Energy Agency.\nThe Samsø offshore wind farm the agency notes is almost 25 years old, and it has therefore been important to ensure that the plant's structures can withstand continued production. Wind Estate provided an independent analysis of the remaining service life to the Danish Energy Agency. In addition, the plant owner has agreed to carry out an extended service inspection annually.\nThe granted permit will allow the offshore wind farm to produce electricity for another 10 years until 2037.\n“There are several older offshore wind farms around Denmark that are also approaching their final expiration date. In the coming time, the Danish Energy Agency will assess whether those wind farms can also continue to operate responsibly,” notes Pedersen.\nThe Danish Energy Agency is currently processing applications for an extension of the electricity production permit for the Middelgrunden offshore wind farm, Rønland offshore wind farm, Nysted offshore wind farm, and Horns Rev 1 offshore wind farm.\nThe older farms are smaller which has challenged some of them to remain economically viable. In the Netherlands, Google recently signed anagreement with Shellto buy the electricity from a nearly 20-year-old wind farm. It was pointed out that the private purchase agreement made it possible to extend the life of the wind farm"

        "content": "\nAustralia has announced that it will extend its Pacific Maritime Security Program for the first time sending a patrol boat to an Indian Ocean nation. Australia has previously given patrol boats to 16 Pacific Ocean nations.\nIn the past five years, Australia has been donating Guardian-class boats to nations, as part of its defense initiative to boost maritime security in the South Pacific. Australia’s foreign policy has been focusing on the Pacific Ocean, but this is now widening to strengthen its influence in the Indian Ocean. The patrol boat to Maldives represents a key milestone in this shift.\nAustralian Defense Minister Richard Marles said the Guardian-class patrol boat will help the archipelago be better placed to protect its sovereign waters. In particular, the boat will enable Maldives to have a more persistent presence in its vast exclusive economic zone to deter, detect and disrupt illegal maritime activities.\nAs an archipelago of low-lying islands, the country’s existence is severely threatened by rising sea levels, with the World Bank warning that by 2050, 80 percent of Maldives could become uninhabitable due to global warming.\nThe boat is currently under construction at Austal Australia and is due for completion in 2026. The Guardian-class patrol boats are 39.5 meters (130 feet) long and are designed to have the capability of traveling at a maximum speed of 20 knots and a maximum 3,000 nautical mile range. Each vessel can accommodate up to 23 people.\nThe Minister of Defense of the Maldives Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon, acknowledged the donations describing Australia as a mutual partner in the safety and security of the seas. He said the vessel was part of the country’s president, Mohamed Muizzu’s vision of doubling the strength of the Maldives Coast Guard.\nIn April, Turkey also donated its former TCG Volkan (P343) missile boat to the Maldives Coast Guard. This became the largest defense platform for the coast guard, whose fleet largely consists of patrol boats and landing craft.\nAustralia is building a total of 24 vessels gifting them to 16 nations. The Guardian-class vessels are replacing the existing 22 Pacific Patrol Boats gifted to 12 Pacific Island countries between 1987 and 1997. The first vessel was delivered to Papua New Guinea in 2018 and last year number 21 went to Tuvalu and 22 was sent to Fiji.\nApart from gifting Maldives one of the boats, Australia will also gift a multi-beam echo sounder to the island nation. The hydrographic equipment will support the country’s capability to map its ocean floor, helping to ensure maritime safety and unlock economic development."

Delivery of the new vessel took place in South Korea seventeen months after the naming of the first ship in the class.\nThe newest isAxel Maersk, named after Axel Poul Peder Maersk Uggla, a grandson of Ane Maersk Mc-Kinney Uggla, chair of the A.P. Moller Foundation and the naming inspiration for the first vessel of the class. Maersk went with names starting with “A” for the entire class,Ane,Alette, Antonia,Alexandra, Alva, Astrid,Angelica,A.P. Møller,Axel,Albert, Adrian, andArthur Maersk.\nThe ships were all built at the HD Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard in Ulsan where the final vessel was named on May 27. She came two months afterAdrian Maerskwas named in Rotterdam. The vessels are all being deployed on the company’s new East-West Network established for the Gemini Cooperation with Hapag-Lloyd.Adrian Maerskthe company reported would be sailing Asia to the Mediterranean while others in the class are sailing to Northern Europe. Axel Maersk departed for Shanghai, where it is due on June 4 on its maiden voyage.\nEach of the ships is 189,500 dwt and approximately 337 meters (1,105 feet) in length with a capacity of 16,000 TEU. MAN Energy Solutions developed the dual-fuel engine which is designed for methanol or gas and can use traditional methanol as well as the future e-methanol or bio-methanol as it becomes available in sufficient quantities. They are registered in Denmark.\nMaersk wrote online in announcing the delivery, “We’re proud to be onboard the enter transition. The journey continues …”\nThis year Maersk is scheduled to also take delivery on six additional dual-fuel methanol containerships. It placed a follow-on order with HD Hyundai in October 2022 for the additional vessels. While they will be similar to the first series the company reports the second series will have a nominal capacity of approximately 17,000 TEU for each vessel.\nThe ships are part of a large fleet modernization effort Maersk announced in 2024. It had previously ordered from Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group six 9,000 TEU dual-fuel methanol vessels for delivery in 2026 and 2027. In the second half of 2024, it completed orders for a total of 20 dual-fuel vessels with a total capacity of 300,000 TEU. The order was split between Yangzijiang Shipbuilding and New Times Shipbuilding in China and Hanwha Ocean in South Korea. The vessels will each be equipped with liquified gas dual-fuel propulsion systems, although in August 2024 the company noted it had elected a mix of methanol and liquified gas dual-fuel propulsion systems as it waits for the development of production and supply chains for bio-methanol to be developed."

The crew was rescued uninjured by passing merchant ships while the U.S. Coast Guard Alaska was coordinating the effort.\nThe vessel, which is managed by London-based Zodiac Maritime, is reported to be carrying around 3,000 vehicles, 800 of which are electric vehicles. It was heading from China to Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico. Lloyd’s is reporting the vessel is operating under charter to China’s SAIC Anji Logistics.\n“Smoke was initially seen emanating from a deck carrying electric vehicles,” reported a spokesperson for Zodiac Maritime. “The crew immediately initiated emergency firefighting procedures using the vessel’s onboard fire suppression systems. However, despite their efforts, the situation could not be brought under control.”\nIn consultation with the United States Coast Guard, the 22 crew abandoned the vessel using its lifeboat. They are reported to be aboard a nearby merchant vessel, while Zodiac reports it is working closely with emergency responders with a tug being deployed to support salvage and firefighting operations.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Alaska reported that aircrews were en route to Adak, Alaska in the Aleutians and that a USCG cutter was traveling to the area.\nMorning Midas(12,250 dwt) is a Liberian-flagged Pure Car and Truck Carrier (PCTC), built in 2006 in China at Xiamen Shipbuilding Industry. The vessel was cited during a port state inspection in Bremerhaven in October 2024 for unspecified issues with fire safety and launching arrangements for rescue boats, but it did not result in a detention. A subsequent standard inspection in Portland, Oregon by the U.S. Coast Guard in January 2025 found no issues with the vessel.\nElectric vehicles have been a constant concern for the shipping industry with numerous reports of car fires. The fires are more difficult to handle because of the batteries prompting insurers and the industry to issue specific warnings about the handling of EVs. They have been believed to be the source of several other fires aboard ships."

The vessel was acquired from an Edison Chouest Offshore subsidiary, with the USCG reporting it was undergoing modifications to “enhance communications and self-defense capabilities.”\nThe icebreaker was acquired after a long lobbying effort with the USCG taking possession on December 20, 2024. She is being used as a stopgap to expand the capabilities of the USCG which currently depends on two aging polar icebreakers along with 21 domestic icebreakers and 16 ice-capable buoy tenders. USCG reports thatStoriswill expand the U.S. operational presence in the Arctic and support Coast Guard missions while the service awaits the delivery of the Polar Security Cutter class. The first of the newbuilds has been delayed multiple times with the current projected delivery in 2030.\nThe Coast Guard has told Congress that to fulfill its mission and meet operational needs in the polar regions, it requires a fleet of eight to nine polar icebreakers. President Donald Trump announced his intent to acquire at least 40 new icebreakers.\n\n\n\nBuilt in 2012 by North American Shipbuilding Company in Larose, Louisiana and LaShip in Houma, Louisiana asAiviq, the vessel was initially chartered by Royal Dutch Shell to support oil exploration and drilling in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska. She displaces approximately 15,000 tons and is a Polar Class 3-equivalent icebreaker with a length of approximately 360 feet (110 meters).\nShe spent long periods in lay-up or had been operating under charter before the latest effort for the USCG to acquire the ship. The USCG highlights the acquisition was made possible through the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022 and fiscal year 2024 appropriations. It does not affect the ongoing procurement of polar security cutters and is not part of that program.\n\n\n\nWhile the vessel is underway for the USCG, they report that the service will continue evaluating the cutter's condition and requirements to achieve full operational capability.Storisis currently commanded by Capt. Keith M. Ropella, who currently serves as chief of cutter forces at Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington D.C., and previously commanded Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star from July 2022 to July 2024. The vessel is manned with a hybrid crew consisting of military cuttermen and civilian mariners.\nStoriswill be commissioned in August in Juneau, Alaska, which will eventually be the vessel’s permanent homeport. Until the necessary shore infrastructure improvements are completed in Juneau,Storiswill be temporarily berthed in Seattle, Washington, with the Service's two other polar icebreakers."

It is the latest in a series of efforts launched by Ukraine attempting to prosecute mariners for their role in the incidents or for operating vessels transporting grain and other materials in the Russian-occupied regions.\nAccording to the reports, Ukraine is charging the captain with spilling 1,500 tons of fuel as part of a larger oil leak from a tanker that it says was in Ukrainian waters. They did not specify the name of the tanker or the captain, but it relates to the two Russian river sea tankers lost in December 2024 in the Kerch Strait. Ukraine in the court papers is reportedly estimating the damages at $480 million.\n“The suspect, contrary to the usual seafaring requirements, did not take into account the weather conditions in the waters of the Azov and Black Seas, as well as in the Kerch Strait, which led to the accident,\" the prosecutor charges. They said the vessel was transporting 4,000 tonnes of M-100 fuel from Volgograd to Kavkaz with the accusation the fuel was to be transferred to an ocean-going shadow fleet tanker.\nThe river sea tankerVolgoneft 212sank in a wintertime storm in December 2024 transporting 4,300 tonnes of oil. A second tanker of the same operator,Volgoneft 239, ran aground around the same time in the area near the Kerch bridge.\nUkraine reported that oil was drifting ashore at various points in the Black Sea prompting a large-scale cleanup in the winter after the incident. Environmentalists warned it would be more difficult to clean up because of winter storms.\nIn the past, Ukraine has detained and sought to prosecute crews for entering the ports of occupied Crimea and transporting grain or other materials that it alleges were stolen from Ukraine. In the summer of 2024, they seized a cargo ship namedUsko Mfuregistered in Cameroon while it was sailing near the port of Reni on the Danube. The courts ordered the vessel seized and last fall Ukraine reported it was prosecuting the ship’s officers for entering Sevastopol. In April 2025, Ukraine reported seizing another cargo vessel they accursed of looting grain from Crimea.\nIn the current case, it is unclear if the prosecutor named a specific individual. Clearly, the captain would have been charged in absentia and it is unclear if they are also attempting to file charges against the owner of the Volgoneft tankers."

The group put out an urgent appeal for help after it detected a drone only to later retract it after it was confirmed to have been a surveillance drone from Greece.\nThe group of a dozen people aboard the sailboatBarcarole, which they are callingMadleen, includes Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, actor Liam Cunningham, and member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan. They have been using social media to post videos and pictures as they make their way across the Mediterranean. They showed them enjoying time in the sun on deck and singing protest songs.\nLate Tuesday night the tone however briefly changed as they posted scared pictures after donning lifejackets. According to their reports, the boat was approximately 40 nautical miles outside of Greek waters when the incident occurred.\n“We can clearly see a drone to our left. It’s gaining on us a little bit. Please share this alert.” they said in a panicked video. “Please share our location.”\nThey reported the drone was briefly overhead and then departed. They later confirmed it was a Heron surveillance drone from the Hellenic Coast Guard. Greece regularly patrols its region as it monitors movements especially because of the strong influx of small migrant boats in the region.\n\nFrom Forensic Architecture:Helenic Coast Guard Heron drone was seen active close to your location a couple of hours ago - ADSB hasn't updated assets location since 20:30 pm.It did a similar trajectory the last couple of days.pic.twitter.com/RmsXNzSgOU\n\nThe Freedom Flotilla Coalition has accused Israel of attacking its first boat, a larger excursion vessel brought from Germany to make the trip. The group has reported it was struck by two projectiles while it was near Malta and disabled. The Maltese government confirmed a fire aboard the vessel.\nThe group set off on Sunday, June 1, aboard the 18-meter (59-foot) sailing vessel. They have said it will take about a week to reach Gaza. Aboard they have a symbolic amount of relief supplies which they said include baby formula, flour, rice, diapers, sanitary products, water desalination kits, medical supplies, crutches, and children’s prosthetics.\nThe mission is about calling attention to the situation and symbolically breaching the Israeli-imposed blockade of Gaza. The boat, which is registered in the UK, is decorated with and defiantly flying the flag of Palestine.\nIsraeli officials have not said how they will deal with this specific incursion. Media reports are quoting the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Force saying the “IDF is prepared to operate on all fronts, including the maritime arena. We will act accordingly.”\nThe sailboat’s AIS signal shows that it is currently south of Crete moving at approximately 6 knots. They have not entered a destination on the AIS signal.\n"

        "content": "South Africa’s Department of Transport has announced what is being called the first definitive steps toward executing the plan for establishing a national shipping line. The concept has been discussed for nearly a decade but the newly named in 2024 director of the department, Barbara Creecy, has now spelled out the steps to making the South African National Shipping Company (SASCO) a reality.\nLike many countries, South Africa cites its near total dependence on foreign shipping companies for its imports and exports. The government is seeking to reverse what it calls negative growth in import and export trade which has persisted since the 1980s. It believes the lack of a national shipping carrier is a factor. The plan calls for reducing or ending dependence on foreign carriers and increasing South Africa’s maritime sovereignty.\nOfficials point out that South Africa is the only nation in the BRICS alliance (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) that does not have a national shipping company. The closest the country had was Safmarine which was established at the end of World War II and ran till being sold to Maersk in 1999. Maersk ended the brand name and all ties to the South African flag in 2020.\nSouth Africa is far from alone in expressing the desire to recreate its merchant marine. Countries in Asia have discussed similar efforts while the Australian government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has begun the process of restoring its national operations. Even the United States under Donald Trump is highlighting the need to rebuild its merchant marine.\nSouth Africa’s Department of Transportation invited interested parties to submit proposals to join a steering committee that it will launch for the new national shipping company. Media reports are that the invite was sent internationally and includes some of the leading global shipping companies. The purpose of the committee will be to develop the business model. It will include members from the Department of Transportation, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, and other relevant stakeholders.\nThe government published its Comprehensive Maritime Transport Policy in 2017 and undertook enacting legislation in 2022. One of the pillars of the police calls for “establishing a national shipping carrier as a strategic pillar in the revival of the maritime transport industry.”\nIn prevision discussions on the formation of SASCO, the government has said it would look at both new construction and the acquisition of ships or companies. All the vessels will be flagged in South Africa. It has proposed focusing on four segments starting with containerships but also crude and chemical carriers, dry bulk carriers, and bunker barges.\nThe official notice for the formation of the steering committee was released on May 30. It gives 30 days for a response."

        "content": "\nThe Texas Port of Corpus Christi is moving to cement its leadership in energy exports highlighting the recent completion of a massive $625 million channel improvement project. The port says the project was three decades in the making, but that it positions it as the U.S. gears to increase hydrocarbon exports reinvigorated by President Donald Trump’s policies.\nCorpus Christi highlights that the port is already a leading U.S. energy export gateway and a major economic engine of Texas and the nation. The Port of Corpus Christi is the third-largest port in the United States in total waterborne tonnage and the port authority reports it moves more than 2.4 million barrels per day of crude oil to points outside the U.S. The port is also the second-largest U.S. gateway for liquefied natural gas exports.\nThe Channel Improvement Project saw the deepening of the Corpus Christi Ship Channel from 47 feet mean lower low water (MLLW) to 54 feet MLLW. It also involved the widening of the channel from 400 to 530 feet with additional barge shelves. The project was conceived 35 years ago and was implemented in four phases, with construction commencing in 2017.\nPhase 1 involved digging the channel from the Gulf of Mexico to Harbor Island while Phase 2 entailed dredging from Harbor Island to the west of the La Quinta junction. For Phase 3, dredging works saw the channel extended from La Quinta to Chemical TB with the last phase entailing the deepening and widening of the channel from Chemical TB to Viola TB. Overall, the project improved approximately 11.9 miles of the channel.\nAbout five million cubic yards of dredged material from the project went into restoring marshes in the Corpus Christi and Nueces bays. It also constructed a 2,000-foot breakwater—to tie into a currently planned 4,000-foot breakwater—in the Nueces Delta.\nBeing a capital-intensive undertaking, the project was funded through Corpus Christi's internal resources, federal budget allocated by Congress, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and private marine companies.\nThe newly expanded waterway is expected to facilitate safe, navigable commerce for larger vessels and two-way traffic, enabling more efficient transport of crude oil, LNG, and other commodities. By enabling the movement of larger vessels including very large crude carriers, exporters are projected to save in excess of $200 million in annual transportation costs.\nCompletion of the project comes when Corpus Christi is recording steady growth in cargo throughput. During the first quarter of this year, the port recorded a five percent increase in throughput, moving 51.3 million tonnes of commodities. The increase was driven primarily by a surge in crude oil and LNG shipments. Crude oil shipments increased by 10.5 percent to 33.4 million tonnes while LNG volumes were up 12.3 percent to 4.3 million tons. Increases were also recorded in dry bulk and breakbulk commodities. In 2024, the port moved a record 206.5 million tonnes of cargo.\nHouston a competing port to Corpus Christi located further northeast on the Gulf Coast also recently reported that it will be expanding its channel. In May its port commission reported that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) released its FY25 work plan, which includes $33 million allocated to the Houston Ship Channel Expansion, known as Project 11. Dredging activities are proceeding for another segment of Houston’s channel due to be completed by late Q2 or early Q3 2025.\nThe expansion of the ports’ capabilities will play another key part in the plan to grow the U.S. industry. Work is also underway on new LNG terminals to increase U.S. exports."

The group analyzed commercial satellite imagery reporting the vessel appeared to be upright less than two weeks after it partially submerged when a planned sideways launch malfunctioned.\nAccording to the analysts at38 North, the helipad markings of the destroyer are now visible in the June 2 imagery meaning the vessel is once again upright. Images in late May showed the vessel tipped on its side with its bow still on land and the stern in the water. In another image from May 29, 38 North reports workers can be seen pulling tethers and they presumed barrage balloons were also being employed in the manual effort to right the vessel.\nThe current images show the vessel with its bow still on land and the stern in the water. Reports said that the supreme leader Kim Jong Un had ordered the immediate salvaging of the vessel to save face for the country and set an end-of-June deadline for the repairs.\n\nCommercial satellite imagery shows that the Choe Hyun class destroyer at Chongjin has been returned to an upright position.https://t.co/vzjsinZoqI\n\n38 North believes the bow of the vessel has been damaged and notes the shipyard lacks a large enough floating drydock to repair the ship. They speculate that with the bow remaining on shore, the yard will attempt repairs with the vessel in this position.\nNorth Korean media outlet KCNA however reported the ship was only \"scratched\" on the starboard side, without any \"bulge on the bottom of the ship.\" They asserted that there was only very limited flooding in a \"rescue passage\" at the stern.\n\nNorth Korea’s latest naval destroyer has been significantly damaged prior to its launch. In a rare acknowledgment, North Korea's state news agency KCNA reported yesterday an incident occurred with a new destroyer in Chongjin, which was close to being launched.pic.twitter.com/0PfuqehYnF\n\nKim called the launch failure \"a criminal act\" and said there would be \"political accountability\" for the disgrace to the country. The central media in North Korea later reported that three managers for the project - the workshop head and chief engineer at the yard, as well as a midlevel administrative official - had been arrested.\nThe manager of the Chongjin Yard, Hong Kil Ho, was also summoned for questioning while Ri Hyong Son, a director in the Munitions Industry Department, was arrested. KCNA reported that Ri was \"greatly responsible\" for the accident."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nJapanese parliament has passed an amendment bill that will allow offshore wind projects in the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The government initially introduced this legal reform in January 2024, with hopes of unlocking over 4 million square kilometers of Japanese EEZ for renewable energy development. Currently, Japan’s wind farms are installed in territorial and internal waters.\nAccording to the Japan Wind Power Association (JWPA), the country’s EEZ has the potential to support up to 552 GW of offshore wind capacity. Most of this power will come from deep-water floating turbines.\nSome of the key features of the bill include the designation of EEZ areas for offshore wind development. It mandates the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) to establish a council to coordinate projects in consultation with relevant stakeholders. In addition, the bill provides for streamlined government-led environmental assessment procedures to safeguard biodiversity.\n“This is great news. Congratulations to the Japanese government for making this possible. Scaling up floating wind is important for increasing Japan’s energy autonomy and resilience,” said Rebecca Williams, Deputy CEO at the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC).\nJapan has set a national target of installing 10GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, and 30-40 GW by 2040. However, due to factors such as inflation and depreciation of the yen, the business environment for offshore wind development has been greatly affected. This has seen companies such as Mitsubishi announce a review of their projects in Japan, significantly slowing the installation pace. Shell has also recently cut its team focused on Japan's offshore wind energy sector as the company scales back its low-carbon operations.\nThese challenges have led the government to introduce legal reforms in the sector, in the hope of wooing developers. Besides the EEZ bill, there are reports that Japan is reconsidering a number of offshore wind regulations to reduce risks and cut the cost of projects. One key change is extending project durations to 40 years from the current 30 years. In addition, there is a proposal to relax cabotage laws to allow non-Japanese flagged ships to operate in offshore wind farm areas.\nWind energy plays a key part in the government’s energy plan. Japan looks to phase out its use of coal. Work has begun on the country’s first large-scale offshore project while the government has established a goal is for 10 GW by 2030 and 45 GW by 2040 from offshore wind."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The government of Spain has voted to extend an existing financial support program designed to encourage the country’s shipbuilding and repair industry. The Ministry of Industry reports it is a well-received program and helped the Spanish shipbuilding industry to build an order book that is the highest it has been in more than a decade.\nThe government provides a subsidy program to compensate the shipyards and others in the industry for the interest rate paid on loads during the construction and repair process. According to the Ministry, the program supports the industry by providing greater certainty and stability in the planning process for projects.\nThe program is being extended to run through the end of 2029 with the government committing to provide a total of €559 million ($638 million) to encourage the construction and conversion of ships in the country's shipyards. The program provides up to one percent point in compensation to credit institutions to cover the difference between the interest rate applied to loans granted to shipowners, shipyards, and third parties, and the reference commercial interest rate.\nAccording to the Ministry, the program provided €41.14 million ($47 million) in support to the industry in 2024. They believe this contributed to 2024 being an exceptional year for the Spanish shipyards. The industry registered 40 new contracts work over €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion).\n“The government values the importance of the naval industry for our country and is committed to the diversification, modernization, and productivity of the Spanish naval ecosystem,” said the Ministry.\nAmong the companies that have benefitted from the program are two of Spain’s largest shipbuilders, PYMAR group which represents yards across northern Spain and Navantia. The Ministry reports the two yards have more than 100 initiatives underway and received grants worth €58 million ($66 million).\nThe Ministry highlights that Spain has a range of programs to support the development of the domestic shipbuilding industry. This includes the Fund to Support Productive Industrial Investment (FAIIP), the Active Financing program, the Naval Research, Development and Innovation Line (IDI), and aid to Innovative Business Groups (AEIs).\nThe industry closed 2024 with its orderbook at its highest level since 2011. The Ministry reports Spain’s private shipyards had 65 vessels under construction at the end of 2024. They report that this is generating more than 14 million working hours."

The unique floating wind farm is the first in France and across the entire Mediterranean basin and the companies believe it will be a model to advance the next phase of offshore wind energy.\nThe project has been under discussion since 2011 as they worked to involve all the key stakeholders and develop the pioneering technology. It was selected by the state in 2016 and also received support from the European Union. An independent committee was also established in 2022 to monitor the program and bring together scientific experts.\nThe resulting Provence Grand Large wind farm is a pilot project with three floating wind turbines installed 17 km (approximately 10.5 miles) off the coast of Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône. It has a capacity of 25 MW. It was developed through a partnership between EDF Renewables, Enbridge, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments).\nBernard Fontana, Chairman and CEO of EDF, called it an important project for the country's energy sovereignty. He said the pilot farm is actively participating in France's energy transition while supporting the emergence of a cutting-edge industrial sector with innovative technologies.\nThe installation relies on a unique anchoring technology. Built by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, the farm's three wind turbines are installed on floats with taut anchor lines inspired by a technology used to stabilize oil platforms. Developed by SBM Offshore and IFP Energies Nouvelles, they report the technology is suitable for deep-sea areas and provides excellent float stability. It however is the first adaptation for offshore wind turbine floats.\nBuilt by Prysmian, the dynamic cables, which adapt to the movements of the floats, transport the electricity produced by the Provence Grand Large wind turbines. Connected to underwater and then onshore cables, they ensure the transmission of the generated electricity to the onshore connection station operated by RTE.\nEDF says the experience from this project will be invaluable in carrying out the construction of its second floating offshore wind farm, Méditerranée Grand Large, for which it was awarded the contract in December 2024. This next project will be developed in partnership with Maple Power. The future Grand Large wind farm in the Mediterranean will be located 25 km (15.5 miles) off the Mediterranean coast with a capacity of approximately 250 MW.\nThe French government has set a target of a total capacity of 45 GW from offshore wind farms. Its plan aims to commission around 50 offshore wind farms by 2050.\nEDF Renewables with Maple Power and its shareholders highlights it developed and commissioned France's first offshore wind farm with a capacity of 480 MW, the Fécamp offshore wind farm, off the coast of Saint Nazaire. They are also building the Calvados offshore wind farm (450 MW) and developing the Dunkirk (600 MW) and Manche Normandie (1 GW) offshore wind farms."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. government released the official data for trade numbers, imports, and exports, for April confirming what port officials said that volumes were plunging due to the tariffs but it also created a record decline in the U.S. trade deficit. The data came as Donald Trump spoke with China’s leader Xi Jinping and later told reporters both sides were going on the terms of a trade deal.\nTrump launched the trade war and tariffs to close the U.S. trade deficit and the numbers for April show the first effects. The U.S. trade deficit was down by half to $61.6 billion, the lowest in 19 months. The good trade deficit was down by more than 46 percent to $87.4 billion.\nAnalysts highlighted that shippers had rushed to move goods, especially imports into the U.S. in the first quarter to get ahead of the tariffs, a point that was confirmed by major ports which reported strong volumes. However, in April and May ports such as Los Angeles reported volumes were dropping quickly reaching a level 30 percent below 2024 levels.\nThe U.S. government data confirmed this with imports off more than 16 percent in April and specifically goods off nearly 20 percent. The data showed a $3.5 billion decline in the imports of household goods including cellphones and other electronics. Industrial supplies and materials were also off dramatically ($23 billion) as well as growing declines in vehicles, parts, and engines.\nA positive note for ports and the economy is that good exports grew to a record $190 billion in April. This included industrial supplies, materials, finished metals, and crude oil.\nSpeaking with reports in the Oval Office later on Thursday, Trump said he had a good call with China’s leader about trade and that both sides were reviewing the terms of an agreement. He said “We have a deal,” but that is being interpreted to mean the agreement which delayed the tariffs of talks as China in its official readout said more talks would follow. Trump said reciprocal invitations had been extended and that he and Xi Jinping would be visiting each other in the future.\nAll of this came as Alphaliner reported today that volumes through the Panama Canal were at all-time highs in the first five months of the year. Its analysis shows that containership traffic set a record with over 1,200 crossings in both directions of the canal. It said this is up 10 percent year-over-year and four percent over the previous best in 2022. Alphaliner said the increase was driven by smaller, Neo Sub-Panamax vessels (7,500 to 10,000 TEU).\nAnalysts have speculated without the announcement of a formal trade deal between the U.S. and China shippers would rush volumes into the United States during the previously announced 90-day pause. Carriers were reported to already be repositioning vessels to meet demand from China. This comes after the U.S. ports said that they were seeing the first large numbers of blanked sailings for May and June since the early days of the pandemic in 2020."

While the company has a long heritage in passenger shipping, cruising has been a small part of the Japanese leisure industry with only theNippon Maruconsistently operating in the market with other ships coming and going over her 35-year career.\nNippon Maru(22,472 gross tons) was built in 1990 by Mitsubishi for MOL to maintain a presence in the cruise business but was only marketed in Japan. It continued the company’s passenger operations which trace back to the 1880s and the founding of the predecessor companies Osaka Shosen and Mitsui Sensen, which operated trans-Pacific passenger services into the 1960s. MOL converted to cruising in 1972 and in response to the rising demand in Japan for leisure cruises decided to buy and then build modern cruise ships.\nTheNippon Maruremained very popular in part because she offered cruises around the Japanese islands reaching smaller ports not accessible to larger cruise ships. She offered a focus on cultural enrichment and traditional Japanese culture.\n“With full hearts and deep gratitude, we bid a bittersweet farewell toNippon Maru, which has served us well for over 35 years,” said Tsunemichi Mukai, President of Mitsui Ocean Cruises, a new brand launched in 2024 to carry on the company’s cruise operations. “Though a difficult decision, it is time to retire her for operational and economic reasons. We're excited to carry on her legacy of fine hospitality aboard our new luxury ships,Mitsui Ocean Fujiand our recently announced second ship, where many of our cherished crew will continue to serve.”\nThe ship, which will be officially retired on May 10, 2026, in Yokohama, has since traveled 2,877,642 nautical miles or approximately 133 times around the earth. She operated over 2,000 cruises, hosting more than 600,000 passengers, and visiting over 400 ports in and out of Japan. In addition to her domestic cruises, she operated longer voyages including nine world cruises.\nMOL reports the legacy ofNippon Maruand her contribution to the Japanese cruise industry will be honored during her final season between February and May 2026, with several cruises and events, featuring special commemorative gifts and menus.\n\n\nNippon Maru (right) is being replaced with Mitsui Ocean Fuji (left) and a sister ship also acquired from Carnival Corporation' Seabourn (MOL)\n\nThe company is continuing with its plan to diversify the commercial shipping operation expanding passenger service both with cruises and ferries. In late 2022, the company revealed plans to build two 35,000 gross ton cruise ships and while it continues to study construction options, it acquired theSeabourn Odyssey(32,500 gross tons) from Carnival Corporation’s Seabourn Cruise Line and relaunched it at the end of 2024 as theMitsui Ocean Fuji. In March 2025, it was revealed that they had made a strong cash offer and agreed to acquire a sister ship,Seabourn Sojourn(32,500 gross tons), also from Carnival Corporation for delivery in May 2026. The new cruise line is marketing the acquired ships and is expanding marketing into the international market as it seeks to develop Japan’s role in the cruise industry.\nMOL’s expansion into the international market comes as the Japanese cruise market is growing. NYK recently took delivery on a newly-built cruise ship namedAsuka IIIfrom Meyer Werft in Germany. The ship enters service in July.\nJapan’s Ryobi Holdings, a diversified company that includes operations in transportation and tourism, also announced plans at the end of 2023 to enter the cruise market. It ordered a luxury, yacht cruise ship to be built in Portugal for delivery in 2027."

Production for the vessel began in 2021 at HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, but the project has been dogged by concerns.\nIngalls had a sole source contract as the only builder for the class which began delivering in 2008 and was designed to replace 12 aging 378?foot Hamilton-class high-endurance cutters that have been in service for 40 years. At 418 feet long, the Legend-class NSC has a maximum speed of 28 knots and a range of 12,000 nautical miles. The tenth ship, USCG Calhoun was delivered in October 2023.\nWork had begun for number 11 in May 2021. HII reported that the start of fabrication signified the first 100 tons of steel had been cut. USCG said the vessel was due for delivery in 2024 and plans called for it to be homeported in Charleston, South Carolina with four other Legend-class cutters.\n“Huntington Ingalls owed us this cutter over a year ago,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. “This project was over time and over budget. Now the money can be redirected to ensuring the Coast Guard remains the finest, most-capable maritime service in the world.”\nAccording to the announcement for Homeland Security, canceling the contract with HII will save the U.S. over $260 million. They have also agreed that the Coast Guard will receive $135 million in parts that will be used to retrofit, upgrade, and maintain the Coast Guard’s existing fleet of 10 Legend-class cutters.\nCongress has been highly critical of the USCG’s problems with its shipbuilding projects both for the cutters and the Polar Security Icebreakers. USCG had reported to Congress that there were issues with the project saying that construction of the 11th ship had been halted since at least November 2024 with the ship 15 percent complete. It blamed “material conformance concerns,” and said that the Coast Guard and the shipbuilder were working to resolve the issue.\nThe Coast Guard has also planned a 12th vessel in the Legand-class. Congress was yet to appropriate funds for the vessel but some long-lead elements were reportedly being ordered.\nHomeland Security highlights canceling the project will save money that can be used as part of the recently announced Force Design 2028 project to overhaul USCG operations and command structure. However, it did not address how the USCG will allocate resources for the two planned vessels which were scheduled as replacements for the older class which is now entirely decommissioned. The USCG had deferred the decommissioning of the last two Hamilton-class cutters,John MidgetandDouglas Munro, to 2020 and 2021 while the rest of the class was replaced with the new cutters by 2018."

The authorities highlight the investigation is still ongoing but have served notice and are detaining one crewmember on suspicion of gross negligence in maritime traffic. They also reported a crewmember was being investigated for drunkenness.\nThe Coast Guard feared an oil leak from the 69,000 liters of fuel oil aboard after a breach was discovered in one of the vessel’s ballast tanks. They reported the tank had flooded complicating salvage efforts. On June 3, the salvage company hired by the owners began offloading a portion of the cargo to an adjacent barge.\nThe vessel was refloated late on Wednesday night with the Coast Guard standing by in case of an oil spill or pollution. Three Coast Guard vessels supervised the operation while tugs worked to free the ship and accompanied it to port. It sailed under its own power reaching Malmö early Thursday where it was docked. The vessel will undergo a further inspection while prosecutors proceed with the investigation regarding the actions of the crew.\nTo the north also along the Øresund fairway another bulker,Meshkagroundedon May 30 also after deviating out of the shipping lane.

A salvage company is working on a plan which must be approved by the Swedish authorities.\nSweden continues to investigate the circumstances of the second vessel’s grounding. The Coast Guard reports notice was also filed with one crewmember for gross negligence in navigation but unlike the crew ofAli Aykinthe crew was tested for alcohol and there was no indication that it was involved in the grounding.

The vessel grounded and partially sunk damaging at least 75 meters (approximately 250 feet) of precious Blue and Deer Coral and has the potential to leak oil into the environment.\nThe wooden 100-tonne cargo ship namedAyar Linnsank on Sunday, June 1, after grounding on the reef in the Mu Ko Surin National Park in the Surin Islands of the Andaman Sea. Thai officials report it is one of the most famous diving and marine life viewing sites in the world. It is within the National Parks in Thailand.\nThe vessel stranded off Jak Bay in the northern parts of the province and then sank spilling its cargo onto the reef. It has 7,700 liters of diesel onboard.\n\n\n\nDivers were sent to inspect the region and report a 75-meter trench of damage in the reef with the worst portions being between meters 45 and 75, where the vessel is now stuck. The coral under the vessel has been crushed and a line of coral, especially the tall species, was broken. In addition, the vessel spilled bags of cement as well as significant amounts of cardboard, rags, truck tires, hoses, and other debris that is littered on the reef.\nThe divers were initially attempting to seal the values on the fuel tanks. Efforts were also underway to pump the fuel from the partially submerged vessel. The Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation working with other agencies called for oil booms that could also be strung to contain any fuel leaks.\n\n\n\nThey said a full salvage mission can not be carried out at this time because it is monsoon season. The danger of strong waves and winds makes any salvage operation risky. They are working with the other authorities to develop an approach for managing the situation.\nThe Kuraburi Police Station is also collecting relevant evidence as well as checking the ship’s documents, and entry and exit from the country. They are planning to lodge a complaint against the owner of the vessel and seek compensation.\nThe authorities are also asking citizens and tourists to avoid approaching the area for safety and to allow the recovery operation to proceed.\n\n"

While saying the 5,000-ton destroyer requires re-examination, they are predicting the vessel will be fully repaired by the end of the month when the Central Committee of the Party convenes for its 12th plenary session.\n“The next stage of detailed restoration work will be carried out at the dry dock of the Rajin Ship Repair Plant, and the work period is expected to be 7 to 10 days,” reports KCNA. They said the next phase would begin after the experts complete a re-examination of the overall condition of the destroyer’s hull. They reported the balance had been restored at the beginning of June and the vessel moved to a dock by the afternoon of June 5.\nKCNA has repeatedly asserted that the damage was less than originally reported and that the vessel would be quickly repaired. The official report was that the detailed underwater and internal inspection found no “crater,” but that the starboard side of the hull was “scratched and a certain amount of seawater had flooded into the structural passage in the stern.”\nExperts had estimated that it would take two to three days to pump out the seawater from the flooded compartment and then 10 days to restore balance to the ship.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was on hand and angrily announced “This accident has brought down the dignity and pride of our country in an instant,” reported KCNA.  The accident was called “an unacceptable criminal act,” with KCNA announcing that “those responsible can never cover up their crimes.”\nThe official account said it was due to “immature command and carelessness in the operation,” that caused the parallel movement not to be regulated. The stern was released first, which they said stranded the ship and caused it to lose balance.\nKCNA announced on May 26 the arrest of Ri Hyong-son, deputy director of the Munitions Industry Department, saying he was largely responsible for the serious accident. The previous day it had reported the arrest of the chief engineer of Cheongjin Shipyard, Kang Jeong-cheol, the head of the shipbuilding assembly shop, Han Gyeong-hak, and the administrative manager, Kim Yong-hak.

Egypt marked the occasion as it again attempts to rebuild traffic in the canal following the attacks of the Houthis in 2023 and 2024 that chased away most vessels.\nEgypt announced its latest efforts in May reporting it would offer large containerships a 15 percent discount on fees. The 90-day promotion was an attempt to lure the major east-west traffic between Asia and Europe into the canal. The Suez Canal Authority also hosted a meeting with representatives of the major carriers reporting that they were receptive to restoring the diverted routes.\nThe commander of the EU effort to protect ships, Rear Admiral Vasileios Gyparis of the Hellenic Navy who overseas EUNAVFOR Aspides told Reuters traffic is up 60 percent from the low point in August 2024. He reported they are seeing 36 to 37 ships a day up from a low of around 20 a day. However, he admitted to Reuters that it is still below the 72 to 75 a day before the Houthis launched their attacks in late 2023.\nSimilarly, the Suez Canal has not announced its current daily average. In August 2022, however, it highlighted a new record of 89 vessels making the passage in a single day. It typically averaged over 60 vessels a day.\n\n\nHMS Prince of Wales and its carrier strike group transited the Suez Canal on May 24 (Royal Navy)\nThe lack of the return is despite the Houthis not having attacked a merchant ship in 2025, although they continue to assert that they will attack any vessel associated with Israel. They suspended all attacks when the Gaza ceasefire went into effect in January but resumed targeting U.S. warships when the U.S. unleashed a barrage at the orders of Donald Trump in March. The U.S. announced a ceasefire in May and despite reports the Houthis were rearming, they have not fired on ships, including there were no reports of attacks as the UK sent the carrier HMS Prince of Wales and her carrier group through the region in recent days.\nThe Aspides commander told Reuters the operation has “provided close protection to 476 ships, shot down 18 drones, destroyed two remote-controlled boats, and intercepted four ballistic missiles.” Aspides began its patrols in February 2024. As of mid-May, it marked 15 months saying it had supported more than 830 merchant vessels.\n\n\nITS Andrea Doria providing close protection to merchant ships in the Red Sea (EUNAVFOR Aspidtes)\n\nAspides reports that it continues its close protection operations with the EU extending its mission at least to February 28, 2026. It highlighted at the end of May, a French frigate in the operation escorted both a tanker and a CMA CGM containership. ITSAndrea Doria, an Italian Navy destroyer, took a Linea Messina containership and several CMA CGM vessels through the region also in late May.\nCMA CGM, however, told The New York Times in a story appearing today that it was “sending a small number of vessels through the Red Sea.” It said it did not plan to resume transits through the Suez Canal on a large scale in the short term, “unless security conditions allow it.” The New York Times reports tracking sites showed at least five CMA CGM vessels transiting the Red Sea in recent weeks.\nOther major carriers have also said they have no short-term plans to resume their normal routes. CEO of AP Moller-Maersk, Vincent Clerc said, The New York Times highlights, that he thought it is still far from the threshold to return to the Red Sea routing."

        "content": "A former master in the U.S. merchant marine has been arraigned on charges that he sexually assaulted a cadet from the U.S. Merchant Marie Academy assigned to the bulker he was commanding in 2019. Lawyers for the victim are hailing it as a watershed moment in U.S. justice highlighting that it is the first time in more than a generation that criminal charges have been brought in this type of assault at sea.\nThe case came to light in 2022 as part of a larger scandal in which female cadets at the service academy spoke up about the culture at sea and the school and the assaults they had experienced. The first two cadets, then known as Midshipmen X and Y, settled complaints out of court with the shipping line while it prompted a broader investigation into the academy’s Sea Year when cadets are assigned to working ships as well as the environment on a campus in Kings Point, New York.\nThe case of Captain John Merrone was first exposed by CNN in October 2022 which reported that two cadets were alleging that he had drugged and assaulted them in his stateroom. According to a Coast Guard administrative complaint obtained by CNN, the two cadets were called to the captain's stateroom, and he offered them both a drink. They told the Coast Guard that they became incapacitated, at which point the master allegedly raped one and attempted to assault the other.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice arraigned Merrone today, June 5, 2025, on five counts related to sexual assault, drugging the victims to become incapacitated, and assaulting them while they were incapacitated. He voluntarily surrendered to the FBI in South Carolina where he lives and was brought to Brooklyn, New York for the arraignment.\n“This is a watershed moment for the maritime industry,” said attorney Ryan Melogy, founder of Justice4Mariners, who represents the victims. “We have not seen the DOJ bring criminal charges for a sexual assault at sea aboard a U.S.-flag cargo vessel in more than a generation. This is a huge, historic turning point for maritime safety.”\nCourt papers revealed the assaults happened in 2019 aboard the U.S. flagged bulker Liberty Glory, operated by Liberty Maritime of New York.\nMerrone voluntarily surrendered his license in October 2022 after the case became public and it was reported that the U.S. Coast Guard was pursuing an administrative action against the master. Media reports at the time said he was being accused of both sexual assault and violating company policies on the use of alcohol. By surrendering the license, he was able to stop the USCG action and reports said the union also expelled him.\nIt came out in the media reports that Merrone had also been accused in 2011 of sexually assaulting a woman in Florida. A jury convicted Merrone of false imprisonment and two counts of simple battery, but an appeals court reversed the conviction in 2013. Merrone retained his license and continued to sail. It was unclear if the case had been disclosed to either the USCG or his employer.\n“This case is about more than one captain — it’s about a broken system consisting of U.S. government agencies, maritime labor unions, and commercial shipping companies that have worked cooperatively for decades to protect known sexual predators and silence their victims,” added Melogy.\nWhile Merrone is the first in years to be arraigned in federal court on criminal sexual assault charges, other seafarers have also faced charges in the broader scandal which also led to reforms in the Sea Year program and at USMMA. In 2023, an electrician who had been accused of sexually harassing Midshipman Y also voluntarily surrendered his license before the USCG could convene its action against him."

In the latest enforcement effort, it destroyed three additional vessels and arrested 27 foreigners.\nThe newest crackdown occurred in a span of two days mid-last month in the country’s northern waters. In the first case on May 13, 2025, officers spotted an Indonesian vessel that was just about to embark on illegal fishing near Cartier Island. Upon boarding the vessel, which had a crew of five, the officers found a variety of fishing equipment. Both the vessel and equipment were destroyed.\nThe following day, another Indonesian vessel near Ashmore Reef was detected and apprehended. Onboard were 12 crew members, six reef fish, 65 kilograms of salt used to preserve catch, and a variety of fishing equipment. While the fishing equipment and salt were seized and the catch returned to the ocean, the vessel was disposed of at sea in accordance with Australian law.\nOn the same day, another Indonesian vessel was spotted near Scott Reef leading to the arrest of nine crewmembers, destruction of the vessel, and seizure of 150 kilograms of salt and fishing equipment.\n\n\nOne of the boats seized and destroyed in Australia (ABF)\n\nThe seizures and vessel disposals at sea in May were the latest as ABF intensifies its fight against illegal fishing in Australia’s waters mainly in the remote regions of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, are being frequented by Indonesian fishers.\nIn April, the ABF destroyed two Indonesian vessels and arrested 14 crews who were transferred to Darwin to face charges. Since July 1, last year, a total of 143 Indonesian fishers have been prosecuted in Darwin for illegal fishing.\n“Australia does not tolerate illegal foreign fishing in its waters and those who are caught offending will face prosecution,” said Rear Admiral Brett Sonter, ABF Commander Maritime Border Command. “My message to those trying to exploit Australia's maritime domain is clear: We are actively patrolling these waters, and you will be caught.”\nAustralia asserts that illegal fishing has become a huge menace that is causing severe impacts on the country’s marine ecosystems and natural resources while also posing significant biosecurity and economic risks. The country is attributing the recent surge in illegal fishing to social and economic pressures facing Indonesia.\nApart from destroying the vessels, authorities are trying to deal with the problem by slapping the offenders with hefty fines and jail time."

It comes as the French carrier is building its logistics and terminal operations including in the Mediterranean where it recently announcement that it would modernize Syria’s Latakia port and has a long-standing agreement to redevelop the port of Beirut.\nThe ocean carrier’s CEO Rodolphe Saadé met on June 2 with the Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. They discussed two discussed upcoming port projects by the shipping giant. The meeting was initially scheduled in April but adiplomatic disputebetween Algeria and France led to the delay. Algeria’s ties with its former colonizer, France, have been lukewarm over the years. However, the relationship deteriorated in April leading to expulsion of diplomats from both sides.\nCMA CGM appears keen to overcome these difficulties and move forward with its projects in Algeria. “We can be an ally of Algeria in developing infrastructure and making Algerian ports true regional hubs. I strongly believe in the potential of this country,” Saadé told the local media.\nWith CMA CGM scaling its footprint in the Mediterranean region, Algerian port sector presents a good opportunity for this ambition. Algeria is increasingly diversifying its economy to cut reliance on oil and gas exports. Central to this shift is a revamp of the port sector to cater for the rising container shipping traffic.\nCMA CGM has shown interest in modernizing the ports of Oran and Djen Djen. This will help in decongesting the Port of Algiers, which is currently experiencing delay challenges with vessel waiting times exceeding seven days.\nIn Oran, CMA CGM reportedly wants to lease the container terminal through its subsidiary, CMA Terminals. The goal is to expend the terminal to have a capacity of handling over one million TEUs annually. According to local media reports, a technical team from CMA Terminals has almost finalizing an investment plan for Oran port, likely to be made public by end of this year.\nTo improve its intra-med connections, CMA CGM is also considering a feeder shipping line between Marseille and Oran, reducing the transit time to less than 48 hours. The service will be operated by its subsidiary La Méridionale, which was acquired in 2023.\n\nTop photo byHabib Kaki--CC BY 3.0"

        "content": "Maryland’s Department of the Environment, Air, and Radiation Administration issued the final necessary approval to permit the start of construction of US Wind’s proposed offshore wind farm. The large project has received all the necessary state and local permits, but it still faces local opposition and the potential that the Trump administration could object to the approvals issued at the end of the Biden administration.\nUS Wind highlights it has been in review and permitting for the past four years with an arduous and thorough process of reviews. It gained approvals in 2024 from Maryland, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and in December 2024 the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management signed off on the Construction and Operation Plan for the full site. Today’s approval from Maryland is for air quality permits for the construction and operation of Maryland Offshore Wind.\nUS Wind, which is a partnership between investors of funds managed by Apollo Global Management and Italy’s Renexia, acquired its lease for 80,000 acres from the federal government in 2014. It proposes to build in two phases a total project with up to a total of 114 wind turbines generating between 1.8 and 2 GW of power. The project also includes four offshore substation platforms, one meteorological tower, and up to four offshore export cable corridors.\nIt would be located between Maryland and Delaware approximately 10 miles offshore from Ocean City, Maryland a popular tourist and vacation destination. Ocean City has opposed the project on the grounds that it would be a negative for the tourist industry as well as potentially ocean fishing. Residents in Delaware have opposed the plan to bring a cable ashore in that state.\nWhile Trump has adamantly opposes offshore wind, the Maryland project has not drawn the same attention as New Jersey where the administration withdrew a federal air quality permit. In New York,  Interior Secretary Doug Burgum withdrew federal permits for over a month on the already under construction Empire Wind project.\nBurgum alleged that the permit for Empire Wind had been rushed by the Biden administration despite the approvals having been issued in February 2024. US Wind’s approval came from BOEM in December 2024 after the presidential election. At the time, the Biden administration highlighted it was the nation’s tenth commercial-scale offshore wind project to be approved.\nUS Wind has all the approvals required to begin construction of its project although there continue to be pending legal cases objecting to the approvals. Maryland law also provides for an appeal of today’s approval which could trigger a judicial review. A potential appeal, which is likely from the opponents of the project and offshore wind in general, must be filed in Maryland by July 14.\nJeff Grybowski, CEO of US Wind said in a statement issued to Maryland media that the company was pleased to have secured the final permit from Maryland. He emphasized the benefits of the project and said they look forward to continued engagement with the state as they work to bring the project online."

        "content": "The U.S. Coast Guard, which has been struggling with its new ship efforts, has reportedly placed a temporary stop work order on two cutters under construction in its Heritage-class Offshore Patrol Class. Reports of the pause come a day after the Department of Homeland Security announced it had canceled a contract for another cutter in its Legend-class national security cutter and the Department has promised to overhaul the operations of the USCG under its Force Design 2028 project.\nNews of the pause was reported by Defense Daily which wrote that work on the third and fourth vessels underway at Eastern Shipbuilding is being delayed as issues regarding funding and delays in the timing of the program are underway. Work on the third cutter, to be named,Ingham, has been underway since mid-2022 when the keel was laid, and steel cutting is underway for number four, USCGRush.\n“We share a common goal with the U.S. Coast Guard—to deliver the Offshore Patrol Cutters as quickly and efficiently as possible,” Joey D’Isernia, CEO of Eastern Shipbuilding Group told The Maritime Executive. “We are actively working to reach an agreement that ensures the program is properly funded and can move forward without further delay. System light-offs on Hull 1 are currently underway, and despite the unprecedented challenges we’ve faced, we remain confident that our incredible workforce represents the most capable and reliable team to complete these vital national security assets.”\nThe Heritage-class has been highlighted as a key component of the future USCG operations. Planning for the vessels began more than a decade ago with the USCG calling the vessels “one of its highest investment priorities.” The vessels which are to be 360 feet in length with a top speed of 22.5 knots are designed to bridge the capabilities of the 418-foot national security cutters, which patrol the open ocean, and the 154-foot fast response cutters, which serve closer to shore. The Heritage-class is needed to replace the 270-foot and 210-foot medium endurance cutters that are approximately 30 and 50 years old.\nThe Coast Guard awarded the first preliminary design contract to three yards in 2014 and in 2016 selected the design from Eastern Shipbuilding saying it anticipated the first cutter would be delivered in 2021. However, the first steel was not cut till early 2019 and the keel was approved in 2020 followed by work starting on the second and third cutters and steel cutting for the fourth. Eastern launched the first cutter, USCGArgus, on October 27, 2023.\nThe second phase of the program was awarded in July 2022 with Austal contracted for one cutter and options for up to 10 more. Production on the first of the Austal-built cutters was started in August 2024 with the Coast Guard saying it would be delivered in 2027. The Coast Guard has said its goal is to build 25 Heritage-class cutters.\nCongress and the Government Accountability Office have been highly critical of USCG and its management of the shipbuilding programs, and in particular the OPC and the Polar Security Cutter. Anxious to get the programs into production, GAO highlighted efforts to push the programs into construction before designs were completed, multiple design changes, and change orders to the contracts. It has resulted in delays to both programs and cost increases. Eastern was also challenged by extensive damage in the Panama City area of Florida by a Category 5 hurricane that hit the area as the program was getting started. The COVID-19 pandemic also impacted the program and contributed to coast increases.\nHours after Donald Trump took office in January, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Linda Fagan, was dismissed. Reports cited a failure of leadership on a range of issues including the problems in the shipbuilding programs. Recently, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem outlined theForce Design 28program that calls for fundamentally overhauling the U.S. Coast Guard.\nHomeland Security is moving forward with its efforts announcing yesterday that it has agreed with HII tocancel constructionfor the eleventh Legend-class cutter which was under construction at Ingalls in Mississippi. Parts from the program will be used instead for maintenance of the existing 10 vessels of the class.\nUSCG is in critical need of the new vessels to replace and upgrade its aging fleet. Congress has promised to address the under-funding issues in the shipbuilding programs while it has also demanded improvement to the programs and addressing issues such as the design problems that have plagued and delayed construction."

        "content": "Maritime investigators in New Zealand are calling for the banning of substandard ships from the country’s water to avoid potential disasters. In the wake of the release of the final report on the near catastrophic incidents involving container shipShiling, which twice had to be rescued and towed back to port in 2023, the investigators as saying that New Zealand can take a cue from Australia and ban substandard ships.\nThe Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) contends that the Singapore-registeredShiling, which had a notorious history of mechanical problems, should never have been allowed in New Zealand waters. TAIC is calling on the Ministry of Transport to pass a law giving Maritime NZ the authority to ban certain ships from the country. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has the powers, which it has repeatedly utilized in banning ships deemed unsafe.\nIn the case ofShiling, the telltale signs were already evident even before the boxship twice experienced engine failures in New Zealand waters in a span of less than a month in 2023. Evidence pointed to the fact that the ship was a disaster in waiting from as early as 2018 when she was classified as a “high risk” vessel under the Tokyo Port State Control (PSC) statutes.\nIn 2020, a year after Shiling Navigation purchased the vessel and tapped Asian-Alliance Ship Management as the operator providing liner services between New Zealand and ports in Asia, inspections in Russia, China, and Chile detected a total of 19 deficiencies in five PSC inspections.\nThe same happened in New Zealand where Maritime NZ had issued 16 deficiencies against the ship during three PSC inspections between March 2022 and March 2023, with the last one coming just a month before the first major incident. It is also emerging that twice, in February 2022 and July 2022, theShilingsuffered engine failures while arriving and departing the Port of Wellington.\n“The Commission found that theShilinghad a history of deficiencies and that it’s virtually certain the ship wasn’t seaworthy while in New Zealand,” said Naveen Kozhuppakalam, TAIC’s Chief Investigator of Accidents.\nOwing to its troubled history, it was just a matter of time before a serious incident could occur. It did not take long for the 294-meter (965-foot) long ship built at HD Hyundai Heavy Industries in 2005 with a capacity of 5,117 TEU to experience its first major incident.\nOn April 15, 2023, theShilingwas under pilotage at Wellington. Just after initiating a turn into the Wellington Harbour entrance channel, the vessel suffered a blackout that caused the main engine to stop. The momentum of the turn carried the ship into the shallow waters of Falcon Shoal, where the bridge team succeeded in using both the ship’s anchors to stop the ship from grounding. She was subsequently towed dead-ship by tugs back to its berth.\nMaritime NZ issued a detention order against theShilingand carried out detailed inspections that identified numerous deficiencies. For the next 25 days, the boxship remained at Wellington undergoing repairs to its generators and rectification of the deficiencies identified.\nOn May 10, theShilingdeparted Wellington bound for Singapore. Normal operational standards entail that while a vessel is in port, any accumulation of oily water must be stored in tanks for later controlled discharge away from any coastline. Due to the length of theShiling’s stay at Wellington, the various tanks used to store oily water were at capacity.\nThe engine room bilges were confirmed as dry before the ship departed with the chief engineer intending to begin pumping out the tanks through the approved oily water separator once the ship was outside New Zealand’s territorial waters.\nOwing to adverse weather forecasts for the Tasman Sea, the master decided to take shelter near the New Zealand coast and wait for about 36 hours for the weather to abate. At about 2300 on May 11, theShilingdeparted the sheltered waters bound for Singapore. Because the engineers had been unable to begin pumping out the oily water holding tanks, additional oily water that had been produced while the ship remained in sheltered waters had filled the engine room bilges and begun accumulating on the engine room tank top.\nWhen the ship entered the Tasman Sea, it began to roll, and the free water on the tank top entered the void under the main engine sump, where three rubber diaphragms were located. The fact that all three rubber diaphragms deteriorated with age allowed the bilge water to enter the lube-oil tank, causing the lube-oil pumps to lose pressure and the main engine to stop. New Zealand’s inspectors later concluded the diaphragms had gone uninspected for years.\nGiven the contamination of the lube oil tank, the engineers were unable to restart the main engine. Without propulsion, theShilingsettled beam-on to the waves and began rolling heavily. At 0828, the master radioed the New Zealand Marine Operations Center to request towing assistance. At 1056, due to continued heavy rolling, the master made a mayday call and a tow vessel responded, managing to rescue the container ship to the sheltered waters of Golden Bay and eventually back to Wellington.\nFor the next 45 days, theShilingremained at Wellington undergoing surveys and repairs to the main engine, further repairs to the generators in connection with the first incident, and repairs to several other systems identified as substandard. On July 7, the ship was finally allowed to depart New Zealand for Singapore.\nIn both incidents, there were no injuries reported for the ship’s 24 crewmembers or environmental pollution. Following the release of the final report, TAIC has gone ahead to issue several recommendations, key of which is banning substandard vessels from New Zealand’s waters."

They highlight that it remains an ongoing operation that is expected to take time.\nWeather which had been a factor during the winter and early spring has improved giving the teams easier access to the vessel. In addition, one of the local mayors reported a light vehicle road was expected to be completed this week to give access for personnel into the remote area on the western shore of Newfoundland. The road is not for the removal of material from the ship.\nContainer removal has also begun in part to give the teams more access including to fuel tanks that they have so far not been able to reach. The Canadian Coast Guard reports approximately half of the heavy fuel has been removed in a process of heating it and pumping it to storage tanks placed on the deck of the vessel. It is then pumped into tanks on a barge and moved to Corner Brook where it is being loaded onto other MSC vessels. The Coast Guard estimates the vessel had approximately 1,600 metric tons of heavy fuel and marine gas oil onboard.\nThe shipgroundedon the shore in a remote cove on February 15 after losing power in a winter storm. The crew was airlifted by helicopter to safety. The salvage operation has been ongoing for three months.\nThe salvage team placed a cargo ship,EEMS Dublin, alongside. The 6,000 dwt open hatch vessel can come alongside. It has provided a walk-to-work platform to reach theMSC Baltic III. Also, images show a crane vehicle has been put on the vessel that is being used to hoist containers from theMSC Baltic IIIto the deck ofEEMS Dublin. The Canadian Coast Guard reports as of this week 115 containers have been removed, which is about a quarter of the boxes that were on the vessel when it grounded.\n\n\n\nInitially, a few boxes with plastics and potential pollutants were removed. Now they are removing more boxes for access. The ship had a total of 470 containers with reports that half were empties.\nThe Coast Guard said the focus remains on fuel removal and mitigating pollution. Previously it reported the discovery of a few tar balls on the shoreline thought to be coming from the ship. A Coast Guard spokesperson says that the team continues to monitor the shoreline and that there have recently been some minor observations of oil including a small number of tar balls of various sizes.\nThe ship has sustained significant hull damage with earlier reports that the engine room and cargo holds were flooded. The Canadian Coast Guard expects to continue to see small amounts of residual oil escape from the vessel over time.\nTo date, there have been no public comments on how the vessel might be removed from the shoreline. The Coast Guard has previously said with the damage it was not possible to remove the vessel at this time."

Lines disconnected from an offshore pipeline connection during a storm. Oil dispersants, booms, and skimmers are being deployed to contain the spill.\nThe National Maritime Interests Protection Center (ThaiMecc) initially reported that an estimated 10 cubic meters or approximately 10,000 liters of oil had spilled in the Si Racha District southeast of Bangkok on the Gulf of Thailand. Later reports doubled the estimate to 20,000 liters.\nThe supertankerPhoenix Jamnagar(311,798 dwt – registered in Singapore) was at the offshore terminal connected to the pipeline. The vessel which was built in 2019 is reported to be operating under charter to Thai Oil.\n\n\nSpill was drifting to the south at 1 to 2 knots (ThaiMecc)\n\nThe spill happened around midnight on June 5 due to unexpected severe weather conditions, including high waves and sudden strong winds. The company initiated a process to stop the oil transfer but during the sudden storm, the breakaway coupling worked as designed to prevent damage to the ship or pipeline. It disengaged causing the spill which officials report took 30 minutes to stop. Safety values permitted what is being called a small amount of oil.\nOfficials were reporting that booms were strung at 399 and 600 meters but the spill spread to create a slick covering an area estimated at 10 meters by 10 meters (32 feet) and being driven southward at a speed of 1 to 2 knots.\nBoats and helicopters with dispersant were crossing the area and a skimmer had also been deployed. The goal was to complete the skimming operation by Friday afternoon.\nThai officials said the focus remains on protecting the marine environment. They believe it was an accident caused by the sudden storm. No damage was apparent to the tanker or the pipeline."

        "content": "\nA team of scientists is preparing to take to the sea to carry out a critical mission of mapping and studying a nuclear waste disposal site that is littered with thousands of drums that were dumped by European countries in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nStarting mid-June, the team intends to sail to the Abyssal Plains in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean where they plan to map out over 200,000 barrels containing radioactive waste which were dumped over a four-decade period spanning from 1946 to 1990. The drums are believed to be at depths of between 3,000 and 5,000 meters (1.8 to over 3 miles) and were sealed in bitumen or cement before being dumped into the ocean.\nThe Nuclear Ocean Dump Site Survey Monitoring (NODSSUM) project aims to map the main immersion area, understand the behavior of radionuclides in the deep ocean, and interactions with the ecosystem. The drums are said to contain mainly radioactive waste from the development of nuclear power produced by several European countries between 1949 and 1982.\nAccording to declarations to the International Atomic Energy Agency made by the dumping states, the barrels contain low or intermediate-level radioactive residues like process sludge, contaminated metal parts, ion exchange resins, and laboratory and office equipment among others. Though the radioactive activity of the waste is believed to have decreased significantly since its immersion due to the natural decay of the isotopes, there are concerns that some long-lived elements may remain.\nFrom June 15, scientists will be in the North Atlantic waters for a month-long mission to locate and detect possible leaks. The team is led by the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and includes scientists from the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (Ifremer), and the Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection Authority (ASNR) among other organizations.\nDuring the period, the team intends to crisscross the dumping sites by deploying the French Oceanographic Fleet underwater vehicle UlyX. Using its high-resolution sonar, the Ifremer-operated robot will navigate at approximately 70 meters above the seafloor to map and identify the barrels and will approach a distance of 10 meters to photograph them and identify areas for water, sediment, and fauna sampling.\nUltimately, the scientists will be able to analyze the presence of radionuclides in the water and their impact on the marine environment. The research ship they are using is equipped with radioactivity measurement instruments.\nBased on the results of the first mission, a second expedition that is still in the planning stages will involve the deployment of a remotely operated robot or a manned submarine to carry out studies and samples in the direct vicinity of the barrels. The team is putting a strong emphasis on safety and has no intention of bringing the drums to the surface.\n“Beyond the minimization of risks, the logistics would be too complex and without scientific interest. The objective of the project is to assess their state in situ, using underwater vehicles, and to study the environmental conditions around them,” states NODSSUM on its website.\nThe NODSSUM expedition is part of the Prime Radiocean project that is involved in missions that seek to better understand radioactive waste risks in marine environments, thus contributing to the development of safer and more sustainable nuclear waste management policies."

        "content": "\nThe Mexican sail training ship Cuauhtémoc, which struck New York City’s Brooklyn Bridge on May 17, was moved this morning, June 6, to a shipyard to undergo further surveys and to begin repairs. The Mexican Navy announced it was the next part of a technical evaluation and the process to ensure the vessel once against sails as a symbol of Mexico.\nThe ship has remained docked at Manhattan’s Pier 36 not far from where itstruck the bridgekilling two sailors and injuring 19 others. There were 277 people aboard at the time. Mexico arranged to fly approximately 200 of the cadets and instructors home while keeping a crew of 77 aboard the vessel.\nThe NYC Emergency Management department coordinated the move which began around 0630 local time. City officials said relocating the vessel by tow through an active waterway required detailed planning. Working with the U.S. Coast Guard which established a safety zone, all vessel traffic on New York’s East River was ordered suspended for 90 minutes, including commuter ferries.\n\n\n\nOfficials said the transfer time was selected and coordinated with the tide schedule. The East River has strong currents and the early morning was reported during the slack tide period so the vessel would encounter minimal resistance. The move was executed by several tugs and images show a platform alongside the vessel. Media reports said the majority of the crew aboard was going to leave the vessel and be bussed to Brooklyn. NYC reported the vessel arrived at 0735 at the GMD Shipyard at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\nThe strong currents on the river are suspected to have contributed to the accident in which the Cuauhtémoc lost control resulting in it moving north on the river and striking the underside of the bridge. It had been in New York City since May 13 and it was a ceremonial departure on Saturday evening with the cadets manning the sails and spaced in the rigging and a large Mexican flag on the stern. The tops of all three masts were broken with cadets visible hanging from the safety harnesses. Initial reports later denied said some of the cadets had fallen into the river.\nAfter being flow to Mexico, the cadets were given psychological evaluations and counseling and time off to visit with their families. They returned to the training program after a week’s leave. Media reports said they were returning to sea for the remainder of the training program aboard a Mexican Navy vessel. Their departure had been scheduled to coincide with Mexico’s Navy Day celebrations on June 1.\nCuauhtémoc had been scheduled to fuel in the Lower Manhattan Bay after its departure and then to sail for Iceland. The vessel was to make a tour of European ports. It was to return to Mexico in November with a stop in Barbados on the return leg of its journey. Built in 1982 as a modern replica of the traditional sailing ships, the vessel is 297 feet in length and is used for training cadets and goodwill missions."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe UK government presented a new set of proposed reforms to align its port sector for future growth. Maritime Minister Mike Kane presented to parliament on Wednesday, June 4, a draft of an amended national policy statement for ports (NPSP), and launched a public consultation which will close on July 29 for the plan document.\nThe government wants a review current of the NPSP which was adopted in 2012 highlighting that new infrastructure priorities are arising in ports across the UK. The proposed revisions aim to streamline the planning process for ports and expedite the approval processes. This will include clearly outlining the existing needs for port facilities and how to design applications to meet the latest requirements to avoid process delays.\nOne example offered for the updated proposal will more clearly outline how ports can meet obligations on noise and emissions, increasing the likelihood of achieving planning approvals and saving time and money. Greater clarity, fewer delays, and reduced costs will give ports the confidence they need to expand, emphasized the Department for Transport.\nThese plans tie in with wider reforms, including the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, and will see ports going further and faster with commercial projects. The reforms are coming at a time when the UK is investing in infrastructure upgrades in its major ports.\nLast month, the UK announced a $47 million investment in the Port of Liverpool to develop a new deep-water terminal. Another $1 billion is being invested in the Port of Tyne to develop state-of-the-art infrastructure.\n“A refreshed ports policy statement is welcome recognition from the government of the value of port development and expansion to the UK’s future prosperity. We hope it will speed up planning processes, delivering on shared industry and government economic growth ambitions,” said Richard Ballantyne, Chief Executive of the British Ports Association (BPA).\nLast year, BPA warned that delays in approving port infrastructure upgrades put billions of pounds of investment at risk. The association, whose members own and operate ports in the UK, complained of the slow process of getting project approvals. In some cases, ports had to wait for almost four years for approvals.\nAlongside the proposals, the government also published the UK’s port freight demand forecasts, revealing the need for long-term planning for the shipping sector. The forecast covers the years 2024 to 2050. It projects that UK port traffic will grow by 1.2 percent by 2035 and 7.8 percent by 2050. That represents an increase from 420.6 million tons in 2023 to 425.8 million tons in 2035 and to 453.5 million tons in 2050.\nThe growth will mostly be driven by ro-ro cargo, containers, and dry bulk freight. However, liquid bulk traffic is forecast to significantly decrease, by 63.3 percent, from 169.3 million tons in 2023 to 62.1 million tons in 2050. The decrease is likely to come from the net zero transition affecting crude oil and oil products."

HMASCanberra, one of the Royal Australian Navy’s largest ships, was sailing to Wellington to participate in the Wellington–Canberra sister city celebrations, an event which is aimed at fostering collaborations across areas like tourism, education, and creative sectors.\nThe hallmark of this year’s celebration was expected to be the Freedom of Entry parade through Wellington. In the parade, over 300 Australian and New Zealand defense force personnel were on Saturday marching through the streets of Wellington.\nOn Wednesday, however, the 230-meterCanberrastole the spotlight after its sophisticated navigation radar interfered with 5GHz wireless access points — devices that bridge wired and wireless networks — in regions on both New Zealand's North and South islands, according to media outlet ABC. The New Zealand Defense Force notified their Australian counterparts of the blocking in the Taranaki and Marlborough regions, prompting the problem to be rectified.\n“On becoming aware, HMASCanberrachanged frequencies rectifying the interference. There are no ongoing disruptions,” said an Australia Department of Defense spokesperson.\nWireless internet and mobile telecommunications company Primo was among those affected. The firm’s MD Matthew Harrison, termed the widespread disruption caused byCanberraas a dramatic example of just how fragile New Zealand’s spectrum environment.\n“This wasn’t just a blip. It was full-scale, military-grade radar triggering built-in safety protocols designed to protect airspace. It rolled across our network in sync with the ship’s movement. We’ve never seen anything like it here before,” he wrote in a post on LinkedIn. “It’s not every day a warship takes your gear offline.”\nCommissioned in 2014,Canberrais the flagship of the Australian navy. The ship is capable of transporting more than 100 ground vehicles, four landing craft, up to 18 helicopters and more than 1,000 troops, in addition to its crew of more than 400.\nIts presence during the sister city relationship celebration was meant to cement the friendship between the two countries’ defense forces that has endured for over a century. Both famously fought together as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps during World War I. The members of that corps were known as “Anzacs.”"

The Swedish Coast Guard reports the operation proceeded without problem or pollution and the ship was moved to port for further inspections.\nThe salvage operation, undertaken by a salvage company hired by the vessel’s owners, began at 0300 on Saturday morning by emptying the ballast tanks. Before that, two tugboats had been connected to the stern and bow ofMeshka. At 0830, the ship was floating freely and, after assistance from the tugboats, was able to continue an eight-hour journey to Landskrona, Sweden under its own power. Pilots from the Swedish Maritime Administration and officials from the Coast Guard were on board during the salvage operation.\nOn boardMeshkathere are approximately 938,000 liters of oil in fuel and lubricating oil tanks. The Coast Guard has had vessels on site monitoring the refloating to address any potential oil leak. Additional environmental rescue resources were standing by in Landskrona and Malmö, if required.\nMeshkagroundedon May 31 while it was southbound in the Øresund coming from Tarragona, Spain to the small Russian port of Vysotsk near the border with Finland. According to Swedish media reports, the Swedish Maritime Administration’s traffic center (VTS) spotted that the ship was outside the shipping lane and warned the ship around 1000 last Saturday morning. The crew either ignored the warning or did not have time to respond and change course.\nAn investigation was launched to determine why the vessel had traveled outside the shipping channel and ran aground on the soft sandy bottom. The ship was traveling only with ballast without cargo.\nThe Swedish Coast Guard reported shortly after the grounding that it conducted sobriety checks and found no suspicions of drunkenness among the crew. However, during the week, Sweden reported that it had charged one person from the vessel’s crew with negligence in maritime traffic. The Coast Guard said it was conducting a preliminary investigation into what it terms “the lack of good seamanship surrounding the grounding.”\nIt was the second grounding in less than a week by bulkers in the same area of the seaway. A Turkish-owned bulker went aground a week before theMeshkaapproximately 50 miles to the south and close to the Øresund Bridge. The Coast Guard reported in that case one seafarer was charged with drunkness and that there were charges also related to negligent navigation. The vessel wasrefloatedon June 4.\nThe cases raised new concerns in the shipping industry after a number of situations of distracted or tired crewmembers contributing to casualties. In May, a cargo ship sailing in a Norwegian fjord grounded when the second officer who was alone on the bridge admitted he fell asleep and missed a turn. The ship grounded at a reported speed of 16 knots. In previous years, there have been other similar grounding situations as well as fatal accidents in the North Sea and Baltic due to distracted watch officers and in some cases a lack of a lookout despite requirements for the second person overnight and in limited visibility situations. A recent survey released in May also highlighted theincreased issuesof fatigue, anxiety, and stress which it said was contributing to issues on ships.\nSwedish authorities noted that they were pleased to have successful conclusions to the recent groundings without significant pollution coming from either case."

        "content": "\nThe Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) released its final report detailing its conclusion that a wreck lying on the seabed in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, is the famed HM Bark Endeavour, which carried Capt. James Cook and his crew on their voyage of exploration to Australia and New Zealand.\nANMM published its final report on the location of Endeavour, detailing a site known as RI 2394 in Newport Harbor indicating that it stands with its 2022 conclusion on the identity of the vessel at the wreck site. In the report, ANMM concludes that based on a “preponderance of evidence,” the wreck is that of Endeavour.\nANMM is hoping that the report, which is a culmination of a 26-year archival and archaeological research, will bring to rest the controversy that has continued to surround the identification of the sailing vessel that is of significant importance to Australia’s maritime history.\nIn 2022 when ANMM first announced the identification, archeologists at the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) termed the announcement as “premature,” going on to add that Australia was being driven by emotions or politics. RIMAP, which was partnering with ANMM to locate the wreck, is yet to comment on the final report.\n\nAfter 25 years of research, we confirm: the shipwreck in Newport Harbor, RI 2394 is HM Bark Endeavour (later Lord Sandwich) made famous by James Cook. The Final Report is now out.https://t.co/nbAGwy0yTcThanks to USA Bicentennial Gift Fund for supporting this critical work.pic.twitter.com/fAdvcRv2LP\n\nIn its detailed129-page report, ANMM contends that after Cook’s Pacific voyage on the Endeavour that began in 1768 and saw him reach the New South Wales coast in 1770, the vessel returned to England a year later. For about seven years, the vessel was of public view, being used as a naval transport before being sold to private owners, who renamed her Lord Sandwich. She was used to transport troops to the American colonies in support of British campaigns.\nIn 1778, the vessel was in poor condition and relegated to holding American prisoners of war in Newport Harbor. When American and French forces besieged the British-held town, Lord Sandwich was one of 13 vessels that were deliberately sunk to act as a submerged blockade. The ship was never salvaged.\nFor decades, historians and archeologists have been undertaking extensive research on the vessel. Part of the research was able to confirm the names and the details of five vessels scuttled by the British in August 1778 within a section of Newport Harbor that would later be identified as the Limited Study Area (LSA). One of these vessels was the 368-tonne Lord Sandwich.\nIn 2019, ANMM and RIMAP signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly identify the wreck and went ahead to establish a 10-point criteria necessary for the Lord Sandwich (ex-HMB Endeavour) shipwreck site to be identified with a reasonable degree of certainty. The teams carried out diving expeditions, surveying a large area of Newport Harbor with the hope of locating the vessel. Apart from the history of the ship, factors like the ship's hull and keel, timber used to construct the ship, and repairs that had been carried out made the team conclude the wreck on the RI 2394 site was indeed that of Lord Sandwich.\nANMM highlights that in 1999 and again in 2019, an agreement had been reached with RIMAP on a set of criteria that, if satisfied, would permit the identification of RI 2394 as Lord Sandwich. “Based on the agreed preponderance of evidence approach, enough of these criteria have now been met for the ANMM to positively identify RI 2394 as the remnants of Lord Sandwich, formerly James Cook’s HM Bark Endeavour,” states ANMM in its final report.\nEndeavour remains an important vessel in Australian maritime history and one that elicits mixed opinions. For some, the Pacific voyage embodies the spirit of Europe’s Age of Enlightenment, while for others it symbolizes the onset of colonization and the subjugation of First Nations Peoples."

        "content": "\nCalifornia is taking action to address the menace of derelict vessels in the expansive Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta after conducting the largest single-site commercial abandoned vessel abatement and site restoration in the state’s history.\nCalifornia has been grappling with the problem of abandoned vessels for decades, with the hazard being most concentrated in the Delta. Since enacting a law that authorizes the removal and disposal of abandoned and derelict vessels and marine debris in 2011, California has been proactive in dealing with the problem.\nThe State Lands Commission says that it has conducted the largest operation in the Sevenmile Slough area in the Delta at a location known as the Skarry site, where abandoned vessels had been an eyesore for years. The deteriorating vessels were not just a navigational hazard, but were highly visible, attracting scavengers and vandals and marring the serenity of the beautiful area.\nThe Skarry site got its name from Skarry Brothers, a marine construction business that abandoned its equipment in the Slough. Michael Skarry, the last known responsible party, died without disposing of his vessels and machinery, despite efforts by multiple agencies to hold him responsible. The abandoned vessels included several large crane barges, two tugboats, and smaller work and recreational vessels, all of which were removed during the operation. Divers also discovered another sunken vessel and other debris while the removal work was underway.\nDuring the operation, salvors also managed to remove almost 1,000 tonnes of debris, more than 1,000 gallons of diesel, and two large barges.\n\n“The Delta is one of California’s most vital and cherished waterways, and it deserves to be protected,” said Lieutenant Governor and State Lands Commission Chair Eleni Kounalakis. “These abandoned vessels not only pose environmental and navigational hazards but also threaten the health and safety of nearby communities. I’m proud that we are taking decisive action to restore this site, protect our natural resources, and prevent illegal dumping in our public waterways.”\nThe operation in the Skarry site is the latest in the Commission’s efforts in dealing with a hazard that it contends is stubborn, perennial and expensive to deal with. Over the last two years, the Commission has removed at least nine high-priority commercial abandoned vessels and forced the owners of an additional 10 abandoned vessels to remove them."

        "content": "\nAfter Israel's defense minister vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" to prevent a 60-foot sailboat carrying activist Greta Thunberg from reaching the shores of Gaza, Israeli commandos interdicted the vessel in international waters, then persuaded the crew to transit to an Israeli port.\nLikud party Knesset member and current Minister of Defense Israel Katz said Sunday that he had given instructions to the Israel Defense Forces to block the vessel's progress, before it reached Gaza's shores. \"You'd better turn back - because you will not reach Gaza,\" Katz warned the boat's operators, calling them a \"hate flotilla\" of \"antisemitic\" activists.\nGaza has been under a strict Israeli naval blockade for nearly two decades, a policy intended to prevent the infiltration of arms for Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. The last time a foreign vessel attempted to run the blockade was the infamousMavi Marmaraincident of 2010. Israeli special forces boarded the ship as it neared shore, and the exchange that followed resulted in the deaths of ten people on board.\nThe current mission's organizers say that their plan is to deliver humanitarian aid to residents of Gaza. The territory has not received full-scale food imports since early March because of certain border control factors. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC, the UN's reference system for degree of deprivation) currently classifies all areas of Gaza as a Phase 4 nutrition \"emergency,\" with risk of edging into famine.\nThe size of the group's boat suggests that the delivery would be symbolic in nature. The organizers originally intended to use a larger vessel, but it was damaged by two unexplained explosions while anchored off Malta last month. The group alleges that Israeli drones caused the blast damage, but no conclusive evidence has emerged and Israel has not claimed responsibility.\nThunberg and her co-organizers have framed the voyage in symbolic terms. \"We are seeing a systematic starvation of 2 million people. The world cannot be silent bystanders,\" Thunberg asserted in a statement."

        "content": "\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has decided to further tweak its proposed port fee structure for Chinese-built vessels, rolling back a proposed deadline for U.S.-built LNG carrier capacity and a fee that would hit all PCTCs in the Maritime Security Program.\nUSTR's original proposal was released in April, and its headline provisions were focused on fees on Chinese-built container ships. Less noticed, further down the list, it also proposed steep new fees on all foreign-built vehicle carriers (PCTCs) and laid out an ambitious LNG carrier construction and utilization requirement for American LNG exporters.\nOn Friday, the office proposed modifications to its PCTC fee plans. Instead of charging $150 per car equivalent unit, based on lane-meters of capacity, it will now charge based on each PCTC's net tonnage. This will make the fee easier to administer and will help close off a potential avenue for fee evasion, the office said. Like lane-meters, net tonnage is a measurement of the vessel rather than the cargo, so even empty PCTCs arriving in ballast will still be charged - a point that foreign critics have emphasized previously.\nUSTR also proposed \"targeted coverage\" for imposing the fee on the foreign-built PCTCs that are flagged into the United States registry for the Maritime Security Program. The agency noted that the MSP \"reduces dependence on China,\" a core objective of the new port fees.\nThe office also rolled back the enforcement of its ambitious timetable for imposing a U.S.-built LNG carrier requirement on the U.S. LNG export industry. In the original proposal, USTR called for the LNG industry to begin shipping one percent of all of its exports aboard U.S.-built LNGCs by 2029. If LNG exporters did not meet this timeline, USTR proposed to begin suspending export licenses.\nThe challenge for this requirement is that this vessel class does not currently exist: the last LNGC delivered by an American yard entered service in 1980 and was scrapped in 2021. The shipyard that built that final hull closed in 1986.\nGiven the challenges of scaling a domestic LNG carrier construction program within four years - an uncertain prospect with real technical risks - LNG exporters informed USTR that they do not favor having their licenses suspended if the ships aren't ready by 2029. USTR agreed, and it now plans to remove the license-suspension clause from the proposed regulation in order \"to allay concerns about the provision’s impact on the U.S. LNG sector.\""

        "content": "In a jury trial at the United States Federal Courthouse in Richmond (Virginia), the Pakistani captain of a dhow has been found guilty of a series of charges related to the supply of advanced conventional weaponry to Houthi rebels in Yemen, and of providing material support to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Muhammad Pahlawan was also found guilty of threatening his own crew in an attempt to confuse the naval boarding party that intercepted his dhow.\nThe interception was carried out in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Somalia on January 11, 2024, and was executed by US Navy and Coast Guard personnel from the USSLewis B. Puller(ESB-3). Two SEALS who were part of the boarding party lost their lives when the captain of the dhow attempted to carry out evasive maneuvers.\nAmong the weapons and equipment found on the dhow were critical components for medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, including a warhead and propulsion, engine and guidance components. The equipment seized was of types used by the Houthis against a range of targets, including merchant shipping.\nThe case is unusual: crews of dhows intercepted with weapons aboard by coalition forces are normally turned over to local authorities, thereby avoiding the burden and costs of imprisoning crews who are often unwitting accessories. In this instance, along with the captain, another member of the crew was charged with misleading FBI investigators. All the remaining Pakistani crew members were detained under federal material witness laws, being assessed as flight risks. Detention of the whole crew, as well as seizure of arms aboard the dhow, enabled FBI investigators to gain a thorough understanding of the dhow’s modus operandii and the IRGC’s system of arms smuggling.\nBetween August 2023 until he was intercepted on January 11, 2024, Pahlawan captained his dhow on multiple smuggling trips, in which he loaded up at IRGC-controlled facilities in Iran, sailed across the Arabian Sea to points off the coast of Somalia, and then cross-decked cargos of weapons to smaller boats which had come out from and then returned to fishing ports on the Houthi-controlled coastline of Yemen. Each voyage was coordinated by two Iranian brothers, Shahab and Yunis Mir’kazei, both of whom were IRGC officers. The IRGC officers provided the coordinates for the points where trans-shipments were to take place, with mobile phone devices and contacts. Pahlawan was paid in cash for each journey.\nThe IRGC method of using transshipment to smaller boats is well-described in successive annual UN Security Council Panel of Experts on Yemen reports. Cross-decking to smaller boats helps both to reduce the risk of detection on the most vulnerable leg of the arms shipment route, and also the consequent loss of cargo should an interception occur.\nPahlawan will be sentenced in September, and he could face up to 20 years in jail."

        "author": "The Conversation",
        "content": "\nAs the UN Ocean Conference kicks off in Nice, France this week, UK government is set to announce a ban on bottom trawling in its marine protected areas (MPAs). For years, environmental campaigners have been calling for government action against bottom trawling, which is associated with large-scale destruction of seafloor habitats.\nIn an editorial in the Observer newspaper, British secretary of state for environment Steve Reed said that he will be announcing in the UN Ocean Conference on the government’s plans to ban bottom trawling. The ban will apply across 41 MPAs of the English seas spanning 30,000 square kilometers. Earlier, Minister for Water Emma Hardy said that the government is committed to stopping bottom trawling on areas that damage the MPAs.\nIn recent years, the UK government has established 178 MPAs covering nearly 900,000 square kilometers of English waters. However, most of these areas are multi-use, meaning that activities that damage the environment can take place if they do not directly impact the specified protected features.\nDamaging and extractive activities are only banned in Highly Protected Areas, of which the UK has just three. This forms the basis for the recent calls to have the government expand the network for the highly protected areas to 10% of UK waters by 2030.\nThe announcement by Reed comes days after UK MPs endorsed the ban on bottom trawling. In a report by the cross-party House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee, the MPs called on government to ban activities that damage UK’s seabed in the offshore MPAs. In the report, the committee recommends relevant ministries to issue a statement no later than January 2026, and clearly set out government’s priorities for marine usage - including how it plans to balance marine exploitation and protection.\nIn an analysis last year, environmental campaign group Oceana said that UK’s MPAs are highly affected by bottom trawling. Out of over 100,000 hours of industrial fishing that took place in UK’s MPAs in 2023, 33,000 hours were from vessels carrying destructive bottom-towed gear, such as bottom trawls and dredges."

        "content": "\nIran is reportedly procuring a further consignment of sodium perchlorate from Chinese manufacturers, as feedstock to produce ammonium perchlorate used to fuel Iran’s solid-fueled ballistic missiles, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The newspaper was unspecific about the source of the information, other than it was provided by “officials” in Washington - which does not necessarily mean that the leak originated from US government sources.\nSodium perchlorate when further refined in Iran into ammonium perchlorate makes up 70 percent of the standard fuel load of most of Iran’s solid-fueled ballistic missiles. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) inventory of solid fuel ballistic missiles contains both longer range missiles such as the Khybar-Shikan and Fattah, used in Iran’s True Promise attacks against Israel. But it also includes shorter range missiles such as Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar systems exported to Russia for its war on Ukraine.\nIran was spotted shipping Fath-360 solid fueled ballistic missiles to Russia across the Caspian Sea in January, and is believed to have increased its exports since then. The US base at Al Asad in Iraq has been attacked on at least two occasions by Iranian Fateh-313 solid fuel ballistic missiles. The Houthi solid fueled Palestine-2 missile being used currently for attacks against Israel is believed to be either an Iranian Fattah missile, or a derivation of it assembled locally in facilities which have probably since been destroyed in recent US/UK air attacks.\nThe WSJ report indicates that the new consignment, to be shipped in pellet form, will be sufficient to fuel 800 ballistic missiles. MVsGolbonandJairan, the two ships which carried Iran’s first consignment of sodium perchlorate, loaded a total of 58 containers, sufficient apparently to fuel 240 missiles. Hence, it appears that the new consignment is more than three times as large as the first, and will need to be shipped in about 185 20-foot containers. Not just for capacity reasons, but also because of its dangerous cargo status and the need to disperse the risk, the consignment looks as if it will again need at least two container ships, probably more, to bring the material safely home to Iran. As an IRGC- controlled activity, the import responsibility for the shipment is likely to be assigned to Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), as was the first consignment.\nAt least three medium-sized container ships owned by IRISL are currently in the CMK/K14 anchorage off Shanghai. MVsBarzin(IMO 9820269),Rayen(IMO 9820245) andBehta(IMO 9349590), under these or previous names, have all been subject by name to US Treasury sanctions, as IRISL has been. For the present, besides their ownership, current location and cargo-carrying characteristics, there is nothing to link these ships to the consignment which the WSJ reports is inbound to Iran.\n\nThe initial explosion at Bandar Abbas Commercial Port, April 26 (Tasnim News Agency - CC by 4.0)\n\nTo the annoyance of reformist-aligned politicians in Iran, the authorities in Bandar Abbas have still not been able to provide a convincing explanation as to what exploded so violently in the Rajaei Port container park on April 26. Reports that the material which exploded was sodium perchlorate off MVsGolbonandJairanhave not been countered. Satellite imagery has clearly identified the primary source of the explosion within the port logistics area at 27.124011°N 56.068211°E. But recently-published video on social media shows that in the aftermath there were at least three separate fires burning in the container park, with one seen being tackled by a water-carrying helicopter, suggesting that simultaneous sabotage at different points may have occurred. However, the size of the projected new consignment adds further weight to the attribution, suggesting that the first consignment of material was destroyed and needs to be replaced. In any case, Iranian missile production - and the need for solid rocket fuel - has significantly increased in recent months, because of increased exports to Russia and elsewhere and the need to replace stocks expended in the True Promise attacks against Israel.\n\nWSJ: The April explosion in Iran, triggered by Quds Force Unit 190, destroyed Chinese ammonium perchlorate meant for proxy militias’ missile production.WSJ also confirms earlier reports that Iran has, for the first time, provided long-range ballistic missiles to Shia militias…pic.twitter.com/8YyZMQ7Dq7\nFires burning in the Rajaei Port container park days after the initial explosion on April 26\n\nPost the safe return of MVsGolbonandJairan, theUS Treasury announcedon April 29 that it had sanctioned an additional six companies and six individuals based in Iran and China for their roles in the network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of the IRGC. Besides those sanctioned in Iran, five Chinese companies based in Hunan and Shandong Provinces involved in the manufacture of dual-use chemicals have been sanctioned: Yanling Chuanxing Chemical, Dongying Weiaien Chemical, China Chlorate Tech, Shenzhen Amor Logistics and Yanling Lingfeng Chlorate.\nElsewhere, another IRISL ship known historically to have been involved in arms shipments is on its way home from Libya. The MVElyana(IMO: 9165827) had lingered for three weeks in an anchorage off Tobruk, but left on May 30, possibly having come into the port briefly on the day of its departure. By June 5 the MVElyanawas stationary in the Suez South Anchorage, post a southerly transit of the Suez Canal, and will presumably soon set sail via the Bab el Mandeb for Bandar Abbas.\n"

The four-day battle in May 1942 was a significant turning point during WWII. Japanese forces had enacted Operation MO with the intention of capturing Tulagi in the Solomons and Port Moresby in New Guinea. Had they been successful, the occupation would have led to Japanese aerial dominance over northeast Australia and the sea lanes connecting Australia with the United States.\nU.S and Australian allied forces were decisive in defeating the Japanese in the battle, which introduced a new mode of fighting that relied on airpower rather than cannonfire. The entire four-day battle was fought using aircraft and aircraft carriers and marked the first time naval engagement took place without opposing ships ever making contact. The Battle of the Coral Sea had significant casualties, with the U.S losing over 600 servicemen.\nIn 2018, a search led by US billionaire Paul Allen's research organization located the wreck ofLexington, which went down during the battle with the loss of 216 crew and 35 aircraft.\n\nAustralia, which regards the Battle of the Coral Sea as the \"Battle that saved Australia,\" has now added the site where the three ships are resting to the National Heritage List. Sitting more than 3,000 meters below the ocean surface, the shipwrecks are incredibly well preserved.\n“The Second World War was a time of such terrible and unimaginable loss suffered by so many and the Battle of the Coral Sea was central to keeping Australians at home safe,” said Murray Watt, Minister for the Environment. “By including the site on the National Heritage List, we can ensure greater protection for a number of historic shipwrecks while preserving a significant piece of world history for future generations.”"

        "content": "\nNewly released data shows the depth of decline both for car and container imports into the U.S. in May. The uncertainties and back and forth on tariffs have taken a toll but the expectation is that importers will rush to bring goods in before the short-term pause on tariff increases is due to expire.\nCar volumes were among the most impacted during May according to a report from Automotive News using information from logistics productivity data provider Descartes. Motor vehicle imports were off 72.3 percent in May as car companies paused shipments waiting for more favorable tariff conditions.  The well-known car industry reporter Kelly Blue Book writes that the auto industry’s pattern has been to have 60 days of inventory on hand and 15 days worth in transit. Automakers’ inventory was down to 66 days at the end of April according to the report. It however highlighted in May that brands Jaguar and Land Rover had restarted U.S. shipments after a pause due to the tariffs.\nDescartes released similar container import data that shows that monthly imports fell nearly 10 percent from April to May and were down over seven percent versus the year earlier. It notes that this was the first time May container volumes were down in the last seven years except for 2020 during the pandemic.\nVolumes from China were off more dramatically where its share of U.S. imports fell to just over 29 percent. Containers coming from China were off more than 20 percent month-over-month and 28.5 percent year-over-year. It was the steepest monthly decline in five years and contributed to 30 percent volume declines for both the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\n“After several months of import growth and following a wave of front loading of shipments in April, the impact of new tariffs began to materialize in May,” said Jackson Wood, at Descartes. “The effects of U.S. policy shifts with China are also now clearly visible in monthly trade flows.”\nThe retailers’ trade association National Retail Federation agrees highlighting that with front loading April’s volume was 2.21 million TEU which was up three percent over March and nearly 10 percent year-over-year.\nThe retailers note that the pause in tariffs on reciprocal tariffs is due to last till July 9, and for Chinese imports it is due to last until August 12. Donald Trump however infers that a deal is being finalized for the Chinese trade. U.S. and Chinese trade representatives were meeting again on Monday to go over the points the White House announced. However, unless that deal is reached the NRF highlights in the rush to get merchandise into the U.S., the peak for the winter holiday imports will come early and be simultaneous with the peak end of summer/fall season imports creating a rush on the ports.\nThe NRF is raising its forecasted container volume for June up 17.5 percent to 2.01 million TEU and up 20 percent in July to 2.13 million TEU. This reflects the lead time to get shipments moving and the rush to beat the scheduled tariff increases.\n“This is the busiest time of the year for retailers as they enter the back-to-school season and prepare for the fall-winter holiday season,” said NRF Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold. “Retailers had paused their purchases and imports previously because of the significantly high tariffs. They are now looking to get those orders and cargo moving in order to bring as much merchandise into the country as they can before the reciprocal tariff and additional China tariff pauses end in July and August.”\nRetailers are forecasting without trade agreements that volumes are expected to drop sharply for the remainder of 2025, with larger year-over-year decreases. The NRF points out that retailers last year rushed shipments due to concerns about longshore workers going on strike at U.S. East and Gulf Coast ports. The NRF however expects this year volumes could be down around 20 percent per month in September and October.\nThe NRF is urging the administration to reach agreements with trading partners to restore predictability and stability to the supply chain. Port officials, longshore workers, and others share the same concern as the fluctuations and drops in volumes take a toll on operations and members."

NOAA Fisheries handles quota and permit management for Alaska's increasingly challenged commercial fish stocks, including much-reduced populations of snow crab, king crab and cod.\nIn a regular status update released May 30, NMFS' Alaska office reported that it has shed 28 staffers since January 1, including people who left through retirement, voluntary separation, the DOGE-initiated \"deferred resignation program,\" or probationary period termination. The office provided brief biographies for 19 people who departed in the last 60 days, including their contributions and skills; for several personnel, the office described a loss of talent that was \"impactful\" or \"vital\" to the mission.\nAdvocacy group Oceana first reported the staff reductions, and warned that the cuts will likely reduce NOAA's ability to gather data and perform the science needed to guide Alaskan federal fisheries towards long-term sustained yields.\n\"Losing one quarter of the regional staff in six months is a direct threat to fisheries, ocean animals and marine ecosystems in the state and beyond,\" said Ben Enticknap, Pacific Campaign Director & Senior Scientist for Oceana. \"Without adequate staffing at NOAA Fisheries the whole fishery management system is at risk, making it ever harder to tackle critical issues.\"\nSome fishermen are also concerned that the reduction in staffing at NMFS could hit Alaska's commercial fishing interests, too. \"The indiscriminate firing of NOAA personnel could cripple our fisheries,\" Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association director Linda Behnken told the Alaska Beacon earlier this year. \"The impact to resources and the seafood industry will be substantial unless the administration corrects course.\"\nThe staffing cuts may already be having an impact. Last month, NFMS missed the deadline for an Endangered Species Act review for Chinook salmon in the Gulf of Alaska, and now faces a lawsuit for failing to complete it on time.\nThe cuts come as the NMFS is working out a new framework for fisheries management, focused on \"restoring American seafood competitiveness.\" The agency is also planning to revise its interpretation of the Endangered Species Act to narrow its application and remove any consideration of habitat impacts."

This comes as the media is reporting the Indian government decided not to file criminal charges against MSC Mediterranean Shipping and instead is collecting more evidence for insurance claims while MSC continues to work with the country to recover from the casualty.\nTheMSC Elsa 3was lost on May 25 while it was 13 nautical miles off the Kerala coast. The small feeder ship built in 1997 was 23,000 dwt and had 640 containers aboard. At least 100 were reported lost overboard with 61 having so far washed ashore.\nThe focus is on controlling and stopping the oil that is seeping from the ship. Two offshore support vessels have remained at the site using dispersal techniques for a small amount of oil that is escaping from the vessel. So far, the Indian authorities insist the oil has not reached the coastline, but fishing in the area remains restricted. Reports indicate there are more than 80 tons of diesel and over 360 tons of heavy fuel aboard. An Indian Coast Guard pollution response vessel also remains on site.\n\n\nContainers floating at the wreck site (Indian Coast Guard)\n\nThe Diving Support VesselSEAMEC IIIhas now been deployed to the wreck site with a team of 12 divers aboard. The vessel has ROVs aboard as well as diving equipment, and a decompression system for diving to the wreck is at oxygen levels. Starting today, June 9, the operation is identifying openings for the fuel tanks. The divers will be working to cap the tanks to prevent further seepage.\nA site survey began on June 5 using a multibeam system to map the location. This data is also being analyzed for the second phase of the operation which is scheduled to start July 3 after the monsoons but subject to weather. In July, they plan to use hot tapping to remove the oil from the tanks.\nAt the same time, they report that 51 containers have been removed from the shoreline. Another 10 are currently being salvaged including some that are partially submerged. The authorities report that none of the 61 containers that came ashore contained hazardous substances.\nSeveral of the containers however did contain small plastic beads, nurdles, and they have been washing up along the coastline. Trained volunteers will be joining the efforts on the coastline to find and remove the pollution that is coming ashore.\n\n\nCoast Guard survey the boxes on the shoreline which have now been salvaged (Indian Coast Guard)\n\nThe Directorate reports MSC is closely involved having retained T&T Salvage of Singapore for the dive operation. Marine Emergency Response Services of India was also hired to manage the onshore efforts.\nThe state government met with representatives for the ship’s P&I club, which is listed by Equasis as the Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association with the UK P&I Club. They have also met with the ship’s owners, which Equasis reports has been with MSC for the past decade. The state government has agreed at this phase to pursue a settlement with the club following the law while it collects evidence regarding the vessel and the factors that caused it to sink so quickly while underway from Vizhinjam to Kochi. Reports have said the investigators believe there were problems with the vessel’s ballasting system that caused it to develop a 26-degree list which led to its sinking."

        "content": "\nAfter the U.S. Treasury sanctioned a Singapore-based cargo inspection company last month, the firm has laid off most of its staff and is winding down operations, according to local media.\nOn May 13, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) blacklisted Chinese-owned inspection company CCIC Singapore for allegedly facilitating Iranian oil shipping. According to the Treasury, CCIC Singapore provided the cargo inspection services for a ship-to-ship transfer of about two million barrels of Iranian crude from the sanctioned VLCC Siri (ex name Anthea). In addition, the firm allegedly provided the same services for the sanctioned tanker Hecate, and may have provided fake papers that falsely certified the oil cargo as \"Malaysian\" - a common fiction for Iranian-origin crude headed for the Chinese market. The Treasury asserted that Iranian government front company Sepehr Energy \"consistently relied\" on CCIC Singapore for inspections of Iranian crude cargoes.\nU.S. sanctions are a powerful deterrent for most potential customers, and can have drastic effects on a business. An OFAC designation also typically freezes some or all bank accounts belonging to the affected firm, with immediate effects on operations. Three former employees of CCIC Singapore told CNA that the company laid off about 300 people effective June 1, and that layoff notices had referenced a \"pending liquidation.\"\nSalary payments for the month of May were also delayed because of frozen bank accounts, they said. Dismissal notices warned that payouts would occur only after the firm's liquidation was completed, likely in mid-2026.\nThe firm confirmed to CNA that the impact of sanctions was greater than expected, and it said that it has been forced to cease operations in Singapore. \"This decision was extremely challenging for the management team, but it is a rational choice that had to be made under the current circumstances,\" the company told CNA in a statement."

Without a physical altercation, Israeli operatives boarded the vessel and took control of the situation on board. Now that the vessel has arrived in Ashdod, the activists will be provided with a viewing of footage of the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023 for educational purposes, according to Israeli defense minister Israel Katz.\nThe activists' original intent was to reach the shores of Gaza and deliver a symbolic amount of food and medical aid to local residents. Gaza has not received full-scale food imports since early March because of certain border control factors, and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC, the UN's reference system for degree of deprivation) classifies the food supply status in all areas of the territory as a Phase 4 nutrition \"emergency,\" with risk of edging into famine. If theMadleen'svoyage had been successful, it would have been a small but rare breach of Israel's naval cordon, which has successfully blocked unauthorized cargo flows to and from Gaza for nearly two decades.\nAs is typical for all discussions of Gaza, opposing sides quickly began fighting over the narrative framing for the IDF's interdiction of theMadleen. Israel's supporters have described it as a justified security action to sustain the naval blockade of Gaza, and have attempted to portray the activists as publicity-hungry \"antisemites.\" The activists' supporters have described the boarding in international waters as an act of state-sanctioned piracy, a category equivalent to Iran's vessel seizures in international waters of the Gulf of Oman. In a strongly-worded official statement, Turkey's foreign ministry went a step further, asserting that the intercept was evidence of malign intent in Israeli foreign policy."

        "content": "\nAfter a series of problems and strong opposition locally and from Donald Trump, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind made it official that it is backing away from its plan for a 1.5 GW wind farm off New Jersey. Media reports indicate the company filed a petition with New Jersey regulators to cancel licenses it has held since 2021.\nAtlantic Shores was developing Project 1, a proposed 1.5 GW wind farm which it said would provide power for approximately 700,000 homes. It has repeatedly cited the project as the most developed of the proposals for New Jersey. In October 2024, it received Construction and Operations Plan (COP) approvals from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) for both phases one and two of its plan, or a total of 2.8 GW of power capacity.\nDespite saying it stood ready to deliver, the project had not been selected by New Jersey regulators for a power purchase agreement. New Jersey in February 2025 closed its fourth round without selecting any projects. Atlantic Shores was one of three projects bidding in the round.\nThe company was established as a joint venture between Shell and EDF Renewables but early in 2025, Shell announced it was backing away from its investments into offshore wind power. Atlantic Shores however said it was still committed to proceeding with its plan which also called for investments in New Jersey’s planned Wind Port in the southern part of the state in Salem, New Jersey.\nDonald Trump had campaigned in New Jersey in 2024 specifically mentioning this project in his opposition to offshore wind power. In January, Trump signed an executive order freezing permitting and putting the sector under review. Shortly after that, the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew approval on an air quality permit for Atlantic Shores that would have covered construction and operations. EPA said the permitting had been rushed and required more review.\nAtlantic Shores is reported to have filed on June 4 with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to terminate its Offshore Renewable Energy Certificates (OREC). The board meets monthly with its next session scheduled for June 18.\nThe withdrawal is the latest blow for the industry and specifically New Jersey which has not been able to move forward with the governor’s plans. Murphy originally called for 3.5 GW of offshore wind power by 2030 but later revised the plan to 7.5 GW by 2035. The state’s first setback came in late 2023 when Ørsted canceled plans for two large offshore projects that were set to begin construction. Governor Murphy’s term comes to an end in early 2026 likely without any wind projects approved for construction.\nAtlantic Shores holds three lease areas totaling more than 400 square miles off the New Jersey coast near Atlantic City and in the New York Bight. According to media reports, the company referred in the filing to this period as a “reset” while saying it remains “ready to deliver.”\nThe filing, the Asbury Park Press newspaper reports, cites the uncertainty caused by the Presidential Wind Memorandum. It also cites the loss of the EPA permit and other actions taken by the “current administration.” It says that it was forced to materially reduce personnel, terminate contracts, and cancel planned project investments.\nAnother proposed offshore wind farm for New Jersey, Leading Light, has also delayed its review process with regulators. It cited problems in completing its plan due to challenges locating an alternate turbine manufacturer after GE Vernova canceled plans for its 18 MW turbine. The project, which is being led by Chicago-based Invenergy and energyRE, asked the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities for delays after it won its approvals in January 2024 for a massive 2.4 GW wind farm to be located approximately 40 miles off the southern New Jersey coast.\n\nTop photo by by Bruce Emmlering (Public domain Free Photo)"

        "content": "\nFollowing a series of setbacks and combat losses in the Black Sea Fleet, Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed off on a new strategy to revamp his country's battered image as a naval power.\nKremlin aide Nikolai Patrushev - who served alongside Putin in the Soviet KGB - told Russian state media this week that a new, as-yet-unrevealed strategy has been finalized. In an interview, he described Russia's maritime-power status as \"gradually recovering.\"\n\"It is impossible to carry out such work without a long-term vision of the scenarios for the development of the situation in the oceans, the evolution of challenges and threats, and, of course, without defining the goals and objectives facing the Russian Navy,\" Patrushev told state-owned Argumenti i Facti.\nThe Russian Navy is powerful, but has had serious setbacks over the past several years. Sanctions have made it harder to get key parts and equipment for shipbuilding and ship repair, slowing down Russia's shipyard sector. The service's sole aircraft carrier, the agingAdmiral Kuznetzov,has been under repair since at least 2018; some analysts believe that it will never deploy again, leaving Russia without the prestige and power projection capability of carrier aviation.\nWorst of all, Ukraine - which lacks any conventional warships - has damaged or destroyed about one third of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, purely through the use of drone boat attacks and missile strikes. Ukrainian \"Magura\" unmanned boats continue to disrupt Russian operations in the northern Black Sea, even near the Russian stronghold of Novorossiysk.\nUkraine's modern methods have raised questions about the future of naval warfare, and about the role of unmanned vessels in open-ocean combat. In the interview, Patrushev said that the new Russian naval strategy \"answers the fundamental question of what Russia’s naval power must look like in order to effectively defend its interests in the world’s oceans.\"\nFurther details of the plan have not been released, but Putin previously announced a $100 billion shipbuilding budget for 2025-35."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The threats of tariffs, port fees from the U.S. on Chinese-built ships, and a slowing overall market for newbuilds have yet to chip away at China’s leadership in shipbuilding. The latest data from Clarkson Research points to China’s continued dominance while South Korea and others look for new strategies to take advantage of the uncertainties in the market.\nShipbuilding orders overall are off dramatically in the first five months of 2025 compared to the record pace of 2024. Clarkson’s data shows that total orders were down by more than half (55 percent) with analysts commenting that it is the first sign of uncertainty, the issues in global trade, and falling freight rates. This is despite a record pace for containership orders which are at an all-time high with the total capacity on order up nearly 50 percent from a year ago.\nChinese shipbuilders continued to lead the orders in the first five months of the year with Clarkson calculating they booked 7.86 million compensated gross tons or nearly half the orders compared to 3.1 CGT for South Korea which represented 24 percent of the global market. Total orders worldwide were calculated at 15.92 million CGT.\nWhile the U.S. released the details of its plan for port fees in mid-April, orders continued a similar pattern in May. China booked 39 percent of global orders (640,000 CGT) or a total of 42 ships. South Korea booked just 15 percent of the orders in May or 250,000 CGT for eight ships while in a market anomaly, France rivaled China with nearly a third of the orders, or 546,000 CGT, driven by MSC Cruises' large cruise ship order.\nKorea’s shipbuilders however are working to make inroads and according to the media reports are planning to expand their aggressive bidding for containership orders. Last year, China held nearly 87 of the containership construction market share but the Koreans are highlighting their expertise in high-value shipbuilding such as methanol-fueled ships, LNG, and future technologies. The Korean media points to reports that Ocean Network Express (ONE) and Hapag-Lloyd are meeting with Korean shipbuilders, but Tradewinds reported that MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company told Nor-Shipping last week that the U.S.’s port fees would not be a barrier to orders in China.\nThe South Koreans also point to the fact that their CGT per vessel was nearly double China’s in May. They point to this as evidence that they are winning orders for more complex and larger ships. South Korea has traditionally dominated the high-value segment for LNG and other gas carriers and looks to use this also with containerships going forward.\nConstruction slots are booked three or more years ahead at some of the large shipyards, especially in South Korea, which some speculate might also be a reason the Korean yards are lagging behind their Chinese competitors. However, as global ordering has slowed, the backlog is starting to thin. South Korea currently has 22 percent of the total global orderbook, 36.3 million CGT versus China’s 96.4 million CGT backlog which equals 59 percent of the global order total.\nThe U.S. trade representative continues to push forward with the plan to launch port fees later this year on Chinese-built ships. Last week, it released revisions for the fees planned for all vehicle carriers arriving in the U.S., but so far, the threat of the fees seems to have done little to drive orders away from Chinese shipbuilders."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nIn the early hours of June 10, in what appears to be the first such long-range operation, the Israeli Navy was used to strike Houthi-controlled port facilities on the Red Sea coastline. There were no immediate reports of civilian casualties post the strike, nor indications posted by either side of the damage caused.\nThe previous evening, the Israeli Defense Force Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee had sent out a social media warning for civilians tokeep awayfrom port areas in Ras Isa, Al Salif and Hodeidah until further notice.\nThe Israeli Navy will have used Sa'ar Class corvettes to mount the attack, of which they have a fleet of 15 ships. The latest Sa'ar 6 vessels are equipped with an Oto Melara 76 mm main gun, plus Gabriel and Harpoon missiles. These missiles, normally used in the anti-shipping role, can be fired from a substantial stand-off range. The corvettes can also carry a medium-sized helicopter, for either reconnaissance or for firing additional missiles at ground targets.\nUse of the Israeli Navy, rather than repeating the long-range strikes previously carried out by the Israeli Air Force, is probably more cost effective with less combat risk than complex air operations involving surveillance, tanker, and air defense suppression aircraft. At least two Israeli naval vessels are likely to have been used, so as to ensure mutual support. The Sa'ar Class corvettes are also equipped with C-Dome, a naval version of the Iron Dome air defense system, as well as the medium range Barak-8.  Together, these two systems would have given commanders some confidence that any Houthi missile or drone counter-attack could be fought off.\n\n\nJafa UAV on launch using jet-assisted take off (Houthi social media video)\n\nThe attack is likely to have been mounted for two reasons. Damage inflicted in earlier attacks of the Houthi-controlled ports appears to have been less severe than previously indicated, with the Houthis well-used to make-do rudimentary docking arrangements and able to bring the ports quickly back into service. Secondly, the Houthis have continued to fire missiles and drones at Israel, none of which of late have hit targets, but which nonetheless have caused considerable disruption and expenditure in air defense missiles.\nIn recent attacks, the Houthis are believed to have used an improved one-way drone, based on the Sammad system. The Yafa drone, with a 50kg warhead, has a range of at least 1,600 miles at about 100mph. But at extended range, relying on a hybrid GPS and inertial guidance system, it is unlikely to be able to strike targets with pinpoint accuracy and hence is better suited to threatening civilian areas. The improved range of the Yafa does mean however that it can be deployed on attack vectors from the West, threatening Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast and placing an additional burden on the Israeli Navy to cover sea approaches."

        "content": "\nThe global shipping industry must invest hundreds of billions of dollars in new technologies and alternative fuels to achieve net-zero emissions, maritime leaders said at an international forum in Monaco last weekend.\nSpeaking at the Blue Economy Finance Forum on Sunday, IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez said that no matter what happens with new global carbon regulations, the sector's decarbonization effort will require stepped-up cooperation between shipping companies, fuel producers and port operators worldwide.\n\"Regulations alone cannot do the job,\" Mr. Dominguez told attendees. \"We need technological development and we need alternative fuels. And that can only happen in one way — with investment.\"\nThe shipping industry burns roughly 350 million tons of fuel oil annually and accounts for nearly 3 percent of worldwide carbon emissions. It is on the verge of a major regulatory change: Under the new carbon framework agreed at MEPC 83, all ocean-going vessels engaged in international trade will be subject to mandatory emissions standards.\nIndustry executives acknowledged the scale of the challenge ahead. Christine Cabau-Woehrel, executive vice president of the French shipping giant CMA CGM, described the transition as \"a complete transformation of the shipping business.\"\n\"It will take ecosystems to do it together,\" Ms. Cabau-Woehrel said. \"It will be a long and difficult journey, but we want to be running in front.\"\nThe container shipping sector has already committed $150 billion to decarbonization, according to Joe Kramek, president of the World Shipping Council. At least 200 boxships can run on zero or near-zero emission fuels, while nearly 80 percent of new orders for container ships and vehicle carriers will have similar capabilities.\n\"The liner industry has already invested $150 billion in decarbonization,\" Mr. Kramek said, speaking at the forum. \"It is unprecedented for the transport sector. But we need the fuel supply — it's a tremendous investment opportunity.\"\nThe industry faces significant logistical hurdles beyond developing cleaner fuels. Port infrastructure worldwide will need major upgrades to safely store and distribute alternative fuels to visiting ships. Nearly half a million seafarers will require new training by 2030 to handle advanced fuel systems and safety protocols.\nThe new regulations represent a two-pronged approach: establishing global fuel standards that disincentivize greenhouse gas intensity while creating economic incentives for early overcompliance. The rules will be reviewed every five years, with emission limits tightened progressively over time.\nMr. Dominguez emphasized that the maritime sector could no longer rely solely on voluntary commitments and diplomatic statements. \"It's time for us to move from the statements and commitments into actions,\" he said. \"That's what we've been doing at IMO for over a decade. That is what we are going to demonstrate again in October, and we will not stop there.\""

Israel issued a similar warning on May 10 and a week dropped approximately 35 bombs on the Hodeidah and Salif ports, destroying infrastructure.\nToday’s warning came in Arabic posted on social media by spokesman Col. Avichay Adraee of the Israel Defense Force. He called it an “important and urgent” warning everyone in and near Ras Isa, Hodeidah, and Salif ports. They were told to evacuate and stay away until further notice.”\nHe wrote that the warning was “Due to the terrorist Houthi regime's use of the seaports for its terrorist activities.” Israel has claimed in the past that the ports are being used to bring weapons into the country including the missiles and drones being launched toward Israel.\nThe Times of Israel reports the Houthis have fired seven ballistic missiles and at least one drone at Israel since the May 16 strikes on the ports. It reports that a missile fired earlier today fell short of reaching Israel.  Previous strikes have hit residential areas and at least once the area around Israel’s main airport, Ben Gurion International Airport, located southwest of Tel Aviv.\n\n#????????? ??? ?????????? ?? ??????? ??????? ???? ????? ????? ?????? ?????? ??????????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ????? ??? ?????????????? ????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ????? ?????? ????????? ??? ???? ?????????? ?? ??? ???????…pic.twitter.com/8Yjo0HA4Dt\n\nDuring the last series of strikes, Israel sent 15 fighter jets. The mission was supported with refueling planes and surveillance planes. After the strike, Israel said it believed it had severely damaged the port infrastructure and expected operations would not be possible for some time. Lloyd’s List had reported the first bulker entered the port Salif on May 31.\nIt is unclear how much vessel traffic has been able to return to the ports. The Houthis however contended that several vessels were damaged during the attack while reports have said they were not giving ships permission to leave the ports. Russia reported that its seafarers on one damaged vessel were evacuated in May after several seafarers were injured possibly in a U.S. attack on the seaports.\nWhile the Houthis have not fired on merchant ships in the Red Sea area this year, they shifted operations to fire long-range missiles toward Israel. They have repeated threatened to attack the port of Haifa.\nIsrael after the last attacks said it would continue to retaliate. It also threatened the leaders of the Houthi movement citing similar assassinations of the leaders within Hamas and Hezbollah.\nIn earlier attacks, Israel target power stations in Yemen, weapons storage areas, the Houthi stronghold of Sanaa and the city's airport. After the extensive U.S. strikes between March and May, there however were reports that with Iran's aid the Houthis were already starting to rearm.\n"

        "content": "A new report looking at the trends in bulker operations and causalities over the past decade points to what the trade group INTERCARGO calls “encouraging progress” in safety, vessel losses, and fatalities. The group points out that with over 12,500 bulk carriers in service globally and demand for dry cargo trade growing, the industry must continue to focus on safety improvements.\nOver the past decade, the sector has recorded 20 causalities on vessels of 10,000 or greater dwt. While the number is down dramatically, INTERCARGO calculates it still resulted in 89 seafarers losing their lives or an average of nine fatalities per year, and many more put in harm’s way. By comparison, it however highlights that the losses have been on a steady decline since the 1980s and 1990s into the 2000s. Between 1990 and 2000, INTERCARGO reports the sector experienced annual losses of between five and 26 vessels and fatalities ranging between 23 and 186 per year.\nThe report attributes the decline in casualties to elements including better crew training, improved ship design, new technology, and stronger regulatory compliance. Yet it sees three factors as the most dangerous to the industry. It says cargo liquefaction is the greatest risk to lives having accounted for nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of the seafarers killed while the similar challenge of cargo shifting sank two other vessels and cost 12 lives. The greatest risk to vessels however is grounding, which accounted for nearly half (45 percent) of the vessels lost in the past decade.\nWhile it notes there were several high-profile large vessel causalities, such as theWakashioandStellar Banner, each lost in 2020, most of the casualties come among the smaller (50,000 to 59,000 dwt) sector or smaller vessels under 35,000 dwt and over 80,000 dwt.\nINTERCARGO however emphasizes that significant risks persist, particularly those related to improperly declared cargoes, navigational failures, and delays in the submission of accident investigation reports by flag States. It notes that the average reporting time remains over two years, which it says is severely hindering the industry’s ability to learn and implement timely corrective actions.\nIt also cites the fact that three of the vessels lost in the attacks by the Houthis were bulkers. It notes that four seafarers were lost in those attacks which it says also had a broader impact on the sector and shipping in general. It notes the safety concerns raised by the Houthi attacks led to difficulties in recruiting seafarers.\nAs a trade group, it commits to working with international bodies and others to continue the progress in the sector. It also reiterates its call for a collective industry commitment to achieving zero loss of life and ships."

The French territory has designated an area equal to 23 percent of its exclusive economic zone for conservation, free of industrial fishing - a meaningful success for the \"30x30\" ecosystem protection movement.\nSpeaking at the United Nations Ocean Conference, President Moetai Brotherson unveiled plans that will establish highly protected zones covering a total of 1.1 million square kilometers — an area roughly twice the size of France.\nThe ambitious conservation initiative will create two major sanctuary zones: an area of 220,000 square kilometers near the Society Islands and another of 680,000 square kilometers near the Gambier Islands. Combined with new artisanal-only fishing areas spanning 186,000 square kilometers, the protected waters will total more than 1 million square kilometers (more than 400,000 square miles).\n\"In French Polynesia, the ocean is much more than a territory — it's the source of life, culture, and identity,\" President Brotherson said in his announcement. \"These measures will make French Polynesia a central player in global ocean governance.\"\nThe designation represents a significant expansion of marine conservation efforts in the Pacific, where small island nations have increasingly taken the lead in ocean protection.\nUnder the new protections, industrial fishing, mining and other extractive activities will be banned in the highly protected zones. The artisanal fishing zones will only allow pole-and-line fishing from boats shorter than 39 feet, preserving local fishing practices while excluding commercial operations.\n\"This level of ambition is what the world needs to help turn the tide back in favor of a healthy and productive ocean,\" said Razan Al Mubarak, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nThe initiative follows years of advocacy by communities in the Austral and Marquesas islands, who have called for stronger marine protections to preserve their environment and traditional ways of life.\nPresident Brotherson also announced plans to establish additional protected areas near the Austral and Marquesas islands within the next year, which would increase the territory's highly protected waters to 2.5 million square kilometers — more than half of French Polynesia's EEZ.\nThe territory has also committed to banning deep-sea mining and drifting fish aggregating devices, while strengthening public participation in ocean management and fisheries oversight.\nThe announcement comes as scientists warn that ocean ecosystems face mounting pressures from climate change, overfishing and pollution, making large-scale conservation efforts increasingly critical for marine biodiversity preservation.\nTop image: Hiva Oa, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia (Rita Willaert / CC BY NC SA 2.0)"

        "content": "\nFor the first time, China's PLA Navy has dispatched two aircraft carriers simultaneously into the Western Pacific, beyond the boundary of the First Island Chain. Chinese Navy spokesperson Senior Capt. Wang Xuemeng confirmed on Tuesday that the carriers were deployed \"to test the forces' capabilities in far seas defense.\"\nOn Saturday, Japanese forces spotted the Chinese carrier Shandong operating just east of the Strait of Luzon, about 300 nautical miles south of Miyako Island. On Monday, Shandong was seen conducting aircraft launch and recovery at a position far out in the Philippine Sea, east of Okinotori Atoll.\nMeanwhile, on Saturday, the Chinese carrier Liaoning was spotted in the Japanese EEZ near the island of Minamatori, beyond the edge of the Second Island Chain. It is the first time that a Chinese carrier has passed this strategic boundary.\nIn addition to the carrier strike groups, two Chinese surface action groups and one amphibious assault group are also operating in the Western Pacific - a total of more than 20 warships and auxiliaries.\nThese movements are part of a pattern of increasingly ambitious Chinese naval deployments. In years past, the PLA Navy was highly active in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, and often ventured just east of Taiwan for drills, but had a comparatively limited presence in the deep waters of the Western Pacific. The carrier deployments signal the ability to project power into the sea lanes that American forces would use to reach Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\nThe pace of advance of China's naval capability has drawn concern in the West. China now has a larger navy (by fleet count) than the United States, and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last month that China was a \"peer competitor\" and a top priority for deterrence. It has been less than a year since Shandong and Liaoning conducted their first dual-carrier exercise, itself a major milestone for Chinese sea power. The PLA Navy has two in-service carriers and a third is currently in sea trials; a fourth, said to have nuclear propulsion, is under construction."

        "content": "\nFour Mexican fishermen who repeatedly crossed over into the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone to fish for snapper have been charged under the Lacey Act for trafficking in illegally-taken wildlife. It is the first time in recent memory that federal charges have been brought against Mexican nationals in the U.S. Gulf for illegal fishing, and represents an apparent end to the \"catch and release\" policies that returned violators to Mexico without charges.\nFishermen from Playa Bagdad, Mexico routinely cross into the U.S. EEZ to pursue lucrative red snapper, typically using longline methods. The Mexican snapper fishery is overfished and depleted, and resources in U.S. waters are more attractive. Historically, the U.S. Coast Guard's response to these incursions has been limited to vessel confiscation and deportation, and the same fishermen often return later aboard new boats. The trade is widely believed to have links to Mexican organized crime groups.\nOn the night of April 16, four men - named as Jose Daniel Santiago-Mendoza, 22; Miguel Angel Ramirez-Vidal, 32; Jesus David Luna-Marquez, 20; and Jesus Roberto Morales-Amador, 27 - boarded a 25-foot lancha and got under way for the U.S. EEZ. After crossing the boundary, they transited to an area about 25 miles east of South Padre Island, Texas and deployed four miles of longline gear.\nU.S. authorities intercepted their vessel and found nearly 700 pounds of red snapper, valued at about $9,000.\nAll of the men had prior arrests for fishing violations in the United States. Ramirez-Vidal, the skipper on this voyage, had been arrested no less than 28 times previously for illegal fishing.\nAll four men have pleaded guilty to violations of the Lacey Act and will be sentenced by a U.S. federal judge. The maximum penalty is up to five years in jail and a fine of $250,000."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nSaying that “Russia’s goal is not peace,” and frustrated by the Trump administration’s lack of action on sanctions against Russia, the European Union outlined what it is calling “hard-biting sanctions” for its 18th package since the invasion of Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would move ahead with deep sanctions on oil, gas, energy products, shadow tankers, and the banking sector “because strength is the only language that Russia will understand.”\nOutlining the new package that will be presented to member states for a vote, von der Leyen asserted that the sanctions are deeply affecting the Russian economy. She said that Russia's oil and gas revenues have already fallen by almost 80 percent while interest rates are rising and the price for importing technologies and other goods have skyrocketed. Oil exports she admitted however still represent one-third of Russia's government revenues.\nThe EU has already voted to end Russian gas imports and now it is proposing to officially ban transactions related to the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines. While both remain closed since the explosion in September 2022, von der Leyen said, “There is no return to the past.”\nThey are also introducing a ban on the import of refined products based on Russian crude oil. In this way, the EU says it will prevent some of the Russian crude oil from reaching the EU market through the “back door.”\nThe EU has already listed 342 tankers that it says are in the shadow fleet and violating the G7 Price cap and other rules on moving Russian oil. The new package lists an additional 77 tankers as they continue to seek to stop the vessels that undertake the exports.\nFurther, the EU is joining with the UK which has already called for lowering the price cap imposed by the G7 for the sale of Russian oil. As the price of crude has fallen the current $60 cap has become less effective. Von der Leyen announced the EU will push the G7 at the upcoming meetings in Canada to lower the cap to $45 per barrel.\nThe other focus of the new sanctions is on the banking and finance sector. It proposed a wide series of actions including a full transaction ban and adding 22 more banks to the sanctions. It also calls for a transaction ban on financial operators in third countries that finance trade to Russia in circumvention of sanctions, and further export bans worth more than 2.5 billion euros targeting raw materials used in industry including machinery, metals, plastics, and chemicals. Finally, they also propose to apply the sanctions to 22 additional Russian and foreign companies providing direct or indirect support to Russia's military and industrial complex.\n“We need a real ceasefire, and Russia has to come to the negotiating table with a serious proposal,” said von der Leyen. “As it is up to today not showing willingness to achieve peace, we will step up pressure on Russia, including through further robust sanctions.”\nThe Trump administration has said it would consider additional sanctions while waving the potential of rolling back sanctions as an enticement to achieve a ceasefire and a negotiated end to the war. Donald Trump has spoken of the potential of more sanctions, but after the most recent peace talks failed, he said sometimes you just have to let both sides fight it out a while longer."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Canada’s BC Ferries announced it has selected China Merchants Industry Weihai Shipyard to build four new large ferries after a four-year procurement process. The company needs to replace an aging fleet but the selection of a Chinese yard may still raise controversy despite the fact that no Canadian shipyard participated in the bidding.\nThe company has been forced to go overseas for its new ferries turning to Germany, Poland, and Romania to build new ferries. It currently has four newdiesel-electric ferriesunder construction by Damen in Romania due for delivery in 2026. Seaspan which owns the largest shipyard in British Columbia said in the past it could not compete with the low-wage countries that have lower standards for the environment and safety.\nBC Ferries is seeking to blunt some of the critics by highlighting that in the first 10 years of service, the company anticipates spending over C$230 million (US$168 million) locally on refits and maintenance and more than C$1 billion (US$730 million) over the vessel’s 45-year lifespan.\n“CMI Weihai is a global leader in passenger ferry construction, and shipbuilding more broadly,” said Nicolas Jimenez, CEO of BC Ferries. “It was the clear choice based on the overall strength of its bid, including its technical capabilities, high-quality and safety standards, ferry-building experience, proven ability to deliver safe, reliable vessels on dependable timelines, and the overall cost and value it delivers for our customers – all essential as we continue to experience growing demand and the urgent need to renew our aging fleet.”\nBC Ferries references China Merchants' strong experience building passenger and vehicle ferries for large operations. It highlights the ongoing project with Stena RoRo for the E-Flexer class of RoPax ferries that are being deployed for companies including Corsica Linea, Brittany Ferries, and Canada’s Marine Atlantic ferry company. CMI is also working with Italy’s Grimaldi.\nThe new vessels are a critical component of BC Ferries’ strategic plan to replace aging vessels. They will take over from four vessels all over 50 years of age and in the case of theQueen of New Westminster65 years. Last year, the company says its operation of the aging vessel cost it C$14 million (US$10 million) in repairs and lost revenues while the vessel was out of service after itlost a propeller.\nThe new ships will start construction in late 2026 with the first vessel entering service in 2029. The fourth ship will enter service by 2031. They will be built with diesel-battery hybrid propulsion systems and designed with the capability to operate on full electric power in the future. They will also reduce underwater radiated noise. Critically they will have a greater capacity able to handle 52 percent more passengers and 24 percent more vehicles. BC Ferries declined to announce the cost for competitive reasons and future vessel procurement but said the contract is within the limits approved by the BC Ferries Commissioner.\nThe company highlights that it is also planning for a 15 percent growth in customers over the next decade. Since 2016, BC Ferries has added 10 new vessels to its fleet, including four mid-size Salish Class vessels and six smaller Island Class ships. With four more Island Class vessels arriving in 2026, and all four of the large new ferries expected to be in service between 2029 and 2031, BC Ferries remains on track to introduce 18 new vessels in 15 years."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe opposition from Australian shipbuilder Austal toward the proposed acquisition or investment by South Korea’s Hanwha Group continues. Austal filed a statement with the Australian Stock Exchange reporting it was seeking verification and written confirmation after Hanwha reported it had received U.S. approval to proceed with an investment in the Australian shipbuilder.\nHanwha Group issued a press release saying that it had received approval from the U.S. government “to acquire up to a 100 percent stake in Australia’s Austal.” Hanwha wrote that the U.S.’s Committee on Foreign Investment stated “there are no unresolved national security concerns,” with its proposal to acquire a 19.9 percent ownership stake in Austal.\n“This approval is a significant milestone that symbolizes Hanwha’s trust and support from the U.S. government,” the release said in a statement attributed to the CEO of Hanwha Global Defense Michael Coulter.\nAustal however reports it “sought independent verification” after receiving the information from Hanwha about the CFIUS approval. It notes it has also seen Hanwha’s statements in the media.\n“Based on informal discussions to date, Austal understands that the approval granted by CFIUS is different to that claimed by Hanwha,” Austal writes in its stock exchange filing dated June 10. The company reports it is “seeking written confirmation from CFIUS.”\nHanwha has been seeking to invest Austal after it was rebuffed by the Australian company in its attempts to acquire Austal. The Australian Financial Review reports Hanwha made its first approach to Austal in late 2023 proposing a takeover. The AFR says Hanwha presented three more non-binding bids and conducted preliminary approvals reviews in Australia and the United States.\nAustal rejected all the proposals and publicly questioned if Hanwha could receive approval due to Austal’s defense-related business and national importance to Australia. Austal said it would discuss the proposals if Hanwha could first obtain approvals in the U.S. and Australia while Hanwha asserted Austal had established onerous conditions for a due diligence review.\nHanwha Group in March 2025 reported it had acquired 9.9 percent of Austal’s shares in open market transactions and that it was entering into a swap agreement with an Australian investment firm to acquire an additional 9.9 percent of Austal’s shares. Hanwha declared its intent to hold a 19.9 percent position in Austal, which if approved would give the South Korean conglomerate the largest investment position in Austal, exceeding the 17 percent held by the Forrest family that became Austal’s largest investor in 2022.\nUnder both Australian and U.S. law, Hanwha can make up to a 10 percent passive investment in Austal without needing approval. Hanwha had said in March it chose the investment route because of the delays for its proposals, but it did not rule out further increasing its investment in Austal.\nHanwha writes that it plans to integrate its shipbuilding capabilities into Austal’s global business to enhance the competitiveness of both companies. It also plans to actively pursue joint business expansion in the U.S. and Australian defense markets.\n“This is an example that shows the potential for high synergy when Korean shipbuilding technology and operational systems are combined with the U.S. defense industry,” Coulter says in Hanwha’s statement. It also says he emphasized, “We will contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of the U.S. shipbuilding industry through our collaboration with Austal.”\nAustralia’s Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) is yet to rule on the application from Hanwha to proceed with the increased investment in Austal. The reports are that the board has up to six months. Austal however highlights the final decision rests with the Australian Treasurer.\nWhile the Australian government has sought to protect and strengthen its defense industry, the media reports in the past Australia’s Minister for Defense, Richard Marles, has said this was a matter for Austal as a private company. Marles said the government was not concerned by Hanwha’s efforts while Hanwha has cited its other projects with the Australian defense industry and the government."

While reporting some progress, the Indian Coast Guard which is leading the effort emphasizes the danger reporting the fire is not contained and explosions persist aboard the vessel.\nThe first explosion occurred according to the rescued crewmembers around 0930 on Monday morning June 9. It is unclear how much of a firefighting effort could be mounted aboard but by 1230 the crew was advising the Coast Guard that they were abandoning ship into a lifeboat and life raft.\nThe Indian Navy transferred 18 crewmembers fromWan Hai 503to shore at the New Mangalore Port. Six were admitted to the hospital with two suffering burns over 30 to 40 percent of their body and serious respiratory burns. Three other crewmembers have been released from the hospital and four remain missing. The Navy and Coast Guard said they were continuing the search for the missing crewmembers.\n\npic.twitter.com/L44LjIgx3f\n\nA total of five Indian Coast Guard vessels are in the area with two large patrol ships leading the fire fighting effort. They are dousing the fire and are also providing perimeter cooling but according to the reports, efforts were being hampered by monsoonal winds. The winds have pushed the flames nearly the length of the 890-foot (268-meter) vessel with the front of the accommodation block and bridge now showing they are also scorched.\nThe Coast Guard is saying that the fire is under control on the forward section of the vessel through thick smoke continues to rise from the ship. The fire moved aft with the Coast Guard reporting additional containers were catching fire and exploding. The port authority announced that the manifest it had received indicated there were 157 containers with hazardous materials aboard.\nReports vary on the number of containers that were lost overboard in the initial incident, but there are some indications that additional boxes have gone overboard during the firefight. The authorities are warning they are drifting toward the south and the first debris should reach the coastline within three days.\n\n\n\nThe vessel has taken on a 10-to-15-degree list which has the authorities concerned that the ship could sink. The vessel is reported to have aboard 100 tons of fuel oil.\nThe ship is registered in Singapore and the Maritime & Port Authority says it is also providing assistance along with the vessel’s class society. It reports that two additional vessels from the Coast Guard and a private salvage company hired by Wan Hai were due to reach the ship Tuesday evening."

They x-rayed the container and found signs of possible drug cargo. On opening, they found five plastic-wrapped satchels filled with bricks of cocaine, sitting unconcealed atop a conventional cargo of polyethylene plastic material. The placement is typical of the \"rip-on/rip-off\" smuggling method, in which a container of ordinary goods is \"contaminated\" with drugs at some point in its journey.\nAFP testing revealed that the shipment totaled about 250 kilos of cocaine, worth about US$50 million in Australia's hyperinflated drug market.\n“I want to commend the highly skilled officers in our supply chain and cargo teams who were vital to the interdiction of this dangerous consignment,\" ABF commander Troy Sokoloff said. \"The ABF, in close collaboration with the AFP, have eyes and ears everywhere. Our sophisticated intelligence networks, advanced screening technology and unwavering commitment to safeguarding the community mean that your attempts will be detected, your drugs will be seized, and you will be held to account.\"\nAustralia has the world's most active cocaine market (per capita), and the drug commands eye-watering prices on the street. Gram for gram, cocaine is worth about twice as much as gold in Australia, making the country a prime destination for smugglers in search of high profits."

        "content": "\nThe unexplained sightings of drones continue to rise with the latest reports coming from Dutch and German news outlets recounting how authorities recently searched two Russian-crewed cargo ships suspected of launching drones in the North Sea area. No evidence was found but the speculation continues that it could be the latest spying effort or a new form of hybrid warfare.\nDrones have drawn attention in many places around the globe. Last year, there were nightly reports of unidentified drones in the Northeastern United States that drew extensive media coverage but were never explained. The Dutch news outlet Pointer (KRO-NCRV) and German news magazine Der Spiegel recount similar stories saying German law enforcement agencies have been seeing an increase in drone sightings over critical infrastructure such as ports, chemical facilities, and military installations. The Dutch Coast Guard also told Pointer that it was aware of unidentified drones being spotted at sea.\nTwo instances are being reported that happened in May 2025. In the first instance, it says drones were spotted near a military site near Kiel, Germany. Ten days later, Der Spiegel says the German patrol shipPotsdamreported it was being followed by a drone for three hours until just before it reached Dutch waters.\nAround the same time the drone was spotted in Kiel, Pointer says German authorities identified a small cargo ship,HAV Dolphin(3,000 dwt) behaving suspiciously off the coast of Kiel. The vessel, which was built in 1993 and is registered in Antigua and Barbuda, Pointer reports had previously spent a month in the Russian port of Kaliningrad. It contends the vessel was spotted operating at times without its AIS signal.\nAccording to the report, the authorities detained and searched the vessel when it reached the Volkerak locks. They report the inspectors did not find drones aboard the vessel.\nThe patrol shipBP 81 Potsdamwas tracking a Russian freighterLauga(3,200 dwt) in the North Sea reports Der Spiegel when it counted seven drones overhead tracking itself and the cargo ship. Because it was night, they could not identify the drones or where they were coming from.Laugathe news outlets highlight was used by Russia in Syria possibly carrying military cargo and has also operated at times without an AIS signal.\nDer Spiegel says that the Federal Police asked Belgian authorities to inspect the freighter at its destination port. However, again the inspection found no evidence of drones on board.\nPointer reports the German authorities have informed European law enforcement agencies about both the incidents. Both outlets say that the police and other authorities do not have the resources to properly track and identify drones.\nThe drone sightings come as Northern Europe remains on alert after the incidents with vessels dragging anchors in the Baltic and damaging undersea cables. Russia has consistently denied involvement or knowledge of these incidents and points to the damage to its Nord Stream 2 pipeline which it claims the West refused to investigate. NATO and the Scandinavian and Baltic countries have increased monitoring and surveillance leading to tensions in the region."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe Pentagon has launched a review of the U.S.-Australia-UK nuclear submarine technology-transfer and purchase agreement (AUKUS), which was negotiated by the Biden administration in 2021. The deal calls for the U.S. to sell the Australian government up to five Virginia-class nuclear attack submarines beginning in the 2030s.\nThe program could have benefits for all parties. For Australia, it promises a major upgrade in defensive capability; for the U.S., it means access to basing and sub repair facilities on Australian territory, as well as five more allied attack subs to call on in time of need. For the UK, Australia would become a long-term partner in the construction of a future class of British attack subs from the 2030s onward.\nThe downside of the deal for the United States is its potential drag on U.S. Navy fleet size. The Virginia-class and Columbia-class sub programs are mission-critical for the U.S. Navy, and the two yards that build these subs - GD Electric Boat and HII Newport News - are behind schedule. In addition, the Navy's public shipyards have been challenged in keeping up with submarine maintenance, reducing availability. If the U.S. submarine industrial base could not replace the AUKUS boats on time, these subs would be subtracted from U.S. Navy fleet growth. For Australia, thedownsideis the high cost burden of a full-scale nuclear submarine program, from acquisition through crewing and sustainment.\nAs of 2023, the initial plan was for the U.S. to sell two secondhand Block IV Virginia-class attack submarines from U.S. Navy inventory in 2032 and 2035, plus one more new Block VII hull in 2038. The deal currently calls for up to five hulls, and Australia made the first $500 million down payment on that plan in March 2025.\nPredictions of the program's cancellation have circulated since the Trump administration took office in February, and those forecasts may now appear prescient. According to the Financial Times, the Defense Department has appointed undersecretary of defense for policy Elbridge Colby to conduct a review of the program; the Pentagon has confirmed the news to multiple outlets.\n\"The Department is reviewing AUKUS as part of ensuring that this initiative of the previous Administration is aligned with the President’s America First agenda,\" a Pentagon official told USNI. \"This means ensuring the highest readiness of our servicemembers, that allies step up fully to do their part for collective defense, and that the defense industrial base is meeting our needs.\"\nLast year, Colby expressed ambivalence about the program and suggested a factual, empirical evaluation was needed. \"In principle it’s a great idea. But I’ve been very skeptical in practice,\" he said in a social media message. \"But if AUKUS can help us get more [subs] in the right place and time, then great.\""

        "content": "\nYemen's Houthi rebel movement has issued a warning to the United States and Israel that an attack on Iran - an increasingly likely possibility - could result in a new round of conflict escalation in the region. The group it well-known for its campaign of attacks on shipping, which only subsided after a U.S. air campaign created conditions for a truce earlier this year. That truce may be in danger in the event of a conflict with Iran, the Houthis' primary military sponsor, the group hinted on Wednesday.\n\"We are . . . at the highest level of preparedness for any possible American escalation against us,\" a Houthi source told Newsweek on Wednesday. \"Any escalation against the Islamic Republic of Iran is also dangerous and will drag the entire region into the abyss of war. . . . It is certainly not in the interest of the American people to become involved in a new war in service of [Israel].\"\nRelatedly, the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) office of the Royal Navy issued a rare warning to shipping on Wednesday, cautioning operators that it has been made aware of a risk of \"an escalation of military activity having a direct impact on mariners.\" Vessel masters are advised to proceed with caution in the Arabian Gulf, Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz - areas where Iran has previously engaged in attacks on shipping during periods of heightened tension.\nThe tensions center on Iran's nuclear program, which Israel views as an existential threat. Renewed U.S.-Iran talks on a new nuclear deal appear stalled, despite initial signs of progress, and President Donald Trump has expressed frustration with the pace of the negotiations. As in previous talks in 2015, Iran is refusing to give up the entirety of its domestic uranium enrichment infrastructure, which the Trump administration insists must be dismantled or relocated to a third country. But the backdrop has changed since the last round of negotiations ten years ago: Tehran now possesses enough high-enriched nuclear fuel that it could produce about 10 nuclear weapons in a \"breakout\" push, perhaps within a matter of months.\nAs the negotiations falter, Israel is widely believed to be preparing for a potential strike on Iranian nuclear sites to pre-empt the manufacturing of an Iranian bomb - and Iran has laid out its plans for a response. Iran's Supreme National Security Council warned on Wednesday that it has \"a vast quantity\" of intelligence on Israel's nuclear weapons establishment, and is prepared to conduct a counterstrike with its missile forces. Iranian Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh has also threatened to strike U.S. military bases around the region if Iran comes under attack.\nIn a sign that hostilities could be imminent, the U.S. government has ordered a heightened state of preparedness for Iranian attacks in the Mideast, to include the evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and a voluntary departure authorization for servicemembers' families at bases in the region."

Purported Russian social media accounts announced what they called a successful attack using supersonic cruise missiles fired from bombers at the platform which has been repeatedly targeted during the war.\nTavrida was built in 1995 by Ukraine's JSC Kherson shipyard. It was positioned as part of the Ukrainian field in the Black Sea with reports it is over 7,000 gross tons and 81 meters (265 feet) in length. It however has not operated in a decade. Russia took control of the platform during the annexation of Crimea in 2014 along with other energy assets in the Black Sea.\nEarly in the war, Ukraine targeted the platform in a series of attacksreported in 2022and then in 2023 reclaimed the platform. Reports accused the Russians of having converted the platforms with electronic listening devices and other equipment.\nRussia is now accusing Ukraine of doing the same with the platform, making it a base of operations to be used against Crimea. Russia alleges Ukraine was using Tavrida as a command post for its drones and other electronic warfare. They also claim it was being used as a refueling and staging point for drones and unmanned vessels attacking ports and other sites in Crimea.\n\nFootage has emerged of a Russian Kh-22 cruise missile strike on the \"Tavrida\" self-elevating drilling platform in the Black Sea during attacks conducted on June 9, 2025.Russian military sources claim the facility housed Ukrainian military intelligence (GUR) personnel and…pic.twitter.com/rwEWvh7YAS\n\nThe video posted online claims that Russia launched an anti-ship cruise missile from a TU-22M3 bomber, the same class of plane attacked by Ukraine in the surprise drone assault. The video is purported to show the missile striking Tavrida and causing additional damage. The reports said four additional missiles were fired at nearby targets including Snake Island.\nUkraine, of course, denies it was using the jackup rig or any of the sites in the Black Sea as a base. Reports in 2022 said Tarvida was damaged including a large hole in its helicopter pad by the prior attacks.\nRussia has been stepping up its assault on Ukraine in part in retaliation for the attack on the bombers.

        "content": "\nCanada’s shipbuilding group Davie reports it is fulfilling its commitment to invest in American shipbuilding with an agreement to acquire facilities in Texas. The company announced a year ago that it would invest in the U.S. shipbuilding sector as it continues to seek a key role in developing future icebreakers.\nUnder the newly announced agreement, Davie will acquire facilities in Galveston and Port Arthur, Texas from Gulf Cooper & Manufacturing. The company reports it has two dry docks each in each of the locations and 4,000 feet of dock in Galveston and 1,000 feet in Port Arthur. Its focus is on ship repair, offshore services, and marine infrastructure. It serves the oil and gas, marine transport, petrochemical, and government sectors.\n\"A successful deal will open a new chapter for Gulf Copper,\" said Steve Hale, CEO of Gulf Copper. \"For the first time in decades, complex shipbuilding could return to Galveston and Port Arthur.”\nDavie reports once it secures contacts it plans to invest $1 billion to upgrade and expand capacity in Galveston and Port Arthur. The project it says could generate approximately 4,000 American jobs, with 2,000 directly at Gulf Copper.\n“We share a vision with Gulf Copper to make Texas a world-class hub for American icebreaker and complex ship production,” said James Davies, President and CEO of Davie.\nDavie reports it needs to complete negotiation with the Galveston Wharves Board of Trustees as well as financial, legal, and regulatory closing conditions for the transaction. It expects to finalize the acquisition in the summer of 2025.\nThe Canadian shipbuilder has been actively pursuing the U.S. market and the opportunity for icebreakers. It is involved in the Canadian effort to build new icebreakers and received one of the two first contracts awarded in 2025 for its yard in Quebec. It previously also acquired Helsinki Shipyard, which it highlights has built half of all the icebreakers globally.\nDavie states that it “possesses commercially viable, production-ready icebreaker designs that meet the U.S. mission requirements,” and would contribute to Donald Trump’s declared goal to dramatically expand the U.S. fleet. Trump has said it is an urgent national security gap that must be filled along with his calls to acquire Greenland.\nThe U.S. announced in 2024 a trilateral Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE Pact) along with Canada and Finland to accelerate the construction of icebreakers. Davie was reported to be a driving force contributing to the agreement between the three countries.\nWith its shipbuilding program years behind schedule for the new polar icebreakers, the U.S. Coast Guard recently acquired a commercial icebreaker which is currently on its first voyage bound for Alaska where it is scheduled to be officially named. TheStoriswill require additional upgrades to be fully operational. The USCG currently depends on two aging polar icebreakers (Polar Starcommissioned in 1976 andHealycommissioned in 1999) along with 21 domestic icebreakers, and 16 ice-capable buoy tenders."

        "content": "Iran’s official news agencies are reporting a further crackdown on fuel smugglers operating in the Gulf saying that it stopped four vessels on Tuesday, June 10. The reports came as the UK Maritime Trade Operations monitoring operation for the region said it had been made aware of increased tensions within the region.\nIran is well-known for its low fuel prices. The government subsidizes the fuel price to aid the citizens, but it also creates a strong opportunity for smuggling into neighboring countries that have much higher fuel prices. The Iranians regularly report efforts to stop the smuggling and apprehend operations.\nThe Mehr News Agency is citing a statement from the prosecutor of Minab County in Hormozgan Province, Ebrahim Taheri, which said the operation was carried out by naval patrol officers, supported by a marine commando unit.\nDuring the operation, they reported stopping and searching suspect vessels. A total of four were apprehended and they discovered and confiscated thousands of liters of fuel. They said they located large fuel containers hidden on the vessels.\nThe vessels were handed over to the National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company (NIOPDC). The individuals face jail sentences. In April, Iran reported that the captains of two vessels, along with two “deputies” from one of the vessels were each sentenced to five years in jail. A fine of more than $5 million was also ordered.\nThe UKMTO Ops Centre also posted an advisory today warning of the increased tensions, which it said “could lead to an escalation of military activity having a direct impact on mariners.”  It advised vessels to transit the region including the Arabian (Persian) Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, and the Straits of Hormuz with caution.\nThe tensions came as the United States and Iran appear to be at a stalemate in the nuclear talks. Donald Trump speaking to the media on Tuesday, June 10, accused Iran of becoming “much more aggressive” and said the terms were not acceptable. Iran’s media writes that a deal is still possible if the U.S. will accept commercial levels of nuclear enrichment. It announced it would be presenting the U.S. with new terms."

        "content": "\nFirst-in-class carrier USS Gerald R. Ford has completed her first full deployment and is gearing up for another, but problems with the Ford program remain, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\nThe Ford program encountered years-long delays during the construction of the first hull. The complexities added by Ford's all-electric launch and recovery gear, as well as her electromagnetically-actuated weapons elevators, caused difficulty at the yard and long after delivery. The keel laying was held in 2009 for a 2015 delivery date, but construction cost increased by $2.8 billion and the schedule for her commissioning slipped to 2017. She was delivered incomplete, without operable weapons elevators, and did not achieve initial operational capability until December 2021. Since then she has successfully deployed overseas, and she was recognized as the best all-around ship in the Atlantic Fleet last year.\nThe program office has emphasized that USS Ford was a first-in-class hull, with the inherent issues that come with a first-of-a-kind vessel, and that the teething problems with her new technology were being worked out for the follow-on carriers. But in its annual assessment of defense procurement programs, GAO reports that the Navy expects significant additional delays to future hulls in the series.\nContinued issues with the weapons elevators aboard second-in-class CVN 79 could put the planned July 2025 delivery date for the vessel at risk, the program office reported. And the delivery date for CVN 80, the third Ford-class, has been pushed back to May 2030 - more than two years later than the Navy expected.\nThe problem, according to GAO, is in the availability of materials and skilled labor. HII Newport News has \"persistent shipyard workforce issues\" that the program office is trying to fix by revising schedules and creating incentives for workers, GAO said.\nNewport News has been trying to hire more yard employees, but it has been hard to retain people who are new to the shipbuilding industry, HII CEO Chris Kastner told defense media in April. The attrition rate for first-year new hires is so high - the Navy puts it at 50-60 percent per year - that HII is pivoting away from bringing in \"green\" staff and is focused on recruiting experienced personnel instead, competing with other yards for the same pool of skilled welders. Kastner acknowledged that this \"means you're going to hire less and you're going to have to figure out how to get the work done.\""

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "After years of issues with contractor-based equipment maintenance, the U.S. Navy is joining the \"right to repair\" movement, Navy Secretary John Phelan told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nThe \"right to repair\" movement is a response to the business practice of locking up after-sales service through intellectual property, warranty and parts-access limitations. In a digital era, this affects everything from autos to farm equipment to cellphones - and, according to Phelan, even aircraft carriers and frigates. Though Navy sailors have to be ready to \"fight tonight,\" they often aren't allowed to fix key pieces of their own equipment, and have to wait for an authorized service tech - by contract.\nThe problem, according to Phelan, is that the OEMs for mission-critical gear on warships still own the intellectual property for the equipment. Their contracts with the Navy forbid servicemembers from performing any repairs because of IP concerns. Instead, the equipment remains out of service until a contractor comes out to join the ship - often by traveling, and often at considerable cost.\n\"I went on the [USSGerald R. Ford] carrier; they had eight ovens — this is a ship that serves 15,300 meals a day,\" Phelan said. \"Only two were working. Six were out.\"\nEven though the crew was capable of performing the repair, they were not allowed to do so, and had to wait for an oven contractor to come out. The same issue applies to theFord'selevators (a persistent source of problems in the past).\n\"They have to come out and diagnose the problem, and then they'll fix it,\" he said. \"It is crazy. We should be able to fix this . . . We need to really try to ensure going forward we control our IP, and we have the ability to fix things.\"\nThe Littoral Combat Ship was famously designed for a contractor-centricmaintenance strategy, which became a driver of the LCS program's excessive operating cost - at one point averaging$70 millionper hull per year, approaching the opex for a far larger Arleigh Burke-class destroyer.\nThe U.S. Army has similar problems with contractor dependency, and has decided to address this going forward by requiring right-to-repair in every contract - and forcing the issue on past contracts as well.\n\"We hope that anyone listening to us who hopes to pitch us a contract going forward will look back at their previous agreements they've signed with us, and if they're unwilling to give us that right to repair, I think we're going to have a hard time negotiating with them,\" Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll told the House Armed Services Committee last week."

The Indian Coast Guard was concentrating regional cooling and foam-based suppression on the forward part of the vessel and successfully reduced the fire while reports indicated they could shift toward the mid-section of the containership.

        "content": "The Navy's Constellation-class frigate program continues to wrestle with an incomplete functional design, which has delayed construction on the first hull and may push back delivery on follow-on vessels as well, according to the GAO. At present, the lead vessel is on track to deliver three years behind schedule and an estimated 13 percent overweight.\n\"The Navy and shipbuilder continue to revise basic design documents, including the ship's general arrangement drawings - the design drawings that all other design aspects are based on - and structural components of the ship,\" reported GAO on Wednesday. \"This approach is inconsistent with shipbuilding leading practices.\"\nThe Constellation-class began as an adaptation of the Italian-French FREMM, an existing design that has proven popular in Europe. Initially, the Navy sought to achieve cost savings and reduce technical risk by keeping 85 percent of the original design. Instead, it changed 85 percent of the design to adapt the vessel to Navy requirements, and it has yet to achieve design stability.\nIn October 2024, the Navy informed GAO that it expects to see about 759 tonnes of weight growth (13 percent) \"due in part to the underestimation of applying Navy technical requirements to a foreign ship design.\" Weight growth can affect performance, and it limits the amount of extra equipment that can be added to the warship in future years to adapt to changing technology. The program office is working with the shipyard to reduce weight \"through a phased implementation across the first three ships.\"\nChange orders and delays tend to increase costs. So far, the shipbuilder has asked for equitable adjustment of the contract payment terms five times, GAO reports - a sign that costs will rise. The Navy has not released the amounts of the requests, and the information is \"not suitable for public release,\" GAO reported."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nWind-assisted propulsion is having a moment in commercial shipping. On average, most systems on the market can reduce fuel consumption by about 10 percent for a tanker or bulker - or more, if the conditions on the route are right. Design maturity is increasing, along with economies of scale for manufacturing, bringing down capex and shortening payback times for the shipowner. It's not just a matter of whether it's the right thing to do; it is getting to the point where it makes economic sense, especially when factoring in carbon-pricing mechanisms like FuelEU Maritime and the IMO MEPC 83 fee structure.\nThe latest example is the Brands Hatch, a new Aframax built by CSSC Shanghai Waigaoqiao, one of China's premier state-owned shipyards.Brands Hatch- built for UK-based Union Maritime - has three 40-meter fiberglass sails from BAR Technologies on deck. These giant \"WindWings\" are capable of generating enough propulsive force to save about 14 tonnes of fuel per day, naval architecture researcher Huang Yiming of Shanghai Waigaoqiao told CGTN.\nUnion Maritime is far from the only owner experimenting with wind power. Odfjell recently installed four self-tending suction sails from Bound4Blue on the tankerBow Olympus. The installation was easy, Odfjell board member Jan Kjaervik told TME at Nor-Shipping. The pedestal supports for the system were welding on at a yard in China during a shipyard period, and the sails themselves were mounted up in a matter of days at EDR Antwerp Shipyard. No physical changes were required to meet stability requirements after adding the additional mass and lateral force at deck level.\nSo far, theBow Olympus'operating experience shows that the system captures some amount of wind energy about 70 percent of the time.\nBound4Blue CTO and co-founder David Ferrer emphasizes that suction sails are compact and comparatively simple, retaining the performance of a Flettner rotor in a less complex package. \"Small size means that it can be built out of steel, without having an enormous cost, weight increase. It has greater simplicity, because there are no big moving parts, so maintenance should be reduced,\" he told TME.Crew feedback has been positive, in part because a vessel with sails experiences less rolling under most wind conditions. \"It's more comfortable to be on board the vessel now. It has a stabilizing effect,\" said Kjaervik. \"The vessel is rolling less than it used to do.\"\nFor owners who are looking to follow this path, certification and data are essential, and that falls neatly into the role of class societies. In a recent study for rotor sail builder Anemoi, Lloyds Register - which has been evaluating sail-powered vessels since 1760 -validatedthe company's performance measurement process, providing assurance that owners can determine how well the system works in practice.\n\"Owners understand that this is actually a viable option for them to reduce emissions and reduce costs and reduce penalties. So I think that higher fuel prices and the [carbon] taxes really start to bring us closer to the point where owners accept it on a broader basis,\" says Claes Horndahl, Commercial Director at Anemoi.\nTankers are an easy use case for sail equipment because they have minimal cargo operations over the main deck level. Large bulkers on long-haul routes perform well on a return-on-investment basis, and for these vessels, sail system OEMs have developed a variety of methods for folding down or moving aside the equipment to enable cargo operations with cranes or grab buckets. In the industrial environment of a bulker in port, the sail equipment has to withstand the usual knocks and dings, like any other deck machinery. That moment of practical maturity has arrived, Horndahl says. \"We have performed drop tests, and the GRP we are using is very resilient to falling pieces, if that were to occur,\" he says."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "The Romanian government has according to reports in the media received a surprise proposal for the management and operation of the Mangalia shipyard from MSC Mediterranean Shipping Group. The government has been considering alternatives for the shipyard after the collapse of an agreement with Damen Group sent the yard into insolvency.\nEuropa Libera Romania reports it has seen a letter sent from MSC Shipmanagement to the government in April that expressed the group’s interest in the shipyard. It cites the company’s need for repair facilities as well as potentially newbuild capabilities. They report the letter says MSC would take over the management and operation of the shipyard and bring in outside management to assist in restoring the operations.\nMSC says it is interested in Mangalia because its newbuilding is currently concentrated for containerships in Asia and cruise ships in Europe. MSC reportedly told the government it intends to consider the shipyard for the future construction of cruise ships, ropax, and tugboats. The company also said it was paying in advance for repair work to provide the yard funds for hiring back employees.\nOwning over 600 containerships and managing a total fleet of nearly 1,000 containerships plus its cruise ships, ferries, tugs, and the recent entry into the car carrier segment, MSC reports it needs more shipyard capacity. It cites that it already owns space in Antwerp and Naples which also gives it experience in managing shipyard operations.\nMSC however is reported to have competition for the shipyard. The government had started seeking investors early in 2025 and the media indicated Turkey’s Desan was in advanced negotiations for Mangalia. The media stories said Desan was proposing to rent the yard facilities from the government and hire the workforce. Desan is reported to be interested in Mangalia for additional production capacity and because it has larger dry docks which would permit work on post-Panamax vessels.\nIt is unclear from the reports how MSC proposed to structure its deal with the government for the yard. Mangalia is undergoing insolvency proceedings with reports it has debts of more than €400 million ($460 million). The yard may need to be reorganized before a new agreement can be completed.\nMangalia which was established by the government in 1976 had been closed since 2024 after Damen notified the government of its intent to end a joint venture in which it owns 49 percent of the yard. Damen had taken over the yard in 2018 after South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineer ended a partnership that had begun in 1997.\nDamen highlighted when it formed the joint venture that the yard had three large drydocks and it was the largest in its group. It said Mangalia had delivered over 200 ships, but the company was hurt by the downturn in shipbuilding and especially the offshore sector.\nRomanian media indicate the yard resumed work in May 2025 with two ship repair assignments and a third to follow. It reportedly has brought back approximately 800 workers and has at least 13 more repair projects scheduled for the second half of 2025."

The charges relate to negligence in handling the vessel and the dangerous cargo aboard.\nThe Fort Kochi Coastal police station filed what is known in the Indian legal system as the First Information Report (FIR) which outlines the various violations. The case is being brought on behalf of a resident named in the complaint and the local fishing community. The FIR outlines offenses of rash navigation, creating a danger to navigation, and negligent conduct as it relates to poisonous substances, combustible matter, and explosive substances.\nAccording to the report, they are being accused of handling the vessel negligently which resulted in causing environmental impact. They are accused of being aware that the vessel was carrying hazardous substances but operating the vessel negligently. Further, it says the aftermath has seen dangerous plastic materials in the sea and washing ashore creating environmental concerns and financial losses to the fishing community.\nThe local government has been under political pressure to file charges while it raised concerns that it did not have legal standing because the casualty was outside the 12-mile limit. There had previously been media reports that the government was pursuing a legal settlement with MSC and its insurers while some reports said the government was trying to maintain good relations with MSC. It was pointed out that MSC is a major operator at the nearby Vizhininjam International Port. This week the company sent one of its 24,000 TEU containerships to the port for the first time, and it became the largest to have docked in India.\nOfficials have commented that the vessel’s ballast water system was not working properly contributing to its taking on a severe list. Media reports have questioned the condition of the ship noting that the vessel was flagged for multiple deficiencies on port state inspections. Issues were recorded on the last two inspections in 2023 and 2024 in India, but the vessel had not been detained. Bureau Veritas reports all the vessel’s certificates were up-to-date.\nSaying that MSC mishandled the cargo aboard the vessel, the report highlights that 12 of the containers out of the 640 onboard held declared hazardous material, and 12 contained calcium carbide. The authorities said that 61 containers washed ashore and that so far 51 have been salvaged.\nThe Indian Coast Guard has been highlighting efforts to deal with small bits of plastic known as nurdles that were in the water and washing up on the beaches. It reports so far approximately 500 kg of plastic nurdles have been painstakingly removed from the beaches.\nSalvage efforts began this week with ROVs and divers inspecting the wreck which sank 38 nautical miles off the Kerala coast. Divers are going to attempt to seal the fuel tanks to stop a small release of oil. At the beginning of July, they are going to attempt to pump the fuel from the tanks to reduce the environmental dangers."

The lumber was needed to build barracks for British troops in Boston, which was under siege by what would soon be known as the Continental Army.\nJones arrived at Machias with the merchant vesselsUnityandPollyon June 2, 1775, in the company of the Royal Navy sloop HMSMargaretta. They were carrying pork and flour to trade for the lumber. Patriots among the townspeople disliked the idea of doing business that would benefit the British, and Jones had to use threats of force to compel the trade.\nIn response, a local militia under the command of Capt. Jeremiah O'Brien attempted to capture Jones on June 11; this was not successful, so the next day they seized theUnityinstead. After making preparations aboardUnity, O'Brien and about 30 men proceeded to chase down HMSMargarettaas well. WhenUnitycame alongside and militia members climbed across,Margaretta'scommanding officer was mortally wounded by musket fire, and his second-in-command surrendered.\nIt was the first time that patriots had seized a British vessel in the war. At the time, the Continental Navy did not yet exist, and it was a military support action carried out by civilian mariners - the first such engagement in the history of the merchant marine, but far from the last. O'Brien went on to a storied career as a privateer throughout the war, and six ships have been named in his honor - five U.S. Navy warships and the well-known WWII Liberty Ship SSJeremiah O'Brien."

Analysts are scrambling to predict the potential impact on shipping while security services are issuing cautions and some nations are already issuing advice to shipping.\nAs would be expected, the price of oil jumped dramatically on world markets after the news that Israel had struck and killed leadership within Iran’s military and nuclear program, bombed nuclear sites, and defense installations. At midday, the global price of oil was up around seven percent on a barrel after news that Iran’s first response was limited to about 100 drones launched at Israel. The Israel Defense Force is saying the drones were intercepted and caused no damage.\n“The Strait of Hormuz remains open and commercial traffic continues to flow uninterrupted,” reported the Joint Maritime Information Center while also saying “JMIC has no indications of an increased threat to the maritime environment.”\nJMIC however immediately raised the “likelihood of regional conflict” to “significant.” It said the effect on the maritime environment is not predictable. It is advising increased security measures and monitoring the situation.\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations had issued its first warning of “increased tension” on June 11. The UK today, June 13, according to a report from Reuters, advised merchant ships to avoid sailing through the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\nGreece’s Ministry of Shipping reports Reuters also issued a warning to commercial shipping. The Ministry is asking Greek ship owners and operators to send details of their planned transits through the Strait of Hormuz. Greece is especially sensitive due to its entanglements with Iran which has seized and held Greek-owned tankers in the past.\nOne company, the UK’s gas producer Energean has already reported it was temporarily suspending production on its FPSO located off the northern coast of Israel. The company said it had been ordered to suspend activities by Israel’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure.\nIran has not indicated its strategy other than announcing that “a bitter and painful fate awaits Israel.” It has however also said it believes the United States supported the efforts although the Trump administration has been quick to disavow any involvement in the attacks. It however announced that its oil infrastructure was functioning normally and not part of the overnight attacks.\nWell-known shipping industry analysts Peter Sand, Chief Analyst at Xeneta, and Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, both speculated on the potential of a “de facto closure” of the Strait of Hormuz similar to what the Houthis achieved with the Red Sea in 2024.\n“Any closure of the Strait of Hormuz would see services re-routed, with increased reliance on India West Coast ports for connecting the Far East to Indian sub-continent,” commented Peter Sand on the potential impact to the container shipping segment in particular.  “The inevitable disruption and port congestion, as well as the potential for higher oil prices, would cause a spike in ocean freight container shipping rates, with carriers likely also pushing for a ‘security surcharge’ on these trades in the coming days.”\nJensen highlighted three major risks with the first of course being oil prices. In addition to the impact on oil from the closing of the Strait of Hormuz, he highlights the impact on imports and exports from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iraq. A disruption at Saudi Arabia’s main ports, Jebel Ali and Khalifa, Jansen points out could spill over to regional congestion in Asia.\nIran, he notes in the past has shown it is “not adverse” to interfering with commercial shipping. It has held theMSC Ariescontainership for over a year as well as having a history of seizing crude oil tankers. The Houthis released the crew but still hold the vehicle carrierGalaxy Leaderwhich they seized in November 2023."

        "content": "\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is pointing out some of the fundamentals of vessel operations along with the dangers of aging vessels in its latest report. The report shows that an 80-year-old Navy surplus vessel being used to support Alaska’s fishing industry was lost due to flooding possibly caused by maintenance issues and the captain and mate’s decision to leave watertight doors open while they were underway.\nThe vessel namedCape Douglaswas lost on November 6, 2024, about four miles southeast of Kodiak, Alaska. The captain and mate reported they were unable to control flooding on the vessel and abandoned ship to a towed skiff. They flagged down a nearby fishing boat for their rescue. Less than an hour after the captain and mate donned survival suits and abandoned ship, 40 minutes after they were rescued, they watched the industrial ship they had been operating sink.\nThe NTSB reports the Cape Douglas was built for the U.S. Navy in 1944 as a landing craft tank. By 1947, it had been decommissioned and found its way to Alaska where it was sailing from Kodiak as a commercial fishing vessel. It was acquired by North Bay Corporation in 2000 and used to haul heavy equipment and as a fish tender to dispose of fish byproducts.\nIt was on one of those fish tender runs loaded with about 30 tons of fish byproduct which the captain termed a “moderate load.” The disposal site was about four miles southeast of Kodiak in Chiniak Bay, and they were making about 5.5 knots. The captain was trying to start a pump used for offloading when he observed water had flooded into the engine room. The mate estimated there were four feet of water in the engine room but a high-water bilge alarm had not sounded. The captain later told the NTSB that he did not know when it had been last tested or if it was functional.\nThe captain told the NTSB investigators he was unable to enter the engine room. He said the water, “seems to be coming in awfully quick.” He confirmed they regularly left the watertight doors open during transit to “help with ventilation in the engine room.”\nThe NTSB reports the vessel had last been surveyed in August 2022 and the report found wastage greater than 15 percent and many sections exceeding 25 percent as well as rust and other issues. The owner was told the vessel was only suitable for local limited fish waste dumping and would require an extensive refit for any heavy load/freight operations. The vessel was not used between the survey in 2022 and the trip in November 2024. The owner was trying to sell the vessel.\nThe City of Kodiak harbormaster also raised concerns in April 2024 over the vessel’s seaworthiness. The harbormaster cited “significant marine growth” and “indications of disrepair.”  NTSB says the operating company resolved the complaint by providing proof of vessel insurance.\nThe report lists the probable cause as flooding from an undetermined failure in the vessel’s deck washdown system. It also points to the fundamental principle of maintaining watertight integrity saying leaving the watertight doors open likely contributed to the casualty.\nIt is another example of aging vessels being used in the fishing industry. In 2023, the U.S. Coast Guard in Tacoma, Washington had to manage a situation with a 77-year-old fish processing vessel after there were reports of an ammonia leak. The ship had a long list of violations and after the leak was addressed, it was listed as aderelict for disposal."

As he neared the island of Anegada in the British Virgin Islands, his yacht was dismasted, then lost propulsion due to lack of fuel. He activated his EPIRB and U.S. Coast Guard Sector San Juan received the distress signal. The command center dispatched a Jayhawk SAR helicopter out of Air Station Borinquen, Puerto Rico to search the scene, and it also broadcast a request for assistance to nearby merchant shipping.\nThe helicopter aircrew located the yacht - theTopaze- and made contact with Rouvray, albeit with difficulty due to a language barrier. A Royal Marine Police boat from the British Virgin Islands arrived later in the day and established a tow to bring theTopazesafely into the harbor at Tortola.\n\"The EPIRB distress signal and the efficient communication and coordination between all Coast Guard elements and those of our Dutch and British Virgin Islands partners led to the successful rescuer,\" said Lt.

        "content": "\nThe firefighting efforts for theWan Hai 503containership which are now being undertaken jointly by India’s Coast Guard and Air Force are reporting progress, while India’s shipping authorities are demanding more action by the vessel’s owners and the appointed salvage team. The frustration comes as India has been forced to deal with two containership casualties simultaneously, and today there was another brief scare when a third vessel reported a box fire.\nThe Indian Coast Guard has been leading the effort since the fire began on theWan Hai 503on June 9, approximately 44 miles off the coast. The fire rapidly engulfed much of the ship with the Coast Guard sending firefighting vessels and today joined by the Air Force which was dropping dry chemical power onto the core of the fire. Today, the fourth day of the effort, the Coast Guard reports it has seven ships engaged in firefighting, boundary cooling, and the continuing search for the four missing crewmembers.\nThe fire has been substantially reduced with the authorities saying it is approximately 40 percent suppressed. However, there is heavy gray and black smoke and heat zones remain active mostly around the forward cargo hold and below deck. One concern is that heating continues near the fuel tanks and persistent hotspots requiring continuous boundary cooling.\nThe Coast Guard was able to get a team aboard the vessel and secured a towline at the stern. They were planning fresh attempts to establish a stable towline that would be connected to theOffshore Warrior, a more powerful platform supply vessel brought in by the appointed salvage company T&T Salvage.\nThe goal is to use the stronger tug to pull the vessel away from the coastline. Currently, the vessel is between 38 and 40 nautical miles offshore and drifting to the southeast at 1.5 to 2 knots. The Directorate General of Shipping warns there is a serious risk of escalation if the fire is not stabilized. Further, they are concerned because the weather forecast calls for strong winds likely reaching 50 to 60 knots and heavy rain from June 14 to 16.\n\nUpdate on#MVWanHai503incident:Firefighting Ops by@IndiaCoastGuardhave significantly reduced the blaze onboard MV WAN HAI 503. In joint efforts with@IAF_MCC, 4000 kg of#DCPhas been air-dropped for controlling metal fire. Vessel held safely away from coast. No oil…pic.twitter.com/CW5SRQIjRD\n\nThe Directorate General sent a letter to Wan Hai and T&T Salvage on June 11 raising serious concerns about their efforts. Reports said theOffshore Warriorhad to leave the scene because it did not have adequate fuel and was traveling to Kochi for refueling. Also, the authorities highlighted the vessel has limited firefighting capabilities and lacked foam for firefighting. They are calling the vessel “unsuitable for effectively addressing the rapidly evolving and critical situation.”\nThe authorities are calling for a stronger response by the companies saying they would not hesitate to initiate criminal proceedings and other punitive measures. They are demanding no further delay or negligence in launching an effective firefighting and salvage operation.\nThe Indian Coast Guard is reported to have requisitioned an additional 1,000 kilograms of dry chemical power to be dropped as well as an additional 10,000 liters of firefighting foam. At the last report, it had 3,000 liters available on-site. The Directorate also reported that it has requisitioned the offshore tugTriton Liberty, which is under charter to the Indian Navy, and it was due to reachWan Hai 503late on Thursday. It is to be used to support the firefight and for towing assistance.\nThe Directorate General of Shipping at the same time is demanding more action from the salvage teams working on theMSC Elsa 3which was lost in the same area. They want the fuel pumping from the wreck to begin although they reported today salvage divers have been able to stop the leaks from the ship.\nFurther compounding the demands on the Indian Coast Guard another feeder ship,Interasia Tenacity(37,160 dwt) reported a box fire on Thursday said India’s Manoram outlet. The vessel is inbound and due to arrive in India tomorrow but reported a fire in one of the 1,387 containers aboard. The Coast Guard responded but the vessel later advised it had controlled the fire and no longer required assistance.\nThe Indian Coast Guard has received commendations from many sources including both China and Taiwan for its response which saved 18 seafarers fromWan Hai 503and the crew from theMSC Elsa 3. The Directorate General however highlights the ultimate salvage responsibility is with the owners and operators of the vessels and they must maximize their efforts to minimize the environmental damage from the casualties.\n"

        "content": "\nIndustrial carbon capture and storage is about to take off, according to DNV. Capacity will quadruple with $80 billion in investment by 2030, and will continue to expand through 2050, DNV predicts - and shipping will be along for the ride.\nThe concept of carbon capture has been on the table since the beginning of the drive for decarbonization, but the technology is beginning to gain traction, particularly in regions where it is incentivized by regulations (Europe) and in heavy industries where it is most practical (power generation, oil and gas). Government subsidies also help: Denmark is underwriting the Greensand and Bifrost storage projects, and Norway is underwriting 80 percent of the cost of the Longship CCS project. In the U.S., the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act created a tax credit that has driven investment in a large CCS project pipeline.\nCCS is also possible on board ships, though as with any emissions reduction strategy, there are caveats. The captured CO2 gas has to be stored in pressurized, cylindrical tanks, taking up additional volume on deck or belowdecks. It has to be offloaded to a reception facility, and at present the infrastructure only exists at a few locations. And operating the onboard capture system itself requires heat and electric power, increasing fuel consumption at the same time that carbon is being captured. However,  CCS has a significant advantage: it can run on ubiquitous and inexpensive bunker fuel, even HFO (with a scrubber).\n\"We expect a [storage] system to be in place from 2040 and 15% of all maritime CO2 emissions to be captured and stored by 2050. Overall, maritime transport will account for 9% of CO2 captured with CCS in 2050,\" DNV predicted.\nShipping will also have a part to play in developing offshore subsea injection and storage facilities. \"Ship transport, especially in the North Sea or the Mediterranean Sea, will likely play a key role in transporting CO2 between shore terminals or via offshore injection,\" DNV predicted."

        "content": "India’s Directorate General of Shipping is expressing frustration over the progress in the efforts to address the oil aboard the sunken containershipMSC Elsa 3leading to the issuing of a “final ultimatum” with the threat of criminal liability and legal proceedings. While they walked back some of the threats, India is getting tough on the salvage efforts demanding more actions.\nThe wreck lies at a depth of 51 meters (167 feet), which means it requires saturation diving. Due to weather and issues getting the equipment in place, the authorities said that there had been prolonged and repeated delays in starting the diving operation. They continue to express urgency due to the environmental risks and the onset of monsoon season.\n“The salvors have been issued a strict notice by both state and central authorities to expedite and complete the extraction of oil from the sunken vessel without further delay,” the Directorate General said in its daily situation report on Wednesday, June 11. They said the final ultimatum was to initiate and complete oil extraction within 48 hours while warning failure to comply would result in civil and criminal liability being imposed.\nAmong the issues they highlighted was a lack of trained divers for the operation. They said limited bottom time means they needed more people and equipment to complete the tasks within the restricted weather window.\nThe Directorate later walked back its warning on Thursday, June 12, acknowledging progress with the dive team doubled to 24 and final mobilization underway of the necessary equipment. They now said the salvors had been instructed to deliver a firm and detailed oil recovery plan within 24 hours. It however still said non-compliance would lead to the “escalation of enforcement action.”\nDivers made progress at the site completing primary capping of the identified leak points. Secondary plugging of non-critical tanks which were empty when the vessel was lost is also underway. As a result, the latest site survey showed no oil sheen. Previously, Tank 22’s sounding pipe was weeping oil.\nThe divers are also scheduled to attempt the recovery of the vessel’s Voyage Data Recorder. Indian officials have previously said they were continuing to collect evidence in their investigation into the casualty.\nOnshore, they report that 58 containers have now been retrieved and taken to the port. One additional container they expected would be delivered to the port within 24 hours. Volunteers are also continuing efforts with the beach cleanup with the Directorate saying “the volume of nurdles collected remains significant.”\nThe local courts are also taking a tough stance against MSC. The Kerala High Court previously said that there “should be no negligence in taking action against the shipping company.” On Thursday, it briefly detained another MSC containership,MSC Mansa F(1,078 TEU) which was at the Vizhinjam port. The Cashew Export Promotion Council petitioned the court seeking compensation for a shipment it had aboard theMSC Elsa 3. MSC agreed to post a bond of approximately $700,000 for the claim. The vessel was later released and its AIS signal showed it underway by the end of the day."

Ordering the ships in 2020 and 2021, Hapag became one of the first in the industry to jump to the larger 24,000 TEU class of ultra large vessels.\nThe company highlighted that the class has 20 percent more capacity than its A 19 class of vessels increasing efficiency and operating costs. The vessels have a nominal capacity of 23,664 TEU with 1,500 reefer plugs. They are 1,309 feet (399 meters) in length with a hull design that was optimized to produce a three percent fuel savings. They also have high-efficiency propellers and onshore power capabilities.\nThe vessels are dual fuel with Hapag selecting the massive MAN B&W 11G95ME-GI engine, which the company says is so large it is housed in a five-deck high engine space. Everllence (formerly MAN Energy Solutions) highlights it is a highly efficient engine that uses 15 to 20 percent less fuel. The vessels are equipped with an LNG tank that holds 18,600 cubic meters or enough for a complete Europe-China-Europe round trip. In addition, there is another tank for 8,000 tons of low-sulfur fuel oil.\n\n\nMassive MAN dual-fuel engine powering the Hamburg Express class (Hapag)\n\nThe order for the ships, which have become the largest containerships operating under the German flag, was placed in two tranches with the first batch of six ordered in December 2020 with Korean shipyard Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) (now Hanwha Ocean) with a reported valued of approximately $1 billion. The company expanded the order with six additional ships in June 2021.\n“With their large capacity, forward-thinking design, and LNG dual-fuel engines, this series of vessels are set to greatly improve efficiency and are projected to reduce emissions by 20 to 25 percent in the near future,” said Hapag announcing the completion of the final delivery.\nDelivery of the class began in June 2023 with the first shipBerlin Express. She has been followed by ships namedManila Express(2023),Hanoi Express(2023),Busan Express(2024),Singapore Express(2024),Damietta Express(2024),Hamburg Express(2024),Gdansk Express(2024),Bangkok Express(2025),Rotterdam Express(2025),Genova Express(2025), andWilhelmshaven Express(2025). They are all currently deployed on the route between Asia and Northern Europe operating as part of the Gemini Cooperation launched with Maersk in February 2025.\n\n\nWind scoop added to the bow of the newer ships of the class (Hapag)\n\nOne noticeable difference with the newer ships of the class is they got a “nose job.” Hapag points to the “sleek red bow” of the new ships. They feature a large red oval at the prow in front of the container stacks. The design began appearing in the past few years on ships ranging from CMA CGM to Ocean Network Express (ONE) and others as a fuel-saving device. It is an enlarged wind scoop that improves the aerodynamics of the vessel while underway and creates fuel savings.\nWilhelmshaven Expressis in Shanghai today, June 12, loading for her maiden voyage on the run to Europe. She joins a fleet that has now surpassed 300 vessels, the largest in the history of the company.  Hapag continues to grow reporting last November that it had placed an order valued at an estimated $4 billion for 24 additional containerships to be built in China.\n\n\nNumber 11 of the class, Genova Express, on sea trials (Hapag)"

        "content": "\nA court in Taiwan has sentenced the Chinese master of a shadowy cargo ship to three years in jail for “willfully anchoring in a prohibited zone,” which it concluded caused the damage to a critical undersea cable. Media reports are saying it is the first time Taiwan has convicted and ordered jail time, although it has reported several instances of cable damage and has been on high alert since the start of the year.\nTaiwan reported at the beginning of 2025 that it was monitoring vessels and especially targeting ships operating under a flag of convenience. It believes many of these ships are owned by Chinese interests and are being used to test or harass the island nation.\nIn February, it detected a small cargo ship anchored approximately five nautical miles offshore. According to the reports, the vessel, which was alternately using the namesHong Tai 168andHong Tai 58and registered in Togo, had entered the restricted zone on February 22. A shore station attempted to contact the vessel several times and received no reply. The Coast Guard asked the vessel to move from the area which it says was clearly marked on the charts.\nOn February 25, as the vessel was departing the zone at 0300 Chunghwa Telecom reported an outage on its Taiwan-Penghu No. 3 subsea cable and the Taiwan Coast Guard intercepted the vessel and directed it to port.  The vessel appears to have been built in 2006 and previously reported ownership by Chinese interests. It is 1,800 dwt and has a crew of eight Chinese nationals aboard. Taiwan reported it detained what it called asuspicious vessel.\nThe Coast Guard said the captain at first denied the charges and refused to give them details on the ownership of the vessel. He said he had a \"bad attitude.\" BBC reports the ship has operated under multiple names and had only one cargo record in the past year. The ship was also in poor condition.\nThe District Court was told the vessel had anchored on February 22 in the restricted area and continued to drift. The Coast Guard however noted that it was moving in a zig zag pattern. The captain told the court they had anchored because of “rough waters” which he said made “navigation tricky.” He admitted to ordering two crewmembers to drop 160 meters of anchor chain but the Coast Guard says it did not attach to the bottom and the vessel continued to move around in the area of the cable.\nEvidence showed the cable had been subjected to external forces and that it had been snagged by an external force. The captain denied intentionally damaging the cable but admitted it could have happened calling it simple negligence. The telecom company reports it spent $578,572 to repair the cable.\nUnder the charges, the court could have sentenced the captain to between one and seven years. He can appeal the three-year sentence. Insufficient evidence was found against the other seven crewmembers and they were deported.\nChinese officials have denied involvement or knowledge of the incident. They said it is a “common maritime accident” and called Taiwan’s accounts “exaggerated.”"

On the prior class of cruise ships built by Fincantieri starting withSeven Seas Explorerin 2016, the line introduced its 4,443-square-foot Regent Suite. It also sleeps up to six with two bedrooms and two-and-one-half bathrooms but is just 3,000 square feet of interior space with a 1,300 square-foot wraparound veranda and a glass-enclosed solarium sitting area. It also has a personal sauna, steam room, and treatment area. For theSeven Seas Splendor, it boasted of a $200,000 hand-crafted bed for the suite. The cruise line highlighted when it launched theSeven Seas Splendorand in 2023 on theSeven Seas Grandeur(each 55,500 gross tons for 750 passengers) that the Regent Suite would be priced at $11,000 per night based on double occupancy.\nThe line noted that the Regent Suite is nearly twice as large as the average American home. They said it was 20 times larger than the average cruise ship stateroom.\nThe luxury segment of the cruise industry is growing with more entrants coming to the market. The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection took delivery this month on its second newbuildLuminara(46,750 gross tons). Fincantieri also recently floated the first of two yacht cruise ships for Four Seasons. Due to start service in 2026 it will be 34,000 gross tons carrying 220 passengers. Orient Express Sailing Yachts is also due to launch service in 2026 withOrient Express Corinthianwith 16,145 square feet of sails and accommodating 110 passengers.\nOther luxury brands are also continuing the build out of their fleets. MSC’s Explora Journeys takes delivery on the third of its six ships in 2006. Viking which already has 10 ocean cruise ships in service has nine more on order and operates two expedition cruise ships as well as its fleet of river cruise ships.\nWith demand strong for unique experiences presented in luxurious surroundings, the luxury segment of the cruise industry is expected to continue its growth."

        "content": "\nInvestigators working for Finland’s national police announced they have completed their criminal investigation into the damage to the subsea cables. They reported they officially suspect the master and two officers from the tankerEagle Swho have been detained in Finland since January 2025.\nThe investigation focused on the possible involvement of theEagle S, a tanker registered in the Cook Islands, which was present in the area at the time the cables were damaged on December 25. Finland quickly identified the vessel as a suspect and took it into custody ordering the master and officers not to leave Finland. Investigators said as a result of the efforts carried out during the criminal investigation, the police have a clear understanding of the sequence of events.\n“Among the suspects are the master, the chief mate, and the second mate, who were responsible for the safe passage, navigation, and operation of the vessel,” announced Detective Chief Inspector Sami Liimatainen, Head of Investigation for the National Bureau of Investigation. “The criminal investigation has examined and assessed, among other things, the extent of their responsibility for the condition of the vessel and the degree to which they should have observed the anchor falling into the sea.”\nBased on the investigation, the police announced that the senior officers of the tankerEagle Sare “suspected of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with telecommunications.” The conclusion was based on reviewing material collected from the vessel, examination of the seabed, and interviews with the crew and officers of the tanker.\nDuring the investigation, they retrieved the vessel’s anchor from the sea floor and looked at the broken anchor chain. Reports said they also found marks on the seafloor showing the anchor had been dragged for more than 100 km (more than 60 miles).\nThe Helsinki Times reported that the crimes would be considered serious criminal offenses under Finnish law. They could carry significant prison sentences. The Finnish media reports the three have consistently denied deliberately damaging the cables, which have now been repaired and returned to service.\nThe investigators will pass their information to the prosecutor’s office which reviews the information and officially decide if charges will be pursued. However, the news outlet Yle Svenska reported at the end of May that it understood preliminary trial dates have already been set. They said a trial could begin in late August or early September.\nA court in Taiwan yesterday, June 12, sentenced the Chinese master of a cargo ship to three years in jail for a similar offense. Taiwan reported the captain of a vessel registered in Togo anchored in an area marked as restricted and permitted the vessel to drift across sensitive cables. They reported finding clear indications of external forces on the damaged cable.\nThese cases raised awareness of the dangers in the Baltic and Scandinavian countries. They have increased patrols around critical undersea infrastructure and were successful in getting NATO to also commit resources for the protection of the undersea assets."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "A new report is suggesting that China’s COSCO Shipping is negotiating for a role as an investor in the deal to acquire the terminal operations of CK Hutchison. Bloomberg first reported that a group of Chinese investors is in discussions with MSC’s Terminal Investments and BlackRock about participating in the $23 billion deal for the terminal operations in 41 ports around the world.\nChina has strongly objected to the deal and primarily the parallel portion that sells the operation of terminals at both ends of the Panama Canal. Billionaire Li Ka-shing who controls CK Hutchison has long been at odds with the communist government and with the announcement of the deal China said it was a betrayal of the nation. It sees the agreement to sell the operations in Panama to BlackRock as a threat to Chinese trade and being done to appease Donald Trump and his assertions that “China runs the Panama Canal.”\nThe two deals have also come under scrutiny from various parts of the shipping industry which cites MSC’s growing domination. Panama officials told the Financial Times that the concentration of terminal ownership could threaten the promised neutrality of Panama’s operations. Well-known industry analyst Drewry also highlights that TIL would become a dominant force in port operations. TIL says on its website that it operates more than 70 terminals worldwide in 31 countries and handles more than 65 million containers annually. MSC has also become the sole investor in the Port of Hamburg (Germany) with the city.\nCK Hutchison announced at the beginning of March that it had entered into exclusive negotiations with the BlackRock investment group for the terminals in Panama as well as its portfolio of properties worldwide except for Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. The outline of the deal called for the sale of 80 percent ownership of CK Hutchison’s portfolio of 43 global ports (199 berths in 23 countries) and in a parallel agreement 90 percent ownership of Panama Ports Company, which operates the terminals in Balboa and Cristobal, Panama. It later came out that TIL was negotiating for as much as 70 percent ownership of the international portfolio with BlackRock holding just 20 percent and 10 percent retained by CK Hutchison.\nChina has said it would be reviewing the deal to ensure it followed the rules although it has no official oversight role. Restructuring to add a portion of the investment from COSCO and possibly other Chinese companies could be seen as a face-saving move for the Chinese government. COSCO is a logical company to lead the Chinese portion as its COSCO Shipping Ports as of December 31, 2024, operated and managed 375 berths at 39 ports globally, of which 226 were for containers, with an annual handling capacity of approximately 124 million TEU.\nBloomberg points out that the exclusive agreement between Hutchison and the BlackRock/TIL group was for 145 days meaning it is due to expire in late July. They could agree to extend the exclusive agreement or it could open the door for alternate bids. Hutchison and BlackRock had said they were targeting signing definitive agreements on or before April 2."

        "content": "\nA team of experts is planning to carry out a detailed survey of a British World War I warship sitting at the bottom of the sea, hoping that it can serve as a blueprint for tackling the environmental time bombs of wartime shipwrecks.\nThe team from Britain’s Ministry of Defense Salvage and Maritime Operations (SALMO) and Waves Group intends to study the wreck of HMSCassandrawhich is lying in just 20 meters of water in the Baltic Sea, off the Estonian island of Saaremaa. The British warship was lost in December 1918 after hitting a mine.\nTheCassandrasurvey is a response to a call by Project Tangaroa for governments to act decisively and deal with the threat of pollution posed by thousands of vessels lost during World War I and II. Project Tangaroa, a global community of experts coordinated by Lloyd’s Register Foundation, The Ocean Foundation, and Waves Group, made the call at the third UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France.\nWartime shipwrecks lying at the bottom of the oceans and seas are believed to be environmental disasters waiting to happen. It is estimated that globally, there are over 8,500 wrecks classified as “potentially polluting wrecks. The majority originate from World War I and II and contain harmful chemical pollutants, unexploded munitions, and an estimated 2.5 million to 20 million tonnes of oil.\n\n\nImaging of HMS Cassandra from 2021 (Royal Navy)\n\nThere are concerns that after 80 to 110 years beneath the waves, the wrecks are becoming increasingly unstable, something that is raising the risks of pollution. Climate change, structural breakdown, and a lack of proactive management are some of the factors that have made the wrecks become “ticking time bombs.”\nExperts believe that without proactive actions, dealing with pollution from these wrecks could cost up to $340 billion. There is also the danger of immeasurable environmental damage, threats to marine life, and potentially disastrous impacts on ocean economies and coastal communities.\nTo avert the risks posed by wartime shipwrecks, the planned study ofCassandrais seen as critical in serving as a blueprint. Discovered in August 2010 by the Estonian Navy and Estonian Maritime Museum, the cruiser was a tragic aftermath of WWI.\nCassandrawas commissioned into the Royal Navy fleet in June 1917 and actively participated in WWI for two years. Following the end of the war, the cruiser was part of a British force dispatched to the Baltic as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. A key aim of the intervention was to support the independence of the newly founded Baltic States of Latvia and Estonia against the Bolsheviks.\nHistorical accounts show that on December 5, 1918, the British force was on passage to Tallinn, Estonia, whenCassandrastruck a mine near the island of Saaremaa. The ship sank quickly, with 11 of her 400 crew killed. The wreck ofCassandrais close to the wrecks of two other Royal Navy ships, minesweepersMyrtleandGentianwhich also struck mines, both sinking within moments of each other on July 15, 1919.\nIn 2021, sailors aboard Royal Navy ship Echo surveyed the wreck ofCassandra, managing to get imagery that showed the cruiser was lying on her starboard side with approximately 20 meters of her bow section missing.\nWith experts going back to the wreck for a detailed study, it is expected that the findings will be instrumental in tackling threats of warships lying in ocean and sea beds.\n“Cassandra has the potential to become a blueprint for future international collaboration when it comes to addressing the risks caused by potentially-polluting wrecks,” said Matt Skelhorn, Head of the UK MOD Wreck Management Programme at SALMO.\nThe SALMO team has been closely involved with Project Tangaroa since its inception, providing critical insights on the practical and political challenges involved with the management of its own inventory of more than 5,000 wrecks around the world."

Concern was being raised during the day on Friday as winds began to build ahead of an approaching storm which local officials feared would drive the ship toward the coastline.\nDespite continuing hotspots and heavy gray and black smoke coming from the midsection of the vessel, the Indian Coast Guard reports the Indian Navy was able to put a salvage team aboard the vessel late on Friday, June 13. They used a helicopter to winch four salvage personnel on the deck of the vessel.

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "Canadian firm Trigon Pacific Terminals intends to increase bulk liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) exports to Asian markets after reaching a final investment decision (FID) on a C$750 million (US$552 million) export facility at the Port of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. It comes as Canada works to expand its energy exports including the Canada LNG plant in Vancouver which is scheduled to start exports in the coming weeks.\nPrivately-owned Trigon called reaching the FID a critical milestone in the implementation of the open-access export facility that will have a capacity of 2.5 million tonnes per annum. Expected to commence exports in late 2029, the facility will be instrumental in increasing Canadian LPG export sales beyond its traditional U.S. market to the growing Asian markets particularly Japan, South Korea, and India.\nThe facility, which is now subject to securing all necessary legal and regulatory approvals, will involve the construction of 98,000 cubic meters of new LPG storage capacity and will leverage existing vessel loading infrastructure. The facility will also leverage existing rail yards, with new rail unloading facilities to provide complete unit train unloading.\nTrigon operates a multi-commodity bulk export terminal at Prince Rupert that has the capacity to load metallurgical coal, thermal coal, and petroleum coke at a rate of 9,000 tonnes per hour. In 2023, the company decided to redevelop a portion of the existing coal facilities for LPG exports. The move was informed by the Canadian government's decision to ban thermal coal exports starting in 2030.\nThe company contends that by taking advantage of the available terminal capacity and infrastructure combined with its experience in handling propane, investing in the LPG export facility is a logical next step.\nTrigon highlights that demand for Canadian LPG is at its peak with off-take discussions ongoing with Asian markets. Japan, in particular, has been increasing LPG imports from Canada, achieving a stable import volume of 2 million tonnes in 2024. More than 20 percent of Japan's total propane imports flow through the Port of Prince Rupert. Nikkei reported today that Mitsubishi has also agreed to begin LNG imports from Canada, marking the first time Japan has contracted for large-scale Canadian LNG imports.\nBritish Columbia's Environmental Assessment Office also reported this week that work is now underway on the new Prince Rupert Gas Transmission natural gas pipeline project. It will provide a link from Hudson's Hope in northeastern B.C. to Lelu Island near Prince Rupert bringing LNG to a proposed liquefaction plant.\nCanada Energy Regulator’s data show that owing to an increase in natural gas production, the country’s propane and butane exports have been on a steady growth path. In 2024, the country’s propane exports averaged 218,300 barrels per day (bpd), a 9.2 percent increase while butane exports surged 15 percent to an average of 56,100 bpd.\n“This FID is a pivotal moment for Trigon and for Canada’s energy sector, creating new pathways for Canadian LPG to reach international markets, and driving economic growth, resiliency and opportunity for Canadians,” said Rob Booker, Trigon CEO.\nTrigon says that the new facility will address a pressing need for Canadian energy producers who are facing significant challenges accessing export markets due to capacity constraints at existing Prince Rupert facilities.\nTrigon’s is the second large-scale export facility being built at Prince Rupert. Last year, U.S. company AltaGas and its Dutch partner Royal Vopak reached an FID for the Ridley Island Energy Export Facility being constructed at a cost of $1.3 billion."

        "content": "North Korea staged an elaborate celebration for its new Choe Hyon class destroyer which was officially named Kang Kon in an event led by Kim Jong Un. The vessel was decked out with bunting in a dry dock at the Rajin Shipyard and named with sailors aboard for the event on June 12.\nDuring the ceremony, Kim referred to the “miraculous event of building two large multipurpose destroyers in less than a year and a half.” The vessel was called a symbol of strength that would extend into the Pacific as part of the country’s second generation of destroyers.\nKim told the audience it was part of the national defense strategy and practical measures for radically strengthening the maritime force.\nThe 5,000-ton vessel looked fully patched up and sparkling a month after the disastrous first launch. Officials said the vessel was fully restored noting that it had been completed before the deadline set to have the vessel ahead of the Central Committee meeting at the end of the month. Kim told the audience the ship would be delivered to the Navy in the middle of next year after completing various necessary procedures such as configuring its weapon system.\n\n\nCelebration of the naming of the new destroyer (KCNA)\n\nHe recognized the efforts of the shipbuilders at both the yards in the east and the west and the contribution of Chongjin Shipyard where the vessel was built and the Rajin Shipyard where the vessel is now in a dry dock for repairs and outfitting. He said the vessel incorporates complex weaponry, a new form of ship-mounted detectors, an integrated management system, and the use of artificial intelligence in the combat environment.\n“Currently, various new weapon systems for ships and torpedoes are being researched and developed, and importantly, a major revolution is expected in the composition of ship engine power systems,” Kim announced. He said the government has also approved the construction of two additional 5,000-ton destroyers starting next year.\nHe said difficulties and obstacles remain in the shipbuilding aims of North Korea while also referencing the “absurd accident” while launching the destroyer.  He said the failure of the launch was not a simple mistake, but an “unacceptable and serious criminal act that instantly brought down the dignity and pride of the nation.” He called the effort at restoring the destroyer an “epochal opportunity,” for the shipbuilding industry.\n\n\n\nThe Secretary of the Central Committee cut the rope unveiling the ship’s name plaque. The ship’s horn sounded and fireworks and balloons were launched. Kim boarded the vessel to inspect its sailors and the vessel’s captain was presented to the leader.\nTheKang Keonwas being launched on May 21 at an early ceremony attended by Kim. During the sideways launch, the stern released ahead of the bow and the vessel twisted and fell to its side. Kim ordered it immediately righted with reports the teams used pullies and airbags to refloat the vessel.\nNorth Korea celebrated the first of the class earlier this year. Analysts believe the vessels which are heavily armed and have the displacement of a frigate, likely are capable of launching ballistic missiles and have 74 VLS cells in several sizes."

Last week, 16 Indonesian fishermen pleaded guilty to offenses stemming from two separate interdictions in May - both of which ended in the destruction of the suspects' vessels.\nThe first case involved an Indonesian boat that Australian authorities identified and intercepted on May 21, near the Cobourg Peninsula, a priority enforcement area in the Northern Territory. On board, the authorities found and seized 600 kilos of sea cucumber worth AUD$60,000, 330 kilos of salt used to process and preserve catch, and a range of fishing equipment.\nThe eight crewmembers were detained and taken to the port of Darwin for processing. The Australian Border Force seized the vessel and destroyed it at sea, as is allowed by Australian law. The men were charged with illegal fishing offenses, and all eight pleaded guilty. The skipper and crew received a sentence of 21 days' imprisonment plus a $2,000 good-behavior bond.\nIn the second case, Australian authorities caught an Indonesian vessel fishing illegally near Scott Reef - a coral atoll some 500 nautical miles west of Darwin - on May 14. On board, authorities found 150 kilos of salt for preserving catch, along with spears, diving equipment and other fishing gear.\nAs in the previous case, eight fishermen were detained and the boat was destroyed at sea. All eight were charged with fisheries offenses, and they received fines of AUD$2,500-5,000.\nWhen done with their time in the Australian legal system, all of these suspects will be deported back to Indonesia."

Both vessels sustained minor damage.\nWhen officers from the Bremen Water Police arrived to assess the accident, they immediately noticed the smell of alcohol on the captain. A voluntary breathalyzer test confirmed their suspicions: a blood alcohol level of over 1.6 per mille.\nThe police banned the captain from continuing his journey, and they ordered a follow-up blood sample to be taken and a $6,000 security deposit withheld.\nAn investigation into the captain's actions for allegedly endangering shipping traffic is ongoing.\nMaritime intelligence site Vesseltracker (a division of Wood Mac) has identified the captain's vessel as the 8,500 coastal freighter Wilson Nanjing. AIS data provided by Pole Staer confirms that the Nanjing briefly departed Weserport Terminal 1 at about 1800 hours GMT on Thursday, then immediately returned to the pier and remained for several days.

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nThe Port of Los Angeles has agreed to stop the discharge of effluent and restore the city’s harbor as part of settling a lawsuit in which the port was accused of violating the federal Clean Water Act. A U.S. District Court judge has approved the settlement, which resolves a suit brought by Environment California last year.\nIn the lawsuit, the group had alleged that the port had repeatedly discharged untreated wastewater with illegal levels of toxic copper and fecal bacteria into the harbor since 2019. During the period, the port is alleged to have conducted over 2,000 illegal discharges. The group had also alleged that the port’s stormwater treatment system was undersized and that, as a result, untreated wastewater frequently bypassed the system entirely, ending up in the harbor.\nEnvironment California had filed the suit under the Clean Water Act’s “citizen suit” provision, which allows private citizens affected by violations to sue. The Act requires permitted facilities, including ports, to monitor their discharges and to submit publicly available reports to the government with the results of the monitoring. Environment California carried out an analysis of the publicly available records and found that the Port of Los Angeles violated the Act over 2,000 times since 2019, all at a single stormwater outfall.\nThe Port of Los Angeles, the busiest container port in the western hemisphere, has agreed to a settlement and committed to improving its management of stormwater and groundwater. The port will be required to treat stormwater to ensure that fecal bacteria stay out of the harbor, and it must redirect groundwater contaminated with pollutants to the Terminal Island Water Reclamation Plant for treatment before it can be reused.\nAs part of the settlement, the port will pay $1.3 million to the Rose Foundation For Communities & The Environment to restore the Los Angeles Harbor and San Pedro Bay. The majority of funds will be earmarked for a multi-year project to remove tonnes of trash from San Pedro Bay. Port of Los Angeles will also pay a $130,000 civil penalty to the U.S. Treasury.\n“Californians count on having a clean, vibrant coastline, but that’s not compatible with contaminated effluent that can lap up on our world-renowned shores,” said Laura Deehan, Environment California’s state director. “This settlement is a great step toward a cleaner, safer San Pedro Bay, and it demonstrates the vital role that citizen lawsuits play in the enforcement of our federal environmental laws.”\nLocated in San Pedro Bay, the Port of Los Angeles covers 7,500 acres of land and water along 43 miles of waterfront and is one of the worlds’ busiest seaports. In 2024, the port handled a total of 10.3 million container units, a 20 percent increase compared to 8.6 million TEU in 2023.\nThe settlement comes as studies show that U.S beaches are some of the most contaminated. In 2022, 1,761 out of 3,192 tested beaches in the country (55 percent) experienced at least one day on which fecal contamination reached potentially unsafe levels. In California alone, the problem is entrenched with fecal bacteria being found in 193 beaches out of 256 beaches that were tested."

The crew notified the Coast Guard and went to anchor on nearby Hay Lake to conduct a damage assessment. Photos from the scene appear to show that she had taken on a slight starboard list.\nNo injuries or pollution were reported, but responders deployed a containment boom around the vessel as a precautionary measure. Under the control of a unified command, the operator and commercial salvors began to take measures to reduce the risk of pollution and to maximize the vessel's stability. The laker Kaye E. Barker anchored alongside the Oberstar on Thursday morning, and the crew of the Oberstar used their self-unloading boom to transfer their cargo - 29,000 tonnes of limestone - over to the Barker. Responders also ran hoses to a damaged bunker tank and pumped off thousands of gallons of oily-water mixture.\n\nOberstar's crew transfer limestone cargo over to another laker, June 12 (USCG)\n\nSalvors work to transfer oil-water mixture out of a damaged bunker tank aboard Oberstar (USCG)\nAfter these steps were completed, and a thorough engineering assessment of the ship was finished, the unified command authorized the Oberstar to make a transit to Fraser Shipyards in Superior, Wisconsin.

All of PSA Singapore's current operational berths remain accessible, and all other port operations and development work were wholly unaffected.\nKejadian di Singapurapic.twitter.com/pdwmz6X0CU\nUnverified casualty video\nThe incident is under investigation, and PSA and the Maritime and the MPA are working with other agencies to respond to the casualty.\nTuas is a brand new greenfield port complex, and it is on track to become the largest of its kind in the world (at full buildout). Singapore plans to gradually shift all of its container terminal operations to Tuas over the span of two decades, freeing up waterfront for other development in the city center."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nEnvironmental campaigners and scientists are renewing their push for a ban on industrial krill fishing in order to protect the ecosystem of the Antarctica Ocean. New evidence suggests that the emperor penguin populations in the Southern Ocean are declining faster than thought, and the decline could be linked to krill.\nAt the UN Ocean Conference (UNOC 3) in Nice, France, the campaigners - led by National Geographic ocean explorer and conservationist Sylvia Earle, actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Captain Paul Watson, filmmaker Andy Mann, and the Bob Brown Foundation (BBF) put out a call for a total ban on krill fishing. They argue that allowing krill fishing to continue is threatening the survival of whales, seals and penguins that depend on krill for food.\nKrill, the tiny shrimp-like crustacean, is the lifeline of the Antarctic Ocea. These tiny creatures are the main source of food for whales, seals and penguins. A humpback whale needs around 1.5 to 2 tons of krill per day for survival.\nIn recent years, industrial krill fishing has been on the rise because of demand for fishmeal for pet food and farmed salmon feed, as well as krill oil for making omega-three pills products. A growing number of super trawlers are venturing in the Southern Ocean waters for krill. Data show that in 2024, catches soared to nearly half a million metric tonnes compared to around 100,000 metric tonnes in 2017. Norwegian, Chinese and South Korean trawlers dominate in industrial krill fishing, and even India is considering getting into the business.\nThe Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), an international body mandated to protect the Antarctic ecosystem, has been trying to limit krill overfishing. Last year, the body refused to increase the krill quota for 2024 despite intense lobbying by the fishing industry, maintaining the quota at 620,000 tonnes. This it reckons is roughly one percent of the total stock of Antarctic krill, estimated at 215 million tonnes.\nCampaigners and scientists now reckon that limiting the quotas is not good enough and want a total ban on krill fishing.\n“Krill are the foundation of the Antarctic ecosystem but are caught to feed to factory farmed salmon, sold as supposed health capsules and for pet food. It is an environmental crime happening on our watch that supertrawlers are plundering krill from the Antarctic Ocean,” said Alistair Allan, BBF Antarctic and Marine campaigner.\nPenguins in decline\nThe renewed push for an industrial krill fishing ban comes when scientists at the British Antarctic Survey have released a new study that shows that Antarctica’s iconic emperor penguin population may be decreasing faster than some of the most pessimistic predictions.\nBased on up-to-date satellite imagery analysis, the new study highlights that the birds’ numbers declined by 22 percent over a 15-year period from 2009 to 2024. This is a huge decline considering that earlier estimates had put the decline at 9.5 percent over the 2009 to 2018 period. Assuming the current rates of global warming continue and are maintained, the scientists expect the birds to be extinct by 2100.\nApart from climate change, the study cites increased competition for food resources as another factor causing the decline of the penguin populations. The birds are facing competition from petrels, seals and killer whales for food."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nSince the initial strikes early on the morning of June 13, the scope of Israel’s attacks on targets in Iran has broadened. It is now becoming apparent that Iranian air defenses have been neutralized, with the Israeli Air Force having freedom to strike targets at will. To illustrate, Israeli defense spokesman Brigadier Effie Defrin claimed that over 70 Israeli Air Force aircraft struck targets in the Tehran area early on June 14 over a three hour period. Over 40 targets were attacked during this period.\nFor illustrative purposes, Israel’s targeting has so far included:\nSenior IRGC commanders and operational headquarters,in a bid to paralyze the Iranian response, and possibly to undermine the hardliner faction within the Iranian government. As well as air strikes, drones and attacks have been mounted from within Iran, targeting particular individuals, some in their homes and others in their places of work. Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi has been named by the Supreme Leader as the new Chief of Staff of Iran's armed forces (Artesh), replacing Major General Mohammad Bagheri, and Mohammad Pakpour as the new commander of the IRGC, succeeding Hossein Salami. Brigadier Seyed Majid Mousavi has been appointed the new commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force, in charge of the ballistic missile and drone force, most of his senior leadership team having been killed when a meeting was targeted.\nUranium-enriching and weapons-related nuclear facilitiesat Tabriz, Kermanshah, Natanz, Arak, Tehran, Isfahan and Fordow have been attacked. At least 10 senior Iranian nuclear scientists have also been pinpointed and killed.\nAir defense targets,both radar surveillance and missile units. Some of these targets have initially been attacked with locally-launched and controlled drones, others with Harop loitering drones.\nBallistic missile sites.Social media footage from Kermanshah shows a line of destroyed transporter erector launchers - which normally take minutes to ready for action and to withdraw post-launch. Another video released by Israel shows an attack on a missile as it is being erected on its mobile launcher, suggesting that in some areas Israeli surveillance is sufficiently established to call up quick-reaction aircraft overhead. The success of attacks on ballistic missile sites is apparent in the poor sequencing and low numbers of missiles - so far, totaling about 200 - which the Iranians have been able to launch at Israel, enabling Israeli air defenses to avoid being swamped and overwhelmed by successive missile barrages. The Iranians have primarily employed Shahab-3 and Khoramshahr medium range missiles.\n????? ?????? ????? ???? ????-???? ??????:pic.twitter.com/bCJUhPbSV1\nIndustrial targets,including the gas extraction plant at Fajr Jam which processes output from the South Pars field, the world’s largest gas producing field. Israeli social media commentators are suggesting that Israel is also beginning attacks on other energy sites on Iran’s coast. The Bonyan engine production plant in Tabriz which has produced engines for drones has also been hit, as has been the Raisi power plant in Isfahan. In later attacks, Israel targeted the Shiraz Electronics Industries factory and an electronics factory in Isfahan, both associated with the building of missile guidance systems.\nIt is not yet clear if regular armed forces targets have been attacked, other than air defense units as might be expected. Iran’s veteran fleet of F-4 Phantoms based at the 3TAB Hamadan Airbase appears to have been taken out of service.\nSo far, the Iranian regular Navy (Nedaja) still seems to have remained on the sidelines, and the Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor still has most of its home-based warships moored dockside. Two IRGC Navy (Nedsa) drone carriers have shifted slightly west from their customary positions held in the Bandar Abbas anchorage for the last month, with theShahid Bagheri(C110-4) drone carrier spotted at 27.0599N 56.1268E on June 13. Her sister shipShahid Madhavi(C110-3) was located a mile to the south.\nThe Nedaja did claim that a British frigate had intercepted an Iranian vessel and required it to change course. However, the picture of the interceptor was identified as one of the two Emirati Gowind Class frigates, implying that the Nedaja may have mistaken the frigate in drone footage and invented the incident.\n\nNedaja-released image showing a vessel mistakenly identified as a British frigate (@Mehdi H)\nAs to be expected, some hardliners, including IRGC general Esmaeil Kousari, have called for the closure of the Straits of Hormuz. But such action might now be beyond Iran’s capabilities, and would in any case be counterproductive: it would harm Iran itself and alienate GCC states who so far have remained neutral in the conflict. Rational considerations, however, may not shape the Iranian course of action.\nAn Israeli defense spokesman has also announced that Israel has continued air attacks on Yemen, targeting Muhammad Abdul Karim Al Ghamari, the Houthi Armed Forces Chief of Staff late on June 14. He apparently was wounded, but the fate of other senior leaders attending the meeting he was chairing in the Hadda district of Sanaa is not yet known."

USSCarl Vinsonand her escorts are already in the Arabian Sea, positioned for possible contingencies.\nNimitzappears to have canceled a planned port call in Vietnam in order to depart swiftly for the Arabian Sea, according to an announcement shared by the U.S. embassy in Hanoi. USSGeorge Washingtonremains in port in Japan as the sole U.S. Navy carrier in the Western Pacific. The Royal Navy's HMSPrince of Waleshas recently departed the Mideast, headed eastbound as part of a scheduled long-distance deployment.\nThe air campaign over Iran is prompting a minor split in the Trump administration's defense establishment between those who want to help Israel's campaign and those who want to minimize the odds of another long war in the Mideast, according to intelligence-community outlet Semafor. China hawk Eldridge Colby - undersecretary of defense - is believed to favor keeping U.S. military assets in Asia, where they can be used to deter PRC aggression against Taiwan. Gen. Michael Kurilla, head of Central Command, is said to favor relocating more equipment to the Mideast where it can be used to defend or support Israel. (The Pentagon told Semafor that there is no internal split.)\n\"Right now, we've got assets in the region and we're going to defend them,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News on Monday. \"We're strong, we're prepared, we're defensive . . . President Trump hopes there can be peace.\"\nAmong the assets in the region is the naval base at Diego Garcia, where the U.S. Air Force stations strategic bombers for campaigns in the Central Command area of operations. This small outpost in the Indian Ocean provided the launch pad for strikes in Afghanistan during the War on Terror, and it was recently used for bombing runs over Yemen during the campaign against Houthi militants earlier this year. In May, satellite imaging identified six B-2 stealth bombers and four B-52 strategic bombers on the tarmac at Diego Garcia - all capable of delivering the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, the most powerful known conventional bunker-busting bomb. This 30,000-pound bomb would have a far greater chance of reaching Iran's deeply-buried nuclear facilities than anything in the Israeli arsenal.\nOpen-source flight tracking analysts have noted a surge of nearly three dozen U.S. aerial tankers headed east, most landing in Europe - a critical enabler for a large-scale U.S. \"air bridge,\" if desired. Publicly, President Donald Trump has called for Iran to return to the negotiating table \"before it is too late,\" and he warned Sunday that it was possible that U.S. forces would join the Israeli campaign. On Monday, he called for Iranian citizens to \"immediately evacuate Tehran.\""

        "content": "\nA new initiative was launched last week, aimed at improving weather forecasting and ocean monitoring. The initiative - dubbed 10,000 Ships for the Ocean - aims to increase the number of vessels equipped for ocean and weather monitoring.\nAlthough the ocean covers over 70% of the Earth, vast areas remain under-observed. Limited coverage means that there are critical knowledge gaps in some weather systems. The goal is to increase the current fleet of 2,000 ships to 10,000 commercial vessels providing real-time weather and surface ocean data. This will help to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, early warning systems and climate monitoring.\nThe initiative is led by partners including the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission and the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\nThe Norwegian car carrier Höegh Autoliners is one of the shipping companies that have pledged support for the initiative. The company said that it would commit its fleet to the project as a contribution to expand ocean data, benefitting both society at large and maritime operations.\n“This initiative will go some way to address the gap in weather measurements over the ocean. To give a context, we currently use 15 times less data from ships over the sea than from meteorological stations over land to predict weather worldwide. The more the data points we get, the more accurate our forecast will be,” said Florence Rabier, the Director General of ECMWF.\nFor centuries, ships at sea have been instrumental in monitoring the ocean and the atmosphere, contributing to science and marine safety. The initiative to scale ship-based observing infrastructure is part of a global reforms effort targeted at upgrading ocean monitoring.\nThe initiative complements an ongoing push to reform the Argo program, which is a critical pillar of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) administered by the UN and the International Science Council (ISC). Launched in the early 2000s, the international Argo program provides real-time data on the temperature and salinity of the ocean up to 2,000 meters. This is made possible through a global network of 4,000 autonomous floats deployed across all oceans.\nBut as the ocean is undergoing changes, there is consensus in the scientific community for the Argo program to evolve. The goal is to expand the observational capabilities of the program by 2030, enabling comprehensive monitoring of the global ocean from the surface to the seabed. In addition, the program will broaden the range of physical and chemical parameters it monitors.\nIn the new phase of the Argo program, 1,200 new floats will be deployed to monitor the deep ocean down to 6,000 meters."

        "content": "In an unusual sequence, defense contractor Babcock International has informally launched the lead ship in the Royal Navy's new class of frigates, the Type 31. The first vessel departed the Rosyth yard on a semisubmersible barge and made a short voyage downriver so that it could be floated out in deeper water - then towed back to its starting point for continued construction.\nThe HMSVenturer, the lead ship of the Type 31 class, took to the water for the first time - a major milestone in its construction journey that started in September 2021. The ship emerged from the building hall late last month, and the process of floating it out was a delicate one. Babcock's team waited for a suitable tidal window in the Forth estuary.\nThe window came last week when a barge supporting the warship left Rosyth and sailed to deep waters, then sheltered in preparation for the delicate maneuver off Leith. Over the weekend,Venturerwas successfully lifted off the barge and into the water. Under tow, the frigate was able to make an 11-mile journey up the estuary, passing beneath the three iconic Forth Crossings bridges and back to Babcock’s Rosyth facility, where outfitting and systems integration will continue in preparation for sea trials.\nOver the next nine months, the frigate will be at Rosyth’s Dry Dock No.?3 for the intensive outfitting phase that will include installation of her weapons, sensors, and propulsion systems. Sea trials are expected to begin in late 2026 or early 2027.\nThe Royal Navy that is currently dependent largely on its aging Type 23 frigates for presence operations. The vessels, which are larger than the frigates they will be replacing, are designed to support general-purpose missions, from patrol to counter-smuggling to board and search operations. They are not intended for antisubmarine warfare. Once she enters service,Venturerwill be crewed by about 115 sailors, and has capacity to accommodate more as her tasking requires.\n“In a complex and uncertain world, our ability to design, build and support advanced warships in the UK is more important than ever. HMSVenturer'sfirst entry into the water is a clear demonstration of UK sovereign capability in action and the depth, resilience and expertise within Babcock's Marine business,” said Sir Nick Hine, Babcock’s Marine Sector Chief Executive."

Chairman of United Kingdom’s Denholm Group, a family-owned business with interests spanning shipping, logistics, seafoods, and industrial services, Denholm has been one of the ICS' vice chairmen since June 2023.\nThe leadership change at ICS also sees Thomas Kazakos succeed Guy Platten as Secretary General. A former Director General of the Cyprus Shipping Chamber, Kazakos joined ICS in April and has been preparing to assume office.\nAlso coming in as part of the new team are three vice chairs - Gaby Bornheim from Germany, Carl-Johan Hagman from Japan and Claes Berglund from Sweden.\nICS, which represents the world’s national shipowner associations and over 80 percent of the world's merchant fleet, notes that the leadership transition comes when the industry is being confronted with complex and evolving challenges. The ongoing threat of global protectionism and increasing trade wars are already having adverse impacts on the industry, disrupting global trade flows, maritime transport, and supply chains. According to the ICS, the growing trend towards economic bifurcation and decoupling is bound to significantly reshape international trade dynamics.\nThe industry also faces pressure to decarbonize. In October, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is set to adopt new greenhouse gases reduction measures that are expected to reshape the structure of the global shipping industry for years to come. The new measures, which will come into force in 2027, are mandatory for the large ocean-going ships over 5,000 GT that emit 85 percent of the sector's total CO2 emissions.?\n“With all that is going on in the maritime space at the moment the industry needs strong governance and strong leadership,” said Emanuele Grimaldi, ICS outgoing Chairman.\nGrimaldi also praised the role played by Platten in steering ICS since 2018. During his time, the ICS has been confronted by numerous challenges including the implementation of the ballast water convention, COVID pandemic, theEver Givenblockage of the Suez Canal, and advancing seafarers' welfare and women in shipping, among others.\nApart from the leadership transition, the ICS has also confirmed the Malta International Shipowners Association as a full member. Formerly an associate member, the confirmation reflects Malta’s expanding influence in maritime affairs."

Last week, the G+ Offshore Wind Health and Safety Organization released its 2024 incident report, revealing rising safety risks in the offshore wind industry.\nThe data contained in the report is compiled from G+ member companies, comprising lead operators and owners of offshore wind farms and original equipment manufacturers serving the sector. The reporting covered Asia, Europe, Australia and the U.S. A major highlight of the report, which is in its twelfth year, is the unprecedented growth for the industry in 2024, with 79 million work hours reported, representing a 27 percent increase from 2023.\nHowever, this growth has also seen a rise in both the Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR), up 7 percent, and the Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF), which went up by 19 percent. Unfortunately, the industry recorded one fatality last year. The incident involved a worker fatally injured during the disassembly work on a monopile upending tool. The second worker was left hospitalized.\nNotably, development sites saw the highest number of reported injuries, with a 75 percent increase year-on-year. The injury breakdown for the period include 99 lost work day injuries, 57 restricted work day injuries and 74 medical treatment injuries. Incidents tagged as high potential - having the greatest likelihood of causing serious harm regardless of actual consequence - were 245, representing 12 percent of all incidents.\nJack-up vessels/barges constituted a risky area for the industry, accounting for 14% of all injuries, with 92 incidents in 2024, up 42% from 2023. Other platforms that recorded significant increases in the number of injuries include the survey vessels, with 30 incidents from 12 in 2023, a rise of 150 percent. Cable installation vessels saw a 108 percent rise to 25 incidents, from 12 the previous year.\n“The continued growth of the offshore wind sector is a testament to our industry’s commitment to the energy transition, but it also brings new and evolving risks. The increase in high potential incidents and the tragic fatality this year remind us that we must never be complacent,” said G+ Chair and Senior Vice President at Ørsted, Lisbeth Frømling."

The newbuilds will support a shipping route connecting Norway with Germany and Sweden.\nIn addition to the grant for Eitzen, the Port of Oslo will receive an additional $2 million from Enova for a new electric charging station at the Sjursoya container terminal, which will power up the two new ships.\nThe container ship projects are the highlight of the funding round, but there are many others. Norway's Polar Energy Shipco will also receive $9 million in funding for an electric bulker; Brim Explorer is getting $4 million for two high-speed electric trimarans for passenger transport; and salmon-farming company Lovundlaks is getting about $5 million for two electric workboats.\n“These projects each show in their own way what is possible with battery electrification in shipping. The technology is now mature and the projects exist,” said Andreas Forsnes Jahn, senior advisor on maritime transport at Enova. “If the electrification of car ferries was the first wave, we hope this will be the start of the second electrification wave in short sea shipping.”\nNorway was an early leader in electric-ferry technology, and a Norwegian owner started the electric-boxship trend with the delivery of the Yara Birkeland in 2022. Chinese interests have also invested in battery-electric coastwise feeders, including orders from Ningbo Ocean Shipping and China COSCO, the owner of the current record-holdingvessel."

        "content": "\nWhile Africa has been missing in the global offshore wind scene, Morocco has become the first country in the continent to unveil an offshore wind project. The initiative was announced last week at an event hosted by the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) during the United Nations Ocean Conference in France. The UfM-supported multi-donor fund, the Blue Mediterranean Partnership (BMP), raised extra financing that will see investments in key blue economy initiatives in the Mediterranean region.\nOne of the selected initiatives is the offshore wind project near Essaouira city in Morocco, a first of its kind in the country. The project has the potential to generate up to 1 GW, with construction scheduled to begin in 2029.\n“This project is part of a dynamic that combines energy independence, industrial attractiveness and economic competitiveness,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition.\nLast year, Morocco (with support from a $2.1 million grant from the European Investment Bank) issued a call for a feasibility study on offshore wind development. The exercise is spearheaded by the Moroccan Renewable Energy Agency (MASEN), which is tasked with achieving a national target of sourcing half Morocco’s electricity supply from renewable energy sources by 2030.\nMorocco is on course to hit this target, with government data showing that wind energy capacity reached 2.4 GW by the end of last year. This capacity came from onshore projects, but offshore wind resources present the best opportunity for expansion.\nAccording to World Bank estimates, Morocco has a potential of 200 GW of offshore wind capacity, of which 22 GW are best suited for bottom-fixed turbines while the rest would be floating wind farms. With a vast coastline of 3,500 kilometers, some regions along the Atlantic coast - such as Tangier, Tetouan, Essaouira and Dakhla - have been identified as the best places for offshore wind development. Wind speeds in these regions is estimated to reach 11 meters per second (m/s), ideal for wind energy generation."

Misdeclaration occurs during the landside segment of the logistics process, before the container arrives at the quay and is loaded aboard the ship. A misdeclared hazardous cargo is typically a hidden threat, outside of the crew's knowledge or control, and can put them at significant risk of injury or death.\nThe Fort Kochi Police have received a First Information Report (initial criminal allegation) against the vessel and the surviving crewmembers of theWan Hai 503,alleging that they were responsible for the cargo fire that left four shipmates missing. The charges are comprehensive, including negligent navigation; obstructing lines of navigation; negligent handling toxic substances; negligent handling of flammable materials; and endangering human life by using explosives. An additional conspiracy charge applies to the crew's allegedly unified actions.\n\"The crew abandoned the vessel immediately after the explosion. The crew members of cargo vessels are trained to undertake firefighting operations, but their decision to leave the ship is suspicious,\" a senior port officer told The New Indian Express.\nNo charges have been announced yet against any shoreside entities in connection with the alleged misdeclaration of the cargo. However, Nhava Sheva port officials are said to be looking into whether a shipping agency may have booked explosives as general cargo.\nFour crewmembers went missing in the explosion and will not face charges. One decomposed body washed ashore at Alappuzha, Kerala on Monday, and DNA testing will be conducted to determine if it is one of theWan Hai 503'screwmembers.\nOn scene, the Indian Coast Guard and a commercial salvor have towed theWan Hai 503about 60 nautical miles offshore for safety purposes, and firefighting response operations continue. According to local media, some smoke is still coming from the ship, but no water pollution has been observed."

        "content": "\nThe Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is taking an unusual approach to dealing with derelict vessels that wash up on remote shorelines. In a recent cleanup project, it used helicopters to lift 14 boats from the shoreline of Squaxin Island in Puget Sound.\nUsing its wildfire helicopters and ground personnel, DNR conducted the operation as part of its Derelict Vessel Removal program. The boats had been washed ashore or left behind to deteriorate, posing a serious risk to the Island’s ecosystem. Because of their deteriorated state, floating the boats out was not an option.\nThrough a $1 million grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), DNR was able to fund the operation, partnering with the Squaxin Tribe and the Port of Olympia. A total of 14 abandoned vessels were airlifted and flown across Budd Inlet to DNR's Marine Station, north of Squaxin Park in Olympia, where they will be stored awaiting proper disposal. DNR posted aTikTok videoabout the operation, complete with a popular musical-theater soundtrack.\nOnce occupied by the Squaxin Tribe, the island is only accessible to tribal members and is used for fishing, hunting, shellfish gathering, camping, and other activities.\nDNR says that abandoned vessels have become a menace to Washington’s waterways, posing risks to public safety and the health of the marine environment. Since instituting the Derelict Vessel Removal program in 2002, the department has removed more than 1,200 abandoned or neglected vessels from Washington's waterways.\nIn the Puget Sound, cases of abandoned vessels sinking, leaking contaminants, breaking apart in the water, and releasing hazardous materials into the marine environment are rampant. By removing them from the Squaxin Island tribal tidelands, DNR hopes to prevent future accumulation of the boats in order to preserve the ecosystem."

        "content": "\nDespite uncertainties in the North American market, the global commissioned capacity of offshore wind is on course to surpass the 100 GW mark by mid-2026 as countries in Europe and Asia ramp up projects.\nUK’s trade group RenewableUK is highlighting that with 27.3 GW of offshore wind capacity currently under construction, the world should expect to cross the 100 GW mark by the middle of next year, an indication of an industry witnessing “significant increase” despite the storm clouds of higher capex and changing trade policies. Going by the current growth rate, operational capacity could increase nearly threefold to 244 GW worldwide by the end of 2030.\nThe positive future growth projections follow a healthy increase in installed capacity over the past 12 months. According to RenewableUK’s latest EnergyPulse Insights Offshore Wind report, operational capacity increased by 14 percent over the period to reach 85.2 GW, up from 74.7 GW. While pacesetters like China and UK aggressively sustain investments, emerging markets like Indonesia, Chile, Guernsey, Bermuda, and Malta have contributed to an installed capacity increase over the last twelve months.\nChina's ring-fenced domestic market continues to dominate offshore wind with over half of all existing commissioned capacity at 42.9 GW. The UK comes second with 15.6 GW, followed by Germany with 9 GW and the Netherlands with 5.4 GW. Taiwan is now fifth with 3 GW, and Denmark is in sixth place with 2.7 GW.\nWhile the UK has put offshore wind at the heart of its energy transition goals, the country is facing a confidence crisis with developers starting to develop cold feet on projects. Last month, Danish renewable energy giant Ørsted said it will discontinue the UK’s Hornsea 4 project citing increased costs and risks. Hornsea 4 was the company’s fourth gigawatt-scale project in the Hornsea zone with a capacity to generate 2.4 GW.\nGoing by Ørsted’s decision, RenewableUK is raising concerns that upcoming auctions could fail to attract interest from developers. Nearly 8.5 GW of UK offshore wind capacity, across 13 projects, is technically eligible for bidding in the next auction, Allocation Round 7, which opens this year. There are indications that developers might choose to stay away. A further 7.8 GW could become eligible if five other projects receive consent from the government before the auction, bringing the potential total to 16.3 GW.\nTo attract bidding, the UK government is considering relaxing the eligibility rules to allow fixed-bottom projects still in the planning system to participate in forthcoming allocation round, which if implemented could see total eligible capacity reach 25.6 GW.\nFor the UK, the continued rollout of offshore wind remains critical, considering the number of people working in the industry has risen from just over 32,000 two years ago to nearly 40,000 today, a 24 percent increase.\nThe EnergyPulse report shows that the total global portfolio of active offshore wind farms worldwide at any stage of development, from early planning to fully operational, now stands at 1,219 GW across 1,555 projects in 46 countries. China maintains leadership with 261 GW under development followed by the UK with 94.4 GW and the U.S with 77.8 GW.\n“It’s great to see this significant increase in operational offshore wind capacity worldwide, as well as the healthy pipeline of future projects with new countries entering the market every year,” said Jane Cooper, RenewableUK’s Deputy Chief Executive.\nIn the case of the UK, and considering the upcoming auction round, Cooper is urging the government to put the right framework in place to maximize interest by ruling out zonal pricing, something that has the potential to deter investors and jeopardize the country’s targets of reaching 45 GW to 50 GW of offshore wind by 2030."

        "content": "\nRussia has confirmed progress in its ongoing project to design nuclear-powered, LNG-carrying submarines for gas exports along the Northern Sea Route (NSR). The project would put it in the vanguard for a nuclear merchant ship revival - and in a class of its own for commercial submarine transport. In an interview with the state-owned news agency Tass, Russian Transport Minister Roman Starovoit said that underwater gas carriers may soon be launched on the NSR, although he did not provide a timeline.\n“We are discussing underwater gas carriers that will operate on this route. The Kurchatov Institute is developing the project, and it is quite possible that the (submarine gas carriers) will soon appear on the route,” said Starovoit.\nDetails of the project were first publicized at an event in St. Petersburg last year. Mikhail Kovalchuk, Director of the Kurchatov Institute, presented on the submarine project, claiming that it is a viable alternative to traditional gas carriers.\nGovernor General:Russia has developed a model of a unique nuclear-powered underwater gas carrierThe Kurchatov Institute has developed a model of a nuclear-powered submarine for transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) without breaking the…pic.twitter.com/tb89QFkGnw\nWith Russia developing its Arctic LNG projects, conventional gas carriers are limited for year-round navigation without icebreaker escort. If successful, the submarines could revolutionize Russia’s gas transport in the Arctic, at a time when sanctions on the country have slowed construction of icebreakers.\nAt a technology forum early this year, Putin celebrated the concept, describing it as a feasible future for Arctic LNG transport. “I first heard about this innovative idea from Mikhail Kovalchuk a couple of years ago. Although initially skeptical, it turns out that Gazprom and Novatek believe it is quite feasible, profitable and efficient,” stated Putin.\nKurchatov Institute, Russia’s leading nuclear research facility, is supporting with the technical design of the project. The submarine is expected to be 360 meters long, width of about 70 meters and height of 30 meters. It will have a draft of 12-13 meters and reach speeds of up to 17 knots. Further, the submarine will be equipped with three RITM-200 nuclear reactors with a total propulsion capacity of 90 MW. The submarines will also have capacity for around 180,000 tons of LNG.\nBut some analysts doubt whether Russia is able to deliver on this project, citing capacity constraints to design and source parts for a nuclear submarine platform. Indeed, western sanctions on Russia have also affected investments needed in the NSR. For the route to be competitive, massive upgrades for Arctic ports and related infrastructure are needed.\nChinese firms which have expressed interest in using the route have backed down, possibly due to concerns over secondary sanctions. For instance, China state-owned shipping company COSCO has suspended operations along the NSR, leaving only a few privately-owned firms to use the route. But Chinese support for NSR is likely to increase with the recent establishment of a China-Russia commission on NSR development."

        "content": "\nDrug smugglers are constantly on the lookout for new ways to get narcotics past customs agents, and containerized freight is an area of constant innovation for organized crime. The invention of new smuggling routes, concealment methods and infiltration schemes make the cocaine business hard to stop, and it requires port officials to exercise skill and persistence to find the one \"dirty\" container in a yard full of cargo. In the Pacific, Australia - the world's largest per-capita cocaine market - has been working with international partners to train up customs officers and target drug shipments throughout Oceania, not just in the major seaports in New South Wales and Queensland.\nDuring a recent Australian Border Force-led operation, ABF officers worked together with their counterparts from the U.S., New Caledonia, French Polynesia and New Zealand to teach local officers how to detect drugs placed using the \"rip\" concealment method, also known as \"rip-on/rip-off.\" This common scheme involves concealing drugs in an otherwise normal container shipment, and it is often carried out by corrupt workers or officials at the port of origin. On arrival in the destination country, the smuggling ring intercepts the container and removes the drugs.\nDuring the two-month operation, the joint teams seized 140 kilos of cocaine in French Polynesia, all hidden in insulation panels in a reefer box. Another 67 kilos were seized in New Caledonia, hidden behind panels in a shipping container. In Australia - where cocaine is worth more than gold on the street, gram for gram - authorities captured a total of 285 kilos from three different shipping containers.\n\n\nCourtesy ABF\n\"Organized crime groups are highly sophisticated enterprises, with incredibly deep pockets and a constantly expanding global reach,\" said ABF Commander International Claire Rees. \"The Rip method is becoming a hugely popular method of evasion, but it is only a possible strategy due to the increase of trusted insiders and criminal infiltration throughout the global supply chain.\"\nThe Pacific islands are a transit corridor for smuggling drugs from South American countries of origin to markets in Australia, and it is a route established enough to earn a name of its own - the \"Pacific Drug Highway.\" Latin American cartels, Chinese Triads and a variety of local actors all play a role in the trade, Joint Interagency Task Force - West advisor Jim Ink told New Lines Magazine."

        "content": "\nAs the war between Israel and Iran continues, speculation continues to mount over whether Iran will seek to close the Strait of Hormuz. If the strait were to be effectively closed, the consequences could be huge. Jebel Ali, on the western side of the strait, is the largest port in the Middle East and the ninth largest in the world. All of Qatar’s gas is exported though the strait in LNG tankers. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have alternative export routes avoiding the strait, but are still heavily dependent on the waterway for most of their crude exports. Iran also ships 90 percent of its exports to China through the strait. In total, with supply added in from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, 45 percent of Chinese oil imports come through the strait.\nTo a degree, concerns about a possible closure are being fanned by a number of groups. Journalists unfamiliar with the region are accepting briefings without skepticism from government and intelligence officials, who may have agendas but not much detailed knowledge of the situation. Hardliners, both in Iran and amongst opponents, are seeking to intensify the conflict to serve their own interests. Normal military contingency planning and associated deployments - such as the deployment of British and US naval forces from Bahrain - are being misinterpreted as expressions of intent, rather than precautionary moves against an unlikely eventuality.\nHotheads and hardliners within Iran’s government may get their way and impose an irrational closure. But considering all the factors, the Iranians are unlikely to initiate such a move. Iran would suffer because of its loss of revenue-earning capacity. Iran would permanently lose its export markets, with China switching to more dependable, alternative suppliers, particularly at a time when there is crude over-supply. China, the last Security Council member with an inclination to support Iran but never a huge admirer, would likely abandon Iran politically. The battle to keep the strait open which would ensue would see Iran’s entire petrochemical infrastructure destroyed. This would please the Russians very much, because it would force oil prices higher, needed to fund their war in Ukraine.\nCloser to home, Qatar has shared commercial links with Iran over jointly-owned gas fields. Oman has always maintained cordial links with Iran. Any attempt on Iran’s part to enforce a closure - for example by laying sea mines - would upset what are essentially neutral relationships, particularly if territorial waters were infringed. For Oman in particular, any Iranian attempt to interdict shipping on the Omani side of the Straits would be catastrophic for a carefully-nurtured relationship which is of greater value to Iran than Oman - any trust would be destroyed should there be armed clashes or drone strikes across meridian lines.\nIt is difficult to identify an advantage for any GCC state in a closure of the strait - only huge problems and potentially enormous risk to infrastructure, protection against which would force GCC countries into adversarial positions with Iran. Israel and America would want to nurture the economic strength of these countries in the post-war period through strengthened economic partnerships.\nSo far, oil markets expect Iran to act in its own best interests and leave the strait open, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi told Reuters on Wednesday. After jumping about $10 after the first Israeli strikes last week, benchmark Brent crude prices have barely budged, suggesting that energy traders aren't overly concerned.\nBut even without a formal and declared operation to close the strait, a de facto reluctance to use the waterway may already be creeping into place. A quick glance around Iran’s oil exporting terminals on June 18 suggests that oil loading has completely ceased (following a reportedexport surgeearlier this week). Nor is there any lifting taking place at the Iranian oil export terminal off Jask; indeed the single point mooring buoy offshore appears to have disappeared. Other states are taking precautions: Qatar hasinstructedarriving LNG carriers to wait for their port arrival slot by idling in the Gulf of Oman, minimizing their time at anchorage in the Arabian Gulf.\nAs insurance premiums creep up, so shippers will also look for ways to avoid the strait altogether. One such route opening up is a new road and border-crossing point between Saudi Arabia and Oman at Ramlet Khelah. A product of much improved Saudi-Omani relations in recent years, there are now good roads from Saudi Arabia (sandstorms permitting) both to Sohar and the container terminal at Salalah - which is well away from the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman danger area. With TIR agreements in place to cover the border crossing, trucked container traffic is already increasing markedly on the route."

        "content": "\nAustralia’s Pilbara Ports Authority has launched a clean fuel bunkering roadmap that is intended to position the region as a global leader in maritime decarbonization. The roadmap explores the creation of Australia’s first ammonia fuel bunkering hub in the Pilbara, a key region for iron ore mining.\nThis comes almost a year after a consortium led by the Global Center for Maritime Decarbonization (GCMD) carried out two pilot ship-to-ship ammonia transfers at anchorages within Port of Dampier in Pilbara. The trial project was aimed at simulating ammonia bunkering operations in a port scenario. The trial included assessing factors such as the technical, logistical, safety and regulatory requirements associated with ammonia transfer within an operating port’s anchorage.\nWith the success of the pilot project, Pilbara Ports hopes that establishing a clean fuel bunkering hub would greatly cut its carbon footprint. Some studies estimate that lower carbon ammonia fuels could cut regional shipping emissions by up to 94 percent.\nThe Pilbara region in Western Australia hosts the country’s largest iron ore mines. Based on this, Pilbara Ports Authority operates some of the world’s largest bulk export ports, including Dampier and Port Hedland.\nPilbara is uniquely placed to become a global ammonia bunkering hub, with ports in the region serving on of the world’s busiest iron ore export corridors. In 2023-24, Pilbara Ports facilitated over 7,700 vessel visits, primarily on the Pilbara-China iron ore route.\n“The launch of Pilbara Ports’ Clean Fuel Bunkering Hub Strategy is a pivotal step forward for Western Australia’s clean energy future. By enabling clean fuel bunkering in Pilbara, we are helping global shipping reduce emissions while we unlock new economic opportunities for the state,” said Stephen Dawson, Western Australia Ports Minister.\nTo finalize critical workstreams of the project, Pilbara Ports has said that is working with industry partners, with another trial scheduled at the Port of Hedland in 2026. Yara Clean Ammonia, a subsidiary of the Norwegian fertilizer manufacturer Yara, is one of the partners. The company has pledged to utilize its assets in the Pilbara, primarily the Yara Pilbara Fertilizers plant to supply ammonia fuel. To ramp up ammonia production, Yara Pilbara Fertilizers is also a partner in the Yuri Renewable Hydrogen to Ammonia Project, scheduled to start next year in Karratha, Western Australia.\nThe ammonia fuel value chain in the shipping industry is steadily maturing, with the first two-stroke dual-fueled ammonia engine expected to be operational early next year. In addition, the Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping (MMMCZCS) this week unveiled a design for a 3,500 TEU container feeder to be powered by ammonia. The vessel features advanced safety features, such ammonia leak detection systems and a “safe refuge” crew area.\nAustralian mining giant Fortescue has also reached anagreementwith CMB.TECH to charter an ammonia dual-fuel Newcastlemax, scheduled for delivery by the end of next year. Fortescue wants to decarbonize all of its Scope 3 emissions - including its shipping emissions - by 2040."

In 1996, he took over management of Louis Dreyfus Armateurs, expanding it into the subsea cable-lay market through the acquisition of TravOcean. 11 years later, he and his children bought out the remaining ownership stake of the shipping company, separating it from the rest of the family-held Louis Dreyfus Group.\nLouis-Dreyfus also found time to take on major roles in industry associations. As president of Armateurs de France in 2002-4, Louis-Dreyfus played a role in modernizing the French flag administration and establishing the French International Register, as well as the rollout of France's tonnage tax system. He then took the helm at ECSA in 2006-9, then became president of BIMCO in 2015-17. He continued to represent Armateurs de France on the BIMCO board.\nOn the issues, Louis-Dreyfus was an advocate of efficiency and CO2 reduction, and he was an early proponent of slow-steaming. \"It is a solution that is immediately effective, at no cost, simple to understand and to apply. I continue to fight on the matter,\" he told an interviewer with ECSA earlier this year.\nLouis-Dreyfus also held two high national honors rarely seen in combination - the UK's Officer of the British Empire (OBE) and France's Commandeur of the Legion d'Honneur.\n\"Philippe Louis-Dreyfus had a profound impact on our sector. His commitment, his strategic vision, and his commitment to the common good have significantly contributed to the international influence of the French merchant navy,\" said Laurent Martens, delegate general of Armateurs de France.\nTop image courtesyThierry Nectoux / CC BY SA 4.0"

        "content": "\nNew Zealand’s inter-island ro/ro ferry operator KiwiRail is facing charges following accusations of endangering the safety of passengers after one of its ferries grounded in June last year.\nMaritime NZ said it has filed two charges against KiwiRail after completing investigations on the grounding of ro/ro ferryAraterenorth of Picton on June 21, 2024. At the time of the incident, the ferry had 47 people on board. Luckily, all the passengers and crew were safely returned to shore with the ferry being refloated the following evening using two harbor tugs.\nFollowing the completion of what it is describing as “comprehensive and wide-ranging” investigations, Maritime NZ highlights that it has filed charges against KiwiRail under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. The charges relate to alleged failures by the operator to keep crew and passengers safe while onboard the ferry.\nThough Maritime NZ said it cannot talk about what its investigation found, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) released its interim factual report on the incident in October last year. The report indicated that the 25-year-oldArateregrounded because the crew did not know how to turn off the vessel’s autopilot when they realized she was heading towards the shore.\nThe incident occurred just weeks afterAraterehad received a new steering control system to work with the ship’s autopilot and integrated bridge navigation system. On the day of the incident, a master who was re-familiarizing himself with the ferry after commanding other vessels was controlling the engines and piloting.\n“This was a complex incident and an important investigation given it focused on KiwiRail bringing in new systems to older vessels and broader safety management. It required us to look at systems, policies and procedures, culture, within KiwiRail in relation to the incident,” said Kirstie Hewlett, Maritime NZ Chief Executive.\nThe lawsuit is the latest facing KiwiRail. In September last year, the operator was ordered to pay US$266,000 in fines and costs in relation to a January 2023 incident involving its ferryKaitaki.\nKiwiRail is facingAratere-related charges at a time when it is planning to take the vessel out of service. In May, the operator announced that the ferry will retire in August after a career spanning a quarter of a century. Having entered service in 1999,Araterehas been Interislander’s only rail-enabled ferry-making 24 crossings on the Cook Strait route per week. The 184-meter (604-foot) ferry has a capacity of 600 passengers, 30 trucks or 230 cars, and 28 rail cars.\nThe 17,816-tonne ferry has had a troubled career characterized by technical problems, engine failures, and the grounding in June last year. Due to her troubled history, some suggest that the ferry is jinxed, resulting in the nickname “El Lemon.”"

        "content": "\nThe defense and security contractor building the next-generation nuclear submarines for the Royal Navy has been ordered to improve its safety measures after a fire broke out at its Barrow-in-Furness shipyard in October last year.\nBAE Systems Marine, which is building the UK’s largest and most powerful fleet of attack submarines, has been served with an enforcement notice demanding improvements on its safety practices. The notice, served by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), gives BAE Systems until September 12 to put in place measures that “ensure the protection of workers in the event of a fire.\"\nThe notice follows a fire that broke at the company’s Barrow-in-Furness site in Cumbria, where the Astute- and Dreadnought-class boats are being built. ONR found that five employees entered an area in the Devonshire Dock Hall facility when the fire was still raging in the early hours of October 30. As a result, two employees were taken to hospital for treatment, though they were discharged and returned to work on the same day.\nInquiries concluded that BAE Systems' arrangements for ensuring workers did not enter places of danger without the appropriate safety instructions were inadequate. In essence, the company lacked guidance to inform staff on the required actions in the event of a fire.\nThe UK nuclear industry regulator has gone ahead to serve BAE Systems with an enforcement notice under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. “We will continue to engage with BAE Systems Marine during the period of the enforcement notice to ensure positive progress is made to address this shortfall,” said Bruce Archer, ONR’s Head of Propulsion Sites Regulation, Operating Facilities Directorate.\nBAE Systems is tasked with building the next generation submarines for the Royal Navy and has since handed over five of the Astute class boats. A further two boats namedAgamemnonandAgincourtare currently under construction. The company is also building the Dreadnought class submarines that will replace the Vanguard class when they enter service in the early 2030s. Work on the first two boats is underway in Barrow.\nCovering about six acres, the Devonshire Dock Hall facility is the second-largest indoor shipbuilding complex of its kind in Europe and is critical in the delivery of the boats. The facility was opened about four decades ago.\nBAE Systems reckons it has invested more than £1 billion ($1.3 billion) in advanced technology and upgraded infrastructure at the shipyard to enable it to deliver Dreadnought. The company also intends to invest a further £450 million ($605.6 million) over the life of the program. Approximately 10,000 people work on the Dreadnought and Astute submarine program at the Barrow site."

        "publication_date": "",
        "author": "Mikael Lind et al.",
        "content": "\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration faces a new round of budget cuts that would undermine the agency's ability to provide services that millions of Americans need, including hurricane research and weather forecasting, according to a group of former top officials.\nThe White House's proposed FY2026 budget calls for cuts totaling $1.3 billion across all NOAA programs, with particularly steep reductions targeting the National Marine Fisheries Service and NOAA's research division. The proposed cuts follow the loss of hundreds of experienced scientists and forecasters during the DOGE-led rounds of federal workforce reductions earlier this year. Across all of NOAA, departing employees took with them a combined 27,000 years of institutional knowledge, according to Craig McLean, former director of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.\nNOAA has been forced to hire more than 100 personnel to re-fill critical roles at the National Weather Service, which is so short-staffed that it has had to scale back weather-balloon launches and reduce hours at several stations.\n\"The Weather Service mentality is to produce the forecast and warnings at all costs,\" said John Sokic, former director of National Weather Service Congressional Affairs, during a recent briefing with former NOAA officials. \"But as the staff continues to work crazy hours over time, 12-hour shifts, they're going to burn out. There will be an impact. There will be missed warnings.\"\nThe budget constraints would force difficult choices across NOAA's operations. The agency's radar network, designed in the 1980s and installed in the 1990s, is expected to function only through 2035 without significant upgrades. Weather Service facilities, many more than 30 years old and operating around the clock, are deteriorating. The National Data Buoy program has operated under flat funding for 12 years, forcing officials to shift from preventive maintenance to reactive repairs.\nThe National Marine Fisheries Service faces particularly severe cuts. Steve Mirowski, former chief scientist at the National Marine Fisheries Service, warned that the reductions threaten a management system that has been highly successful. Under current programs, U.S. fisheries generate $321 billion in annual sales and support 2.3 million jobs. Since 2000, 50 depleted fisheries have been rebuilt, including some of the nation's most lucrative.\n\"The bottom line is that the cuts to NMFS personnel and budget have already significantly degraded the capacity of the agency to fill its statutory obligations,\" said Mirowski. \"Additional cuts as proposed in FY2026 will threaten a system that is not broken and is currently producing significant economic benefits for the country.\"\nResearch Programs Face Elimination\nThe proposed budget would effectively eliminate NOAA's research enterprise, including the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which has been instrumental in improving hurricane forecasting. Over the past two decades, three-day hurricane track forecasts have improved from 200-mile to 60-mile accuracy - a development that has dramatically reduced evacuation areas and has likely saved lives.\nMcLean gave an example from the well-known Hurricane Hunter program, which dispatches P-3 Orion research aircraft into the upper layers of hurricanes to take real-time readings.\n\"The Oceans and Atmospheric Research people [are] in the back of that airplane while the NOAA Corps pilots are flying in the front of the airplane. The work is conducted by researchers, and the improvement in the hurricane track and intensity forecasts - which is up about 15 to 20% - transition to the Weather Service, a perfect example of how we make Americans safer every day,\" McLean said. \"When you close the cooperative institutes and you close the research labs, you lose the people who are in the back of the airplane doing the research and the analysis . . .  So once again, we're cutting off limbs and wondering later how we're going to run the race.\"\nThe proposed cuts could have far-reaching economic consequences beyond weather services, and well beyond shipping. Major financial institutions, including JPMorgan and Cantor Fitzgerald, rely on NOAA climate data for investment decisions, McLean said. The reinsurance industry, banking sector, and mortgage markets also depend on NOAA data for risk assessment.\nCongressional Response Expected\nThe budget cuts will likely encounter opposition in Congress, where both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have historically supported NOAA programs. The former officials said that public pressure could be crucial in preventing the cuts from passing, and called for companies and individuals who rely on NOAA to contact their representatives.\n\"I believe that if members of Congress recognize the harm that will be done in their district or their state as a result of these cuts to NOAA, that will be a factor that they have to take into account,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), who joined the former officials to advocate for funding. \"I think that these proposed cuts will be rejected in large part.\""

In a new filing, plaintiffs in the civil suit againstDali'sowner and operator allege that one key piece of deck equipment may also have had known issues before the ship hit and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge.\nAccording to the attorneys, the hydraulic brake control onDali'sport anchor windlass was inoperable, and had not worked for two weeks prior to the casualty voyage. This may not have been an immediate concern under normal circumstances, since the brake could still be operated by hand.\nHowever, the lawyers allege that the manual brake control needed two people to operate. Only one crewmember was posted on the bow of theDaliduring the outbound transit, and when called upon to deploy the port anchor, \"he was unable to do so,\" the attorneys claimed.\nThe anchor windlass figured prominently in the final minutes of the voyage in the early hours of March 26, 2024. AfterDalilost power and drifted towards a bridge pylon, the master gave an urgent order to deploy the port anchor \"fast fast\" at 0127:14 - but the sound of the anchor chain was not picked up on the VDR bridge audio recording until 0129:00. TheDalihit the bridge 37 seconds after the sound of the chain beginning to run. Quicker deployment of the port anchor would have exerted steering forces to port for a longer period of time, in addition to any effects in reducing the ship's forward momentum.\nIn addition, the attorneys noted thatDalihad two auxiliary generators up and running before the back-to-back power losses that led up to the allision. If the ship had been running three generators during the transit, \"the second blackout would never have occurred,\" the attorneys argued, citing testimony fromDali'schief engineer.\nThe owner of theDali, Grace Ocean, has filed a federal suit to limit its liability to the value of the ship post-salvage, which it estimates at $44 million. Dozens of claimants - families of the deceased, local government bodies, the federal government, cargo interests and others - oppose the motion and seek to recover far greater amounts of compensation. The cost of bridge replacement alone is expected to come to several billion dollars."

The authority is calling it a new phase in its efforts to restore mega containership traffic through the canal.\nThe vessel which is 156,000 dwt and 366 meters (1,200 feet) in length was reported to be the largest to transit the Suez Canal since March 2024. It is traveling from Singapore bound for Europe and followed two smaller CMA CGM containership which made the transit the day before. TheCMA CGM AquilaandCMA CGM Callisto(each 11,400 TEU) made the transit on Tuesday bound for Jeddah.\nCMA CGM has quietly maintained a limited number of transits in the Suez Canal for some of its Middle Eastern routes. It has been spotted transiting the Red Sea with escorts from the EU’s Aspidies operation, although the company said it was challenging and required coordination with the navies.\nAdmiral Ossama Rabiee, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority said that CMA CGM currently “tops the list” for the number of vessels and tonnage transiting the Canal during the first half of 2025.\n\n\nCMA CGM plans to increase its transits of the Suez Canal (SCA)\n\nThe authority is working to bring back more traffic to the Suez Canal. In May, it launched a 15 percent discount on fees for containerships over 130,000 net tons transiting either laden or in ballast. The promotion is scheduled to last 90 days and follows a marketing meeting with the major shipping companies and their representatives held in May.\nThe move comes as most major shipping carriers remain skeptical of a quick return to the Suez Canal. The sentiment this week during the presentations at Marine Money Week in New York is that the risk is high. Several shipowners said insurance premiums remain higher for the Red Sea versus transits of the Straits of Hormuz even with this week’s escalation between Israel and Iran.\nSecurity consultants Ambrey also reiterated this week the increased danger for shipping in the Red Sea. It notes that the Houthis have continued to threaten attacks on any ship associated with Israel and also stepped up in May calling for a blockade of the Port of Haifa. While there have not been any recent attacks targeting merchant ships, the Houthis previously targeted ships with questionable associations with Israel.\nThe Suez Canal, however, is a critical source of income for Egypt. In March, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi estimated the monthly loss in revenue at around $800 million due to the 60 percent decline in traffic through the canal. For all of 2024, Egypt reported the disruption in Suez Canal transits represented a decline of $7 billion in revenue."

As the G7 leaders and other countries' representatives met in Canada this week, Australia launched its first sanctions on shadow tankers while the UK again expanded its efforts.\nAustralia joined with the other countries in calling for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine and a withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. The country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs highlights that Australia has imposed over 1,400 sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and now it is also targeting tankers.\nA total of 60 tankers were listed with the ministry highlighting that under Australian law the vessels are not required to be owned, registered, or flagged in Russia. Also, under its sanction regime, a vessel cannot escape the sanctions with a name or flag change. Australia can direct a sanctioned vessel to leave its ports and not to enter a particular port.\n“These sanctions reinforce Australia’s consistent commitment to ensuring Russia, and those enabling its illegal invasion of Ukraine, face consequences,” said Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\nWhile speaking at the G& Summit, Sir Kier Starmer, the UK’s Prime Minister, also announced his country’s latest package of sanctions. He said the new round includes 30 entities across Russia’s financial, military, and energy sectors.\n“We know that our sanctions are hitting hard, so while Putin shows total disregard for peace, we will not hesitate to keep tightening the screws,” said Starmer. “His repeated refusals to engage seriously in peace has redoubled the UK’s resolve to apply a stranglehold on the Russian economy.”\nThe UK listed 20 additional tankers. This followed what it called its largest package launched in May which targeted up to 100 tankers. The UK had also previously listed 133 tankers, while the EU has now listed over 300 tankers.\nBeyond tankers, the UK also listed two firms involved in crewing and managing the shadow fleet. It said that Orion Star Group and Valegro were helping to enable Russia’s oil trade with their efforts supporting the shadow fleet.\nDuring the talks at the G7, the EU and UK were both advocating for a lowering of the price cap imposed on Russian oil exports. The $60 per barrel was challenged in the spring when oil prices receded but now with tensions in the Middle East oil has jumped to over $75 a barrel. Oil markets remain very nervous waiting for a possible U.S. action against Iran."

The vessel which is laden with Russian oil is being tracked as it makes its outbound transit but so far Denmark has taken no action against the vessel.\nThe tanker which appears to be identifying with the nameMarathon, or previouslyUdaya, (IMO 9288746) was first identified as a suspect vessel on its inbound transit to the Baltic on June 10. According to the outlet Danwatch, the Danish patrol shipFrejaapproached the vessel, but there was no apparent attempt to intercept or stop the tanker. The Danish patrol boat was sailing alongside but changed course away from the tanker.\nThe Danish Maritime Authority told Danwatch, “During radio contact with the Defense Command, theUdaya/Marathonreported that it was flying the Comoros flag. However, during subsequent checks with the Comoros authorities, we received confirmation that the vessel was not registered in the Comoros registry.”\nThe vessel’s AIS signal shows it departed Primorsk, Russia on June 16 with a declared destination of the Suez Canal. Tracking data from today, June 19, shows it is transiting the Danish straits at a speed of 12 knots. The AIS signal warns its navigational status is constrained by draft. The reports suggest the vessel is carrying 100,000 tons of Russian oil likely bound for India.\nDenmark, like the other nations of the region, remains on high alert monitoring shadow fleet tankers. Estonia and Germany have challenged some of the tankers based on suspicious activity or likely false flag operations while Denmark has said it also would consider intervention. Speaking on Danish TV 2 Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen at the end of May called fortightening controlson the shadow tankers. He said legally it was difficult but that “I do not rule out the possibility that we may have to intervene to a greater extent. If you cannot show the correct insurance papers and do not have a flag state, then it is legitimate to intervene,” said Rasmussen. In February 2025, Denmark reported it would be increasing itsinspection programtargeting tankers.\nThis tanker is an example of the worst of the shadow fleet. In addition to the accusation that it is sailing without a flag state, the vessel has reported at least three other flags (Djibouti, Gabon, and St. Kitts and Nevis) in the past three years since 2022. The ship was sanctioned by the UK at the end of 2024, and the EU, Canada, and Switzerland in early 2025.\nThe tanker has been tied to repeated calls in Russia, India, Lebanon, Egypt, and other ports.  Equasis lists the flag as unknown and since March 2024 ownership associated with a company in Mauritius. Management is listed in India.\nThe tanker according to Equasis had not undergone a Port State inspection between July 2022 and April 2025. Its most recent inspection was in Russia, where the authorities cited it for a lack of fire patrols and issues with its inflatable liferafts. The ship was not given a detention.\nDanwatch reports this is at least the second vessel Denmark recently identified as being stateless sailing through its waters. The Danish Maritime Authority did not respond to media inquiries regarding the outbound passage of the tanker.\nTop photo byL-BBEin 2013 --CC BY 3.0 DEED"

        "content": "The UK marked a milestone early in June in its efforts to develop a program for dismantling and recycling its fleet of decommissioned nuclear submarines. The first large section was cut from the former HMSSwiftsureas the final stage of the first dismantling project for a British nuclear sub moves forward.\nThe first major cut on HMSSwiftsurewas the removal of the sub’s fin (sail or tower section) of the nearly 5,000-tonne submarine. The large structure was removed from the hull and lowered to the dry dock. Cutters have been working on the submarine since late 2024 after she entered a dry dock in Rosyth, Scotland at the Babcock facility. While they have begun removing smaller elements within the hull, this was the first exterior cut into the vessel.\nThe project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2026, and they estimate as much as 90 percent ofSwiftsure’s total weight will be recycled. Some of the high-quality steel will be repurposed into components for future Royal Navy submarines.\n\n\nSwiftsure is being dismantled in a dry dock in Scotland (Royal Navy)\n\nThe UK has been working to develop a process for the recycling of the submarines for nearly a decade with critics pointing out they are dramatically behind schedule. The country currently has a total of 23 decommissioned nuclear submarines stored between Rosyth and Devonport in England and many still have their nuclear fuel on board. They require regular maintenance and surveys.\nCritics point out the UK moved to rapidly decommission nuclear submarines at the end of the Cold War with no plan for how to address the ships. One proposal called for scuttling the vessels in deep water. By comparison, the United States has a well-developed process undertaken at the yard in Bremerton, Washington which completes the recycling of a Los Angeles class attack submarine in less than two years.\nThe UK established the Submarine Delivery Agency in 2013 with the objective of developing a dismantling and disposal solution for 27 decommissioned nuclear submarines.  The plan calls for a multi-stage approach starting with the removal of radioactive parts that contain low-level radioactive waste. The second stage is the removal of the Reactor Pressure Vessel and that is followed by the clearing of all radioactive materials.\n\n\nSwiftsure was operational from 1972 to 1991 (Royal Navy)\n\nSwiftsurewas ordered in 1967 and built by Vickers-Armstrongs Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. She was 83 meters (272 feet) in length and commissioned as the first of her class in April 1972. She was active for 19 years but retired after they reportedly found cracks in the structure as she was prepared for her second life-extension overhaul.

        "content": "\nDrifts of miniscule plastic nurdles are washing ashore in Kovalam, Kerala after the sinking of the container shipMSC Elsa 3, which took on a list and sank off the coast on May 25. As the environmental damage from the casualty racks up, the High Court in Kerala has ordered the detention of another MSC ship to ensure that the market-leading container line can pay compensation.\nAn Indian exporter, Sans Cashew India Private Ltd., has filed suit seeking $85,000 for the loss of a container of cashew nuts that was aboardMSC Elsa 3. The plaintiff alleged unseaworthiness, and filed for the arrest of a second MSC vessel - the MSC Polo 2 - to ensure repayment.\nMSC's counsel countered thatMSC Polo 2was outside of India's 12-nautical-mile territorial sea, beyond the jurisdiction of local authorities, according to local media. However, the court sided with the plaintiff and issued a conditional arrest order to be carried out at Adani Vizhinjam Port (unless MSC posts a bond for the amount of the claim). The Hindu reports that MSC deposited a demand draft for the amount of the bond later in the day.\nThe state of Kerala is also in talks with MSC over compensation, and negotiations are ongoing. The state has signaled that it plans to file an admiralty suit against MSC, but has not yet done so and has formed a negotiating committee to talk with MSC over terms, according to Indian media.\nIn a rare development, the High Court of Kerala's chief justice and a second court judge issued a warning from the bench, cautioning the state government that these behind-closed-doors, out-of-court negotiations were irregular. Typically such talks between parties would take place within the context of an admiralty suit or arbitral process. \"Various questions arise for consideration—whether such a negotiation will result in a binding agreement, whether it can ensure transparency, and whether the court's jurisdiction would be impacted,\" the judges wrote. \"It would be appropriate that the avenue of negotiation is deferred at present.\"\nIndia's government is concerned about the recent uptick in casualties off the coast - not justMSC Elsa 3,but also the ongoing fire aboardWan Hai 503and two smaller, previously unreported shipboard fires. In recent weeks, cargo fires related to misdeclared containerized freight have broken out aboard theInterasia Tenacityand theWan Hai 613, Indian representatives told IMO's Marine Safety Committee this week."

        "content": "\nThe U.S. Navy has beaten its struggle to hit enlistment quotas and has achieved its recruiting goals for FY2025, three months ahead of schedule. More than 40,000 people have signed up so far this fiscal year, with more to come.\n\"This milestone reflects more than numbers - it affects the drive of our recruiters, the innovation of our team, and the courage of thousands of Americans who stepped forward to serve,\" said Secretary of the Navy John Phelan in a video address. \"The challenges ahead are only growing. We're in a new era of warfare, where the battlefield extends from seabed to space. To succeed we must innovate, adapt and move boldly.\"\nIt is the second year in a row that the service has met its recruiting target, thanks to several factors. First, the Navy loosened its recruitment qualifications as far as the law allows - raising the maximum recruit age to 41, removing educational requirements, and lowering its minimum allowable Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score to the 10th percentile, lower than 90 percent of all test-takers' results. Then it added preparatory courses to help any candidates who had the potential to qualify, but had difficulty with physical-fitness requirements or testing standards. Internally, the service also worked on expediting the process for granting medical waivers, a critical change because the Pentagon recently incorporated candidates' electronic medical records into the screening process - and is now discovering disqualifying medical conditions that used to be overlooked.\nIn addition to these reforms, Secretary Phelan also attributed the recruiting boom in part to President Donald Trump's election - a \"Trump bump,\" which the president has claimed credit for creating. Other service branches are also seeing good numbers: the Army met its ambitious FY2025 goal four months ahead of schedule, and the Air Force has reported exceptionally strong monthly recruitment.\nNow that the Navy's annual goal has been met, recruiters have more time to focus on \"fit,\" not just \"fill,\" lining up applicants with the right talents to meet specific needs out in the fleet. “We’re still working hard every day,” said Rear Adm. Jim Waters, commander of Navy Recruiting Command. “Meeting the recruiting target is not the finish line — it’s a signal that we’re on the right course and ready to keep building the force of the future.”"

Environmental activists from the Middle East and North Africa section of Greenpeace are calling for action to increase the monitoring in the region based on the increased tensions and dangers of an environmental disaster.\n“Satellite imagery indicates a large plume of oil stretching up to around 1500 hectares (3,700 acres) from the site of the crash between two vessels,AdalynnandFront Eagle, in the Gulf of Oman, approximately 22 nautical miles east of Khor Fakkan, near the Strait of Hormuz,” reports Greenpeace. It is using satellite images from Planet Labs PBC.\nFurther, the group cites data from Veson Nautical and Lloyd’s List Intelligence to assert thatAdalynnwas carrying approximately 70,000 tons of crude oil “despite being officially listed in ballast condition.” This is based on an analysis that reportedly shows the tanker currently with a 9.3-meter (30.5-foot) draft.\n“Greenpeace MENA urges all concerned authorities to act swiftly to contain the spill and assess its ecological impact,” the group said in a statement from Farah Al Hattab, Campaigner at Greenpeace Middle East and North Africa. “We call on shipping companies, governments, and oil industry actors to commit to full transparency regarding environmental consequences of oil spills and the measures being taken for cleanup. Additionally, we urge governments in the region to increase investment in maritime monitoring, early-warning systems, and contingency plans to effectively respond to future oil pollution incidents. Environmental security must be treated as national and regional security.”\nThe statement contradicts information from the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure in Abu Dhabi which said the incident, “resulted in minor surface damage to the outer hulls of both ships, a small oil spill, and a fire.” The ministry is saying that it continues monitoring and assessment of the situation to ensure navigational safety.\nThe Russian news outless TASS is quoting an official from the consulate general in Dubai saying the crew of Adalynn is now in a hotel in Fujairah. It says the crew includes seven Russian citizens, including the vessel’s captain.\nThecollisionhappened at approximately 0130 local time Tuesday, June 17. The Ministry is saying that preliminary information indicates the incident was caused by a “navigational misjudgment” by one of the vessels.\nLars Barstad, CEO of Frontline operator ofFront Eagle, made a similar assertion on Wednesday speaking at Marine Money Week in New York describing the encounter with a \"dark fleet\" tanker. He said the company had “no information” regarding the media reports of GPS jamming. He also asserted that “ships have redundancy for navigation” meaning the officers on the bridge would have better information than the AIS signal data relayed by sites on the Internet.\nThe maritime AI data analytics firm Windward issued a report saying “Front Eagleexperienced sustained electronic navigation interference. Persistent GPS and AIS jamming that preceded the tanker’s collision signals a new and growing maritime security threat in the region.”\nWindward acknowledges the statements pointing to no relationship between the collision and the current tension in the region. It however also asserts that GPS jamming in the Arabian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz has impacted as many as 970 ships a day over the past four days.\nThe authorities in Abu Dhabi are saying that the fire has been extinguished aboard theAdalynn. Barstad told the audience in New York that despite dealing with a dark fleet tanker the incident had “went well” and they avoided a far worse disaster."

        "content": "\nA known Iranian arms smuggling container ship has been spotted in the Red Sea on its way home after spending three weeks loitering outside the Port of Tobruk, Libya.\nThe MVElyana(IMO: 9165827) is linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line (IRISL) which as an entity is subject to secondary sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Additionally, the MVElyanahas been specifically sanctioned by name.\nThe ship has an established history of use by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for shipping arms. In June 2024, theElyanaunloaded cargo in Latakia, in Syria, which had been taken on in Bandar Abbas. Hitherto, when President Assad was in power, the IRGC used Latakia as a hub for their arms imports, IRGC cargos destined for Hezbollah and the Syrian regime were shipped into the port of Latakia, or flown in by Boeing 747 cargo aircraft flights using Latakia International Airport.\nOn its latest journey, theElyanaset off from Bandar Abbas on April 18, making a port call in Jebel Ali - notwithstanding the ship’s sanctioned status - from whence she departed on April 21.\nIt is not known what cargo, if any, theElyanatook on at Jebel Ali. But the ship then took a leisurely 13 days to reach the southern end of the Suez Canal without making any declared port call. As it is equipped with deck davit cranes, theElyanawould be capable of off-loading cargo at unsophisticated ports en route, potentially being able to do so in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, or in Sudan. A transit from Jebel Ali to the Suez Canal normally takes six days.\nAfter transiting the Suez Canal, theElyanamade for Tobruk, where she anchored for three weeks. The port of Tobruk is managed by the forces of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls Eastern Libya and Libya’s oilfields. The UN-recognized and Islamist-inclined national government controls Western Libya and the capital Tripoli.\nHaftar is supported by the UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the rebel RSF faction in Sudan, not normally regarded as Iranian allies. But Haftar is also supported by Russia, which - until last week - was considered a close Iranian ally.\nThe main backers of the recognized government in Tripoli are Turkey and Qatar. France and the United States are ambivalently neutral, Italy resolutely so. Who therefore is sponsoring theElyana’scargo, or working to enable its delivery, is thus a complete mystery.\nThe MVElyanaleft the anchorage off Tobruk on May 30, possibly having come into the port briefly on the day of its departure. By June 5 the MVElyanawas stationary in the Suez South Anchorage after a southerly transit of the Suez Canal. On June 15, MVElyanawas heading down the Red Sea adjacent to territory controlled by the Houthis, and is expected to arrrive in Jebel Ali on June 22. It remains to be seen if it cuts short its journey or stops off en route, and whether it will head home for Bandar Abbas or perhaps wait awhile in the Northern Arabian Sea."

        "content": "\nA Belgium recycling firm confirmed that it was the sole bidder at the June 17 auction for the famed linerStockholmwhich spent its final years operating as the cruise shipAstoria(15,000 gross tons). The ship which earned a place in history for its 1956 collision with the Italian passenger linerAndrea Doria, is expected to leave its final port, Rotterdam, as early as next month.\nAn auction was held in the Netherlands on June 17 and Galloo was the sole bidder. Reports are the company offered the minimum opening bid of €200,000 ($230,000) and it was accepted. The company however must also settle outstanding port fees before it will be able to remove the ship.\nThe Astoria was towed into Rotterdam in December 2020 months after the ship was laid up during the COVID-19 pandemic. It had been operating under charter to a UK firm, Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV), which filed for bankruptcy during the pandemic. The ship reverted to its Portuguese owners which by that time had also gone bankrupt with the ship controlled by the banks. It was sold to investors who called for restoring the famed ship.\nBuilt in 1948 as one of the first post-World War II passenger liners, her size was limited by the available shipyards. Introduced asStockholmof the Swedish American Line she was a workhorse passenger-cargo ship that filled an important gap till larger liners could be built in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it was the faithful night of July 25, 1956, that sealed her fame as she was outbound from New York to Sweden. Off Nantucket in patchy fog, she collided with the Italian luxury liner killing more than 50 people and causing theAndrea Doriato sink hours later.\nStockholmalthough badly damaged survived and in the 1960s became an East German holiday ship for the working classes. Retired in 1985, she was in nearly original condition and cheated the scrappers instead being sold for an extensive reconstruction in Italy. She was stripped to the steel and returned to service as a cruise ship in 1994 operating during the following years asItalia I,Italia Prima,Valtur Prima,Caribe,Athena,Azores, and finally in 2016Astoria. It wasrumored on several occasionsthat she was scheduled for retirement including in 2020.\nAcquired in 2021 by an investment group, the ship languished as they sought to develop a plan and then offered it for sale. Sale to scrappers had been rumored more than once. In 2024, two YouTubers snuck aboard the ship andvideoed her conditionwhich showed decay from a lack of maintenance as well as the historic bones of a now 76-year-old ship.\nGalloo reports it plans to move the ship as early as July to a recognized recycling yard in Ghent. It notes the ship which is 160 meters (525 feet) in length with accommodations for over 500 passengers will account for more than 12,000 tonnes of material, including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, wood, glass, and plastics. It expects 97 percent will be recycled into renewable raw materials.\nTop photo byNiels Johannes-CC BY-SA 4.0"

The Crown Estate which manages the offshore property is calling the contracts for projects among the largest of their kind and a step in developing the UK’s leadership for floating offshore wind power generation.\nThe first two projects are being awarded to Norway’s Equinor and a partnership called Gwynt Glas, a JV between EDF Renewables and Irish energy company ESB. Each received rights to an area of seabed which the Crown Estate estimates can support 1.5 GW. The plan for a third site for a further 1.5 GW is still being developed with the Crown Estate reporting it is working on a range of options and expects to set out the next steps by the end of September.\nEquinor and Gwynt Gas have to complete contracts and begin a multi-year process for gaining consent. It is expected the approval process could take three to five years with the projects becoming operational in the early 2030s.\nThe process for this round began in 2024. It is the first floating-specific leasing round in the UK.\nThe Round 5 process also asked bidders to set out their plans for working with ports to support the final assembly of their projects, with specialist infrastructure needed to mount the turbines on floating platforms before being towed out to the final project sites. As part of their submissions, the preferred bidders have identified Port Talbot and Bristol ports as the likely locations for this activity.\n“Floating offshore wind will be transformative for economic growth in Wales and the South West, unlocking thousands of jobs in places like Port Talbot and Bristol, bolstering our energy security and delivering industrial renewal,” said Energy Secretary Ed Miliband.  \"The Celtic Sea has huge untapped potential to support our mission to become a clean energy superpower, so we can get energy bills down for good through our Plan for Change.”\nThe Crown Estate views this as the first phase of a new industry in the Celtic Sea. It reports it has identified the potential for a further 4 to 10 GW of power to be developed in the region. It projects this could be brought to market by the end of the decade.\nThe government of Sir Kier Starmer is supporting the development of offshore wind power. The UK remains the leader in Europe and second only to China in total installed capacity. The government has outlined a plan calling for as much as 50 GW of offshore renewable energy by the end of the decade. The UK currently has approximately 16 GW installed.\nThe next major auction is planned for September. Analysts had said the UK must move aggressively with the next auction playing a critical component in the ability to meet the long-term goals.\n"

        "content": "\nThe fight between Samsung Heavy Industries and Russia’s Zvezda shipbuilding is continuing with the South Koreans now saying they have terminated the contracts and plan to seek compensation. The dispute has been developing as Western sanctions mounted against Russia including Zvezda and ends what had once been hailed as the largest contract in the history of Samsung Heavy Industries.\nIn stock exchange filings on June 18, Samsung Heavy Industries reports it notified Zvezda that it was terminating two contracts, one for blocks for 10 icebreaking LNG rankers and a second for blocks to assemble seven icebreaking shuttle tankers. The first of the contracts was awarded in November 2020 valued currently at $2 billion and a second in October 2021 valued at $1.5 billion. As part of the notices, SHI says it plans to retain $800 million in advance payments.\nThe problem is that Zvezda backed out of the contracts a year ago citing what it said were the failures of Samsung Heavy Industries. It demanded repayment, with interest, on the advance payments. SHI launched an ongoing Singapore International arbitration process but has now decided to take additional steps.\nThe problems began in February 202 as the United States and South Korea began imposing increased strict sanctions on Russia and its companies. One of the first limited the ability to pay for work but in April 2022 Samsung reported it had been able to complete the delivery of a new Aframax shuttle tanker to Russia’s state-run shipping company Sovcomflot. Samsung had total contracts calling for the blocks for 22 vessels with a combined value of approximately $5.7 billion.\nFive vessels under the 2019 contract were delivered, but the 2020 and 2021 agreements were hampered by the increasing sanctions. Samsung was designing the vessels when the first sanctions were imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. Competitor Daewoo Shipbuilding canceled three contracts with the Russians in 2022 citing failure to make installment payments while initially, Samsung Heavy Industries sought to continue its projects.\nSamsung Heavy Industries reported in 2022 that it invoked Force Majeure, suspending the design work for 10 LNG carriers and seven shuttle tankers. It said the companies were discussing future implementation plans for the contract. However, when Zvezda was designated by the U.S. in February 2024, Samsung said it was blocked from working with Zvezda. Both companies are claiming a breach of the contracts.\nThe vessels were part of Russia’s ambitious plans to expand its oil and gas sector in the Arctic. With the sanctions, Russia has said it would shift the production work domestically with a plan to invest more than $6 billion to build more than 1,600 commercial ships over the next decade. The yards however have struggled to even complete the assembly process using the blocks from South Korea for these highly technical vessels."

A criminal investigation into the cause of the casualty is under way, and as part of that process, the vessel is being raised from the bottom at a cost of about $27 million.\nTo bringBayesianback up, salvors are using a crane barge, dive teams and ROVs. The team has passed slings underneath the vessel and plan to use this rigging to hoist the yacht to the surface as early as Saturday.\nThe operation was expected to take longer, but when salvors removed the yacht's gigantic mast with a diamond wire cutting tool, the wreck  - which was resting on its side - rotated partly upright on its own. This made it easier to pass messenger lines under the hull and run through steel lifting slings to prepare for hoisting.\nOnce the vessel has been hoisted out of the water, it will be delivered to nearby Termini Imerese and placed in a storage cradle. After it is drained, prosecutors and plaintiffs' attorneys will be able to inspect it. Among other details, the authorities will be looking at whether the vessel's hatches were closed before the sinking - which may have bearing on pending criminal cases against three crewmembers.\nThe operation has been challenging - and tragic. Diver Rob Huijben lost his life during an operation to remove the yacht's boom, and officials suspect that a hydrogen explosion from an underwater cutting torch may be to blame. The fatality forced a one-week stand down, delaying operations and prompting salvors to use ROVs instead of divers where possible."

Structural issues were identified during the inspection along with questions regarding the training and competence of the crew. The owner of the vessel, Murmansk Shipping Company, promised repairs but ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2020. Control of the vessel passed to a trustee who showed little interest in the ship.\n\n\n\nThis year the ship drewrenewed attentionwith speculation in the media even suggesting the Russians were using it to spy on NATO’s activity in the port.

It highlighted the growing danger confirming reports that the vessel had twice broken away from its moorings and began to drift in the port.\nThe government authorized the sale of the vessel and by May the Port Authority was reporting it was finally ready to depart. However, because the European Union has classified the vessel as waste, and because it is incapable of navigation, they require documentation before the ship can be towed from the port. Technical work had to be undertaken to prepare the ship including reports in the media that its tanks had not been properly vented in years creating a risk of an explosion.\n\nKhatanga usuni?ta.pic.twitter.com/e0LU63Qn96\n\nWith Poland in the midst of a contentious presidential election that is yet to be resolved, Marchewka used the departure of the ship as a political issue.

He created a video on the dock with the ship as a backdrop and posted it on X.\nPort officials announced that the ship had been sold to a qualified scrapyard in Denmark licensed for the required remediation and dismantling of the vessel.

It is the latest step in efforts by Ukraine to sell off seized vessels to raise hard currency to fund its war efforts.\nARMA is looking for someone to organize the sale of theUsko MFU(2,850 dwt). Built in 1982, the ship is registered in Cameroon, but during its years in service, it has also been registered in Equatorial Guinea, Sierra Leone, St Vincent and Grenadines, and Croatia. The ship is 308 feet (94 meters) in length. It has a spotty safety record frequently being cited for deficiencies during Port State Inspections.\n“The vessel, despite the technical need for further development, has significant investment potential. In particular, it concerns the presence of the main power unit, basic navigation infrastructure, and the possibility of further restoration or re-equipment. The asset is attractive both for future commercial use and for companies specializing in ship repair or recycling of marine transport,” writes ARMA in the sale notice.\nProposals are being accepted until July 4, and then it will select an auction organizer for the sale of the cargo ship. The selected organizer will be responsible for obtaining an independent valuation and then organizing the sale.\nThe ship wasdetainedon the Danube at Reni, Ukraine on July 2, 2024, on allegations it had turned off its AIS signal and was bound for Moldova. The Prosecutor General supplied more specifics saying according to its investigation in November 2023 the ship entered and left Sevastopol with more than 3,000 tons of agricultural products intended for a Turkish company. To hide its activity the vessel turned off its AIS transmissions. At the end of May 2024, they reported the ship returned to Sevastopol where it unloaded cargo from Turkey. The AIS signal was again turned off.\nThe Ukrainians searched the ship and confiscated records and electronics. When it was stopped there were 12 crewmembers aboard in including a captain from Azerbaijan. Reports said Ukraine was prosecuting the captain and another officer. The media is now saying the captain was released with a fine. The Turkish owner of the vessel denied the allegations saying the vessel had been to Crimea under a prior owner.\nThe courts ordered theship confiscatedin October 2024 for damages to the state and ARMA reports it has management of the ship under a court order. ARMA seeks to manage and sell the assets it receives to fund the government. Earlier this week it filed with the court to take control of nine smaller vessels, including three Russian VolgoBalt tankers. It asked the court to prevent the ships from going to sea as a first step toward taking management. At the end of last week, it was also successful in the court in stopping the removal of a Panama-flagged bulkerEmmakris III(70,000 dwt) that has been detained in Chornomorsk since the start of the war. In August 2024, ARMA advertised for amanager for the vesselsaying it would be used to store grain.\nARMA also continues its fight over the seized luxury yachtRoyal Romancewhich is linked to exiled businessman and Russian supporter Viktor Medvedchuk. Ukraine was successful in having theyacht seizedin 2022 while it was in Croatia. After a period of mandatory maintenance, ARMA says it will contact the Prosecutor General's Office in an effort to update the process of selling the seized yacht in accordance with current legislation."

Much of the Omani diplomatic effort directed at Iran is based on the need for these two countries to agree to the unfettered operation of the Traffic Separation Scheme - for the benefit of both parties and the international community.\nA review of ship movements in the strait on June 19, repeated today on June 20, shows that shipping is now avoiding Iranian territorial waters in the approaches, in the strait itself and then further into the Gulf, where standard routing previously was largely through Iranian waters.\nRoutes now being used fall within international waters in the Gulf of Oman approaches. Within the Straits, ships appear to be keeping further south and wholly in Omani waters, in the northern/inward channel - previous routing used to edge Iranian territorial waters. Once in the Gulf, all vessels are keeping close to the Ras Al Khaimah coast, within Emirati territorial waters, save those heading for Iranian ports. Crowding so much traffic into narrower sea lanes inevitably increases the risk of collisions.\n\n\nShips in the Straits of Hormuz identified by vesselfinder.com\nFor Oman, keeping traffic flowing through the Straits is a heavy responsibility, which will be stretching the Royal Navy of Oman to its limits.  Oman well understands the types of both declared and ‘unattributable’ attacks that shipping has suffered in the past. Ships can be attacked by drone, boarded from small boats, subject to both sea floor mines and limpet attacks - where there can be difficulties in attribution. Ships can also be subject to deadly direct attacks from naval gunfire, submarines, and anti-shipping cruise missiles - with which the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) and the IRGC Navy (Nedsa) are both well-equipped. The biggest danger is that a hothead Nedsa commander will take matters into his own hands, and attack without orders.\nOman will no doubt be stressing to Iran, with whom it keeps open channels of communication, that any Iranian violation of Omani territorial integrity would force a re-think of relations between the two countries.  With at least three Iranian aircraft seen flying into Muscat in recent days, presumably in connection with stalled US-Iranian negotiations which Oman has been mediating, keeping Oman open as a conduit through which to communicate ought to be considered a high priority for those in Iran interested in a negotiated end to the conflict.\n\n\nGoat Island\n\nAnxious to remain neutral so as to protect its mediating role, Oman has made no mention of shifts in traffic in the Straits of Hormuz. Nor has it made mention of any naval movements to bolster its coverage of the Straits. Nonetheless, silence does not indicate any lessening of determination to protect Omani sovereignty. The Omani Navy has a tight oversight of the maritime picture in the area through radar pickets on outlying outcrops within its territorial waters, and from vessels operating out of its Goat Island Naval Base on the Musandam Peninsula.  It is likely also to have issued warnings to Iranian commanders via the channels established to coordinate search and rescue operations in the area."

        "content": "In an unusual daytime assault, Iran launched missile barrages targeting the Israeli port city of Haifa as well as other regions of the country. The attack came just hours after Maersk issued a customer advisory reporting after “carefully analyzing threat risk reports,” that it would suspend port calls to Haifa.\nThe Israeli military issued an alert on Friday afternoon for an incoming missile attack with reports of sirens sounding in Haifa and other areas. According to the reports as many as 23 ballistic missiles were targeted at Haifa with reports of one or more loud explosions. One appeared to hit near the center of the city while media reports said there were three impact sites to the west of Haifa in the area of Shfar’am, which is an Arab district.\n\nClouds of smoke are rising from Haifa port after it was targeted by Iranian missiles.pic.twitter.com/PwrL5lVGvz\n\nMost of the citizens were able to reach shelters before the missile attack, but medical sources are saying that 17 people were injured in the attack on Haifa with three including a 16-year-old boy seriously injured. There have not been reports of causalities from the strikes in south and central Israel during the same attack.\nSpeculation is that the oil refinery near Haifa may have been the primary target. It is unclear, but it seems the attack missed the port itself. Haifa is a critical port as it accounts for a third or more of Israel’s container imports. Approximately 98 percent of Israel’s trade is seaborne. Operations in the port are run by India's Adani Ports which won the contract to privatize Haifa's terminals in 2022.\n\"The port at Haifa is Israel’s busiest and most important link enabling international trade and exports as well as receiving and processing import containers supplying goods to the local population. Any degree of constraint to the accessibility of these and other ports in the region will add significant pressure to the remaining infrastructure as companies scramble to secure capacity and services to other entry and exit points across the region,\" said Gartner VP analyst David Gonzalez.\n“Maersk has made the decision to temporarily suspend vessel calls at the Port of Haifa, Israel, and also suspend cargo acceptance for Haifa,” the company informed customers. It emphasized that the safety and security of its seafarers and operations are its top priority.\n\n\nHaifa is a critical port accounting for as much as a third of Israel's container volume (Port Authority)\n\nWell-known industry analyst Lars Jensen commented that it is an “open question” of whether additional operators will follow suit. Earlier in the week, CMA CGM said “We confirm that maritime transport activities are proceeding as normal in the area, and our operations and logistics chains remain unaffected.” It however said it has “activated a dedicated monitoring cell to watch closely all developments.” Other carriers such as MSC Mediterranean Shipping have not made public statements.\nJensen notes that Maersk updated him clarifying the development noting it “specifically only encompasses Maersk-operated vessels, which means that Maersk-booked cargo moving on other providers' vessels should not be affected for now.”\nMaersk’s online schedule system reflects ships diverting from Haifa to the Port of Ashdod in central Israel. The 2,500-TEUMaersk Norfolkshows that it is now en route to Ashdod according to its AIS signal and the online schedule. TheJohannes Maersk(3,000 TEU) operating a loop between Northern Europe and the Mediterranean is also now scheduled to call in Ashdod."

        "content": "The sailing yachtBayesianreached the surface on Friday afternoon, June 20, ten months after it was lost claiming the lives of seven passengers including billionaire tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter. It was the first phase of a complex salvage operation that will resume on Saturday and is expected to be completed by Monday when the salvage team will hand the vessel over to investigators.\nThe salvage company TMC described the complex operation which has been ongoing all week using sophisticated remote vehicles and two of the heaviest lifting capacity cranes in Europe. They were working on the yacht which was upright but at an angle approximately 50 meters (165 feet) below the surface near the fishing port of Porticello, Italy. The yacht had anchored for the night of August 19, 2024, with a forecast of thunderstorms in the region.\nTMC reports a specialized remote-controlled, diamond-wire precision-cutting tool was used earlier this week to remove the vessel’s mast. It stood 72 meters (236 feet) from the waterline and would have made it impossible to bring the hull up on an even keel. The mast was lowered to the seafloor for later recovery.\n\nTmc aveva tentato già nei giorni scorsi di sostituire i cavi, riscontrando però alcune difficoltà a causa della posizione e della profondità (49 metri) cui si trovava l'imbarcazionehttps://t.co/1fL0LCcNdJ\n\nEight steel lifting straps were strung below the hull which measures 56 meters (184 feet) with four near the bow and four near the stern. They are using a combination of straps, a sling, and a harness to recover the vessel. TMC reports the lifting process began three days ago. Two heavy lift cranes,Hebo Lift 10andHebo Lift 2, were positioned on each side of the wreck.\nAround 1 p.m. local time the upper portion of the accommodations came out of the water. The lifting was paused at this point. The Italian Navy and Coast Guard were on hand observing and ensuring that no onlookers approached the site. TMC explains they were inspecting the hull, and it must reinforce and increase the harnesses before the next phase of the operation. In addition to the yacht which is reported to weigh about 550 tons, there are still 18,000 liters of fuel aboard as well as the weight of the water inside the hull.\n\nSono iniziate le operazioni di recupero del Bayesian, il veliero con a bordo 22 persone che è affondato il 19 agosto 2024 al largo di Santa Flavia, nei pressi di Palermo, causando 7 morti. Lo scafo ora è a pelo d'acqua tra le due gru per le operazioni di svuotamento.#bayesian…pic.twitter.com/QibYpLT75E\n\nThe next phase is scheduled to start at dawn on Saturday and weather permitting the vessel will be fully lifted and transferred toHebo Lift 10. The crane barge is scheduled to depart on Sunday and arrive on Monday in the port of Termini Imerese, Sicily. On Monday, they plan to lift the hull into a specially built steel cradle that has been prepared on the dock in Sicily.\nInvestigators are anxious to begin reviewing key points that are believed to have contributed to the sinking. They will be trying to determine the position of access doors and others that could have hastened the sinking if they had been left open. They are also looking to determine the position of the sailing yacht’s retractable keel. Investigators want to know if it was raised or lowered as it would have also affected stability and the ability to withstand the sudden winds which are believed to have caused the vessel to roll onto its side. They want to know why the yacht rolled and why it did not recover.\nThe prosecutors in the Palermo suburb are investigating the captain, engineering officer, and watchman. They have been charged with multiple counts of manslaughter for the seven deaths as well as negligence contributing to the shipwreck.\nA second investigation is underway for the death of a diver working at the site in May. Three people from the salvage company SMIT are being investigated on allegations that workplace safety rules were violated.\nAfter completing the removal of theBayesian, teams will return to the site to recover the mast and other debris on the seafloor."

At 727 feet (220 meters) in length and accommodations for 110 passengers, it will be the world’s largest sail yacht and the launch of the famed Orient Express and French Accor group into the cruise market.\nThe float out took place on June 16 at the Chantiers de l’Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France. First steel for the vessel was cut in March 2024 and assembly began at the beginning of this year. It was moved from the dry dock to the fitting out berth with its maiden voyage scheduled for June 2026.\nThe hull was built from 14 structural blocks and the vessel features three balestron rigs that are a unique base for the masts and sails. The bases pivot and tilt to increase the performance of the three rigid sails. Each mast will stand 100 meters (328 feet) supporting 16,146 square feet of rigid sails. The sails will also fold down when not in use. The unique sail concept was developed by Chantiers de l’Atlantique and this is the first commercial installation after years of testing.\nThe propulsion system will be unique for a cruise ship of this size able to sail 100 percent under renewable power in the right conditions. Backing up the sails when required is a hybrid propulsion system powered by liquified natural gas (LNG).\n\n\nSail yacht afloat for the first time (Accor)\n\nThe shipyard and Orient Express highlight other state-of-the-art technology aboard the vessel and her sister shipOrient Express Olympiandue to enter service in the summer of 2027. Each ship will be outfitted with an AI-driven floating object detection system which aims to minimize the risk of marine mammal collisions. They will also have dynamic positioning technology which eliminates the need for anchoring, preserving delicate seabeds. BIO-UV Group is also supplying a BIO-SEA ballast water treatment. It is a chemical-free UV-based system to treat water aboard the vessels.\nAccor, which is one of the world’s largest hotel companies with more than 5,600 locations and 850,000 hotel rooms, acquired in 2022 the legendary Orient Express brand famous for the luxury train of the same name. The group is launching its first Orient Express branded hotels in 2025 and last year Accor and LVMH entered into a strategic partnership to accelerate the development of Orient Express.\nThe launch of the cruise ships leverages the brand name while introducing a new element to the luxury segment. It follows the entry of Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons into the luxury cruise market.\n\n\nRendering of the ship as it will look with its masts and sails (Orient Express)\n\nOrient Express Corinthianwill feature 54 luxury suites ranging between 485 and 2,476 square feet. The ship will also have five restaurants and private dining spaces, all overseen by multi-Michelin starred chef Yannick Alléno who also oversees dining on the train. The company promises to capture the same grandeur of the famed train onboard with a luxury interior design.\nBeginning service in June 2026, the ship, which will be registered in France, will depart on its maiden voyage from Marseille and cruise in the Mediterranean and Adriatic. It will cross the Atlantic to spend the winter in the Caribbean."

A large-scale response was mounted with 40 marine firefighting specialists from the two stations and three SCDF marine rescue vessels. When they reached the unidentified tanker smoke was billowing out from an area in the deck house which was later identified as a storeroom.\n\n\n\nThe fireboats began a boundary cooling effort and fire teams boarded the vessel. The SCFD reports the teams were able to locate the seat of the fire and used a water jet to extinguish the blaze before it could spread to more areas of the vessel. The fire team was also using specialized equipment to ventilate the vessel.\nThe crew of the tanker has been accounted for and they were uninjured. The cause of the fire is still under investigation."

        "author": "The Maritime Executive",
        "content": "\nAustal USA marked a key milestone in its shipbuilding operation recently with the rollout and launch of its first steel ship, the future USNS Billy Frank Jr. (T-ATS 11). The company is best known for its large aluminum vessels and the Independence-class Littoral Combat Ship, started the transition into steel five years ago responding to the U.S. Navy’s concerns over the durability of lighter-weight aluminum vessels.\nUSNS Billy Frank Jr. is seen as a kickstart for the shipyard to develop its skills in steel construction and its newly developed automated steel panel line. The Navy in 2019 began planning its return to all steel construction and the Department of Defense supported Austal in its efforts to develop the capabilities. This included a $50 million matching grant toward the construction of the steel line and the development of additional capacity for steel naval vessel construction at its Mobile shipyard.\nWork began in July 2022 for the first-ever steel cutting at the Mobile facility and kicking off the Navy Towing, Salvage, and Rescue Ship program. Austal USA won a contract for three of the hulls as its first steel job. The rollout of the first vessel took place on June 14 in Mobile.\n“It was amazing to see the flawless rollout of our first steel ship,” said Harley Combs, vice president of surface ship programs. “The completion of this milestone is the result of the hard work and dedication of our talented workforce.”\nAt 3,100 metric tons, T-ATS 11 is also the heaviest ship Austal USA has launched to date. The launch was executed using the process used to launch most of the 32 Navy ships the company has built and delivered over the last 15 years. The multi-step method involves rolling the ship onto a moored deck barge and then transferring the ship from the barge to a floating dry dock.  The dry dock is submerged enabling the ship to float for the first time and then removed from the dry dock and moored pier side.\n\n\nFuture USNS Billy Frank Jr. afloat and positioned to the fitting out berth (Austal USA)\n\nThe ship was over 85 percent complete at the time of launch. Austal reports the future USNS Billy Frank Jr. will now prepare for her next major milestone, the engine light off, as she gets ready for sea trials and delivery.\nT-ATS will provide ocean-going towing, salvage, and rescue capabilities to support fleet operations. It will have a multi-mission common hull platform capable of towing U.S. Navy ships and will have 6,000 square feet of deck space for embarked systems. The large, unobstructed deck allows for the embarkation of a variety of stand-alone and interchangeable systems.\nThe class was designed to combine the capabilities of the retiring Rescue and Salvage Ship (T-ARS 50) and Fleet Ocean Tug (T-ATF 166) platforms. It will be able to support current missions including towing, salvage, rescue, oil spill response, humanitarian assistance, and wide-area search and surveillance. The platform also enables future rapid capability initiatives such as supporting modular payloads with hotel services and appropriate interfaces.\nWhile it is the first steel construction for Austal, the prize was a $3 billion contract for seven ocean surveillance ships for the U.S. Navy awarded in 2023. In addition, after committing to its steel capability, Austal also received a contract for the Navy’s Auxiliary Floating Drydock Medium (AFDM) and in a contested decision, Austal beat out Eastern Shipbuilding to secure follow-on hulls for the U.S. Coast Guard Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) program.\nThe addition of the steel capability is critical for the yard as it works to complete the delivery of its final Independence-class Littoral Combat Ship. The future USS Pierre (LCS-38) was launched in August 2024 as the final ship of the series for Austal. The company highlights that it is closing more than a decade of work as this series winds down. The yard was established in 1999 focusing on aluminum and the demand for more capacity to meet the needs of the U.S. Navy."
