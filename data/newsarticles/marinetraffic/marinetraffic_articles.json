        "content": "As global sanctions frameworks continue to evolve, maritime stakeholders must adapt to the changing regulatory landscapes. This update highlights the key sanctions developments from January 2025, offering insights into emerging risks and compliance strategies. **Key Takeaways** - The **U.S. intensified sanctions on Russia and Cuba**, revoking General License 93 and issuing eight new Russia-related General Licenses (GLs), including GL 8L and GL 115A. - **A total of 183 vessels linked to Russian and Iranian oil shipments were designated**, with a focus on AIS manipulation and ship-to-ship (STS) transfers. - Russian maritime insurers **Ingosstrakh and Alfastrakhovanie were sanctioned**, along with nearly 80 entities in Russia’s LNG sector and over 30 oilfield service providers. - The **Cuba Restricted List was reinstated**, targeting entities tied to Cuba’s military and intelligence sectors. - These measures signal heightened scrutiny on maritime compliance, insurance, and shipping practices. **Market Analysis** In January 2025, U.S. sanctions policy took a decisive turn, significantly impacting maritime operations and global energy markets. The revocation of General License 93, which previously permitted transactions involving Sovcomflot vessels, underscores a strategic shift aimed at curbing Russia’s maritime influence. Concurrently, OFAC issued eight new Russia-related General Licenses, including GL 8L and GL 115A, to adjust compliance pathways ([OFAC, 2025](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20250110)). A total of 183 vessels, predominantly oil tankers linked to Russian and Iranian crude shipments, were designated due to their involvement in deceptive practices such as AIS manipulation and clandestine STS transfers ([U.S. Treasury, 2025](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2777)). This marks a clear regulatory focus on “shadow fleet” operations that have become instrumental in circumventing sanctions. Notably, Russian maritime insurers Ingosstrakh and Alfastrakhovanie were also blacklisted, intensifying risks for shipping companies reliant on these providers. This demonstrates a holistic regulatory approach, targeting not only vessels but also ownership structures, insurance providers, and smaller support vessels that facilitate operations for refineries and larger ships.\" The U.S. State Department expanded its sanctions scope, targeting nearly 80 entities associated with Russia’s LNG sector, including Arctic LNG 2 and officials from Rosatom ([U.S. Treasury, 2025](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2777)). Additionally, over 30 Russia-based oilfield service companies faced restrictions, directly impacting crude production and LNG export operations. The reinstatement of the Cuba Restricted List further complicates maritime logistics, particularly for entities engaged with Cuba’s military-linked enterprises ([U.S. State Department, 2025](https://www.state.gov/restoring-a-tough-u-s-cuba-policy/)). **Implications for the Shipping Industry** These sanctions impose immediate and complex challenges for maritime stakeholders. The designation of 183 vessels demands enhanced due diligence and real-time vessel tracking to mitigate the risk of inadvertent sanctions breaches. Compliance teams must swiftly update screening tools to reflect the revocation of GL 93 and adjust risk assessments for entities like Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, and sanctioned insurers. Shipping companies face increased scrutiny in chartering, insurance, and supply chain operations, particularly along routes involving Russia, Iran, and Cuba. The heightened focus on deceptive shipping practices necessitates investment in advanced monitoring technologies and robust compliance frameworks. Additionally, insurers must reassess coverage policies, given the sanctions against key Russian providers, potentially leading to higher premiums and limited coverage options. ![Picture1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture1_9d9165648e.png) **Graph 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the last five years (January 2020 to January 2025) - Kpler._ The intensification of sanctions enforcement is evident in the sharp rise in the number of sanctioned vessels and companies over the past five years. Between January 2020 and January 2025, the number of sanctioned vessels surged from approximately 380 to nearly 1,200, marking an increase of over 215%. A particularly notable acceleration occurred between mid-2022 and early 2023, where the number of sanctioned vessels jumped by roughly 200 units - a clear reflection of evolving geopolitical tensions and regulatory responses. Similarly, the number of sanctioned companies grew from around 160 in early 2020 to over 500 by January 2025, representing a 213% increase. This parallel growth in sanctioned entities underscores the expanding scope of enforcement actions, with the most pronounced spike observed in the final months of 2024, coinciding with the latest U.S. sanctions targeting Russian and Cuban-linked entities. ![Picture2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture2_5534abee53.png) **Graph 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the last three years (January 2022 to January 2025) - Kpler._ The evolving sanctions landscape is clearly reflected in the growth of sanctioned vessels across the top 10 flag registries from January 2022 to January 2025. Over this three-year period, the total number of sanctioned vessels increased from approximately 180 to nearly 600, representing a staggering growth of over 230%. Russia and Iran continue to dominate the list, with Russia’s share rising sharply from around 50 vessels in early 2022 to more than 200 by January 2025, indicating a fourfold increase. Similarly, Iran’s sanctioned fleet remained consistently high, maintaining a substantial baseline throughout the period. Notably, Panama, Curacao, and Guyana have experienced significant upticks, with Panama’s sanctioned vessels growing from less than 20 in 2022 to over 80 by early 2025 - a 300% surge. Flags such as Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe, and Barbados, which had minimal presence in early 2022, show exponential increases, particularly from mid-2023 onwards. This trend suggests a regulatory pivot towards targeting vessels registered under flags of convenience—registrations in countries with lenient regulations, lower operating costs, or minimal enforcement standards, often used to obscure beneficial ownership and facilitate sanctions evasion. The sharpest increase occurred in the final quarter of 2024, where the total number of sanctioned vessels jumped by over 40% within just three months, underscoring the aggressive escalation in enforcement actions tied to recent geopolitical developments and regulatory shifts. ![Picture3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture3_2352353b7b.png) **Graph 3.** _Total vessels and companies added to sanctions lists over the last twelve months (February 2024 to January 2025) - Kpler._ The enforcement momentum peaked dramatically over the last 12 months, with January 2025 alone witnessing the addition of 183 vessels and 58 companies to sanctions lists - representing month-on-month increases of 375% and 120%, respectively, compared to December 2024. This explosive growth aligns with the revocation of General License 93 and the imposition of new restrictions on Russian maritime insurers and energy-linked entities. The final quarter of 2024 also shows consistent monthly additions, averaging around 50 vessels and 20 companies, highlighting an aggressive escalation in enforcement actions. This surge underscores the need for maritime stakeholders to rapidly adapt compliance frameworks, as the sanctions landscape becomes increasingly dynamic and expansive. **Conclusion** Proactive compliance is essential in navigating the evolving sanctions landscape, where enforcement actions have surged dramatically—evidenced by a 215% increase in sanctioned vessels and over 200% growth in sanctioned companies since 2020. With regulatory focus expanding to cover deceptive shipping practices, diverse flag registries, and entities tied to high-risk jurisdictions like Russia and Iran, staying ahead requires more than reactive measures. Industry professionals must remain vigilant, continuously monitoring regulatory updates, adapting compliance frameworks, and leveraging real-time data to detect emerging risks. In this dynamic environment, informed, agile compliance strategies are not just a regulatory requirement—they are critical for safeguarding operations and maintaining business continuity. _To find out more about Kpler’s Risk & Compliance offering, visit [here](https://www.kpler.com/demos/risk-compliance-demo?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=risk&compliance_commodities_maritime_news_demo_request)._"

        "content": "_Contributing author: Dimitris Ampatzidis, Risk and Compliance Analyst at Kpler_ The **VEZHEN** ([IMO 9937270](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:7148754/mmsi:229659000/imo:9937270/vessel:VEZHEN)) incident raises familiar yet increasingly urgent questions about maritime risk, intent, and accountability. Undersea cables play a critical role in global internet connectivity and energy transmission, forming the backbone of modern communication and infrastructure. Damage to these cables can have far-reaching consequences, disrupting services and exposing vulnerabilities in maritime security. A vessel slows down, deviates from its expected course, exhibits erratic movement, and soon after, a vital undersea cable is found damaged. The sequence of events follows a now well-documented pattern—one seen with Shunxing39, YI PENG 3 or EAGLE S incidents referenced in a recent [MarineTraffic article](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/maritime-news/16/general/2025/11765/commercial-vessels-a-new-form-of-hybrid-warfare). What makes this incident particularly striking is how predictable it is when compared to previous events. The combination of vessel behavior and infrastructure damage forms a worrying pattern that continues to unfold in plain sight. **Vessel Details** The Maltese-flagged VEZHEN, a Handysize bulk carrier, was en route from the Russian port of Ust Luga, loading a cargo of sulfur. Kpler’s ownership data shows the vessel is managed by Navibulgar, a major player in Bulgarian shipping and a member of BIMCO. Whilst the registered owner is a Hong Kong registered company called Hai Kuo Shipping 2015B Limited. ![CleanShot 2025-01-27 at 12.15.01.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2025_01_27_at_12_15_01_fa263ade2d.png) **Image 1:** _On January 25, 2025, at 03:20 UTC, the vessel - a 2022-built Handysize bulker, DWT 32,196 - began reducing its speed from a usual operational speed of just above 10 knots to around 7.5 knots. This reduction continued for almost a full day until 06:50 UTC on January 26, when it resumed its normal operational speed. Just before returning to her normal speed, the vessel briefly maneuvered below 3 knots, with an AIS trajectory that shows a sharp course deviation - MarineTraffic data._ This is almost identical to what was observed in the other cable cutting incidents including YI PENG 3 and NEWNEW POLAR BEAR, where vessels slowed down or altered course before undersea cables were found damaged. The location of this low-speed maneuvering is also critical. The VEZHEN was transiting an area where a fiber-optic cable between Latvia and Sweden's Gotland was later found damaged. This mirrors what happened with EAGLE S in December 2024, when Finnish authorities later recovered its damaged anchor after the vessel had passed over the Estlink 2 cable. The consistency in how these incidents unfold raises obvious questions. **Contradicting Statements** The company issued a statement claiming that the damage was due to “unfavorable hydrometeorological conditions.” (source: https://www.navbul.com/ ) However, based on MarineTraffic data, our weather data partner and AIS tracking analysis, the conditions encountered by the ship were calm to moderate, well within the normal range for the Baltic Sea during winter. - **Waves and Swells:** The ship encountered moderate swells, with periods ranging from 2.7 to 4.7 seconds and heights generally below 1 meter. This is typical for the Baltic Sea, which has smaller swells compared to open oceans due to its shallow waters. - **Wind:** Wind speeds peaked at 16 knots and decreased to 2 knots at times. These are typical conditions for the Baltic in January, with stronger winds being more notable during major storms—something not observed in this instance. - **Currents:** Current speeds ranged between 0.01 to 0.23 knots, primarily from the east to southeast. These mild currents are characteristic of the Baltic Sea. Then there’s the mechanical evidence. Photos from the scene show the ship’s anchor was broken—another element that ties this case to others (source: Reuters - [Swedish authorities board ship seized over Baltic Sea cable breach](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swedish-authorities-board-ship-seized-over-baltic-sea-cable-breach-2025-01-27/)). The same was reported for NEWNEW POLA BEAR (source: ERR - [Photo: Chinese ship that crossed gas pipeline is missing anchor](https://news.err.ee/1609143092/photo-chinese-ship-that-crossed-gas-pipeline-is-missing-anchor)) after the Baltic connector pipeline incident and YI PENG 3 when it severed Sweden-Lithuania’s undersea cables (source: The Maritime Executive - [Suspected Sabotage Ship's Anchor Shows Signs of Extreme Damage](https://maritime-executive.com/article/suspected-sabotage-ship-s-anchor-shows-signs-of-extreme-damage)). Ships do not randomly drop or drag their anchors in these areas, let alone repeatedly break them under similar circumstances. **At what point do we stop treating these as isolated maritime mishaps?** The combination of speed reductions, erratic course deviations, known infrastructure damage, and physical anchor evidence follows a pattern too clear to ignore. While the specific causes behind each event may vary, the sequence of actions is almost identical."

        "content": "**Overview** Maritime sanctions dominated 2024 due to geopolitical tensions, stricter enforcement, and evolving evasion tactics such as ship-to-ship transfers and the manipulation of the vessel's Automatic Identification System (AIS) . Key regions, including Europe and Asia-Pacific, saw intensified scrutiny, particularly focused on Russia's \"shadow fleet.\" These developments highlighted the industry's pivotal role in global trade and the importance of compliance. The article offers a balanced reflection on the major sanctions trends of 2024 while highlighting key developments in December. Over the course of the year, 333 vessels and 167 companies were added to sanctions lists, with December alone accounting for 68 vessels and 30 companies newly sanctioned. **Major Trends in 2024** In 2024, maritime sanctions became stricter, with authorities focusing on stopping deceptive practices. The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ([OFAC, 2024](https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/933556/download?inline=)) highlighted issues like ships switching off their tracking systems (AIS manipulation) and ship-to-ship (STS) transfers in high-risk areas. These tactics were often used to hide illegal activity, including the transport of sanctioned goods. The European Union also introduced new measures, especially focusing on vessels involved in moving Russian oil. In December 2024, the EU’s 15th sanctions package ([DG NEAR, 2024](https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-adopts-15th-sanctions-package-against-russia-its-continued-illegal-war-against-ukraine-2024-12-16_en?)) targeted a \"shadow fleet\" of ships that used deceptive measures like frequent flag changes and STS transfers to avoid detection. These actions taken by the EU and OFAC show how enforcement agencies have intensified their efforts to track and penalise non-compliance. Shipping companies now face more pressure to adopt better monitoring and compliance practices to avoid costly penalties and reputational damage. The year marked a turning point in the crackdown on sanctions evasion. In 2024, a record-breaking 333 vessels were added to global sanctions lists, a sharp increase compared to 96 in 2023. This surge underscores intensified regulatory efforts targeting high-risk practices such as AIS manipulation and dark ship-to-ship transfers. Notably, December alone accounted for 68 newly sanctioned vessels, highlighting a year-end escalation in enforcement actions that marked a defining trend in maritime compliance. Throughout 2024, international authorities intensified their scrutiny of specific regions and deceptive maritime practices to enforce sanctions more effectively: - **Eastern Mediterranean and Gulf of Oman:** The UK government ([OFSI, 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-guidance-for-maritime-shipping/financial-sanctions-guidance-for-maritime-shipping?)) identified these regions as high-risk for sanctions evasion, particularly through deceptive shipping practices. - **Automatic Identification System (AIS) Manipulation:** OFAC ([OFAC, 2024](https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/933556/download?inline=)) issued guidance addressing the manipulation of AIS data, where vessels intentionally disable or falsify their tracking information to conceal illicit activities. - **Ship-to-Ship Transfers:** The UK government ([OFSI, 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-guidance-for-maritime-shipping/financial-sanctions-guidance-for-maritime-shipping?)) emphasised that while STS transfers can be legitimate, they are often exploited to evade sanctions, especially when conducted clandestinely or in high-risk areas. - **Flag Hopping and False Flags:** The practice of frequently changing a vessel's registration (flag hopping) or using false flags to disguise a ship's true origin has been identified as a tactic to evade sanctions ([OFSI, 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-guidance-for-maritime-shipping/financial-sanctions-guidance-for-maritime-shipping?)). These focused efforts by the U.S. and UK authorities underline a commitment to monitoring and addressing regional and tactical methods of sanctions evasion in the maritime industry. **Looking Ahead: What to Expect in 2025** The 2025 sanctions landscape is set to tighten further, building on the U.S. sanctions package announced on the 10th of January, which clamps down on Russian oil exports and entities involved in evading price caps. This package, detailed by Kpler ([Matt W., 2025](https://www.kpler.com/blog/us-sanctions-clamp-down-on-russian-oil-exports)), underscores a targeted approach toward shadow fleets and deceptive practices, with a focus on regions and entities facilitating unauthorised trade. Anticipated regulatory changes may expand the scope of enforcement to include stricter penalties and additional sectors. Geopolitical factors, including the return of Trump to the U.S. presidency, could further influence the sanctions framework, echoing the assertive policies of his previous administration. Such a shift may lead to heightened scrutiny on global maritime operations, requiring proactive risk management. **Industry Adjustments** In 2024, the maritime industry adapted to intensified sanctions enforcement by placing a greater emphasis on compliance strategies and technology. Companies increasingly adopted advanced tools, such as AI-powered vessel tracking and real-time sanctions screening, to detect deceptive practices like AIS manipulation and ship-to-ship transfers. Platforms like MarineTraffic and Kpler offered detailed insights, enabling stakeholders to identify high-risk vessels and regions more effectively. Compliance teams enhanced their expertise through regular training on updated regulations, such as the EU’s sanctions packages and OFAC guidelines. Collaborations with legal and risk consultancies also became more common to navigate complex cases. **December 2024 at a Glance** In December 2024, significant sanctions updates and enforcement actions impacted the maritime industry: **EU Sanctions on Russia's Shadow Fleet:** The European Union imposed sanctions on approximately 50 vessels within Russia's \"shadow fleet,\" aiming to disrupt clandestine oil and fuel shipments circumventing existing restrictions ([Ampatzidis D., 2024](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/maritime-news/34/risk-and%20compliance/2025/11725/patterns-of-risky-shipping-activity-amid-eu-15th-sanctions-p)). This initiative seeks to tighten control over unauthorised maritime activities linked to Russia and enhance the enforcement of sanctions compliance. **Western Coalition's Measures Against Uninsured Vessels:** A coalition of twelve Western nations, including the UK, Germany, and Nordic countries, agreed to enforce measures against vessels lacking proper insurance documentation ([Sytas, A., 2024](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-shadow-fleet-be-boarded-or-sanctioned-if-it-refuses-prove-insurance-2024-12-17/)). Ships unable to prove insurance coverage while transiting strategic maritime routes, such as the English Channel and the Gulf of Finland, face potential boarding or sanctions. These measures specifically address Russia's \"shadow fleet,\" while promoting maritime safety and regulatory compliance. **Heightened Scrutiny on Maritime Infrastructure Risks:** Finnish authorities seized a Hong Kong-flagged vessel suspected of damaging an undersea power cable between Finland and Estonia ([Raza, R., 2024](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/maritime-news/15/maritime-security/2025/11744/finnish-authorities-seize-vessel-suspected-of-damaging-power)). This action underscores the growing focus on maritime operations that threaten critical infrastructure. By linking such incidents to broader security concerns, authorities focus on the need for stricter accountability and compliance in safeguarding key assets and ensuring operational transparency. This incident highlighted the broader implications of negligent or non-compliant practices, extending beyond sanctions evasion to include risks to vital infrastructure. Just as the EU and Western coalitions moved to curb clandestine shipping and promote transparency, this case illustrated the growing need for vigilance and accountability across all maritime activities. Together, these developments reflect a reinforced commitment by authorities to uphold safety, compliance, and security in increasingly complex operating environments. **What the Numbers Say** ![Graph1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Graph1_af9f7bcea8.png) **Graph 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the last five years - Kpler._ Over the past five years, the maritime industry has experienced a notable rise in sanctions targeting both vessels and associated companies. This trend reflects a global crackdown on practices like ship-to-ship transfers, AIS manipulation, and the use of shadow fleets to evade restrictions. Regulatory bodies have intensified efforts to trace ownership networks and enforce compliance, particularly since 2022, when enforcement measures became more coordinated. In December 2024 alone, 68 vessels and 30 companies were sanctioned. Over the entire year of 2024, the total numbers reached 333 vessels and 167 companies. ![Graph2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Graph2_eb53769fc5.png) **Graph 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the last five years - Kpler._ In 2024, Panama experienced the largest increase in sanctioned vessels with 52 additions, including 25 in December alone, signaling an intensified focus on major registries linked to evasion tactics. Barbados and Guyana also faced significant scrutiny, with increases of 44 and 23 vessels, respectively. While Iran and Russia continue to account for a substantial share of sanctioned vessels, their increases were moderate, reflecting established trends rather than new developments. Other flags, such as Gabon and Curacao, showed smaller but notable increases, indicating broadening enforcement to less obvious registries. ![Graph3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Graph3_15d41adb9d.png) **Graph 3.** _Total vessels and companies added to sanctions lists in 2024 vs. previous years - Kpler._ The addition of vessels and companies to sanctions lists has accelerated significantly in recent years, with 2024 marking a notable surge. A total of 333 vessels and 167 companies were sanctioned in 2024, representing the most substantial increase compared to previous years. This escalation reflects the intensified global focus on enforcement, particularly targeting deceptive practices and high-risk entities. The sharp rise in 2024 contrasts sharply with the steadier, lower increases observed between 2020–2023, signaling a broader regulatory effort to combat evasion tactics like shadow fleets. These developments highlight the importance of compliance for maritime stakeholders, as enforcement measures expand both in scale and complexity. ![Graph4.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Graph4_daf7e10614.png) **Graph 4.** _Dark STS transfers increase - Kpler._ Dark ship-to-ship (STS) transfers involve cargo transfers conducted while a vessel’s AIS transponder is turned off, making them challenging to monitor. Each event is verified using satellite imagery and AIS data, ensuring reliable detection and analysis. Over the past three years, the number of dark STS transfers has risen substantially, with 2024 recording a significant increase. Both sanctioned and non-sanctioned events grew sharply, reflecting a higher reliance on these covert tactics. The growth in non-sanctioned transfers indicates broader risks that extend beyond sanctions violations, emphasising the need for enhanced detection tools and robust risk management practices. ![Graph5.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Graph5_65cb949902.png) **Graph 5.** _Top 10 regions for dark STS transfers through the last three years - Kpler._ Over the last three years, specific regions have emerged as hotspots for dark ship-to-ship (STS) transfers. EOPL leads as the most active zone, with a significant share of sanctioned events, highlighting its role in high-risk cargo transfers. Iran and Kharg Island also report substantial activity, with Kharg Island showing a notable mix of both sanctioned and non-sanctioned transfers, pointing out its strategic importance. Malaysia and Amuay Light further illustrate the global spread of these activities, while Venezuela, Bandar Mahshahr, and Bandar Abbas represent key areas linked to sanctions evasion. The presence of non-sanctioned events in these regions indicates broader operational challenges. ![Graph6.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Graph6_06d2ef408e.png) **Graph 6.** _Breakdown of sanctioned vessel types in 2024 vs. previous years - Kpler._ Sanctioned vessel types in 2024 reveal a significant focus on crude oil tankers, which dominate the list, reflecting heightened scrutiny on high-risk energy cargo. Compared to previous years, there has been a sharp increase in sanctions targeting this category, aligning with efforts to curb illicit oil trade and enforce energy-related sanctions compliance. Other vessel types, including general cargo ships, oil/chemical tankers, and bulk carriers, also show consistent sanctions activity, highlighting their role in facilitating deceptive practices. Notably, newer categories, such as LPG and LNG tankers, emerged in 2024, reflecting the expanding scope of regulatory measures. These trends underline the critical importance of monitoring a wide range of vessel types as regulators broaden their enforcement to address evolving risks in global maritime operations. **Lessons Learned** The 2024 sanctions landscape underscored the importance of adaptability and innovation in maritime compliance. Leveraging advanced technologies and fostering collaboration with authorities proved effective in addressing evolving risks. However, disparities in access to resources and inconsistent regulatory interpretations highlighted areas for improvement. Strengthened global cooperation and a commitment to transparency remain essential for navigating future challenges. Stay tuned for more insights and updates, ensuring that you remain informed and compliant amidst these dynamic regulatory changes.

The upcoming Mediterranean Emission Control Area (ECA), set to take effect on 1 May, 2025, combined with the introduction of the FuelEU regulations, is expected to push fuel prices higher, resulting in increased freight rates throughout the region. As the shipping industry braces for these converging regulations, vessels may turn to alternative fuels, but the transition is likely to come at a cost, further driving up operational expenses for shippers. Last year, it was announced that the Mediterranean Sea will become an Emission Control Area (ECA) starting on 1 May, 2025. This means the sulphur content of fuel used on board ships must not exceed 0.1%, a significant reduction from the previous limit of 0.5%. The only exception is for ships equipped with scrubbers - exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) - which ensure an equivalent reduction in sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions. Other regions, such as the Baltic Sea, North Sea, North American waters, and the U.S. Caribbean Sea, are already designated as ECAs. [![Risk & Compliance London Breakfast Briefing.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Risk_and_Compliance_London_Breakfast_Briefing_7ec2f0cd41.png)](https://www.kpler.com/event/risk-and-compliance-london-breakfast-briefing) While previous regulations, like IMO 2020, saw a smoother adaptation than initially feared, this new market for lower-sulphur bunker fuels could still create challenges, as vessels will need to secure compliant fuel supplies, such as 0.15% MGO and USLFO, with existing demand from other regions. Jean-Christophe Monfort, Senior Product Manager - Emissions at Kpler, says shipowners will be seeking alternative fuels to avoid fines: >“The timing of the Mediterranean ECA also coincides with the upcoming FuelEU regulations starting on January 1, 2025, which may trigger shipowners to consider alternative fuels like LNG or biofuels to avoid penalties. This regulatory convergence could lead some fleet owners to prioritise these cleaner fuels for Mediterranean routes, potentially reducing reliance on scrubbers as the default compliance method. But with bunker fuel costs for alternative fuels higher than regular HFO or VLSFO, trading in the region will still face increased costs.” Kpler Freight Analyst Matt Wright adds that the combination of the Mediterranean ECA and EU regulations means costs for shippers will likely increase and be passed on to the charterer, raising freight rates across Europe and the Mediterranean. >“For short-haul voyages taking place entirely within the ECA or EU, alternative fuel vessels will become increasingly popular, while scrubber-fitted ships will be favoured for longer voyages,\" Wright said."

The naming ceremony of the ANE MAERSK took place at the Ulsan port around two weeks ago. The ship was built at the HD Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard, also located in Ulsan. This vessel is the first of a series of 18 large methanol-powered ships that are to be delivered to Maersk between 2024 and 2025. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries established the “Guidelines for Approval of Self-Safety Management Plan for Methanol Supply,\" a framework that was utilized in the bunkering operation. The ministry has been involved in two prior bunkering demonstrations in July and November of last year. The Minister for Oceans and Fisheries, Kang Do-Hyung, has stated that, due to the global goal of eliminating emissions by 2050, many international ports are competing to build infrastructure to supply sustainable marine fuels. The Ministry and the Ulsan Port Authority have stated that they will continue to upgrade the systems related to bunkering and work on establishing standard operating procedures for the supply of methanol. Additionally, they have also confirmed that they intend to collaborate with the private sector to secure the supply of sustainable marine fuel."

Such mass flow meters not only increase the operational productivity by streamlining the supply process; they also lead to enhancing the security and integrity of the fuel supplies as fuel transfers are automatically logged. The mass flow meters to be utilized in the port have been reported to be ISO 22192-certified, which will allow for real-time decisive measurements of fuel transfers. This, in turn, is expected to lead to fewer disputes between fuel suppliers and shipowners."

The court found him guilty of assigning the second officer to the bridge despite him knowing that the officer was intoxicated and distracted while on duty. Media reports indicate that the captain will have to pay a charge and serve 200 hours of community service for avoiding jail time. The shipping company, Intrada Ships Management, was found guilty of having operated their vessel in an unsafe manner. The company was fined £180,000 ($227,000) and ordered to pay costs of £500,000 ($630,000). In addition to this, the litigation costs incurred by the company in this case have been estimated to be around £1 million ($1.3 million). The court determined that the shipping company was aware of there being only one officer on watch on the bridge of their ships, which violated regulations but failed to take action."

The facility is expected to produce 300 MW worth of hydrogen, which is then to be distributed across the filling stations throughout the UK. The plans for this green energy terminal call for the construction of a new jetty to import and export bulk liquids, and land-side processing infrastructure. The new project is being built in collaboration with Associated British Ports (ABP) and Air Products. The ammonia to be imported and converted into hydrogen is to be sourced from Air Products’ facilities in Saudi Arabia. Initial plans for the new energy terminal were submitted to the UK government by ABP in September of 2023, following which it underwent a rigorous examination involving both public and private consultations. The project was finally greenlit on 6th February. No official dates have been announced for the commencement or the completion of this project; however, the construction of the project is expected to begin in the coming months."

With the possibility of the vessel losing cargo in the upcoming storm, Herminia looming large, the decision was made to dock the vessel at a port. The vessel docked at the port of Vigo on 26th January and has been at the port ever since. It has been docked at the Transversal Pier at the port, which has been reserved for vessels with dangerous cargo and has been guarded by private security, the port police, and the civil guard. The first inspection of the ship was carried out on 1st February by an engineer from the shipping company, accompanied by the head of the port authority’s security division and representatives from the shipping company. The inspection revealed that the cargo was intact, and only the external structure of the containers had sustained damage. The shipping company has clarified that the shells had been dismantled as required by international shipping standards. They further added that they are drawing up a plan for securely transporting the containers from one hold of the vessel to another and isolating the damaged containers. Following this, specialized personnel are to arrive and shift the cargo from damaged to new containers prepared for the same purpose. The shipping company has insisted that at no point will the containers be offloaded onto the port."

Luke van Riet, NSRI Bakoven duty coxswain, said: At 04h19, Wednesday, 29 January, NSRI Bakoven and NSRI Table Bay duty crews were activated following reports of a sailing yacht running aground and listing at Clifton 4th Beach. Almost immediately after the initial report it was established that all crew and passengers on two local charter sailing yachts were safe. TNPA (Transnet National ports Authority) Table Bay Port Control were alerted. NSRI Bakoven and NSRI Table Bay dispatched rescue swimmers to Clifton 4th beach, the NSRI Bakoven rescue craft Gemini Legend and the NSRI Table Bay rescue craft DHL Deliverer were launched. On arrival on the scene one sailing yacht, with 3 crew onboard, was found aground in shallow water and listing at Clifton 4th Beach. A second sailing yacht, with 5 crew onboard, that had also drifted into shallow water, had managed to motor back out to sea and was standing off in deeper water safely at anchor. It appears that both yachts were spending the night at Clifton and during the early hours of the morning, despite calm seas, but in increasing wind speeds, both vessels had dragged anchor and gently drifted towards shore. NSRI rescue swimmers were deployed onto the vessel that was listing in shallow water. The 2 passengers, females, were transferred onto NSRI Bakoven's rescue craft and transported to the second sailing yacht, further out, where they were transferred onto the second yacht safely. Telkom Maritime Radio Services and MRCC (Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre) were notified. 2 NSRI rescue swimmers were deployed to the grounded yacht where they assisted the skipper to establish a towline from the casualty yacht to the NSRI rescue craft Gemini Legend. The NSRI rescue craft gently towed the casualty yacht further out to sea. At that stage the NSRI rescue craft DHL Deliverer was arriving on the scene. It was determined that both yachts had sustained no damage and with 2 NSRI rescue swimmers remaining onboard the recovered casualty sailing yacht, both yachts were escorted to Granger Bay, by the NSRI Table Bay DHL Deliverer, where they were both berthed at their moorings and no further assistance was required."

The CEO of this company, Alexander Kalchev, acknowledged the possibility of the vessel having severed the undersea cable but firmly denied any allegations of sabotage performed by the crew, claiming the act to be unintentional. He explained that as the vessel was passing through the region between Latvia and Gotland, where the undersea cable was severed, the ship was facing inclement weather and winds with speeds up to 25 meters per second. He claims that one of the anchors must have become dislodged and dragged across the ocean floor without the knowledge of the crew and ended up damaging the undersea cable. Swedish authorities have launched an investigation into this matter.

        "content": "_Contributing author: Dimitris Ampatzidis, Risk and Compliance Analyst at Kpler_ The **VEZHEN** ([IMO 9937270](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:7148754/mmsi:229659000/imo:9937270/vessel:VEZHEN)) incident raises familiar yet increasingly urgent questions about maritime risk, intent, and accountability. Undersea cables play a critical role in global internet connectivity and energy transmission, forming the backbone of modern communication and infrastructure. Damage to these cables can have far-reaching consequences, disrupting services and exposing vulnerabilities in maritime security. A vessel slows down, deviates from its expected course, exhibits erratic movement, and soon after, a vital undersea cable is found damaged. The sequence of events follows a now well-documented pattern—one seen with Shunxing39, YI PENG 3 or EAGLE S incidents referenced in a recent [MarineTraffic article](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/maritime-news/16/general/2025/11765/commercial-vessels-a-new-form-of-hybrid-warfare). What makes this incident particularly striking is how predictable it is when compared to previous events. The combination of vessel behavior and infrastructure damage forms a worrying pattern that continues to unfold in plain sight. **Vessel Details** The Maltese-flagged VEZHEN, a Handysize bulk carrier, was en route from the Russian port of Ust Luga, loading a cargo of sulfur. Kpler’s ownership data shows the vessel is managed by Navibulgar, a major player in Bulgarian shipping and a member of BIMCO. Whilst the registered owner is a Hong Kong registered company called Hai Kuo Shipping 2015B Limited. ![CleanShot 2025-01-27 at 12.15.01.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2025_01_27_at_12_15_01_fa263ade2d.png) **Image 1:** _On January 25, 2025, at 03:20 UTC, the vessel - a 2022-built Handysize bulker, DWT 32,196 - began reducing its speed from a usual operational speed of just above 10 knots to around 7.5 knots. This reduction continued for almost a full day until 06:50 UTC on January 26, when it resumed its normal operational speed. Just before returning to her normal speed, the vessel briefly maneuvered below 3 knots, with an AIS trajectory that shows a sharp course deviation - MarineTraffic data._ This is almost identical to what was observed in the other cable cutting incidents including YI PENG 3 and NEWNEW POLAR BEAR, where vessels slowed down or altered course before undersea cables were found damaged. The location of this low-speed maneuvering is also critical. The VEZHEN was transiting an area where a fiber-optic cable between Latvia and Sweden's Gotland was later found damaged. This mirrors what happened with EAGLE S in December 2024, when Finnish authorities later recovered its damaged anchor after the vessel had passed over the Estlink 2 cable. The consistency in how these incidents unfold raises obvious questions. **Contradicting Statements** The company issued a statement claiming that the damage was due to “unfavorable hydrometeorological conditions.” (source: https://www.navbul.com/ ) However, based on MarineTraffic data, our weather data partner and AIS tracking analysis, the conditions encountered by the ship were calm to moderate, well within the normal range for the Baltic Sea during winter. - **Waves and Swells:** The ship encountered moderate swells, with periods ranging from 2.7 to 4.7 seconds and heights generally below 1 meter. This is typical for the Baltic Sea, which has smaller swells compared to open oceans due to its shallow waters. - **Wind:** Wind speeds peaked at 16 knots and decreased to 2 knots at times. These are typical conditions for the Baltic in January, with stronger winds being more notable during major storms—something not observed in this instance. - **Currents:** Current speeds ranged between 0.01 to 0.23 knots, primarily from the east to southeast. These mild currents are characteristic of the Baltic Sea. Then there’s the mechanical evidence. Photos from the scene show the ship’s anchor was broken—another element that ties this case to others (source: Reuters - [Swedish authorities board ship seized over Baltic Sea cable breach](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swedish-authorities-board-ship-seized-over-baltic-sea-cable-breach-2025-01-27/)). The same was reported for NEWNEW POLA BEAR (source: ERR - [Photo: Chinese ship that crossed gas pipeline is missing anchor](https://news.err.ee/1609143092/photo-chinese-ship-that-crossed-gas-pipeline-is-missing-anchor)) after the Baltic connector pipeline incident and YI PENG 3 when it severed Sweden-Lithuania’s undersea cables (source: The Maritime Executive - [Suspected Sabotage Ship's Anchor Shows Signs of Extreme Damage](https://maritime-executive.com/article/suspected-sabotage-ship-s-anchor-shows-signs-of-extreme-damage)). Ships do not randomly drop or drag their anchors in these areas, let alone repeatedly break them under similar circumstances. **At what point do we stop treating these as isolated maritime mishaps?** The combination of speed reductions, erratic course deviations, known infrastructure damage, and physical anchor evidence follows a pattern too clear to ignore. While the specific causes behind each event may vary, the sequence of actions is almost identical."

The vessel carrying approximately 99,000 tons of oil, became unmaneuverable on 10th January, at around 12:30 PM local time. ![EVENTIN adrift in Baltic sea.](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/EVENTIN_1142b8fe6e.png)*Vessel EVENTIN, image credit:havariekommando.de* The Warnemunde Traffic Control Center requested Germany's Central Command for Maritime Emergencies to take charge of the situation. Promptly, multi-purpose vessel Arkona of Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration and the emergency tug Bremen Fighter were dispatched to assist the distressed vessel. Due to inclement weather, including winds of 7 Beaufort scale and waves of 2.5 meters, the rescue operation became unmanageable. Additional tugs VB Bremen and VB Luca joined the operation, and a specialized towing team of four individuals was deployed via a federal police helicopter. At around 10:50 PM local time, the towing team boarded the oil tanker and established a connection between the tanker and the tug VB Bremen. VB Luca was able to establish a connection to the stern of the vessel, and Bremen Fighter maintained a connection at the bow of the vessel. Subsequently, the three tugs successfully held the oil tanker about eight nautical miles north of Rugen. The towing convoy began relocating northeast of Cape Arkona in response to the increasingly northerly wind in the sea area. This safer position provides more open sea space to prevent [EVENTIN](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:373974/mmsi:352001758/imo:9308065/vessel:EVENTIN#overview) from drifting. The vessel is to be held at this position till the winds subside. Inspections of the vessel are being carried out periodically via a sensor aircraft and so far there has been no leaks or pollution detected from the vessel.

        "author": "Alex Stuart-Grumbar",
        "content": "On Christmas Day, the Estlink 2 power cable, a critical link between Finland and Estonia, was severed in an incident that has raised alarm across the Baltic Sea region. Just over a week later, on January 3rd, 2025, a Taiwanese communications cable was damaged in a similar fashion, this time in the Pacific. In both cases, authorities have pointed to old, Chinese-owned vessels as the primary suspects, with evidence suggesting the damage was caused by ships dragging their anchors. The events of late 2024 and early 2025 are not isolated but rather part of a larger, alarming pattern of incidents involving commercial vessels causing damage to critical undersea infrastructure. Submarine cables are critical components of global infrastructure, serving as the backbone for communication and energy transfer. They are particularly attractive targets in hybrid warfare due to their strategic importance. Submarine communication cables, handle over 95% of global internet traffic and undersea power cables play a key role in energy security, particularly in areas such as the Baltic, where countries rely heavily on cross-border power transmission. These incidents carry significant geopolitical implications, with the vessels involved linked to countries like China and Russia, both of which are expected by many commentators to be increasingly engaged in hybrid warfare tactics. The timing of these events is particularly notable from a geopolitical perspective. In the Baltic, it coincides with several Baltic states' decision to sever ties with the Russian electricity grid and integrate into the continental European energy system in February 2025. Meanwhile, Chinese Premier Xi Jinping’s New Year’s Day declaration reaffirming that China’s reunification with Taiwan is inevitable further underscores the political tensions at play. To understand the scope of this issue, here are the most prominent incidents of recent years with cable damage linked to commercial ships: Shunxing39 (3rd January 2025) The Shunxing39, a cargo ship flagged in Cameroon though owned by Jie Yang Trading Limited, a company registered in Hong Kong. The vessel is widely accused of severing a subsea communications cable part of the Trans-Pacific Express Cable System connecting Taiwan to the US west coast. Tracking data indicated the vessel dragged its anchor at the cable’s location. The vessel has since gone 'dark,' with MarineTraffic receiving no AIS signal from the vessel since the damage occurred on January 3rd. ![CleanShot 2025-01-10 at 14.58.25@2x.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Clean_Shot_2025_01_10_at_14_58_25_2x_2bd03b5b19.png) Source: Marine Traffic - The authorities now suspect that the vessel was operating under two different AIS devices and identities: its real name, Shunxing39, and a nearly identical fake name, Xingshun39. By alternating between these identities, the ship managed to create a fragmented AIS track. The Shunxing39 was out of signal at 08:49 UTC on the 3rd January, only for Xingshun39 to reappear 09.59 UTC at a location only around 10kms away. ![unnamed (1).png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/unnamed_1_ed5daf85f1.png) ![unnamed.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/unnamed_86d0612560.png) Source: MarineTraffic - the vessel Shunxing39 has been suspiciously drifting for over a month around Taiwan's north coast without loading or discharging cargo, this being far from usual for this type of vessel. **Eagle S (25th December 2024)** On Christmas Day 2024, the Eagle S, a tanker part of Russia’s ‘grey fleet*’, was detained by Finnish authorities in the Gulf of Finland. The ship is believed to have damaged both power and data cables, including the crucial Estlink 2, which links Finland and Estonia. Authorities found anchor drag marks over a distance of “dozens of kilometers” on the seafloor. ![unnamed (2).png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/unnamed_2_c5d4df65c9.png) Source: The activities of the Eagle S, have been flagged by the [Kpler’s Risk & Compliance](https://www.kpler.com/product/commodities/risk-and-compliance) tool for transporting of sanctioned cargo. **Yi Peng 3 (15th November 2024)** A month before the Eagle S incident, the Yi Peng 3, a Chinese bulk carrier, was investigated for severing two key data cables that link Sweden, Lithuania, Finland, and Germany. Investigators believe the crew deliberately dragged the ship’s anchor for approximately 100 nautical miles, cutting across vital communication and energy transmission lines. Owned by Ningbo Yipeng Shipping, the vessel had departed from Ust-Luga, Russia, carrying fertiliser. Chinese government officials refused to let a Swedish prosecutor board to inspect the vessel and question the crew with the vessel now well on the way to the Port of Fangcheng in China. ![unnamed (3).png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/unnamed_3_40ecfe0590.png) Source: Marine Traffic’s ‘Past Track’ feature shows the Yi Peng 3 already through the Suez Canal on her way to Fengcheng (ETA 29/01/2025) to discharge fertiliser cargo. **NewNew Polar Bear (25th October 2023)** In October 2023, the Chinese owned and Hong Kong flagged container ship NewNew Polar Bear was suspected of dragging its anchor across a gas pipeline and undersea cables in the Baltic. After the damage, the ship promptly continued its voyage along the Norwegian coast towards Russia's Arctic region, leaving behind a trail of damage to vital infrastructure. Chinese authorities conducted an investigation and reported the vessel did cause the damage but as a result of a strong storm. The vessel has since been trading between Russia and China. ![unnamed (4).png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/unnamed_4_292e0cd3d4.png) Source: Marine Traffic’s ‘Past Track’ feature shows the NewNew Polar Bear trading just in between Russia and China since the incident in Oct 2023. **Common Traits** The ships implicated in these incidents exhibit several recurring traits that suggest their deliberate use in hybrid operations. These vessels are typically older, ranging from 19 to 24 years, and nearing the end of their operational lifespans. These vessels are flagged under nations with lenient regulations, offering a level of oversight that makes enforcement difficult. Their ownership structures are equally concerning: three of the vessels—Shunxing39, NewNew Polar Bear, and Yi Peng 3—are tied to Chinese companies with opaque corporate setups, while the Eagle S is linked to a UAE-based firm with its registered address in a luxury Dubai hotel. These cases underscore a worrying pattern, commercial vessels seemingly being deployed for covert espionage, sabotage, and broader geopolitical ends. Finnish President Alexander Stubb remarked on the frequency of these occurrences, emphasising that they “cannot all be a coincidence or an accident.” Operationally, MarineTraffic shows these vessels behaving erratically, including extended periods of drifting, slower than usual speeds, and inconsistent routing. **Why Commercial Ships?** One major factor lies in the legal complexities surrounding maritime enforcement under international law. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) severely limits the ability of coastal states to act against vessels suspected of damaging undersea infrastructure. Criminal jurisdiction is restricted to cases where the offending ship is flying the flag of the coastal state or the damage is caused by one of its nationals. Beyond territorial waters, even interventions under the 1884 Paris Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables are limited to boarding and questioning the crew, without provisions for detention or meaningful enforcement. This legal ambiguity makes old commercial ships, approaching the end of their life with opaque ownership structures, an appealing choice for hybrid warfare. Their routine presence in international waters, coupled with the difficulty of proving deliberate intent, provides a layer of plausible deniability. Furthermore, the absence of safety zones around submarine cables and pipelines in Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) exacerbates the issue. While some nations have experimented with domestic laws to extend protections in their EEZs, these measures remain contentious and are not universally adopted. This enforcement gap allows malicious actors to exploit the vulnerabilities of critical maritime infrastructure with minimal risk of detection or accountability. **A Wake-Up Call for Maritime Security** The detention of the Eagle S marks the first successful intervention by a Baltic Sea coastal state in response to a suspected deliberate attack on critical offshore infrastructure located beyond territorial waters. Unlike the Eagle S, the NewNew Polar Bear, Yi Peng 3, and Shunxing39 all managed to evade authorities. This highlights the stark enforcement gaps that continue to exist in the maritime domain, particularly when it comes to investigating and addressing such covert attacks on critical infrastructure. These incidents underscore a critical vulnerability in global infrastructure networks, especially undersea cables and pipelines, which are essential for energy transmission and communication. Whether due to negligence or deliberate actions, the damage caused by anchor dragging to these vital systems can lead to substantial and far-reaching disruption. The fact that these vessels, many linked to geopolitical adversaries, can operate with relative impunity—evading detection, legal action, and timely intervention—reveals deep weaknesses in both international maritime law and enforcement practices. It is clear that this growing pattern of damage poses a significant threat to national security and economic stability, signaling a pressing need for enhanced vigilance, stronger international cooperation, and more effective maritime security measures. **Tracking and Monitoring: A New Era of Detection** The rise in these incidents points to an urgent need for enhanced maritime security and international cooperation and underscores the importance of leveraging advanced fleet tracking technology combined with Risk & Compliance tools. Authorities can use AIS (Automatic Identification System) data to protect critical maritime infrastructure from emerging threats. These tools enable the creation of customisable notifications tailored to customisable areas or specific scenarios, such as unauthorised entry into sensitive zones near submarine cables or erratic vessel behaviour indicative of anchor dragging. By delivering real-time updates, these alerts provide maritime authorities or compliance teams with the actionable intelligence necessary to respond swiftly to potential risks. Beyond customisable notifications, Marine Traffic’s utility in maritime security is enhanced by Kpler’s Risk & Compliance tools. These tools allow for detailed evaluations of a vessel’s operational history, highlighting patterns of regulatory violations or affiliations with flagged entities. Such insights enable proactive risk mitigation by identifying high-risk vessels before incidents occur. The combination of AIS tracking and compliance intelligence offers an invaluable toolset for monitoring and addressing suspicious activity in a timely manner."

However, one of the major points of contention between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) was job protection from automation in ports. As a solution, a framework is being established that aims at creating more jobs while still continuing the modernization of ports. It is also anticipated that the new contract will carry over the terms of the labor wage increase that was agreed upon in the interim contract of October 2024. Both sides have agreed to temporarily operate on the current contract till all of the USMX members ratify the new contract. The new agreement is being lauded as a win-win situation that secures jobs for the ILA while supporting American consumers and businesses by ensuring the ports are capable of handling greater demand."

        "content": "As global sanctions frameworks continue to evolve, maritime stakeholders must adapt to the changing regulatory landscapes. This update highlights the key sanctions developments from January 2025, offering insights into emerging risks and compliance strategies. **Key Takeaways** - The **U.S. intensified sanctions on Russia and Cuba**, revoking General License 93 and issuing eight new Russia-related General Licenses (GLs), including GL 8L and GL 115A. - **A total of 183 vessels linked to Russian and Iranian oil shipments were designated**, with a focus on AIS manipulation and ship-to-ship (STS) transfers. - Russian maritime insurers **Ingosstrakh and Alfastrakhovanie were sanctioned**, along with nearly 80 entities in Russia’s LNG sector and over 30 oilfield service providers. - The **Cuba Restricted List was reinstated**, targeting entities tied to Cuba’s military and intelligence sectors. - These measures signal heightened scrutiny on maritime compliance, insurance, and shipping practices. **Market Analysis** In January 2025, U.S. sanctions policy took a decisive turn, significantly impacting maritime operations and global energy markets. The revocation of General License 93, which previously permitted transactions involving Sovcomflot vessels, underscores a strategic shift aimed at curbing Russia’s maritime influence. Concurrently, OFAC issued eight new Russia-related General Licenses, including GL 8L and GL 115A, to adjust compliance pathways ([OFAC, 2025](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20250110)). A total of 183 vessels, predominantly oil tankers linked to Russian and Iranian crude shipments, were designated due to their involvement in deceptive practices such as AIS manipulation and clandestine STS transfers ([U.S. Treasury, 2025](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2777)). This marks a clear regulatory focus on “shadow fleet” operations that have become instrumental in circumventing sanctions. Notably, Russian maritime insurers Ingosstrakh and Alfastrakhovanie were also blacklisted, intensifying risks for shipping companies reliant on these providers. This demonstrates a holistic regulatory approach, targeting not only vessels but also ownership structures, insurance providers, and smaller support vessels that facilitate operations for refineries and larger ships.\" The U.S. State Department expanded its sanctions scope, targeting nearly 80 entities associated with Russia’s LNG sector, including Arctic LNG 2 and officials from Rosatom ([U.S. Treasury, 2025](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2777)). Additionally, over 30 Russia-based oilfield service companies faced restrictions, directly impacting crude production and LNG export operations. The reinstatement of the Cuba Restricted List further complicates maritime logistics, particularly for entities engaged with Cuba’s military-linked enterprises ([U.S. State Department, 2025](https://www.state.gov/restoring-a-tough-u-s-cuba-policy/)). **Implications for the Shipping Industry** These sanctions impose immediate and complex challenges for maritime stakeholders. The designation of 183 vessels demands enhanced due diligence and real-time vessel tracking to mitigate the risk of inadvertent sanctions breaches. Compliance teams must swiftly update screening tools to reflect the revocation of GL 93 and adjust risk assessments for entities like Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, and sanctioned insurers. Shipping companies face increased scrutiny in chartering, insurance, and supply chain operations, particularly along routes involving Russia, Iran, and Cuba. The heightened focus on deceptive shipping practices necessitates investment in advanced monitoring technologies and robust compliance frameworks. Additionally, insurers must reassess coverage policies, given the sanctions against key Russian providers, potentially leading to higher premiums and limited coverage options. ![Picture1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture1_9d9165648e.png) **Graph 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the last five years (January 2020 to January 2025) - Kpler._ The intensification of sanctions enforcement is evident in the sharp rise in the number of sanctioned vessels and companies over the past five years. Between January 2020 and January 2025, the number of sanctioned vessels surged from approximately 380 to nearly 1,200, marking an increase of over 215%. A particularly notable acceleration occurred between mid-2022 and early 2023, where the number of sanctioned vessels jumped by roughly 200 units - a clear reflection of evolving geopolitical tensions and regulatory responses. Similarly, the number of sanctioned companies grew from around 160 in early 2020 to over 500 by January 2025, representing a 213% increase. This parallel growth in sanctioned entities underscores the expanding scope of enforcement actions, with the most pronounced spike observed in the final months of 2024, coinciding with the latest U.S. sanctions targeting Russian and Cuban-linked entities. ![Picture2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture2_5534abee53.png) **Graph 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the last three years (January 2022 to January 2025) - Kpler._ The evolving sanctions landscape is clearly reflected in the growth of sanctioned vessels across the top 10 flag registries from January 2022 to January 2025. Over this three-year period, the total number of sanctioned vessels increased from approximately 180 to nearly 600, representing a staggering growth of over 230%. Russia and Iran continue to dominate the list, with Russia’s share rising sharply from around 50 vessels in early 2022 to more than 200 by January 2025, indicating a fourfold increase. Similarly, Iran’s sanctioned fleet remained consistently high, maintaining a substantial baseline throughout the period. Notably, Panama, Curacao, and Guyana have experienced significant upticks, with Panama’s sanctioned vessels growing from less than 20 in 2022 to over 80 by early 2025 - a 300% surge. Flags such as Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe, and Barbados, which had minimal presence in early 2022, show exponential increases, particularly from mid-2023 onwards. This trend suggests a regulatory pivot towards targeting vessels registered under flags of convenience—registrations in countries with lenient regulations, lower operating costs, or minimal enforcement standards, often used to obscure beneficial ownership and facilitate sanctions evasion. The sharpest increase occurred in the final quarter of 2024, where the total number of sanctioned vessels jumped by over 40% within just three months, underscoring the aggressive escalation in enforcement actions tied to recent geopolitical developments and regulatory shifts. ![Picture3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture3_2352353b7b.png) **Graph 3.** _Total vessels and companies added to sanctions lists over the last twelve months (February 2024 to January 2025) - Kpler._ The enforcement momentum peaked dramatically over the last 12 months, with January 2025 alone witnessing the addition of 183 vessels and 58 companies to sanctions lists - representing month-on-month increases of 375% and 120%, respectively, compared to December 2024. This explosive growth aligns with the revocation of General License 93 and the imposition of new restrictions on Russian maritime insurers and energy-linked entities. The final quarter of 2024 also shows consistent monthly additions, averaging around 50 vessels and 20 companies, highlighting an aggressive escalation in enforcement actions. This surge underscores the need for maritime stakeholders to rapidly adapt compliance frameworks, as the sanctions landscape becomes increasingly dynamic and expansive. **Conclusion** Proactive compliance is essential in navigating the evolving sanctions landscape, where enforcement actions have surged dramatically—evidenced by a 215% increase in sanctioned vessels and over 200% growth in sanctioned companies since 2020. With regulatory focus expanding to cover deceptive shipping practices, diverse flag registries, and entities tied to high-risk jurisdictions like Russia and Iran, staying ahead requires more than reactive measures. Industry professionals must remain vigilant, continuously monitoring regulatory updates, adapting compliance frameworks, and leveraging real-time data to detect emerging risks. In this dynamic environment, informed, agile compliance strategies are not just a regulatory requirement—they are critical for safeguarding operations and maintaining business continuity. _To find out more about Kpler’s Risk & Compliance offering, visit [here](https://www.kpler.com/demos/risk-compliance-demo?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=risk&compliance_commodities_maritime_news_demo_request)._"

The search by the agents yielded around 76 tonnes of contraband cigarettes retrieved from 5 containers in the vessel. The contraband has been estimated to have a value of $35 million. The Australian Border Force (ABF) has stated that the investigation and surveillance of the vessel had been ongoing for a while and that they were monitoring the suspicious route of the vessel near the Australian coast. Along with the contraband, two speedboats were also found to be stowed aboard the cargo vessel. The speedboats were found to be fitted with four 300-horsepower outboard motors. Customs authorities have clarified that this arrangement is typical for boats used in smuggling operations. Around 10,000 liters of gasoline were also found to be on the cargo vessel, presumably to fuel the speedboats. Customs agents believe that the vessel [KOKOO](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:700511/mmsi:677054900/imo:9114074/vessel:JING_SHENG) probably served as a mother ship to smuggle cigarettes, with the final leg of the delivery being made using the speedboats. Authorities have also stated that the sophistication of the operation leads them to believe in the involvement of organized crime. On 7th February, the captain of the vessel was presented in a criminal court in Noumea and was sentenced to 10 months in prison and a fine of $350,000."

The St. Kitts and Nevis-flagged tugboat, Salvage Rigger, headed to the distressed vessel at 8:00 AM local time on 5th January, and it is expected to arrive at the Port of Kaohsiung with the [PANORIA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:213733/mmsi:538008112/imo:9480930/vessel:PANORIA) in tow by 6th January."

A claim was made by the ship Chandler MH Bland SL, which stated that the vessel had failed to pay dues amounting to Rs. 15,56,100 ($18,143) for supplies and provisions provided to the vessel. Despite the vessel's arrest on the 30th, they released it the next day, subject to the vessel clearing its dues. The amount is to be held by the court in an interest-bearing account till a final resolution for the litigation is reached. If the judgment goes in the favor of MH Bland SL, they would receive the amount with interest; if not, the funds would be returned to the Propel Fortune. The case is set to be reviewed further on 6th January."

The cargo, which shipped from the Russian port of Kandalaksha on 22nd August, arrived in January. ![RUBY ](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/RUBY_aa237f4b05.png)*Vessel RUBY, image credit: Malcolm Cranfield* The dangerous cargo was initially loaded on the vessel [RUBY](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:1605/mmsi:229041000/imo:9626390/vessel:RUBY#overview), which unfortunately ran aground due to inclement weather, causing damage to the vessel’s hull and propeller. The vessel, however, was still able to sail and arrived for repairs at the port of Tromso, where it caused the first controversy due to the sheer amount of explosives that was onboard the vessel. Ammonium nitrate is the same chemical that was the cause of the infamous Beirut explosion in 2020. For context, the Beirut explosion, which is considered to be the largest non-nuclear blast in history, was caused by around 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, which is a fraction of the cargo of 20,000 tons being hauled on the [RUBY]( https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:1605/mmsi:229041000/imo:9626390/vessel:RUBY#overview). The vessel was sent away and subsequently denied entry to ports in Norway, Lithuania, and Sweden due to the dangerous nature of its cargo. A shipyard in Lithuania was supposed to offer repairs to the vessel, but the authorities prohibited it from entering until the explosive cargo was removed. Later, the vessel was allowed to dock at the port of Great Yarmouth in the UK. While the vessel was docked in the UK, the ammonium nitrate aboard the vessel was reported to be contaminated with the ship’s fuel and seawater due to the grounding of the vessel. Thus decreasing the stability of the explosive and making it more dangerous. This contaminated cargo, which weighed around 300 tons, was then dumped into the ocean after discussions with relevant authorities in the UK at a site that offered the lowest possible environmental impact. This sparked local outrage and environmental concerns. The remaining cargo was then transferred to another vessel, the [ZIMRIDA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:458238/mmsi:314458000/imo:9380817/vessel:ZIMRIDA).

Finnish authorities have classified the incident as a suspected case of \"aggravated criminal mischief\" and authorities estimate the cable may take up to seven months to repair. The investigation into the incident centers on the [Eagle S](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:712379/mmsi:518998865/imo:9329760/vessel:EAGLE_S), a commercial shipping vessel. Authorities suspect the Eagle S caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed. The Eagle S has been detained by Finnish police and coast guard officials, escorted by the Finnish Border Guard’s patrol vessel Turva, and is now anchored 20km off Porkkalaniemi in Finnish territorial waters with a 3-kilometre no-fly zone imposed. This incident raises concerns over the growing use of commercial vessels for sabotage and espionage. <br> </br> **Location of the Estlink2 power cable** ![image2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image2_ccc06f9449.png) Source: [Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estlink#/map/1) <br> </br> The investigation suggests that the Eagle S (IMO 9329760) played a critical role in the sabotage of the Estlink 2 power cable, given its suspicious movements before and after the damage occurred. Below is the timeline of the vessel’s actions: 10:16-11:10 UTC: Eagle S slows from 10.3 knots to 7.6 knots, a significantly slower speed than typical for this type of vessel in these weather conditions. 11:10-12:34 UTC: The vessel further decelerates and begins to drift, indicating potential issues or intentional disruption. Investigators have identified a \"dragging track\" thought to have been made by the anchor which detectives say is ‘’dozens of kilometers in length’’, which matches with the distance the ship travelled at speeds well below the usual minimum economical sailing speed. **Eagle S movements 25 December 2024** ![image3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image3_5319b376df.png) !Source: MarineTraffic - shows the track the vessel took as she slowed down around the area where the underwater cables lie.! <br> </br> The Eagle S is owned and operated by Caravella LLCFZ, a UAE-based company, whose office is in a business centre of a luxury hotel in Dubai, and is registered in the Cook Islands. The ship has a Deadweight Tonnage (DWT) of 74,034 and a Length Overall (LOA) of 228.6 meters. It was previously named NORSTAR INTREPID before being renamed on 22 July, 2023. In 2024, the vessel only transported Russian cargoes including gas oil, naphtha and gasoline. The Kpler terminal shows that on her current voyage she was carrying gas oil and naphtha from Ust Luga and St. Petersburg, with the vessel due to discharge in India. <br> </br> **Ship-to-Ship (STS) Transfers** <br> </br> Over the past 24 months, Kpler data shows the Eagle S has been involved in several high-risk STS transfers at locations including Malta Lightering area and Augusta Lightering area (see chart.) In 2024 the Eagle S only transported Russian cargoes, and has been identified as part of the Russian ‘grey fleet,’ a group of vessels reportedly used by Russia to evade shipping sanctions through deceptive practices..

        "content": "**Overview** On **December 16th, 2024**, the European Union published its 15th package of sanctions ([EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202403192)), with enforcement starting on December 17th. A key provision of this package targets **52 vessels** identified for breaching or circumventing sanctions, particularly through the transportation of restricted cargo such as crude oil and refined petroleum products. This move reflects the EU’s intensified efforts to address illicit maritime activities and uphold international compliance standards. By utilising advanced satellite imagery, artificial intelligence, and human intelligence, we have identified critical trends in how vessel operators exploit AIS systems, capitalise on operational gaps, and conduct covert cargo transfers to obscure their movements. Current data highlights persistent risks in key zones such as Ust-Luga, Primorsk, and Nakhodka, which are primary sources of restricted cargo. ![Image 17-12-24 at 1.59 PM.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Image_17_12_24_at_1_59_PM_2a14f10c48.jpg) **Image 1.** _Positions of the EU sanctioned vessels as of 17th of December, 2024 12.00 UTC - Kpler._ **Cargo Movements Linked to Sanctioned Zones** Analysis of multiple vessels revealed recurring patterns linking cargo movements to high risk ports. This includes the transport of crude oil, fuel oil, and gasoil from Russian ports such as Ust-Luga, Primorsk, and Nakhodka. Key Observations: - Urals crude and fuel oil frequently feature in cargo reports, aligning with sanctions from OFAC, OFSI, and the EU. - Extended voyages flagged for risk detection between July and October 2024 often involved high-value commodities, including LNG and ESPO crude. **Dark Ship-to-Ship Transfers** Dark STS transfers—conducted with AIS systems deliberately disabled—remain a significant area of concern. Using satellite imagery, AI, and human intelligence, we identified notable instances of such clandestine activity: - **Mianzimu**: Detected engaging in a dark STS transfer with the vessel Koala on June 1, 2024, in the Ukrainian EEZ. - **Pioneer**: Demonstrated prolonged AIS gaps and dark STS events which attracted our interest previously ([Kpler LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kpler_lng-kpler-activity-7233789053966458880-_hsd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop); [Seven LNG tankers caught in a new wave of US sanctions](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/maritime-news/16/general/2024/11445/seven-lng-tankers-caught-in-a-new-wave-of-us-sanctions); [US sanctions two LNG vessels, ratcheting up pressure on Russia’s Arctiv LNG 2 project](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/maritime-news/15/maritime-security/2024/11473/us-sanctions-two-lng-vessels-ratcheting-up-pressure-on-russi)). - **Alissa** and **Christophe De Margerie** displayed high-risk transfer patterns, such as AIS gaps and STS transfers, in regions like Kalamata, Kerch, and Murmansk. **AIS Spoofing: Masking Real Movements** AIS spoofing, a tactic involving the falsification of vessel locations, was detected through satellite monitoring and machine learning: - **Pioneer**: Noted for spoofing events between Egypt and the Barents Sea, likely to obscure actual cargo origins. - **Georgy Maslov** and **Siri**: Spoofing events, paired with suspicious draught changes, suggest deliberate efforts to avoid detection during high-risk or dark STS operations. **AIS Gaps as a Risk Indicator** Persistent AIS signal gaps often coincide with operations in sensitive zones: - **Duration**: Gaps ranged from one day to over two years, as observed with vessels such as Pioneer and Alissa. - **Notable Areas**: 1. **Oman to India**: Draught reductions during these gaps indicate unloading activities. 2. **Ukraine**: Notable draught shifts align with STS transfer activities. **Conclusion** Patterns of cargo flows, dark STS transfers, and AIS spoofing illustrate increasingly sophisticated methods for sanctions evasion. Leveraging satellite imagery, AI, and human intelligence, we are now better equipped to track and analyse these anomalies. However, the ongoing evolution of these tactics underscores the need for heightened vigilance and advanced detection tools.

This latest package has brought the total number of vessels sanctioned by the EU to 79. The majority of these tankers are non-EU vessels that are involved in the transport of Russian oil and in transporting arms for the Russian military. The sanctions package also targets a total of 54 individuals and 30 entities that are deemed to be bolstering Russia’s war effort. Among them, there are also entities and individuals in China and North Korea who have been deemed to be supplying Russia with dual-use materials to support Russia’s military efforts. Two senior North Korean officials and seven Chinese individuals and companies have been targeted in the latest sanctions. The purpose of the sanctions has been defined to increase the operational costs for Russia by banning them from ports in the EU and hindering them from receiving maritime services.

The fire led to significant production of smoke, and emergency services were quickly alerted to the fire. By 6:00 AM, the firefighters and the water police brought the fire under control, but they did not fully extinguish it. However, the situation was resolved with intense efforts from the firefighters with measures such as cooling the hull from the outside due to the intense heat. The fire alarm and the emergency systems aboard the vessel worked without a hitch, and all 149 passengers and 42 crewmembers were evacuated successfully. Buses were arranged for the passengers for their return journey, and they departed by around 10:00 AM. The cause of the fire is yet unknown, and an investigation has been opened into the matter."

        "content": "**Overview** November 2024 saw robust enforcement actions from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the UK's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), adding 29 vessels and 9 companies to international sanctions rosters. These measures heightened scrutiny on high-risk vessels accused of engaging in deceptive practices, signaling a continued clampdown on non-compliance across global maritime networks. Over the year leading up to November 2024, international sanctions targeting the maritime industry surged significantly, with 261 additional vessels and 98 companies listed between December 2023 and November 2024. The most notable increases were recorded among vessels flagged by Barbados (35), Russia (33), Panama (28), and Guinea (19), highlighting the broad geographical impact of these efforts. This sustained enforcement underscores the growing determination of regulatory bodies to curtail illicit activities and enhance transparency in global shipping operations. **Main Updates** November 2024 saw critical developments in sanctions impacting the maritime and shipping sectors, driven primarily by geopolitical and strategic considerations. These measures highlighted the evolving dynamics of global trade enforcement. On November 25, the United Kingdom targeted Russia's 'shadow fleet' with its most expansive sanctions package to date ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/britain-imposes-biggest-sanctions-package-russian-shadow-fleet-says-lammy-2024-11-25/)). Thirty vessels allegedly circumventing restrictions on Russian oil exports were sanctioned, increasing the total number of affected tankers to 73. These measures also extended to Russian insurers AlfaStrakhovanie and VSK, challenging the validity of their coverage for vessels in UK waters. A week earlier, on November 18, the UK expanded its scope by sanctioning Iran for supplying ballistic missiles to Russia ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/uk-iran-sanctions-supplying-russia-missiles-2a4b06b76b1157678e7b12b02c6ad2c3)). This move included asset freezes on Iranian state entities and the Russian cargo ship Port Olya-3, highlighting concerns about the escalating conflict in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission launched an investigation into reports that Spain denied port access to the U.S.-flagged vessels carrying military equipment to Israel ([Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fmc-investigating-spain-alleged-blocking-183845165.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE7vAJ9nzqJ4M4YdhrpZyzKqgi8xMMwrAazRJrBUrOk-ZJOVAhwbsThJbViCwiHcdOk884wynQRmx052bKvCcORvuVOLsIfUFkDApZVTI5NPC2HWPrqUkM8T1jGLFHAH3o-EFAN6VaAkBdj3ZEcpdIHX4kIJFvZ1pmYIOCW062z9)). These actions, allegedly taken to prevent an arms escalation in the Middle East, reflect rising tensions over the use of shipping routes for strategic purposes. These sanctions highlight a month of intensified scrutiny and enforcement in maritime trade, with significant implications for vessel operators, insurers, and global commodity flows. **Analysis of Sanctioned Vessels and Companies** ![Graph1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Graph1_0c0f474233.png) **Graph 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the years - Kpler._ ![Graph2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Graph2_a988003db1.png) **Graph 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the years - Kpler._ Sanctions targeting vessels and companies within the maritime sector have seen a steady increase, reflecting heightened regulatory oversight aimed at mitigating risks in global shipping. Recent data highlights a notable diversification in the geographic distribution of sanctioned vessels, with some flag registries experiencing significant growth in 2024. In November 2024, enforcement actions added 29 vessels and 9 companies to international sanctions rosters, representing a continued effort to address high-risk maritime activities. Compared to October 2024, notable increases were observed among vessels flagged by Panama (10), Gabon (5), Russia (4), and Barbados (4). These monthly shifts illustrate the dynamic nature of enforcement priorities and the adaptive strategies employed by regulators to monitor compliance. Registries with the most significant annual growth include Barbados, Russia, Panama, and Guinea, collectively reflecting the evolving global landscape of maritime oversight. By expanding enforcement to encompass a diverse group of flag states, authorities aim to ensure accountability and compliance across the international shipping ecosystem, supporting a more secure and transparent maritime environment. Examining pre-sanction behaviours offers vital insights into the nuances of maritime risk management and underscores the importance of diligent oversight in mitigating compliance challenges. **Risk & Compliance findings before the November 2024 sanctions** Recent enforcement by OFAC and OFSI highlights the growing focus on shadow fleet activities. The Aframax-class vessel LELIA (IMO 9258870) exemplifies this trend, showcasing numerous sanction risks: - **Cargo Connections:** Since 2022, LELIA has been linked to at least one Iranian transfer (South Pars Co.) and several Russian ESPO shipments. These transactions are subject to strict regulatory scrutiny. - **AIS Activity:** Significant gaps in AIS signals were recorded twice—22 hours near the Philippines in 2023 and 29 hours near South Korea in 2024—indicating potential evasion tactics. - **High-Risk Operations:** LELIA participated in numerous ship-to-ship (STS) transfers at Kalamata Light and other zones, involving restricted or sanctioned vessels and cargo, with frequent instances of questionable AIS behavior. ![Image1.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Image1_0d488a4813.jpg) **Image 1.** _LELIA risks - Kpler._ ![Image2.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Image2_70564626eb.jpg) **Image 2.** _LELIA connections to Iranian and Russian cargo - Kpler._ LELIA's management risks stemmed from operational and structural vulnerabilities: - **Insurance Termination:** Britannia Steam Ship Insurance withdrew coverage by early 2024, leaving the vessel uninsured during high-risk periods. - **Classification Downgrade:** Bureau Veritas discontinued classification services post-sanction. - **Ownership Links:** The vessel's technical and ISM manager, Salina Ship Management, faced direct OFAC sanctions in 2024. ![Image3.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Image3_0c1ed22dd4.jpg) **Image 3.** _LELIA lack of coverage from an IGP&I member - Kpler._ Kpler’s proprietary insights highlighted several critical operational risks: - **STS Transfers:** One \"dark\" STS transfer was documented in March 2022 near Malaysia. LELIA's AIS was off, confirmed later via satellite imagery. - **High-Risk Port Calls:** In mid-2024, LELIA docked at Assaluyeh, Iran,, a high-risk port associated with sanctioned cargo movements. ![Image4.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Image4_02bc1b8ac8.jpg) **Image 4.** _LELIA operational risks overview - Kpler._ ![Image5.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Image5_24d89a407d.jpg) **Image 5.** _LELIA dark STS transfer - Kpler._ LELIA's pre-sanction activities underscore a broader trend where ship tracking and compliance solutions play a vital role in mitigating risks.

The bow of the tanker sank, while the stern remained afloat for a while longer before succumbing to the storm. The ship is reported to have been carrying 4,300 tons of low-grade biofuel. The vessel was reported to have 15 crew members on board, of which 12 have been rescued. Of these rescued individuals, two have been reported to be in serious medical condition. One sailor tragically lost his life in the incident, and two are still missing. The breaking apart of a vessel typically causes large quantities of cargo to get released quickly. While there are no detailed reports of environmental damage available yet, an oil spill from the vessel has been confirmed. President Vladimir Putin himself has sanctioned a working group to coordinate efforts to rescue sailors and mitigate environmental damage. The Russian Authorities have initiated a criminal investigation into the incident, spurred on by the fact that no plausible immediate explanations were given for such serious damage to the vessel. The vessel is considerably old and was built in 1969. There have been a considerable number of similar maritime disasters that involved aging vessels that could not operate in challenging environments. Incidentally, another vessel from the same operator, the [VOLGONEFT 239](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:348458/mmsi:273354600/imo:0/vessel:VOLGONEFT_239#overview), suffered damage and became adrift in the storm, eventually running aground. It was determined that the crew of 14 aboard the vessel were not in immediate danger and were left aboard the vessel till the storm subsided."

This service will allow for timely and reliable cargo delivery. The scheme is also heavily incentivizing early adopters by offering around 35% reimbursement of operating costs for all cargo that is transported farther than 300 kilometers. Initially, this scheme is set to be valid for 3 years. The inauguration also involved the flagging off of three cargo vessels that will mark the beginning of cargo deliveries under the new scheme. These were the MV TRISHUL, carrying cement to Guwahati; the[ MV HOMI BHABA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:5757773/mmsi:419741170/imo:0/vessel:HOMI_BHABHA), carrying coal to Varanasi; and the [MV AAI](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:5452237/mmsi:419001319/imo:0/vessel:AAI), carrying gypsum to Patna. The new Jalvahak scheme is also intended to promote a more eco-friendly mode of transport than roadways or the Indian railways, which are the go-to methods for the majority of goods transport in India. The new Jalvahak scheme is intended to bring about significant change in the current cargo transport landscape, with more than 800 million tonne-kilometers of modal shift expected by 2027."

The fire reportedly started in the cargo hold, which was filled with scrap materials. Firefighters from the Gran Canaria Emergency Consortium quickly arrived on the scene, and after a protracted struggle, managed to douse the fire at 6:00 PM (WET). The bulk cargo within the vessel was reportedly covered with foam to prevent reignition. The majority of the crew evacuated the vessel, and the ship at a nearby berth was moved to a more distant berth due to the fire. Port operations were also temporarily suspended as a precaution. Eyewitness accounts indicate that smoke billowed from the vessel, which was creating visibility issues for the emergency responders. Fortunately, no reports of pollution or injuries have been reported. Local media reports indicate that the crew made an attempt to close the hatches of the vessel and deploy the vessel’s fire fighting system. However, the fire seemed to have burned the wires of the hatch’s actuation system, leading to the hatch remaining open. An investigation has been launched into the incident.

Two subsequent salvage attempts to free the vessel have failed, with the latest attempt being made at 7:20 AM on 10th December. The first attempt to free the vessel is said to have failed due to the tugboat not being strong enough to pull the vessel free. However, even during the second attempt, the vessel refused to budge. An officer on duty at the Armed Forces Operations Center stated that the next attempt to free the vessel would be made later in the night during high tide. So far, no reports of pollution have been made. The reason for the grounding of the vessel is not yet known, and investigations are underway.

The new tax, if approved, is expected to take effect from 2026. ![COZUMEL PORT.](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/COZUMEL_PORT_cfc1541aad.png)*COZUMEL PORT, image credit: Aloys Eijgermans* In the particular case of the ports of [COZUMEL](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/280?name=COZUMEL&country=Mexico) and [COSTA MAYA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/19259?name=COSTA-MAYA&country=Mexico), there will be a $5 charge levied from passengers for tourism infrastructure and disaster prevention efforts. This will lead to a total of $47 charge per head for cruise passengers that visit these ports annually. The Mexican army is due to receive around two-thirds of the proceeds from this new tax. Since 2020, the Mexican army has been placed in charge of Mexican ports to curb the smuggling of illicit cargo. The large percentage of revenues from the tax being diverted to the army instead of being invested in tourism infrastructure is also raising concerns. The bill is already facing resistance, with the cruise industry, the Florida Caribbean Cruise Association (FCCA), and even the Mexican Association of Shipping Agents opposing the tax, asking for it to not be implemented. The FCCA has issued a public statement to Mexico stating that the cruise industries would be forced to shift away from Mexican ports should this new tax come into effect, and hence, the tax must not be allowed to come into effect. As for now, the bill has been approved by the lower house and sent for debate to the Senate. Along with the possibility of the bill failing to gather support in the Senate, there is also the possibility of the bill being vetoed by the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum."

The renewable fuel production plant will be located in Kundziņsala, within the Port of Riga, and will be built in partnership with Ukrainian investors.

Protesters accuse the ruling party of trying to build closer ties to Russia. Protesters obstructing access to the port of Poti are but a part of a much wider unrest across the nation. Protests are reported to have spread to 8 cities and towns other than the cities of Poti and Tbilisi. The police are responding to the clashing protestors with tear gas and water cannons, and more than 150 protestors have been detained across the nation."

The new plan is expected to garner around $3 billion in private investments, leading to the upgrade of the country’s ports. ![SANTOS PORT.](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/SANTOS_PORT_08c00b4c22.png)*SANTOS PORT, image credit: Roberto Smera* The plan involves investments in more than 50 listed projects that would involve a collective investment of around $3 billion from the private sector. Among the upcoming events, the government plans to auction off 35 port terminals, with 22 of these auctions expected to take place before the end of 2025 and three auctions to take place in the last month of 2024 alone. Five of these leases are for the Port of[ SANTOS](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/189?name=SANTOS&country=Brazil), the largest port in Brazil. In addition to this, there are also concessions to be offered for the three terminals in the port and for the navigation channel. One of the terminals, the ITG 02 at Itaguai, is slated for auction this month. In a bid to attract private investors, the Brazilian government is offering competitive lines of credit and tax rebates. The regulatory landscape for the privatization of these assets has also been streamlined, reducing the overall time of such paperwork by 3 months. Furthermore, the Merchant Marine Fund has earmarked 30% of its budget for this privatization effort of the port sector. This plan, through the modernization and expansion of the port infrastructure, is expected to boost Brazilian trade and its competitiveness in the international landscape."

        "author": "Dimitris Ampatzidis",
        "content": "**Overview** This article reports on the Global Distribution of Grey and Sanctioned fleets throughout the month of November. While 87.4% of the world’s ships operate openly, about 10.2% are hidden or unclear in their operations, and another 2.4% are involved in breaking sanctions. Altogether, this adds up to around 3,000 ships in the “grey zone”. In the past month, these fleets have moved over 101 million barrels of oil, often using old ships over 16 years old with hidden ownership. **Current state of compliance** Quietly moving through international waters, the \"shadow fleet\" avoids detection by constantly altering its registration details and masking its true operations. Within 2024, 248 more ships were added to this fleet, making a total of 2,967. This is about 10.2% of the world’s commercial fleet that carries dry goods, liquids, or gas that are over 5,000 tons in weight. As of November 29, 2024, we have 13 fewer vessels than we did on October 31, due to the new sanctions enforced by the United States and United Kingdom. ![Picture1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture1_4fac559e0d.png) **Image 1.** _The rise of the grey and sanctioned fleets, from 101 to 2,967 vessels - Kpler._ ![Picture2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture2_1beb45d7f0.png) **Image 2.** _Global distribution of white, grey, and sanctioned fleets - Kpler._ A dominant 87.4% of the global fleet operates within the 'white' category - vessels follow standard regulations, transparent practices, and are not connected to sanctioned cargo. In contrast, 10.2% of vessels (2,967 vessels) fall into the 'grey/shadow' category, indicating potential involvement in deceptive shipping practices or sanctioned trade, while a smaller 2.4% are directly involved in sanctioned activities. ![Picture3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture3_89f6e6ef09.png) **Image 3.** _Age distribution of grey and sanctioned fleets and their proportion relative to the total fleet - Kpler._ The \"grey\" or \"shadow\" fleet primarily comprises older vessels, with a significant portion aged 16 years or more. Specifically, ships between 16 and 20 years old constitute 8.6% of the global fleet, while those over 20 years account for 29.1%. Sanctioned vessels are particularly prevalent in the 20+ year age group. This trend indicates that older ships are more often used in both shadow and sanctioned activities, possibly because their lower market value makes them more susceptible to illicit use. Accurately identifying the age of a vessel helps to better assess the likelihood of risk associated. ![Picture4.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture4_7f6f01a556.png) **Image 4.** _November-over-October changes on age distribution of grey and sanctioned fleets - Kpler._ In November, there was a decrease in the proportion of grey fleet vessels aged 0-20 years, likely due to new sanctions targeting this segment. Overall, the proportion of sanctioned vessels has increased across all age groups, reflecting the impact of recent sanctions. ![Picture5.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture5_43ac5c6796.png) **Image 5.** _Proportion of grey and sanctioned fleets across flag states - Kpler._ Iran and Russia have the largest shares of grey or sanctioned fleets, with 91.4% and 75% of their vessels falling into these categories, respectively. In contrast, Panama, despite having the largest fleet overall, has only 12.8% of its ships involved in grey or sanctioned activities. This trend highlights potential weaknesses in how some countries enforce maritime regulations. ![Picture6.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture6_b354f672f8.png) **Image 6.** _November-over-October changes on proportion of grey and sanctioned fleets across flag states - Kpler._ November-over-October, Gabon, Liberia, and Cook Islands have removed the most grey and sanctioned ships from their registries, demonstrating efforts to mitigate growing risks. However, the Marshall Islands saw the biggest increase, with a 14.3% rise in their grey fleet and a 33.3% rise in sanctioned vessels. But these percentages are misleading since only 1.9% of their fleet falls into the grey or sanctioned categories. ![Picture7.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture7_affead222f.png) **Image 7.** _Proportion of grey and sanctioned fleets across top ISM (International Safety Management) manager countries - Kpler._ The top 10 countries with the most vessels under ISM management have no sanctioned vessels in their fleets. However, there are noticeable differences in the proportions of grey vessels among them. The United Arab Emirates leads with 20.2% grey vessels, followed by Turkey at 18.7%, and India at 9.7%. In comparison, major shipping nations like Greece and Singapore have much lower percentages, with 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively. ![Picture8.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture8_ef60c208ea.png) **Image 8.** _November-over-October changes on proportion of grey and sanctioned fleets across ISM manager countries - Kpler._ From October through November, Japan saw the largest decrease in grey vessels managed by companies based there, while Germany experienced the largest increase. However, since both countries have relatively small grey fleets compared to others, such as the UAE, these changes have a limited impact on the overall risk assessment for these regions. This variation reflects enforcement of regulatory practices among these countries. Understanding these disparities is crucial for policymakers and industry leaders aiming to enhance compliance and strengthen maritime oversight on a global scale. ![Picture9.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture9_e7ecff0e43.png) **Image 9.** _Percentage of unknown ISM manager for the grey and sanctioned fleets - Kpler._ A notable 13.4% of sanctioned vessels and 7.3% of grey fleet ships lack identifiable ISM managers responsible for their safety protocols. This absence of clear safety management undermines regulatory oversight and increases the risk of these vessels participating in deceptive or non-compliant activities. The lack of transparency not only complicates enforcement efforts but also heightens concerns about maritime safety and adherence to international regulations such as IMO’s MARPOL. ![Picture10.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture10_bbd2b978f4.png) **Image 10.** _Percentage of grey and sanctioned fleets involvement in STS with Russian cargo - Kpler._ ![Picture11.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture11_c7fe547259.png) **Image 11.** _November-over-October changes on percentage of grey and sanctioned fleet involvement in STS with Russian cargo - Kpler._ Over the past year, 20.4% of the grey fleet and 26.9% of sanctioned vessels have conducted ship-to-ship (STS) transfers involving Russian cargo. However, in November, the grey fleet decreased. This drop happened because some grey fleet tied to Russian trades was moved to the sanctions list. These high numbers indicate a heavy reliance on these fleets to transport restricted goods, helping to avoid direct bans on Russian exports. Approximately 20% or more of grey and sanctioned ships are involved in ship-to-ship transfers with Russian cargo, highlighting their pivotal role in facilitating trade activities that bypass international sanctions. ![Picture12.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture12_4d45ef6fea.png) **Image 12.** _Oil volumes and flows transported by the grey fleet in the last 30 days - Kpler._ Over the past 30 days, the grey fleet has facilitated the transport of significant volumes of oil from nations with sanctions or restrictions to various global markets. China has benefited the most, importing about 13 million barrels of oil from Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. In total, China received 78 million barrels from these countries, with 17% of these imports using the grey fleet. This shows China’s reliance on this network despite international sanctions. India is also a major player, receiving about 7 million barrels of oil from Russia through the grey fleet. This is part of the 25 million barrels India imported from Russia overall. This indicates a strategic balancing act in India and China’s energy imports, utilising the grey fleet to sustain supplies while sidestepping restrictions. In the Middle East, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have also actively participated in this trade, collectively importing around 10 million barrels using the grey fleet within November. Altogether, these trade flows highlight the grey fleet’s expansive operational scope, having moved over 101 million barrels of oil in the last 30 days. This scale of activity underscores the fleet’s role in maintaining energy trade dynamics despite international sanctions, exploiting gaps in maritime regulations to keep sanctioned oil moving. Stay tuned for more insights and updates, ensuring that you remain informed and compliant amidst these dynamic regulatory changes.

USGC watchstanders in the San Juan sector received the oil spill report at around 7:30 PM local time on the evening of 27th November. The US Coast Guard responders arrived promptly and secured the source of the leak. They then proceeded to contain the spill within the dock area, deploying around 300 meters of boom to prevent the spread of oil to the shoreline and the surrounding areas. Following this, efforts will be concentrated on identifying any pockets of oil that have escaped the containment area. The subsequent oil cleanup efforts are being led by the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC). Many other government agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, are closely monitoring the situation. The USGC has posted a warning to residents and fishermen in the vicinity of the oil spill to refrain from entering the area until clean-up activities are complete. The US Coast Guard has opened an investigation into the matter."

(U Ming) for the installation of four rotor sails on a Very Large Ore Carrier owned by (U Ming). The installation is expected to be completed by late 2025. ![GRAND PIONEER to be install with rotor sails.](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/GRAND_PIONEER_d17a2011e7.png)*Ore Carrier GRAND PIONEER, image credit: Anemoi* The vessel to have the rotor sails installed is a U Ming-owned 325,000 DWT Very Large Ore Carrier, [GRAND PIONEER](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:6316243/mmsi:563110200/imo:9850331/vessel:GRAND_PIONEER#overview). The new rotor sails will generate wind-powered thrust, reducing fuel expenditure and increasing efficiency. The four sails, each of which is 25 meters tall and 5 meters in diameter, will collectively reduce 10% to 12% in fuel expenditure. The reduction forecast is evaluated on routes between China, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia. Rotor sails, also known as Flettner rotors, are cylindrical structures that create a pressure differential and, hence, generate thrust. The technology has gained much traction in recent years due to the impetus towards sustainable shipping practices."

The farmers then proceeded to blockade the roads to the port and stayed till 3:00 AM local time. The protest effectively blocked the entries and exits to the port and caused heavy congestion. Heavy goods vehicles stayed in queues for hours, and passengers were unable to board ferries across the Irish Sea. The traffic congestion eased at around 4:00 AM local time after the farmers dispersed at 3:00 AM local time. A slow-drive protest by farmers at the Dover Ferry port was held earlier that same day. In addition to this, around a week ago, around 10,000 farmers approached Westminster, London, en masse to express their discontentment over the new inheritance tax. Under the previous law, farms had been exempt from paying inheritance tax. However, under the upcoming law in April of 2026, an inheritance that is valued at more than 1 million pounds will be taxed at 20%. Farmers have claimed that while their farms have high valuations, they themselves make little on profit margins. Farmers contend that many of the farmers inheriting ancestral property will be forced to sell parts of their farms in order to cover the tax, thus leading to the fragmentation of the farms and a threat to the food provisions of Britain."

As of now, the vessel [YI PENG 3](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:213234/mmsi:414270000/imo:9224984/vessel:YI_PENG_3#overview) is suspected of sabotage of two undersea optic cables in the Baltic Sea. ![YI PENG 3.](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/YI_PENG_3_385495d914.png)*Bulk carrier YI PENG 3, image credit: Hans Berkenhoff* The narrative established by the investigation so far states that the vessel YI PENG 3 departed from the Russian port of Ust Luga on 15 November. Two days later, the vessel dropped anchor at around 9:00 PM local time and continued to sail with its anchor dragging across the seabed. The anchor then severed the undersea optic cable connecting Sweden and Lithuania. Following this, the vessel continued sailing for an additional 111 miles and severed yet another cable, this one connecting Finland with Germany. Investigators and industry experts have expressed their skepticism with the idea of the vessel’s crew remaining oblivious to a dragging anchor. Experts at Kpler have stated that given that weather conditions were mild and waves were within manageable height, the chances of anchor dropping accidentally are minimal. As of now the [YI PENG 3](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:213234/mmsi:414270000/imo:9224984/vessel:YI_PENG_3#overview) is anchored less than one nautical mile from the coast of Denmark in the Kattegat Strait. The naval forces of Denmark are monitoring it closely but are unable to board the vessel and interrogate the crew, stymied by geopolitics and international law. Negotiations with Chinese authorities are ongoing to allow further investigation. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has stated that they are not accusing the crew of the YI PENG 3 of any wrongdoing but has asserted that this is not the first time an incident of this kind has happened, and they want to investigate it further. Western officials believe that despite the vessel having a Chinese registration and being owned by a Chinese company, the incident was arranged by Russian agencies. German and Finnish foreign ministers released a joint statement on 18th November implying Russian involvement in the incident. The joint statement claimed the incident to be suspicious and Russian aggression against Ukraine to be a threat to European security. Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov issued a statement on 20 November disavowing any Russian involvement in the incident, stating that the accusations had no ground. Lin Jian from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied any knowledge of a Chinese vessel being linked with the sabotage of undersea cables. A Chinese ministry spokesperson confirmed that they are in contact with relevant parties, including Denmark, to resolve the situation. Undersea cables are well charted and rupturing them accidentally is highly improbable. However there are fears of malicious actors purposely severing undersea cables, which are crucial to the digital infrastructure and are extremely difficult to repair. Severing of an undersea cable by a civilian vessel is not construed as an act of aggression by itself as there is no concrete evidence tying the incident to a state agenda. In 2023, Taiwanese authorities accused two Chinese vessels of severing the only two cables that supplied internet to the Taiwanese Matsu Islands. These two cables ended up being cut separately by a cargo vessel and a fishing vessel within the same day on 2 February 2023. The Taiwanese ruling Democratic Progressive Party also highlighted that there had been 27 instances from 2018 to 2023 where Chinese vessels had caused cable disruptions. Then there is the much highlighted case of the [NEWNEW POLAR BEAR ](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:3162/mmsi:477893800/imo:9313204/vessel:NEWNEW_POLAR_BEAR#overview)which cut two cables and a gas pipeline last year by dragging an anchor across them. Given the context of rising tensions, such incidents are being viewed as a form of hybrid warfare, a way to undermine the opponent without openly engaging in conflict."

        "author": "Dimitris Ampatzidis",
        "content": "**Overview** October 2024 marked a surge in maritime sanctions as regulatory bodies like OFAC and OFSI expanded their sanctions lists, with 33 and 20 vessels respectively, intensifying scrutiny on high-risk vessels engaged in potentially deceptive practices. This collective action marked a year-on-year surge, with an increase of 242 vessels added to international sanctions rosters. The most significant growth was noted among vessels flagged by Russia (33), Panama (30), Comoros (11), and Guyana (9). **Main Updates** In late October, the G7 reinforced its stance on addressing the evasion of Russian oil sanctions, which directly impacts maritime shipping and the transport of energy commodities ([The Guardian, 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/g7-vows-to-clamp-down-on-russias-oil-sanctions-evasion); [UK Government, 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-strikes-at-the-heart-of-russian-energy-revenues-funding-putins-war?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&utm_source=13aad6c3-cde5-4ffa-bb5c-ff999f5948bd&utm_content=immediately)). The updated guidance aims to prevent deceptive practices, such as misreporting cargo origins and ship-to-ship transfers, which circumvent Russian crude price caps ([G7, 2024](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6709446c92bb81fcdbe7b732/G7_Updated_Guidance_for_Industry_-_Preventing_Russian_Export_Control_and_Sanctions_Evasion.pdf)). The UK government has strengthened these measures by introducing new restrictions specifically targeting Russia's revenue generation through maritime routes ([UK Government, 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-strikes-at-the-heart-of-russian-energy-revenues-funding-putins-war?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&utm_source=13aad6c3-cde5-4ffa-bb5c-ff999f5948bd&utm_content=immediately)). These sanctions target UK shipping services, such as insurance and reinsurance, to hinder the transport of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG). Compliance teams within the shipping industry now face the challenge of ensuring that their operations align with these newly expanded restrictions, which include more rigorous checks on vessel activities and ownership details to prevent indirect support of sanctioned entities ([Mayer Brown, 2024](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2024/11/russia-ukraine-sanctions-update-month-of-october)). **Analysis of Sanctioned Vessels and Companies** ![Sanctioned vessels and companies through the years.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Sanctioned_vessels_and_companies_through_the_years_027a9fe29a.png) **Graph 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the years - Kpler._ ![Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the years.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Sanctioned_vessels_per_top_10_flag_registry_through_the_years_ca00970c6b.png) **Graph 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the years - Kpler._ In October 2024, sanctions in the shipping industry increased sharply, mainly focusing on vessels rather than the companies managing them. More than 50 new vessels were added to the sanctions list, raising the total from just over 900 at the beginning of the month to nearly 1,000. Meanwhile, the number of sanctioned companies stayed about the same, nearing 400, without the same sharp increase seen in vessels. This difference shows that authorities are focusing on stopping certain vessel operations instead of targeting the companies behind them. Overall, October 2024 stands out as a month of intensified sanctions, with a clear focus on vessels involved in high-risk trading activities. Examining pre-sanction behaviours offers vital insights into the nuances of maritime risk management and underscores the importance of diligent oversight in mitigating compliance challenges. **Risk & Compliance findings before the October 2024 sanctions** The crude oil tanker LUNA PRIME serves as a useful example, as it showed activities that raised compliance concerns before sanctions were applied. This case shows the challenges of assessing risks in maritime operations, especially when dealing with sanctioned or restricted cargo, possible tampering with AIS, and engaging in high-risk STS transfers. ![LUNE PRIME risks .jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/LUNE_PRIME_risks_029926e5c9.jpg) **Image 1.** _LUNA PRIME risks - Kpler._ LUNA PRIME exhibited multiple risks even before recent sanctions were applied. The biggest concerns include direct links to sanctioned cargo from Iran and Venezuela (HS 270900), which were mostly transported through ship-to-ship (STS) transfers. Additionally, the vessel has a pattern of frequent and long AIS signal gaps, sometimes lasting over twenty hours. ![LUNA PRIME connections to Iranian cargo.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/LUNA_PRIME_connections_to_Iranian_cargo_f62e5129f1.jpg) **Image 2.** _LUNA PRIME connections to Iranian cargo - Kpler._ In addition to the operational patterns we discussed earlier, the vessel has an interesting and concerning Port State Control history from the Paris and Tokyo MOUs. It has undergone multiple inspections, resulting in over five deficiencies and one detention for three days in Qingdao, China, back in 2022. This poor performance highlights the safety and security issues the vessel is dealing with. Notably, the responsibility for addressing these issues lies with the ISM manager, RUNFENG SHIPMANAGEMENT CO LTD, whose oversight is crucial to maintaining compliance and ensuring vessel safety. ![LUNA PRIME concerning performance on PSC .jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/LUNA_PRIME_concerning_performance_on_PSC_47b570641b.jpg) **Image 3.** _LUNA PRIME concerning performance on PSC - Kpler._ The vessel's operational history raises significant concerns: - AIS Gaps: Since 2022, there have been at least 17 high-risk AIS (Automatic Identification System) gaps exceeding 20 hours each. Some of these gaps coincide with reported changes in the vessel's draught, suggesting potential undisclosed loading or unloading activities. - High-Risk STS Transfers: In 2022, the vessel was involved in four high-risk ship-to-ship (STS) transfers, transporting sanctioned cargo from Iran and Venezuela. - Dark STS Transfers: In 2023 and 2024, three \"dark\" STS transfers were identified, during which the vessel's AIS signal was deliberately turned off to conceal its activities. These covert operations were detected using satellite imagery, machine learning algorithms, and human intelligence, underscoring the vessel's attempts to evade monitoring. These patterns indicate deliberate efforts to obscure the vessel's operations, posing significant safety, security, and compliance risks. Such actions, including recurrent AIS gaps and 'dark' STS transfers, suggest intentional evasion tactics. ![LUNA PRIME operational risks overview.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/LUNA_PRIME_operational_risks_overview_1e50592586.jpg) **Image 4.** _LUNA PRIME operational risks overview - Kpler._ ![LUNA PRIME dark STS transfers.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/LUNA_PRIME_dark_STS_transfers_ce61841173.jpg) **Image 5.** _LUNA PRIME dark STS transfers - Kpler._ In conclusion, these findings reveal substantial operational risks, including multiple AIS signal gaps, sanctioned cargo transfers, and deliberate 'dark' activities to evade detection. These trends reveal significant gaps in transparency and adherence to global safety and compliance norms. As regulatory pressures escalate, companies must proactively audit operational histories and develop compliance frameworks that integrate real-time monitoring technologies. This approach is essential to mitigate the substantial legal and reputational risks posed by association with high-risk vessels. Stay tuned for more insights and updates, ensuring that you remain informed and compliant amidst these dynamic regulatory changes.

According to reports, the German ministry, via a letter, instructed the state-operated Deutsche terminal not to accept deliveries of LNG that have a Russian origin. The German government, in its letter, cited “overriding public interests” as the reason for the rejection. However, it is important to note that the Russian LNG is still imported in Germany via the German state-owned energy firm Sefe from the Arctic Russian LNG project. Russian gas still accounts for around 15% to 20% of the European supply. LNG is imported owing to longstanding contracts and then redistributed throughout the continent via the European interconnected gas network."

The first digital bunker delivery has already been successfully completed as part of the trial. The project is expected to demonstrate the benefits of using electronic bunker delivery notes in terms of time savings during bunkering, increased operational efficiency, and more comprehensive and improved data quality. The parties intend to fully integrate the eBDN system into the port of Rotterdam's operations in time. The port of Rotterdam follows the example of Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, which was the first to mandate the use of eBDNs in buildings. The eBDN system automates processes such as documentation, which will minimize administrative burdens for the crews. The system allows for swift verification of fuel quantities purchased and reduces risks associated with human errors. In addition to this, the system will be easy to integrate with the existing workflows of suppliers and regulatory compliance systems. The initiative was developed by ZeroNorth and was launched in September last year. The eBDN system was approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) at the 80th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee."

The next deadline offered by the ILA was 15 January 2025. However, the negotiations broke down after only two days, with the ILA alleging that the USMX is pushing to use automation in ports, which will reduce the number of jobs for port workers. USMX, on the other hand, states that a measure of automation is imperative if the port is to see continued modernization. USMX insists that they are not seeking to use the kind of technology that would eliminate jobs at ports, but their focus is on increased efficiency, capacity, and worker safety. The ILA has threatened strikes again should USMX not agree to their demands by 15 January.

This is the second time in the last few months that the Canadian government has stepped in to resolve deadlocks between employers and workers. The last instance was the major railway lockouts in August this year."

Despite the captain claiming that the discharge was carried out without his knowledge, the court ultimately fined him anyway, upholding that the captain was responsible for ensuring compliance. ![Captain of vessel SEAFORCE fined for scubber discharge](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/SEAFORCE_8633459b61.png)*Bulk carrier SEAFORCE, image credit: Morten Weesgaard* The actual incident dates back to March 2023, when the vessel [SEAFORCE ](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:2707818/mmsi:256238000/imo:9685487/vessel:SEAFORCE#overview)discharged a million liters of scrubber waste in the waters of Fos-Sur-Mer, France. Such discharges have been banned in France since 1st January 2022. Initially, the charges against the captain were not as severe, having a maximum possible penalty of 4000 euros. However, at a hearing in November 2023, the prosecutor's office reclassified the offense as pollution of the territorial sea, which is a more severe offense and carries a maximum penalty of 100,000 euros. The prosecutor's office also dismissed the claim of the captain being unaware of the discharge, stating that it was the captain's responsibility to ensure compliance on board. The 66-year-old Filipino captain appeared in court in Marseilles, France, on 2nd September, where prosecutors sought a charge of 50,000 euros against him, which was upheld in the final decision pronounced in October."

        "content": "**Main Updates** In September 2024, there were no new sanctions imposed on shipping trades or cargoes by OFAC, OFSI, the EU, or the United Nations. However, on 12 September, the UK government introduced a new directive, [\"Trade, Aircraft, and Shipping Sanctions, Civil Enforcement.\"](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trade-aircraft-and-shipping-sanctions-civil-enforcement-guidance/trade-aircraft-and-shipping-sanctions-civil-enforcement-guidance) Notably, this guidance set unprecedented fines starting at £1 million and mandated proactive due diligence for vessels and shipping firms. These updated regulations highlight the growing need for advanced technologies capable of closely tracking vessel behaviour to support compliance. As shipping firms, charter companies and harbour authorities adapt to these more stringent guidelines, investing in robust tracking tools will be critical to avoid fines and sustain trust in international trade. **Analysis of Sanctioned Vessels and Companies** ![Sanctioned vessels and companies through the years.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Sanctioned_vessels_and_companies_through_the_years_36025d69ee.png) **Graph 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the years - Kpler._ ![Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the years.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Sanctioned_vessels_per_top_10_flag_registry_through_the_years_70212e4dd7.png) **Graph 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the years - Kpler._ In recent years, the number of sanctioned vessels and companies has climbed sharply. Since 2017, vessels have become a particular target, with the count soaring past 900 by 2024, while sanctioned companies have increased more gradually, surpassing 300. This disparity points to vessels as a primary focus of sanctions enforcement, likely due to high-risk activities like STS transfers and AIS manipulation, often employed to circumvent sanctions. Certain flag registries have also seen pronounced increases in sanctioned vessels, with Russia and Panama leading the trend in 2024. For example, Russia saw a rise of 31 vessels, underscoring a shift towards scrutinising vessels flagged under specific nations. This trend reflects a more globalised and comprehensive approach to sanctions enforcement, urging shipping companies to remain vigilant over vessels and flag registries associated with elevated sanctions risks. Examining pre-sanction behaviours offers vital insights into the nuances of maritime risk management and underscores the importance of diligent oversight in mitigating compliance challenges. **Risk & Compliance findings before the applied sanctions** The vessel LA PEROUSE serves as a useful example, as it showed activities that raised compliance concerns before sanctions were applied. This case shows the challenges of assessing risks in maritime operations, especially when dealing with sanctioned cargo, possible tampering with AIS, and engaging in high-risk STS transfers. ![La Perouse risks.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/La_Perouse_risks_b8bd6f7e9a.jpg) **Image 1.** _LA PEROUSE risks - Kpler._ LA PEROUSE was linked to Russian LNG ([HS code: 271111](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/commodities/2711)) from the ports of Sabetta and Vysotsk in 2023, months before the sanctions came into effect. Notably, one trade of this Russian LNG took place via an STS transfer from Sabetta to Zeebrugge, Belgium. This type of operation is now being closely examined by the European Union under the 14th EU sanctions package (Dalboni & Perez-Cejuela Romero, 2024; Sutenko, 2024). ![La Perouse High Risk Trade.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/La_Perouse_High_Risk_Trade_a6f003a88d.jpg) **Image 2.** _LA PEROUSE high risk trade - Kpler._ In terms of operational risks, LA PEROUSE experienced at least five high-risk AIS gaps starting from May 2023. In four of these instances, there was a change in the vessel's draught, highlighting loading and discharge operations. During the same time, the vessel was involved in three high-risk STS transfers with the Christophe De Margerie (IMO No. 9737187). ![La Perouse High Risk AIS Gaps.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/La_Perouse_High_Risk_AIS_Gaps_acf87df870.jpg) **Image 3.** _LA PEROUSE high risk AIS gaps - Kpler._ To assess the risks associated with LA PEROUSE on Kpler before the sanctions were enforced, users could have monitored the vessel’s activities, such as its connections to Russian LNG and its participation in STS transfers. Additionally, tracking AIS gaps and draught changes could have raised early warning signs of non-compliance or riskier behaviour. By identifying these red flags in advance and cross-referencing them with evolving regulations, such as the UK’s recent sanctions guidelines, users could have avoided engaging with the vessel, thus reducing the risk of breaching sanctions. Stay tuned for more insights and updates as the year progresses, ensuring that you remain informed and compliant amidst these dynamic regulatory changes.

A preliminary assessment showed that the vessel was not damaged and there was no pollution thus far. After several failed attempts to refloat the vessel, the efforts were finally successful in the rising tide at around 1:10 AM on 20 October, the next day. The vessel was then towed to the Mahe Quay in Port [VICTORIA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/20023?name=PORT-VICTORIA&country=Seychelles), Seychelles and was safely docked by 5:47 PM. SPA authorities declared that the vessel indeed caused no pollution and there was no water ingress into the vessel."

The incident occurred on the afternoon of October 18 while the vessel was conducting loading operations while docked at the [KORSAKOV Port](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/18156?name=KORSAKOV&country=Russia). After the vessel capsized, the Korsakov port authority promptly requested assistance from nearby vessels and requested four nearby vessels to divert to the region and conduct a search and rescue operation. The responding vessels included two tugboats. Reports indicate that there were seven crew members present at the time of the capsizing. When the vessel started listing heavily, three of the crewmembers were flung off the vessel into the sea. These crewmembers were later rescued in the search and rescue efforts and have reportedly suffered from hypothermia due to exposure to the cold waters. One of them was released from the hospital, while another sailor is still reported to be in a serious condition. Four remaining crewmembers were not found, and unconfirmed reports indicate that the bodies of two of these sailors have been recovered. The vessel has been towed and taken back to the port, and investigators are to assess the damage and inspect the vessel for any signs of the missing sailors. Initial investigations by the Russian Marine Rescue Service have revealed that the vessel started listing and subsequently capsized due to the improper loading of building materials on the vessel. The regional governor of the area has hinted at the possible overlooking of safety procedures during the loading of the vessel.

This new container ship is also the fifth in the series of eighteen dual-fuel methanol vessels ordered by Maersk. The vessels are scheduled to be handed over in 2024 and 2025. Maersk is using methanol-enabled vessels as an essential element in its strategy of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieving net zero emissions by 2040 across its operations. The low-emission methanol can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 65 to 90%, depending on its feedstock and production process.

The vessel operates for Avenir Supply and Trading, the physical LNG trading division of Avenir, and provides its services in Northwest Europe. The announced agreement with Eni is a Time Charter Party agreement, which traditionally would entail Eni chartering the vessel for a predetermined period, during which Eni would control the vessel’s operations and pay for operational costs such as fuel, port fees, and cargo handling, while Avenir would pay for the maintenance and crewing of the vessel. The charter of the vessel with Eni will begin upon the delivery of the vessel in Europe in 2025. The charter of this vessel will bring Avenir’s long-term revenue backlog, including options, to around $285 million. The agreement, which is to extend for a decade, will benefit both companies mutually. Avenir stands to benefit from the improved financials, namely the improved long-term cash flows, whereas Eni will be able to offer LNG among its bunker fuel options with the addition of this newest vessel to its fleet."

The incident occurred on 7 October. The HM Coastguard was notified at 1:15 AM, prompting them to send lifeboats from both Kyle and Portree lifeboat stations. Kyle lifeboat, the Spirit of Fred Olsen, arrived on the scene as soon as 1:30 AM. The lifeboat crew then went onboard and looked for damage to the vessel and injuries to crew members. After the subsequent arrival of the Portree lifeboat, the Stanley Watson Barker, the Spirit of Fred Olsen returned to the Kyle lifeboat station. The Portree lifeboat stood by, awaiting the high tide for the refloating of the vessel. Soon after, the emergency towing vessel arrived, and the Gotland was successfully refloated. The Gotland has now moved to anchor at Glenelg Bay. The narrow strait connecting the Isle of Skye with the Glenelg mainland, known as the Kylerhea Narrows, is notorious for strong currents. The strong currents coupled with the narrow passageway are the reason for frequent cases of vessels running aground here."

The attacks led to the death of one Ukrainian national, the injuring of five crew members, and damage to vessels and structures at the ports. On 6 October, a Russian airstrike targeted a grain vessel docked at the port of Pivdennyi in the Odessa region of Ukraine.

According to Odessa Regional Governor Oleh Kipper, the attack resulted in the death of a 60-year-old Ukrainian worker who was employed in a private cargo handling company. Kipper further stated that five crewmembers were also injured. The injured crew members are in medical care, with reports claiming four of them having sustained moderate injuries and one having sustained mild injuries. These attacks have been claimed by Ukrainian authorities to be Russia threatening food security and grain exports by repeatedly targeting grain vessels. The marked increase in attacks on vessels began after Russia withdrew from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, although Russia claims to never have targeted any civilian vessels."

The two wind-assisted sails are designed to alleviate the fuel requirements for the vessel. The Wind Assisted Ship Propulsion (WASP) system installed onboard is a product of the Dutch company Econowind, which specializes in harnessing wind energy for maritime uses. The company’s primary product is the VentoFoil, a foldable wind assist unit that can generate substantial thrust and reduce reliance on traditional fuel sources. Econowind stated that the[ JUMBO JUBILEE](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:267465/mmsi:246309000/imo:9371581/vessel:JUMBO_JUBILEE) was the first geared vessel to have wind-assisted propulsion systems installed, commenting on the pioneering approach Jumbo has taken in the heavy lift sector.

The accident occurred at the Outer Elbe, around five nautical miles west- northwest of Scharhorn, a small island in the North Sea. [LOTTA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:235763/mmsi:210586000/imo:9629809/vessel:ZUIDVLIET#overview), a 88.6- metre-long vessel came in contact with a 9.5-metre-long yacht under the moderate rough sea and wind conditions. In the collision the yacht sustained significant damages to its hull whereas the cargo vessel sustained minimal damage. At 6:40 AM local time, the Cuxhaven Traffic Control Center, part of the Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration, alerted the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center in Bremen, Germany about the collision. The German Sea Rescue Association (DGzRS) promptly responded to the incident and deployed two sea rescue cruisers to the scene. The general cargo vessel, [LOTTA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:235763/mmsi:210586000/imo:9629809/vessel:ZUIDVLIET#overview), remained nearby at the site. A small yacht came to assist the damaged yacht, preventing it from running aground on the nearby Scharhorn reef before the rescue cruises arrived. Later, sea rescue cruisers arrived at the scene and stabilised the damaged yacht. Upon inspection of the yacht, it was discovered that the collision had caused a significant hole on the port side of the hull, just above the waterline, as well as a broken mast. When the mast broke, the sail fell into the water and draped over the hole in the hull, effectively blocking it and preventing water ingress. Fortunately, no injuries were reported.

The US government claims that three of the sanctioned companies, namely Shenzhen Boyu Imports and Exports Co. Ltd., Shenzhen Jinghon Electronics Ltd. and Shenzhen Rion Technology Co. Ltd were found to be supplying components for the construction of missiles, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and other military equipment to the Houthis. An Iranian operative named Hasan Ahmad Hasan Muhammad al-Kuhlani has been sanctioned for coordinating the smuggling efforts."

Although the strike lasted only from October 1 to October 3, almost 45 containerships are currently in queue to unload cargo at the 36 ports that were shuttered in the strike. The disruption had threatened to raise prices had it continued for any longer, especially in the backdrop of Hurricane Helene, which struck the Southeastern states just as the strike began. The destruction caused by the hurricane threatened supply chains for the essential goods such as food and pharmaceuticals, prompting the Biden administration to urge the USMX to reach a deal. The new temporary agreement is to extend the master contract to 15 January, 2025, with a few compromises made on the demands of both the ILA and the USMX. The contending parties have settled for a pay raise of 62% over the course of 6 years, which is a compromise on the offers of both the ILA, which demanded a 77% raise, and the USMX, which had offered a 50% raise. With the new contract in place, both parties will return to the negotiating table again, and the striking workers will return to their jobs immediately. However, the disagreement between the ILA and the USMX was not completely resolved, as one of the major points of contention, namely automation in ports, remained unaddressed in the agreement. The Biden administration, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the National Retail Federation have lauded the efforts of both the ILA and the USMX for reaching an agreement and thwarting further economic and supply chain disruptions."

Although negotiations are currently underway between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), a labour strike is unlikely to be avoided. The strike by around 45,000 workers in ports from Maine to Texas would have a drastic impact on global supply traffic. As an agreement has still not been reached in the wage negotiations between the ILA and the USMX, the port authorities are preparing for a strike by port workers at the end of the contract on 30 September. The strike would therefore begin on 1 October next week. If the approximately 45,000 port employees, who handle around 60% of US shipping traffic, lay down their work, the country's busiest ports will be closed. Bethann Rooney, director of the Port Authority of [New York](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/137?name=NEW-YORK&country=USA) and New Jersey, said in a recent briefing: ‘There will be a shutdown, assuming that there's is no intervention, at midnight on Monday the 30th’ Another spokesperson emphasised that $240 billion worth of goods move through the two ports each year and that this trade supports more than 600,000 local jobs. While cruise traffic would continue, all activities involving the loading and unloading of containers would stop. Exports would be blocked so that they do not reach the ports on the East and Gulf coasts and then remain there, explained Rooney. Container ships with imports for the relevant ports would either remain at sea or at least be allowed to dock at certain points in the harbours."

The ship was carrying around 15,000 to 20,000 liters of diesel fuel and around 1000 liters of engine oil. Although efforts are underway to contain the spill, such as pumps and floating barriers, the tides, winds, and sea currents typical of the region are making it challenging to do so. All vessels traveling through the area have been advised to travel at low speeds so as to not disturb the oil and exacerbate the condition. The police and firefighters have received additional equipment to be able to contain the spreading spill, and the Environment and Civil Protection Ministry has also requested assistance from the Arctic command of the Danish Navy to recover the leaked fuel."

The vessel encountered rough weather with waves up to 2 to 3 meters on 17 September, leading to engine failure, which in turn led to the grounding of the vessel at 6:00 AM (local time). Although the vessel has sustained a hull breach, the inflow of water is not severe, and water can be pumped out faster than it can flood in. All 10 crewmembers are also reported to be safe. The vessel was carrying green oil, a kind of fuel that is used in fishing boats, particularly those that operate in coastal or inland waters.

Image Credits: wartsila* Wartsila and Chevron have announced a partnership to reduce methane emissions from Chevron’s LNG carriers. The collaboration is focused around replacing one engine on six of Chevron’s LNG tankers, mitigating methane slip from engines, and thereby reducing emissions. This conversion was announced by Wartsila in a press release on 19 September. Wartsila will be replacing its 50DF engines on six of Chevron’s ships with SG engines, which use spark ignition to begin combustion rather than diesel pilot fuel. This will lead to more efficient combustion of methane and thereby reduce methane slip. Such an effort is the first in the maritime industry and is the result of two years of collaboration between Chevron and Wartsila. The order for the conversion of the first two vessels was placed in the third quarter of 2024. LNG carriers are infamous for their carbon intensity, with the International Council on Clean Transportation claiming that these were responsible for around 82% of the marine industry’s methane emissions. Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2, trapping around 25–30 times more heat than CO2."

The [Dali](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:2810451/mmsi:563004200/imo:9697428/vessel:DALI) is the vessel that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024, leading to the collapse of the bridge into the water and causing the death of 6 people. The companies, namely Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine, have been accused by the US DoJ of keeping the [Dali](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:2810451/mmsi:563004200/imo:9697428/vessel:DALI) operational despite knowing that the ship was not seaworthy. In its filing, the DoJ has outlined a series of consequent mechanical failures, including power outages, failure of safety systems, and other known issues that led to the disaster. The DoJ asserts that its investigation revealed the intentional configuration of the vessel in a way that hindered quick restoration of propulsion and steering if the ship lost power. The DoJ also claimed that the defendants were aware of vibration issues on the ship that could lead to power outages, but they neglected to take corrective measures, choosing instead to resort to temporary fixes such as welding over cracks of critical components on the ship. Furthermore, the DoJ has stated that none of the four primary means of steering a ship—the propeller, rudder, anchor, or bow thrusters—functioned when needed at the time, leading to the accident. The lawsuit by the DoJ is to recover costs incurred by different arms of the US government in removing the debris from the bridge collapse, clearing the navigation channel, and mitigating risks against pollution. In addition to this, the DoJ is also seeking punitive damages to deter other shipowners and operators from repeating these mistakes. This civil suit is one part of a larger legal landscape surrounding the tragic bridge collapse in March. The bridge itself was owned by the State of Maryland, which will be filing a similar claim against the Dali’s owner and operator for recovering the cost of the damaged bridge. Furthermore, the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation into the events of the disaster. Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine have filed a motion of their own, trying to limit the damages that can be sought from them to $44 million. However, the US Congress has deemed the 170-year-old underlying law limiting the damages of shipowners to be obsolete and is seeking to change it."

Maersk signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the city of Yokohama and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical back in December of 2023. The aim of the agreement was to promote the use of methanol across Japanese shipping corridors. A number of operations, including berthing, unberthing, and hose connections, were tested in the simulation. Insights gained from the simulation will be used to further the goals of developing guidelines and enhancing the methanol fuel supply chain in the country. The initiative is being supported by other stakeholders, such as the Ministries of Land, Transport, and Infrastructure, along with Tourism’s Port and Harbor Bureau. These ministries are also planning to convene a study group focused on developing methanol bunkering hubs in Japanese ports."

The commercial trials, which will continue for the coming months, will allow for entities to charter the vessel and experience its performance firsthand. The [HYDROMOVER](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8123120/mmsi:563082550/imo:0/vessel:HYDROMOVER), launched in November 2023, is an 18.5-meter-long vessel that can carry up to 25 tons. The vessel can achieve up to 12 knots and travel up to 40 nautical miles when at maximum loading capacity. The vessel is powered by swappable batteries, which can be switched when in port in a matter of minutes, allowing for a quick turnaround time. The [HYDROMOVER](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8123120/mmsi:563082550/imo:0/vessel:HYDROMOVER) is claimed to reduce operational costs by up to 50%, owing to its greater energy efficiency and reduced operational costs. Yinson Greentech has announced that it has already received letters of intent from six partners that intend on chartering the [HYDROMOVER](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:8123120/mmsi:563082550/imo:0/vessel:HYDROMOVER) with the intent of potentially electrifying their fleets. The partners, namely Lita Ocean, DM Sea Logistics, OPL Services, RW Mainlines Services, Tian San Shipping, and Kanlian Ferry, have a combined fleet of over 200 vessels. This implies a great demand for the production of electric vessels should the partners opt for the electrification of their fleets. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore has declared that all harbor craft are to become fully electric, use B100 biofuels, or become compatible with net zero fuels such as hydrogen by 2030. These commercial trials are expected to provide crucial data regarding the feasibility, efficiency, and safety of using electric vessels in the maritime sector, bringing electric cargo ships a step closer to widespread adoption."

This signals the easing of the political deadlock between the warring factions in Libya, as ships are gradually being let in to load oil. According to Marine Traffic data, the crude oil tanker, [FRONT JAGUAR](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:4113838/mmsi:538006772/imo:9703332/vessel:FRONT_JAGUAR), a Marshall Island flagged vessel, arrived at the [MARSA BREGA Port](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/19334?name=MARSA-BREGA&country=Libya), Libya on September 04 to load oil cargo.

The vessel is scheduled to load 600,000 barrels of crude oil. Libyan oil exports have been suspended for over a week due to a political dispute involving the central bank and oil revenues. The conflict is about the rival governments exerting control over the Central bank of Libya (CBL), which is an authorized body that receives oil revenue and is responsible for paying the government salaries in Libya. On August 18, the western factions attempted to remove the 13 year tenure Governor of CBL. As retaliation, the eastern factions ordered the shutdown of oil production in Libya on August 26. Reports indicate that the two factions have reached a truce to jointly appoint the new president of the CBL by October 3. As of now, this ongoing conflict has resulted in Libya's oil output having dropped by more than half to just over 590,000 barrels per day."

The ILA has begun preparations for a potential strike from October 1 if an agreement is not reached by September 30. The talks of a strike are primarily due to unresolved contract negotiations, which have been ongoing since 2022. The main points of contention are automation in ports threatening jobs, wages, retirement benefits and working conditions. Reports indicate that the ILA workers in New York and New Jersey make only around 55% of the salary of their counterparts that are in the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and are demanding a pay raise. The ILA insists that they will not continue working past the expiration of the current contract on September 30, should their demands not be met. With the ports in the East Coast and Gulf Coast handling around 43% of the nation's imports, a strike would already have far-reaching consequences and additional strain on the global supply chain, which is already reeling from the incidents in the Red Sea. Further worsening the situation is the fact that the holiday season is approaching along with the US presidential elections, which means increased sensitivity and a greater volume of cargo to be handled. The current labor deal impacts around 14,500 workers across 36 ports in the East Coast and Gulf Coast. A strike would potentially cause billions of dollars worth of cargo to be stranded, bring detention and demurrage charges for shippers, and cause lasting ripple effects in the supply chain that would be comparable to those caused by the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. Experts state that for every day the strike remains, it would take four to six days more to clear the backlog that would be built. Due to the tremendous threat that such a strike would pose, many entities, such as the National Retail Federation, the Biden Administration, and US importers and exporters, are trying to persuade the ILA to resume negotiations after the [last time](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/maritime-news/21/ports/2024/11388/ila-workers-threaten-strike-on-us-east-and-gulf-coasts) negotiations broke down. However, ILA president Harold Daggett has stated that the parties are further apart than ever, especially concerning the economic conditions put down by the ILA."

These vessels, which are a part of the GG5G class, are equipped with technologies such as hybrid propulsion, lithium batteries for zero emissions in port, fuel-efficient design, and even solar panels covering 350 square meters on board. In comparison to the older generation of Ro-Ro vessels, the [ECO MALTA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:6698670/mmsi:247383800/imo:9859583/vessel:ECO_MALTA) and the [ECO MEDITERRANEA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:7134662/mmsi:247383900/imo:9859595/vessel:ECO_MEDITERRANEA) are twice as efficient in terms of CO2 generated per unit of cargo. The route would be of particular help to leading automobile manufacturers such as BMW, Land Rover, Kia, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and others who would be able to leverage the new ro-ro service not only for the import of raw materials but for the export of finished products. The new route will satisfy the growing demand for an efficient maritime trade connection between Italy and Turkey. In addition to this, the strategic locations of Trieste, which would by extension offer access to Northern Italy and furthermore to central Europe, and that of Ambarli, which is in close proximity to Istanbul and Turkey's economic district, would significantly increase the efficiency of the existing supply chain and boost trade."

Concerns arose when the ship was discovered to be loaded with 20,000 tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive substance. The 37,309-dwt [RUBY](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:1605/mmsi:229041000/imo:9626390/vessel:RUBY) was carrying the cargo from the Russian port of [KANDALAKSHA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/23929?name=KANDALAKSHA&country=Russia) to the Canary Islands. The vessel sailed out of [KANDALAKSHA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/23929?name=KANDALAKSHA&country=Russia) on August 22, and due to the ship suffering damage to its hull and propeller and facing inclement weather, it sought permission to sail to sheltered waters and arrived in [TROMSO](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/267?name=TROMSO&country=Norway) on September 1. The dangerous nature of the cargo has caused multiple agencies to be involved in the resolution of this situation. These include the Norwegian police, Tromso harbor, the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning (DSB), the Norwegian Maritime Authority, and the Norwegian Coastal Administration. The authorities have decided to have the ship relocated out of the Tromso harbor to an anchorage, although the exact destination has not been decided upon. The ship is to receive temporary repairs before being towed. Although ammonium nitrate is a great fertilizer, the chemical is most notable for its explosive properties. The chemical is usually stable under room temperature, but it can become unstable and explode under specific conditions, such as being exposed to an initiation charge or to increased heat and pressure. Unfortunately, the chemical burns when heated and produces gasses and heat, which can lead to a runaway reaction and cause an explosion. The same chemical caused the severe explosion in Beirut in 2020, when it was stored improperly alongside fireworks. For context, the Beirut explosion, which is considered to be the largest non-nuclear blast in history, was caused by around 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate compared to the 20,000 tons onboard the [RUBY](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:1605/mmsi:229041000/imo:9626390/vessel:RUBY)."

The retrofit is to be carried out as a part of the HyEkoTank project in 2025. The HyEkoTank project is the world’s largest fuel cell retrofit project. It is a consortium of TECO 2030, Umoe, Shell, BLOM Maritime, Nav-Tech, FKAB Marine Design, Tarbit Shipping, and the Arctic University of Norway. The project provides standardized solutions for retrofits that can be adopted by a variety of seagoing and inland waterway vessels. In the partnership, TECO 2030 will provide the hydrogen fuel cells for the retrofit, and Umoe Advanced Composites will provide hydrogen storage solutions. The retrofit will ensure that the vessel remains compliant with the Fuel EU Maritime and EU ETS requirements for the remainder of its life. With regulations such as Fuel EU Maritime and EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) incoming, shipowners like Samskip will face stricter requirements. The Kvitnos operates in a weekly multipurpose service, traveling from Rotterdam, along the Norwegian coast, to Hammerfest. Routes such as this, which pass through the Norwegian fjords, will have more stringent requirements with time. These include strict emissions monitoring, specific fuel requirements, and achieving zero emissions. Vessels below 10,000 gross tons are to reach net zero by 2026, with larger vessels having an extended deadline of achieving it by 2032."

The seafarers hailing from Colombia, Panama, and Peru faced dire conditions during their contract aboard the ship. They are reported to have had inadequate food and water supplies and limited medical care. The ITF has undertaken the case of the seafarers and is using its resources and network to get the seafarers their due compensation. The seafarers were left abandoned at Puget Sound in Washington last week and were due to be deported back to their country before the ITF intervened. Cyrus Donato, Inspector for the ITF, condemned the actions of the shipowner, stating that the re-flagging of the vessel was a strategic move. Donato described the action as both cynical and unscrupulous, performed to increase profits and evade regulations by sacrificing seafarers. Donato explained that currently the crew is in a vulnerable position, not being under the protection of US laws; he further stated that the ITF is working to get the seafarers their complete compensation.

The Namibian Police Force reported that an earlier order granting permission to the vessel to dock at the port was revoked. The police also made reports that the vessel was carrying 60 containers of TNT and six containers of hexogen explosives. A local human rights organization, the Economic and Social Justice Trust, lauded the government's efforts and stated that they were pleased that their government decided in favor of respecting international law and not being involved in genocide."

On December 01, 2023, the bulk carrier was seized by the customs officials of the Paradip Port after discovering 22.2 kilograms of cocaine aboard. The Orissa High Court ordered the sale of the bulk carrier not for its involvement in a drug bust case. The order came after the ship owner, Asia Pacific Shipping Company, Vietnam, failed to clear the due related to berthing charges and penalties to the Paradip International Container Terminal (PITC). In February 2024, the Orissa High Court allowed the ship to return to its owner only if the company provided a bank guarantee and an indemnity bond. Following this, the PITC charged the shipping company nearly $947,000 for overstay docking, which is around INR 79 million. The shipping company argued in court, stating that the vessel was subject to pay docking fees only upto the time before it was seized by customs officials in a drug case investigation. The company also claimed the bulk carrier had overstayed because of the authorities' investigation, which was not under their control. However, the PITC claim was found valid, and the court ordered the arrest of [DEBI](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:464399/mmsi:352002464/imo:9616735/vessel:DEBI#overview) on February 23, 2024.

PITC further noted that with time, docking fees are piling up for the vessel. Moreover, the vessel is deteriorating, and the value is decreasing day by day. The court ordered the vessel to be sold after the survey reports determined its value. The details of the [DEBI ](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:464399/mmsi:352002464/imo:9616735/vessel:DEBI#overview)sale will be provided after the survey report, which is expected to be available to the court in September."

In the latest update, the EUNAVFOR ASPIDES ship rescued the crew members aboard [SOUNION](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:213122/mmsi:240542000/imo:9312145/vessel:SOUNION#overview) and were taken to Djibouti. Currently, the vessel is at anchor and is not drifting. Although the Houthis have not officially claimed responsibility for the attack, the pattern of targeting vessels in the Red Sea aligns with that of the Houthis. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) and the Greek Shipping Ministry have indicated that the attack occurred in an area well known for Houthi activity, further reinforcing the possibility of Houthi involvement."

More than 700 kg of cocaine was discovered from different containers at the port and has been seized by the officials. On August 14, the Public Prosecution Service, Netherlands reported that during a routine inspection by customs officers, 514 kilograms of cocaine was found concealed in one of the containers of avocados, which arrived from Peru passing through Panama to Rotterdam. The container was heading to a company in De Lier.The police believe that the company was not involved in the drug smuggling. Another 100 kilograms of cocaine was found in a different container of avocado, which arrived at Rotterdam Port through the same route. The container was destined for a company in Ridderkerk. The company is also believed to be not connected to drug smuggling. Subsequently, on August 15, the Public Prosecution Service, Netherlands stated that the customs, during a check-in at the Port of Rotterdam, uncovered 39 kilograms of cocaine in a refrigerated container. Following this, on August 16, again, 60 kilograms of cocaine was seized from the container carrying bananas following a regular inspection conducted by customs at the Port of Rotterdam. The container carrying the fruit came from Costa Rica and was heading for a company in Zeeland, which is again presumed to be a proxy and not involved in the smuggling. 714 kilograms of cocaine had been discovered worth around $59 million. The authorities have destroyed the drugs and are investigating the drug cases."

The ship’s owner, Japan-based Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), and the charterer of the ship, Brazilian mining giant Vale International, released a statement celebrating the achievement of being the first in the industry to fit a rotor sail on a capesize bulker.

The vessel was originally delivered 10 years ago. Following the retrofit, the vessel made its first call on its maiden voyage at the Brazilian port of [PONTA DA MADEIRA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/18858?name=PONTA-DA-MADEIRA&country=Brazil), Brazil, on August 15. Both MOL and Vale International are committed to sustainable shipping and have announced sustainability goals of their own in line with the Paris Agreement. Vale has set a goal of reducing 15% of their Scope 3 emissions by 2035, which includes their shipping arrangements. MOL has set its own goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and is investing in clean energy and energy-saving technologies."

The port [NACALA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/1231?name=NACALA&country=Mozambique) has seen infusions of capital not only from neighboring countries but also from the Japan International Cooperation Agency, which invested around $300 million in the port back in 2018. Due to these investments, the port has expanded rapidly to become a regional hub of maritime traffic. The new terminal will create a more cost-effective logistics framework for Malawi, improving its trade capabilities and ultimately benefiting its economy."

The demonstration will start on Baltic Sea Day, which is celebrated every year on the last Thursday of August, which is on August 29, and will last for one week until September 4. The project is being achieved with a partnership between Viking Line and the ports of Stockholm and Turku. The three have signed a Memorandum of Understanding for creating a carbon neutral corridor by 2035. The [VIKING GLORY](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:6637578/mmsi:230041000/imo:9827877/vessel:VIKING_GLORY) and [VIKING GRACE ](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:5547/mmsi:230629000/imo:9606900/vessel:VIKING_GRACE)are already climate-smart, and Viking Line has invested around 450 million euros in their construction. However, the choice of running the ships on biogas alone will further reduce the CO2 emissions from these ships by 90%. This week-long demonstration with the two vessels will save 2600 tons of CO2. Viking procures its biogas from Gasum, which in turn derives the biogas from food and agricultural waste. The fuel is European in origin, and each batch of fuel can be traced back to its origin."

The contract will begin on January 1, 2025. The contract has made Stax Engineering the industry's first to have a five-year deal for emission capture. The technology involves a barge arriving by the side of the berthed vessel and connecting to the vessel’s exhaust stack directly using steel pipes and hoses. The emissions are then pulled into the barge’s filtration systems, and the released gas stream is free of 99% diesel particulate matter and 95% nitrogen oxides (NOx). Connecting to the exhaust stack externally makes the approach versatile and applicable to a variety of vessels, including container ships, auto carriers, and tankers. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has mandated that vessels berthing at California ports adhere to strict emissions regulation standards. Tankers and ro-ro vessels berthing at the Port of [LOS ANGELES](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/87?name=LOS-ANGELES&country=USA) and [LONG BEACH](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/2727?name=LONG-BEACH&country=USA) Port will fall within the purview of these laws as of January 1, 2025.

The strike will involve Fremantle pilot boat operators and vessel traffic service officers walking off their jobs for 48 hours. They claim that their pay is lower than that of their counterparts in other ports and are demanding that their pay be raised by 33% over three years. The union has claimed that they are prepared to extend the strike should their demands not be taken seriously. Experts have warned that the repercussions of the strike could be felt for weeks even if the strike is not prolonged. The dock workers in charge of loading and unloading are not involved in the strike. So, vessels that are already at berth in the port will continue their operations as per schedule. However, ships that have to be moved to and from the berths will face difficulties.

        "author": "Dimitris Ampatzidis",
        "content": "**Overview** In July 2024, maritime sanctions evolved with the EU renewing measures against Russia and Iran, while OFAC sanctioned 5 new vessels and 2 companies. This contributed to a year-over-year increase of 128 vessels and 70 companies on the sanctions list, reflecting the broadening scope and complexity of global trade. The largest increases were observed in vessels flagged under Panama, Liberia, Comoros, and Swaziland, highlighting the importance of monitoring high-risk activities like AIS manipulation and STS transfers. **Renewal of Sanctions Against Russia and Iran** On July 22, 2024, the EU renewed its economic sanctions against Russia for another six months, extending them until January 31, 2025. These sanctions, initially imposed in 2014 and significantly expanded since February 2022, include a wide range of measures targeting trade, finance, technology, and more. Specific actions include bans on the import of seaborne crude oil and certain petroleum products, de-SWIFTing Russian banks, and suspending broadcasting licences for Kremlin-backed media outlets. The EU continues to maintain these measures in response to Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine ([Lenzu, 2024b](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/07/22/russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-council-renews-economic-sanctions-for-a-further-6-months/)). On July 15, 2024, the EU extended sanctions against Iran until July 27, 2025, due to Iran's military support for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and various armed groups in the Middle East and the Red Sea region. The Council prohibited the export of components used in the development and production of UAVs from the EU to Iran. These measures, reviewed annually, include restrictions on exporting equipment and technology that could bolster Iran's military capabilities, specifically impacting maritime transport and the provision of UAV and missile components ([Lenzu, 2024a](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/07/15/iran-council-prolongs-eu-restrictive-measures-in-view-of-iran-s-military-support-for-russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-and-for-armed-groups-and-entities-in-the-middle-east-and-the-red-sea-region/)). **Analysis of Sanctioned Vessels and Companies** ![image6.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image6_5ad1a35de5.png) **Image 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the years - Kpler._ ![image2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image2_bc03b6a9c7.png) **Image 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the years - Kpler._ A year-on-year comparison reveals a substantial rise in sanctioned entities, with 128 new vessels and 70 new companies, reflecting the ongoing enforcement measures and the broader scope of sanctions implemented over the past year. The increase in the diversity of sanctioned entities by country, as illustrated in the second graph, highlights the expanding geographical focus of these sanctions risks - with the biggest increase in vessels flagged under Panama (11), Liberia (12), Comoros (11), and Swaziland (6). The maritime industry continues to navigate a complex web of sanctions and export controls, with July 2024 witnessing developments in enforcement actions by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, while observing a quieter month from OFSI and EU without new sanctions on vessels and shipping companies. The recent updates include notable additions to the list of sanctioned vessels and companies: Sanctioned Vessels - TIREX (9203772): Crude Oil Tanker, Panama-flagged, 25 years old ([OFAC](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=49842)) - WANJI (9215103): Chemical/Oil Products Tanker, Panama-flagged, 25 years old ([OFAC](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=49840)) - MIROVA DYNAMIC (9237618): Crude Oil Tanker, unknown flag, 23 years old ([OFAC](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=49845)) - OCEANIC II (9275995): Oil products Tanker, Hong Kong-flagged, 23 years old ([OFAC](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=49841)) - KASPER (9293143): Crude Oil Tanker, Panama-flagged, 21 years old ([OFAC](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=49850)) Sanctioned Companies - BARCO SHIP MANAGEMENT INC (6389977): UAE-based company, commercial manager for TIREX, WANJI, and OCEANIC II ([OFAC](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=49839)) - SEA KNOT SHIPPING INC (6253546): Registered owner for MIROVA DYNAMIC ([OFAC](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=49844)) Understanding the pre-sanction behaviours of vessels such as WANJI, MIROVA DYNAMIC, and OCEANIC II provides critical insights into the complexities of maritime risk management and due diligence. **Risk & Compliance findings before the applied sanctions** The vessels WANJI, MIROVA DYNAMIC, and OCEANIC II had shown activities that raised compliance concerns before the sanctions were applied. These cases highlight the complexities in assessing risks in maritime operations, particularly with connections to sanctioned cargo, possible manipulation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), and high-risk ship-to-ship (STS) transfers. WANJI was linked to Iranian cargo (HSFO) as far back as 2023, with suspicions that it manipulated its AIS during a journey between Iran and the UAE during June 2023. This suggests that the vessel might have been trying to hide its true location, a common tactic used to avoid detection and evade sanctions. ![image5.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image5_da45da1937.jpg) **Image 3.** _Cargo with risks for WANJI - Kpler._ ![image8.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image8_911df005c2.jpg) **Image 4.** _AIS spoofing event for WANJI - Kpler._ ![image1.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image1_0a8118b6d5.jpg) **Image 5.** _Start of the spoofing event for WANJI - Kpler._ ![image3.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image3_1736913acb.jpg) **Image 6.** _End of the spoofing event for WANJI - Kpler._ MIROVA DYNAMIC was similarly involved in risky activities, connected to Iranian cargo (HSFO) in 2022 and participating in several high-risk STS transfers. These transfers, where cargo is moved between ships at sea, are often used to conceal the real origin or destination of the cargo, making it harder for regulators to track. ![image10.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image10_a4d60fcefa.jpg) **Image 7.** _Cargo with risks for MIROVA DYNAMIC - Kpler._ ![image9.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image9_01180bff71.jpg) **Image 8.** _High Risk STS transfers for MIROVA DYNAMIC - Kpler._ OCEANIC II had a more complicated risk profile, linked to Iranian cargo (HSFO) in May 2024 and Russian products (LSSRFO) from 2023. The vessel was also involved in high-risk STS transfers, further indicating its potential role in unlawful maritime operations. ![image7.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image7_7dfa85f2fa.jpg) **Image 9.** _Cargo with risks for OCEANIC II - Kpler._ ![image4.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image4_c3a832d3a4.jpg) **Image 10.** _High Risk STS transfers for OCEANIC II - Kpler._ These findings show that pre-existing patterns of behaviour like AIS manipulation and STS transfers are often early signs of future sanction breaches.

The vessel delivered 89,000 tons of freight cargo on its first voyage, which is a record amount for the carrier AAL. The ship was built and christened at the CSSC Huangpu Wenchong Shipyard in Guangzhou, China. Shortly after the christening ceremony held on April 26, the ship departed on its maiden voyage from Asia to Europe. Departing from China, the ship visited [TUTICORIN](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/2986?name=TUTICORIN&country=India) in India, transited around the Cape of Good Hope and the English Channel, and reached [KLAIPEDA](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/771?name=KLAIPEDA&country=Lithuania).

The group claims that cruising is too taxing an activity on the environment for something that is recreational in nature and, hence, should be ceased. In recent news, XR managed to prevent a cruise ship, the \"Jewel of the Seas,\" from docking in Amsterdam. A small group of protestors chained and glued themselves to the lock gates, obstructing the passage of the ship. The cruise ship had to reroute and head to the nearby IJmuiden on August 10. XR employed the same tactic a day later, on August 11, this time targeting the cruise ship [SEVEN SEAS MARINER](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:375209/mmsi:311622000/imo:9210139/vessel:SEVEN_SEAS_MARINER#overview). As negotiations bore no fruit, the Mobile Eenheid (ME), a specialized police unit trained to manage physically restrained protesters, put an end to the protest. This caused the ship to be delayed for around 3 hours entering IJmuiden. The local authorities decided not to arrest anyone to honor the right to protest, as the protestors did not pose a grave threat to anyone but later intervened to restore shipping traffic. Extinction Rebellion claims that presently, there is no emission-free fuel available at scale to sustain shipping. And while they consider logistics to be a necessary evil, they have condemned cruising primarily due to it being recreational in nature."

The shipment of LNG was loaded at Equinor’s Hammerfest LNG terminal and departed Norway on August 6, 2024. The shipment of LNG is to be used in the cooldown phase of the LNG plant, which involves reducing the temperature of liquefaction components in the plant shortly before beginning normal operations. LNG marked for use in the cooldown phase may also be used in the testing and purging of the plant, in which any impurities from the components are removed, and the systems are finally tested before starting regular operations. LNG earmarked for such use is usually exported under a special license; in this case, Qogir delivered the cargo under the license issued by the US Department of Energy (DOE). The new Plaquemines facility, once operational, will produce twenty million metric tons of LNG per year, making it the second-largest LNG production facility in the US. The plant is located at a 632-acre site along the Mississippi River, which already has a deep riverbed, not requiring dredging to accommodate larger vessels, which will no doubt be required as the LNG plant begins operation. The new plant will capture a significant share of the LNG supply market, poised to supply Europe, Asia, and South America. The US is currently the largest supplier of LNG in the world, having surpassed Qatar. This is part of a broader strategy of ramping up energy production in response to recent geopolitical events, such as sanctions on Russia."

The onset of a winter storm caused a rapid buildup of ice that the crew could not keep up with and clear in time. This led to a buildup of ice, leading to the vessel listing and then subsequently capsizing. Reports indicate that the risk of pollution is limited since the vessel was carrying only around 200 liters of diesel. The ship's owner is to deploy booms to contain any oil leak that does happen. The Shirshov Institute has stated that they are drawing out plans to raise the vessel in spring time if the weather is accommodating.

        "author": "Alex Stuart-Grumbar",
        "content": "The U.S. government is considering sweeping restrictions and financial penalties on Chinese-linked vessels calling at U.S. ports. These measures are primarily driven by economic and national security concerns, aiming to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains and revitalise U.S. shipbuilding, which remains uncompetitive. These measures could have far-reaching consequences, as nearly a third of the 57,000 cargo visits to the United States each year involve China—whether through vessel ownership, flag state, or construction. The proposed restrictions have the potential to reshape fleet operations, increase freight costs, and shift global chartering preferences. **Proposed Measures** The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has outlined several measures designed to curb China’s dominance in shipbuilding and logistics. Key proposals include: - Port entry fees of up to $1.5 million per visit for vessels built in Chinese shipyards. - Fees of up to $1 million per entry for Chinese-owned vessels operating in U.S. ports. - Additional surcharges for operators with pending orders from Chinese shipyards, discouraging future procurement. - Stricter regulatory checks and potential restrictions on Chinese-flagged vessels, increasing delays and compliance costs. Currently, a port call for a Chinese bulker or tanker can cost as little as $50,000. With the proposed fees, costs for affected vessels could increase by a staggering 3,000% **Measuring Exposure to U.S. Restrictions Using MarineTraffic Data** MarineTraffic data reveals the extent of Chinese maritime interests in U.S. waters and illustrates the widespread impact of these measures. **Chinese-Built Vessels** MarineTraffic data shows that 2,717 vessels built in Chinese shipyards have called at U.S. ports since January 2024. These vessels have made a total of 16,870 port calls in the U.S. over this period. China has steadily expanded its shipbuilding dominance, leveraging its global steel production supremacy and the cost efficiencies of its shipyards. These factors have positioned China as a near-monopoly in many commercial shipbuilding sectors, accounting for approximately 50% of global shipbuilding output and receiving over 70% of new orders last year. If the $1.5 million per-entry fee is enforced, it would significantly increase operational costs for shipowners using Chinese-built tonnage. The most immediate consequence would be a decline in future orders from Chinese yards, as shipowners seek alternatives in South Korea and Japan despite higher costs. However, the policy highlights a fundamental challenge: U.S. shipyards lack the capacity to meet growing demand. They currently produce only a handful of commercial vessels per year and have not built an LNG carrier since 1980. These measures may be aimed at curbing China's continued expansion in shipbuilding, as its control over steel production and cost-efficient yards enables it to outcompete global rivals. **Chinese-Flagged Vessels** Since the start of 2024, MarineTraffic data shows that 793 Chinese or Hong Kong-flagged vessels have called at U.S. ports, making a total of 4,657 port calls. These ships could face heightened scrutiny, delays, and elevated compliance costs, leading to potential rerouting of cargo flows. A likely response from Chinese operators would be to reflag vessels under alternative jurisdictions to evade restrictions. MarineTraffic continuously monitors flag changes, allowing businesses to track these shifts in real time and assess the regulatory risks associated with different registries. **Chinese-Owned Vessels** MarineTraffic’s ownership data reveals that 1,309 different vessels with some level of Chinese ownership have entered U.S. territorial waters in 2024. These vessels have made 7,186 port calls during this period. If the proposed $1 million port entry fee is implemented, it would impose substantial costs on Chinese-affiliated shipping companies and the charterers relying on these vessels. This financial burden is likely to prompt a shift toward non-Chinese-owned tonnage, as operators seek to minimise expenses and regulatory risks. Companies looking to restructure ownership or divest Chinese holdings can leverage MarineTraffic’s intelligence tools to navigate these changes effectively. **Broader Trade and Financial Implications** Even if implemented in a modified form, these measures will drive higher freight costs globally. Charterers seeking to avoid vessels that attract fees will increasingly favour non-Chinese-flagged, owned, and built tonnage, reshaping global chartering decisions. Financial institutions may also reassess their exposure to Chinese-built assets. Tighter credit terms and risk-averse lending practices could make financing more difficult for companies dependent on Chinese shipyards. Insurers and leasing companies may also adjust their risk models, increasing premiums or limiting coverage for Chinese-built vessels operating in U.S. waters. **What This Means for Global Shipping** While the proposed measures remain uncertain, they are already prompting strategic planning among stakeholders across the shipping industry. The Trump administration adds another layer of unpredictability, but bipartisan concerns over China’s influence in global trade suggest that some level of restriction is likely. Rather than a straightforward revenue-raising mechanism, these regulations may serve a broader strategic purpose—discouraging new orders from Chinese shipyards to curb China’s dominance in shipbuilding. However, given the limited capacity of U.S. shipyards to absorb this demand, the primary beneficiaries are more likely to be South Korean and Japanese builders rather than American ones. And while such stringent policies often begin as extreme proposals—only to be softened after industry pushback—their long-term impact on global trade remains a key concern. In anticipation of these changes, shipping firms may begin restructuring their fleets, segregating Chinese-built vessels from non-Chinese tonnage and assigning them to distinct trade lanes. This could lead to a fragmented global shipping network, potentially driving a shift in global trade routes, with some Chinese-built vessels being used more heavily in regions such as the Far East to Europe trades. If implemented, these policies would impose billions of dollars in additional costs on the shipping industry and global trade. **Key consequences include:** - Higher freight rates, increasing costs for businesses and consumers and contributing to inflation. - Charterers avoiding Chinese-built, owned, and flagged vessels to escape financial penalties. - A decline in Chinese shipyard orders, shifting demand to South Korea and Japan. - Increased pressure on U.S. shipbuilding, which lacks the capacity to meaningfully compete in commercial markets. - A shift of Chinese-linked shipping to Mexican and Canadian ports to bypass U.S. restrictions, with transshipment to U.S. ports. Ultimately, these measures could reshape global shipping, driving up costs, disrupting trade flows, and forcing fleet realignments. A public hearing is scheduled for 24 March 2025, which should shed more light on this topic. MarineTraffic will continue to monitor developments, providing real-time data, analytics, and intelligence to help industry players navigate this evolving regulatory landscape."

        "author": "Dimitris Ampatzidis",
        "content": "The maritime industry faces increasing challenges in tracking illicit activities such as dark ship-to-ship (STS) transfers and automatic identification system (AIS) spoofing, often linked to sanctions evasion. By analysing these activities, it is possible to assess risk and predict vessels that may be subject to sanctions in the near future. This report provides insights into the latest trends in dark STS transfers, AIS spoofing, and their combined occurrences over 2024, highlighting the involvement of non-sanctioned vessels and the typical timeline of sanctions imposition after deceptive events. **Trends in Dark STS Transfers and AIS Spoofing** Two primary high-risk activities have been identified: - **Dark STS:** transfers conducted with AIS transponders switched off. These events are verified via satellite imagery and pose significant compliance and operational risks. - **AIS Spoofing:** Deliberate manipulation of vessel location data to obscure real movements, making enforcement efforts more challenging. ![3-months rolling average events.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3_months_rolling_average_events_ace40c84c4.png) **Graph 1.** _3-months rolling average of AIS spoofing and dark STS events within 2024 - Kpler._ Data trends indicate a peak in these activities between July and August 2024. The increase prompted intensified regulatory enforcement, culminating in the U.S. imposing its largest sanctions package by January 10, 2025 ([Wright M., 2025](https://www.kpler.com/blog/us-sanctions-clamp-down-on-russian-oil-exports)). Over time, spoofing tactics have evolved, incorporating more advanced techniques to bypass detection. A three-month rolling average reveals that dark STS events reached approximately 200 occurrences at their peak in August 2024, while AIS spoofing incidents peaked at around 100. Following regulatory crackdowns starting in September 2024, these numbers gradually declined, with dark STS and AIS spoofing falling to 120 and 50 incidents, respectively, by December 2024. **Non-Sanctioned Vessels Engaging in These Events** In 2024: - **242** vessels were involved in dark STS operations. - **280** vessels engaged in AIS spoofing. - **81** vessels were involved in both illicit activities. ![Total vessels engaged in Dark STS and:or AIS Spoofing.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Total_vessels_engaged_in_Dark_STS_and_or_AIS_Spoofing_90cdd26e48.png) **Graph 2.** _Total number of vessels engaged in dark STS and/or AIS spoofing within 2024 - Kpler._ A key finding is that most vessels engaged in dark STS events and AIS spoofing were not under existing sanctions at the time. This highlights a major gap in regulatory frameworks, where operators take advantage of enforcement delays to continue illicit trade. Compliance teams relying solely on sanction lists may miss exposure to high-risk activities. ![Proportion of sanctioned and non-sanctioned vessels per event.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Proportion_of_sanctioned_and_non_sanctioned_vessels_per_event_80ae820386.png) **Graph 3.** _Proportion of sanctioned and non-sanctioned vessels per event within 2024 - Kpler._ Given that more than half of the vessels involved in these activities lacked an official sanctions designation at the time of their operations, proactive monitoring and real-time analytics are essential to mitigate risks. **How Long After a Dark Event Do Sanctions Follow?** Analysis of sanction timelines reveals the following patterns: - **34%** of vessels were sanctioned within **250 days** of their first dark event. - **30%** were sanctioned between **501-750 days** post-event. - **12%** were sanctioned within **251-500 days**. - **25%** of vessels faced sanctions after **750+ days**. ![Sanction after first event.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Sanction_after_first_event_fc4109e3ab.png) **Graph 4.** _Days spent after the first dark event and before sanctioning - Kpler._ This data underscores the enforcement lag, with many vessels operating illicitly for extended periods before facing regulatory action. The prolonged delay in some cases exposes gaps in enforcement, allowing vessels to continue high-risk activities before formal measures are imposed. **Towards a Predictive Approach: Identifying Future Sanctions Risk** On the anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, February 24th, both the [UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-largest-sanctions-package-against-russia-since-2022) (FCDO) and the [EU](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/02/24/16th-package-of-sanctions-on-russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-eu-lists-additional-48-individuals-and-35-entities/) announced new sanctions targeting grey/shadow vessels, including those already sanctioned by OFAC, while OFAC focused on Iranian-affiliated vessels. Notably, all 51 vessels sanctioned were previously flagged by Kpler's Risk and Compliance tool as part of the grey/shadow fleet, with nine of them highlighted as high risk due to dark STS and AIS spoofing activities observed over recent months. While sanctions are often the result of political decisions, our analysis demonstrates that leveraging historical data allows us to make statistically significant predictions about vessels meeting these high-risk criteria, enabling proactive compliance strategies. Predictive analytics can identify potential future sanctions risk by tracking vessel activities over the past twelve months and establishing behavioral patterns that are correlated with eventual sanctions. This method allows for a forward-looking approach to manage compliance risks proactively. Based on current trends, it is estimated that **over 370 vessels are at high risk of inclusion in future sanction lists**. By implementing real-time tracking and predictive modeling, industry stakeholders can better manage compliance risks before formal sanctions are imposed, strengthening risk mitigation efforts and enhancing operational decision-making. Implementing real-time tracking and predictive modeling enables industry stakeholders to proactively manage compliance risks before formal sanctions are imposed. This forward-looking approach strengthens risk mitigation efforts and enhances operational decision-making.

According to GFS, the vessel, built in 1998, is particularly well-suited for these operations due to its relatively short length of approximately 96 metres. Additionally, the stainless steel tanks can be cleaned within 24 hours, enhancing flexibility. The economic reasons behind the expansion into West Africa are the enormous growth and expansion opportunities in the region, explained Bijan Shahbaz, Managing Partner and COO of GFS. “With some of the most dedicated professionals in the industry, we are well-prepared to provide our customers with even greater value by delivering a smooth, seamless service that sets new standards in this region”, he stated."

        "content": "Escalating sanctions in February 2025 have intensified the crackdown on illicit oil trade, targeting a record number of vessels and companies linked to Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan crude exports. As enforcement tightens and shadow fleet operations come under greater scrutiny, traders, insurers, and shipping analysts must navigate a rapidly shifting landscape of supply disruptions, rising compliance risks, and evolving trade routes. Meanwhile, broader geopolitical uncertainty - shifting U.S. policies, unresolved trade agreements, and fragile international alliances - casts a long shadow over what comes next. **Key takeaways** - In February 2025 alone, **51 additional vessels and 19 companies were sanctioned**, bringing the total number of sanctioned vessels to 1,301 and companies to 540. - Newly sanctioned vessels transported over **208.3 million barrels of crude in 2024**, valued at approximately **$15.24 billion**, highlighting the scale of illicit shipments now under restrictions. - The **revocation of Chevron’s Venezuela waiver from 1st of March** is expected to cut production from 900 kbd to 700 kbd by August, tightening supply for U.S. Gulf refiners already struggling with declining Mexican output. - The sharp rise in sanctioned ships, including 183 vessels blacklisted in January 2025 alone, is expected to **push up freight costs**, restrict vessel availability, and intensify compliance risks for insurers and traders. **Market Analysis** In February 2025, the U.S. introduced new sanctions on the shipping industry, targeting vessels involved in illicit oil trade, particularly those linked to Iran and Russia. The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ([OFAC](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0026)) sanctioned over 30 Iranian oil tankers that were part of a “shadow fleet,” moving millions of barrels through ship-to-ship (STS) transfers. Additionally, multiple shipping companies across the UAE, Hong Kong, China, and India were penalised for facilitating these transactions. Some firms, like India-based Marshal Ship Management, were caught providing falsified documents and crew for sanctioned vessels. The [UK followed with its largest sanctions package since 2022](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-largest-sanctions-package-against-russia-since-2022), adding 40 more Russian tankers to its blacklist. These vessels, which had transported over $5 billion worth of oil in six months, are now under asset freezes and trade bans, bringing the total number of UK-sanctioned oil tankers to 133. The [European Union also expanded its restrictions](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/02/24/three-years-of-russia-s-full-scale-invasion-and-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-eu-adopts-its-16th-package-of-economic-and-individual-measures/), adding 74 vessels to its sanctions list for their role in evading sanctions by moving Russian oil under different flags or through ship-to-ship transfers. At the same time, the U.S. revoked Chevron’s license to operate in Venezuela, cutting off exports of heavy crude that were crucial for U.S. refiners. With Venezuelan production expected to drop from 900 kbd to 700 kbd by August, U.S. Gulf Coast refiners now face a supply gap in heavy crude, which was [already tightening due to declining Mexican output](https://terminal.kpler.com/insight/research/research-updates/trump-cancelling-chevron-s-permit-in-venezuela-hurts-the-us-gulf-the-most). This move is likely to further strain the global heavy crude market, leading to increased demand for alternatives such as [Canadian and Middle Eastern sour crudes](https://terminal.kpler.com/insight/research/reports/chevron-waiver-removal-in-venezuela-will-tighten-heavy-crude-markets-in-the-us). The combination of U.S. sanctions on Russia and Iran, coupled with Venezuela’s supply disruption, is reshaping the global oil and tanker markets, forcing refiners to seek alternative sources to maintain operations. **Implications for the Shipping Industry** Sanctions on vessels and shipping companies have surged over the past year, with a sharp increase in newly blacklisted tankers involved in illicit oil trade. In the last month alone, 51 additional vessels have been targeted, along with 19 shipping companies. In 2024, these newly sanctioned vessels transported a large amount of oil - 208.3 million barrels in total. This included 117.57 million barrels from Russia and 71.45 million barrels from Iran. The flags under which these tankers operate reveal a pattern of convenience, with many shifting registrations to jurisdictions less likely to enforce international sanctions. ![Picture1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture1_b35f1fcef4.png) **Graph 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the last five years (February 2020 to February 2025) - Kpler._ The number of ships and companies facing sanctions increased rapidly between late 2024 and early 2025 due to growing political tensions and stricter enforcement of energy trade restrictions. Over the 12 months leading to February 2025, 471 more vessels were sanctioned, bringing the total to 1,301. The biggest increase happened in January 2025, when 183 ships were blacklisted in just one month. The number of sanctioned companies also rose significantly, growing by 213 over the year to reach 540, with the largest jump of 70 in January. These increases were driven by new U.S., UK, and EU sanctions aimed at stopping Russian and Iranian oil trade, particularly through secret ship movements, ship-to-ship transfers, and false registrations. ![Picture2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture2_f40511abca.png) **Graph 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the last two years (February 2023 to February 2025) - Kpler._ The number of sanctioned vessels across different flag registries has increased sharply from February 2023 to February 2025, with a notable acceleration in late 2024 and early 2025. Iranian- and Russian-flagged vessels continue to represent the largest share, but the use of alternative flags, such as Panama, Barbados, Guyana, and Curacao, has grown significantly. By February 2025, the total number of sanctioned vessels under these top 10 flag registries had surpassed 600, more than doubling from early 2023 levels. The rapid expansion of sanctions targeting Russian and Iranian oil shipments, along with increased scrutiny of deceptive shipping practices, has driven a diversification of flagged vessels, with new entries such as Djibouti and Sao Tome and Principe playing a more prominent role in recent months. ![Picture3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture3_e9ddc6632a.png) **Graph 3.** _Total vessels and companies added to sanctions lists over the last twelve months (March 2024 to February 2025) - Kpler._ While the monthly additions remained relatively steady from March to September 2024, with most months seeing fewer than 30 new designations, a sharp rise began in October 2024, when 48 vessels and 30 companies were blacklisted. This trend continued through the end of the year, with December recording 51 sanctioned vessels and 30 companies. However, January 2025 saw an unprecedented increase, with 183 vessels and 70 companies added in a single month, marking the largest wave of sanctions over the period. This surge aligns with intensified geopolitical tensions and expanded U.S., UK, and EU sanctions targeting Russian and Iranian oil networks, reflecting a concerted effort to disrupt illicit shipping activities at the start of the new year. By February 2025, the numbers had moderated, though 51 additional vessels and 19 companies were still sanctioned, indicating that enforcement efforts remain ongoing. In 2024 alone, these newly added vessels exported approximately 117.57 million barrels of crude—71.44 million barrels from Iran and 1.44 million barrels from Venezuela. These tankers have been instrumental in sustaining exports despite restrictions, utilising ship-to-ship (STS) transfers and deceptive shipping tactics. The targeting of these vessels represents a broader effort to disrupt shadow fleet operations, reflecting a tightening enforcement landscape that is reshaping global crude trade flows and increasing risks for market participants engaging with these entities. The total estimated value of these shipments, based on an average crude price of $80 per barrel, is approximately $15.24 billion. **Conclusion** The expansion of sanctions in February 2025 introduces significant risks to oil procurement strategies, particularly for those traders relying on Russian, Iranian, or Venezuelan crude. The growing list of blacklisted vessels increases the difficulty of securing reliable shipping routes, potentially tightening spot market availability and raising freight costs. Refiners, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast, face added supply pressures following the revocation of Chevron’s Venezuela waiver, forcing a shift toward alternative heavy crude sources such as Canadian and Middle Eastern grades. The impact of these sanctions extends beyond immediate supply disruptions - traders must now navigate an increasingly complex compliance landscape, where dealing with sanctioned entities, even indirectly, carries heightened legal and financial risks. For insurers and compliance analysts, the sharp rise in sanctioned vessels signals increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny, compliance violations, and operational uncertainty. The growing use of alternative flag registries and deceptive shipping tactics, including dark STS transfers, poses challenges in risk assessment and liability coverage. Insurers will likely tighten underwriting criteria for vessels operating in high-risk corridors, while compliance analysts must closely monitor evolving trade patterns and enforcement trends to anticipate disruptions. The shifting regulatory environment reinforces the need for more sophisticated tracking mechanisms and due diligence to mitigate exposure to sanctioned fleets and maintain supply chain integrity. _To find out more about Kpler’s Risk & Compliance offering, visit [here](https://www.kpler.com/demos/risk-compliance-demo?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=risk&compliance_commodities_maritime_news_demo_request)._"

The one missing crewmember from the [Solong](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:122649/mmsi:255805837/imo:9322554/vessel:SOLONG) has been presumed dead after a search and rescue effort was called off on 10 March. Environmental groups continue to warn of disastrous consequences to marine wildlife due to the jet fuel spill from the Stena Immaculate. However, authorities have assured that the impact from the leak remains limited. The Coast Guard has placed a 1 km exclusion zone around the accident site and both vessels. There had been a moment of panic when a Lloyd’s List report revealed that the [Solong](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:122649/mmsi:255805837/imo:9322554/vessel:SOLONG) had been carrying the highly hazardous and toxic sodium cyanide. However, these fears were quelled when the shipowner, Ernst Russ, explained that the containers carrying cyanide had been emptied prior to the collision. They further assured that the four containers that had held sodium cyanide are being actively monitored. Despite the accident, both vessels are expected to remain afloat following the dousing of the fire. Coastguard agencies have stated that the Solong is expected to be towed away from the shore, following which salvage operations on the vessel can be initiated. The captain of the Solong has been identified as a 59-year-old Russian national who has been apprehended under charges of gross negligence and manslaughter. Questions have been raised regarding the incident as to why multiple safety systems on the Solong failed simultaneously and led to the accident. Reports indicate there has been no indication of malicious intent behind the accident; however, foul play has not been ruled out. Poor visibility at the time of the incident is also being claimed to have played a role. Investigations by multiple authorities have been launched into the incident. The British Marine Accident Investigation Branch is to gather preliminary evidence, whereas the US and Portuguese authorities, the states where the vessels are registered, bear the burden of investigating the accident more thoroughly."

The [Solong](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:122649/mmsi:255805837/imo:9322554/vessel:SOLONG), which was traveling at a speed of around 18 knots, struck the moored [Stena Immaculate](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:4651569/mmsi:368108000/imo:9693018/vessel:STENA_IMMACULATE) at 9:48 AM UTC, leading to a substantial hole in its hull, a ruptured cargo tank, and a fire breaking out along with jet fuel leaking into the sea. The fire aboard the [Stena Immaculate](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:4651569/mmsi:368108000/imo:9693018/vessel:STENA_IMMACULATE) was extinguished by the next day; however, the fire on the [Solong](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:122649/mmsi:255805837/imo:9322554/vessel:SOLONG) continued to burn even a day after the collision. 13 crew members from the cargo ship [Solong](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:122649/mmsi:255805837/imo:9322554/vessel:SOLONG) and the 23 crew members of the [Stena Immaculate](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:4651569/mmsi:368108000/imo:9693018/vessel:STENA_IMMACULATE) were evacuated. The one missing crewmember from the [Solong](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:122649/mmsi:255805837/imo:9322554/vessel:SOLONG) has been presumed dead after a search and rescue effort was called off on 10 March. Environmental groups continue to warn of disastrous consequences to marine wildlife due to the jet fuel spill from the Stena Immaculate. However, authorities have assured that the impact from the leak remains limited. The Coast Guard has placed a 1 km exclusion zone around the accident site and both vessels. There had been a moment of panic when a Lloyd’s List report revealed that the [Solong](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:122649/mmsi:255805837/imo:9322554/vessel:SOLONG) had been carrying the highly hazardous and toxic sodium cyanide. However, these fears were quelled when the shipowner, Ernst Russ, explained that the containers carrying cyanide had been emptied prior to the collision. They further assured that the four containers that had held sodium cyanide are being actively monitored. Despite the accident, both vessels are expected to remain afloat following the dousing of the fire. Coastguard agencies have stated that the Solong is expected to be towed away from the shore, following which salvage operations on the vessel can be initiated. The captain of the Solong has been identified as a 59-year-old Russian national who has been apprehended under charges of gross negligence and manslaughter. Questions have been raised regarding the incident as to why multiple safety systems on the Solong failed simultaneously and led to the accident. Reports indicate there has been no indication of malicious intent behind the accident; however, foul play has not been ruled out. Poor visibility at the time of the incident is also being claimed to have played a role. Investigations by multiple authorities have been launched into the incident. The British Marine Accident Investigation Branch is to gather preliminary evidence, whereas the US and Portuguese authorities, the states where the vessels are registered, bear the burden of investigating the accident more thoroughly. The nature of the accident and the resulting damages, multiple insurance claims from differing parties are expected to be made. Hull and Machinery (H&M) Insurance, which covers damage to the ships, including their hulls, machinery, and equipment, is expected to be significant but still less than claims from liability and environmental cleanups. The combined insurance value of both the vessels is estimated to range between $50 million and $100 million, which includes potential salvage costs. Both the vessels involved in the collision are expected to be marked off as a total loss (the cost of repairs exceeds the cost of the vessel itself) following the incident. Protection and Indemnity (P&I) Insurance is expected to be the biggest component in the insurance claims to come. These include third-party liabilities, including environmental damages, pollution cleanup, and injury or death of crew members. The high cost of environmental cleanup owing to the leaked jet fuel and potential legal liabilities is expected to be the biggest financial contributor to insurance claims. Finally, the Marine Cargo Insurance, which covers the loss of cargo being transported, will also be a significant component of the claims. The jet fuel, which is estimated to be completely lost in the incident, is expected to be claimed for insurance by the owner of the cargo. However, it is important to note that investigations by the US and the Portuguese governments into the incident have not yet been finalized. If malicious actors or sabotage are proven, it can significantly complicate insurance proceedings, with the denial of insurance coverage also becoming a possibility. The total expected losses, including all of these factors, are estimated to range from $100 million to $300 million."

        "content": "Flag risks are increasingly shaping maritime due diligence, impacting regulatory scrutiny, financial exposure, and operational integrity. The strategic use of high-risk flags in evasive practices, such as flag-hopping and shadow fleet operations, underscores the complexities of compliance in global shipping. Strengthening risk assessment frameworks and integrating systematic flag evaluations are essential for mitigating exposure and ensuring resilience in an evolving regulatory landscape. **Key takeaways** - **High-risk flags pose increasing compliance challenges**: Over 5,000 vessels (14.5% of the global fleet) operate under registries with less than 10% ratification of IMO/ILO conventions, increasing exposure to enforcement actions. - **Sanctioned vessel operations have doubled since early 2023**: Over 600 sanctioned vessels operate under high-risk flags, facilitating the movement of Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan crude despite restrictions. - **Insurers and financial institutions are tightening policies**: Premiums are rising, detentions are increasing, and financing is being restricted for vessels flagged under jurisdictions with weak compliance records. - **Flag-hopping remains a major enabler of sanctions evasion**: Shadow fleet tankers frequently shift flag registrations to maintain trade flows despite regulatory pressures. **The growing need for flag risks screening** ![Image 13-3-25 at 5.12 PM.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Image_13_3_25_at_5_12_PM_5dbf11afdc.jpg) **Graph 1.** _Countries with weak compliance on IMO and ILO rules - Kpler._ Maritime due diligence frameworks are under increasing strain as **flag state compliance gaps** introduce additional financial and regulatory risk. Vessel registries serve as primary regulatory authorities, yet their **adherence to international safety, environmental, and labour standards remains inconsistent**. A significant proportion of flag states fail to enforce more than 10% of International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International Labor Organization (ILO) regulations, exposing shipowners and charterers to: - Higher risk of sanctions violations - Port State Control (PSC) detentions - Operational disruptions and financial penalties Recent Kpler data analysis highlights critical jurisdictions with compliance gaps, revealing that **14.5% of the global fleet operates under low-ratification flags**. This classification includes nations such as the Marshall Islands, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Palau, where selective ratification creates uncertainty over compliance obligations. _Key Data Point: Afghanistan, Somalia, and South Sudan have not ratified essential IMO frameworks, while Bahrain, Brunei, and Qatar lack adherence to ILO conventions, increasing seafarer risk exposure._ A structured approach to flag risk screening allows stakeholders to quantify non-compliance exposure, integrating these insights into Know Your Customer (KYC) and risk management protocols. Systematic evaluation of flag state governance can mitigate regulatory uncertainty and enhance trading resilience. ![Picture1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture1_b0b53023da.png) **Graph 2.** _Share of ships registered under flags with weak compliance on IMO and ILO rules - Kpler._ **How flag risks relate to sanctions and the grey/shadow fleet** The [February 2025 surge in sanctions](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/maritime-news/34/risk-and%20compliance/2025/11921/navigating-the-complexities-of-maritime-sanctions-a-february) has exposed the extent to which high-risk flags facilitate evasive shipping practices, with **51 additional vessels blacklisted in a single month**. **Key Trends:** - **Flag-hopping as a primary evasion tool**: Tankers carrying Russian, Iranian, or Venezuelan crude frequently switch flags to obscure ownership structures and evade tracking. - **Rise of alternative registries**: Panama, Barbados, and Curacao continue to attract high-risk fleets. - **STS transfers in high-risk zones**: Weakly regulated flags facilitate ship-to-ship (STS) crude transfers, increasing opacity in global energy flows. The number of sanctioned vessels under the top 10 high-risk flag states has doubled since early 2023, reflecting a shift towards more complex evasion techniques. **Financial and reputational risk** Flag risk exposure directly impacts vessel valuation, operational costs, and market access. Owners operating under low-ratification flags face: - **Tighter underwriting criteria**: Insurers are raising premiums for flagged vessels linked to evasive trade. - **Higher detention risk**: PSC authorities are targeting weak registries with increased enforcement actions. - **Restricted financial access**: Banks are withdrawing financing options from high-risk fleet operators. Recent insurance data suggests that underwriters have increased premiums by 30-40% for vessels flagged under low-ratification jurisdictions. Financial institutions are now integrating flag-based risk scoring models to pre-screen financing applications. **How to integrate flag risk screening** Mitigating exposure to flag risk-driven disruptions requires a proactive compliance framework. Kpler recommends: - Prioritising vessels flagged under high-ratification jurisdictions. - Leveraging real-time tracking to identify high-risk flag-hopping patterns. - Embedding flag risk assessments into sanctions screening protocols to detect evasive shipping tactics. By adopting data-driven flag evaluations, insurers, financiers, and charterers can enhance due diligence and reduce exposure to regulatory and financial penalties.

The vessel, carrying 11 individuals including crew and technical-scientific personnel of different nationalities was performing seabed monitoring operations. The vessel reportedly approached the coast to seek shelter from adverse weather conditions when it struck a shallow seabed coming close to the rocky cliff in the area. ![FUGRO MERCATOR ran aground off Italian coast.](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/FUGRO_MERCATOR_134cffcff6.png)*Research vessel FUGRO MERCATOR, image credit: Guardia Costiera* The vessel sustained damage, leading to water ingress into the hull. The crew initially tried to contain the flooding; however, the water eventually reached and damaged some engine parts, resulting in a complete blackout of onboard equipment. The Livorno Maritime Directorate coordinated a rescue operation and dispatched a patrol boat, CP 805 of the Portoferraio Port Authority, to evacuate all crew members and scientific personnel. All the rescued individuals were reported to be in good health. The transshipment operations were complicated by the blackout, the vessel’s proximity to the rocks, and rough sea conditions. The Italian Coast Guard aerial and maritime monitoring has detected no oil pollution so far. The exact cause of the grounding remains under investigation. The Portoferraio Port Authority has instructed Fugro Mercator’s shipping company to arrange for the vessel’s removal for environmental protection reasons. A specialised company has commenced underwater inspections to develop a recovery plan."

The vessel’s superstructure and its hull have been designed from the ground up to maximize efficiency and carrying capacity. The weight of the hull has been kept low while increasing the hydrodynamics and aerodynamics of the structure. In addition to the Stena Futuro’s efficient fundamental design, the vessel will also be equipped with technologies to cut back on its emissions. The vessel will feature hybrid propulsion with highly fuel-efficient engines. The vessel will also have batteries connected with solar panels for emission-free operation, such as when the vessel is at ports. A waste heat recovery system will recirculate the residual heat from the engines aboard the vessel for heating needs as well as for power generation. An air lubrication system that uses air bubbles beneath the waterline to reduce the vessel’s friction in water is also present in the vessel to further optimize its performance. Keeping in line with the deadline, the 40-meter-tall retractable wing sails that are to be equipped on the Stena Futuro have already passed the necessary simulations and tests and are projected to enhance the fuel savings of the vessel by 15%. The final design is expected to start production in the coming years, and the new breed of vessels is expected to play a large part in Stena Line’s emission reduction commitments."

        "author": "Alex Stuart-Grumbar",
        "content": "The U.S. is contemplating one of the most significant shifts in maritime trade policy in recent memory. A proposed executive order—currently being developed by the Trump administration and coordinated through the National Security Council—seeks public comment on introducing new port fees of up to $1.5 million per call on vessels connected to China, whether by ownership, flag, or place of construction. These measures are part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on Chinese maritime infrastructure. If implemented, the fees could increase port call costs for affected vessels by as much as 3,000%, potentially reshaping global shipping dynamics. <br><br> Given the structure of the global fleet, the implications are considerable. MarineTraffic data shows that nearly 28% of all commercial vessels worldwide are linked to China in one or more ways. The exposure differs by sector, with MarineTraffic data showing that one in two vessels in some categories will be affected. This reflects China’s longstanding role as a central player in global shipbuilding and maritime logistics—a position built over decades of investment and industrial consolidation. The proposed policy introduces a new variable into global shipping calculations, with potential impacts across key cargo segments and trading routes. <br><br> ![image5.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image5_8e190d6321.png) _Source: MarineTraffic_ **Measuring Exposure: China's Maritime Reach** <br><br> China’s role in global shipping is deeply embedded and highly visible at U.S. ports. MarineTraffic data shows that since January 2024, approximately one in three vessels calling US ports were built in China. That’s a substantial presence in its own right—yet it represents only one part of the broader picture. <br><br> When taking into account all vessels linked to China—whether through construction, ownership, or flag (China or Hong Kong) —the exposure rises significantly. In the dry bulk segment, **49% of vessels calling at U.S. ports in 2024 have some form of Chinese link**. For container ships, the figure is 38%; for tankers, 30%. Even among gas carriers and Ro-Ro vessels, exposure stands at 18% and 15%, respectively. <br><br> ![image3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image3_b6e10d446d.png) _Source: MarineTraffic_ <br><br> This reflects China’s dominance in global shipbuilding. Chinese yards account for roughly 50% of global output, and secured over 70% of new commercial ship orders in 2024. Nearly 37% of the global dry bulk fleet and 24% of container ships were built in China. The country’s competitive advantage—driven by scale, cost-efficient production, and control over steel supply—has allowed it to outpace rivals in South Korea and Japan. <br><br> This position is no accident. China’s dominance in shipbuilding has been driven by long-term state support, a vast and cost-efficient labour force, and favourable access to domestic steel—often the single largest input cost in ship construction. Yards benefit not only from cheap raw materials but also from integrated supply chains and financing from state-backed lenders, allowing them to offer attractive pricing and terms. Unlike their counterparts in Korea and Japan, Chinese builders have also been more flexible in accommodating bespoke designs, further widening their appeal. Combined with improving quality standards and accelerated delivery timelines, China has positioned itself not just as a shipbuilder, but as the default production base for much of the global fleet. <br><br> Should the proposed $1.5 million per-call fee on Chinese-linked vessels be implemented, the impact would be immediate. While future orders may shift to non-Chinese yards, capacity constraints—particularly in the U.S., where commercial shipbuilding is limited—mean that any realignment will be slow and costly. The U.S. has not built an LNG carrier in over four decades and currently produces only a small number of merchant ships each year. <br><br> The data makes clear: Chinese-linked vessels are not a marginal presence in U.S. trade—they are a structural feature. Replacing them will take far more than policy—it will require time, global coordination, and substantial industrial investment. <br><br> **Dry Bulk: Heavy Exposure to U.S. Fees** <br><br> Dry bulk is the most exposed vessel segment to the proposed U.S. port fees targeting Chinese-linked ships. MarineTraffic data shows that 48.7% of the global dry bulk fleet is connected to China through construction, ownership, or flag—the highest level of exposure across all vessel types. This includes standard bulk carriers as well as general cargo vessels and multipurpose (MPP) ships. Notably, the more specialised the dry bulk vessel, the more likely it is to be linked to China, further increasing the risk of disruption in niche shipping segments. <br><br> ![image6.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image6_7fc33bde31.png) _Source: MarineTraffic_ Since January 2024, more than 8,000 dry bulk carriers with ties to China have called at U.S. ports. Of these, 37.4% were built in Chinese shipyards, 4.75% are owned—at any level—by Chinese entities, and 5.65% sail under a Chinese flag. This deep integration underscores the vulnerability of dry bulk trade flows, which support critical sectors of U.S. industry, from agriculture and energy to construction and manufacturing. <br><br> According to Kpler cargo data, the United States exported over 300 million tonnes of dry bulk cargo in 2024, accounting for roughly 6% of global dry bulk flows. While this may seem modest at first glance, it represents a significant share for a single country—highlighting the U.S.'s pivotal role in global commodity supply chains. These exports include vital cargoes such as soybeans, coal, corn, and petcoke. On the import side, the U.S. received around 125 million tonnes of dry bulk goods, with cement, steel, and fertilisers making up the lion’s share. Any disruption to the availability or routing of dry bulk vessels—especially at the scale implied by the proposed port fees—could trigger cascading effects across global supply chains and industrial operations. <br><br> The financial impact of these fees is staggering. With the proposed $1.5 million surcharge per port call, voyage costs could rise by as much as 161%—a significant increase that would directly raise freight rates for critical trade routes. For example, coal shipments from the U.S. Gulf to Europe could see voyage costs rise from $12.40 to $32.40 per tonne—a 161% increase. Grain exports from Houston to Rotterdam would jump from $16.15 to $39.23 per tonne, a 143% increase. Petcoke cargoes to Turkey would climb from $23.40 to $53.40 per tonne, up 128%. <br><br> ![image1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image1_6f4ef587b8.png) Source: Kpler Insight, Argus <br><br> <ul> Even under a lower $500,000 fee scenario, the cost implications remain significant: coal shipments to the ARA region would increase by 54%, grain to Rotterdam by 48%, and petcoke to Turkey by 43%. These are not marginal changes—they represent structural cost increases across key routes that underpin U.S. exports. </ul> See the table below for a full breakdown of cost impacts by route and cargo type: ![image2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image2_0a9502e557.png) Source: Kpler Insight, Argus <br><br> These cost hikes would make U.S. exports far less competitive on the global market and drive up the price of dry bulk imports that support domestic industries. U.S. manufacturers relying on imported steel, cement, and fertilisers would face higher input costs, with these expenses inevitably passed on to the consumer. In essence, the proposed fees risk acting as a self-imposed tax on both U.S. exporters and industrial buyers. <br><br> The ripple effects are already emerging. There are reports that vessel owners are refusing to offer ships for future U.S. coal shipments, citing regulatory uncertainty and cost risk. The agricultural sector alone could face up to over a billion dollars in additional annual freight costs—threatening U.S. competitiveness in an already tight and price-sensitive global market. <br><br> **Container Shipping: Navigating Potential Disruption** <br><br> In the container sector, the picture is more nuanced. MarineTraffic data shows that 38% of container ships globally are linked to China—whether through construction, ownership, or flag. Of this, 24% are Chinese-built, 18% are Chinese-owned, and nearly 14% sail under the Chinese flag. <br><br> While only 22% of container ships calling at U.S. ports are Chinese-built, over 11% fly Chinese or Hong Kong flags—more than any other segment. This suggests that reflagging may be a quick fix for some operators. But even so, China’s presence in newbuild deliveries is only growing. Globally, over 70% of container ship orders in 2024 went to Chinese yards. <br><br> The implications for U.S. importers are considerable. Any disruption in Asia–U.S. West Coast traffic could spill over into inventories, port congestion, and freight costs, just as supply chains were beginning to stabilise post-COVID. <br><br> **Tankers: A Third of U.S.-Calling Vessels Linked to China** <br><br> The tanker segment shows substantial exposure to China across the global fleet. MarineTraffic data indicates that 30.1% of tankers worldwide are linked to China—through construction (21.4%), ownership (14.6%), or flag (7.9%). <br><br> These vessels are the backbone of international energy flows, moving crude oil, refined products, and chemicals across long-haul corridors between the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Latin America. China-linked tankers are deeply embedded in these routes, and any disruption to their operations—whether through punitive port fees or regulatory restrictions—would strain the availability of compliant vessels. <br><br> The resulting costs go beyond the fee itself. With fewer eligible tankers in the mix, scheduling challenges increase, trade patterns become less efficient, and charterers may need to reroute or delay cargoes. For refiners, traders, and shippers, this means higher freight rates, longer lead times, and reduced flexibility. <br><br> Replacing Chinese-linked capacity will take years. Redirecting orders to Korean or Japanese yards, or reshuffling ownership structures, is not a quick fix. In the near term, the proposed U.S. measures introduce not only financial penalties but operational uncertainty. The impact will ripple far beyond shipping desks, affecting fuel costs, delivery timelines, and trade competitiveness worldwide. <br><br> **Gas Carriers: Strategically Vulnerable** <br><br> Gas carriers—including both LNG and LPG vessels—may have lower direct exposure to China compared to sectors like dry bulk or containers, but their strategic significance is notably higher. MarineTraffic data indicates substantial Chinese involvement in global gas carrier operations: 16.5% of LNG carriers and 19.0% of LPG carriers worldwide have connections to China. Specifically, among LNG carriers, 7.1% are Chinese-built, 13.9% are Chinese-owned, and 4.7% sail under the Chinese flag. For LPG carriers, these figures are slightly different, with 10.5% built in China, 10.5% Chinese-owned, and 3.7% Chinese-flagged. <br><br> Energy industry experts caution that imposing restrictions on Chinese-linked gas carriers could disrupt crucial supply routes connecting Asia, Europe, and Latin America. If such measures are strictly enforced, the global market could shift in favour of competitors like Qatar and Australia, nations already benefiting from significant scale advantages in LNG shipping. <br><br> **Vehicle Carriers: A Rare Exception** Ro-Ro vessels, which carry vehicles and rolling equipment, are the least exposed segment. Just 13% are Chinese-built and virtually none are flagged or owned in China. These ships may avoid the brunt of new maritime rules, though they could still be affected indirectly by congestion, fleet shortages, or cascading effects from other segments. <br><br> That said, the sector is not immune to broader trade frictions. The Trump administration has also proposed new tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles, meaning auto shipping could be hit on multiple fronts. Even if Ro-Ro vessels themselves escape direct penalties, the cargo they carry may soon become entangled in the same geopolitical crossfire. <br><br> Looking ahead, the exposure of the vehicle carrier sector is set to rise sharply. China has secured over 80% of the global newbuilding orderbook for Ro-Ro carriers. This orderbook represents just under a third of the existing Ro-Ro fleet, suggesting that China is on course to dominate future capacity in this sector. If port fees are applied to new vessels based on build location, automakers and logistics providers could face significantly higher shipping costs as these ships enter service over the coming years. <br><br> **The Strategic Trade-Off** <br><br> The proposed restrictions represent one of the most significant interventions in maritime trade policy in recent decades. At their core, these measures aim to reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese shipbuilding and logistics. However, with nearly a third of all U.S. port calls involving Chinese-built, owned, or flagged vessels, the fallout will extend far beyond Chinese stakeholders. <br><br> Exporters of coal, grain, and energy are already feeling the effects. Shipping availability is tightening, and some operators are preemptively cancelling sailings or reconfiguring trade lanes in anticipation of regulatory enforcement. These disruptions not only risk raising freight rates—undermining the competitiveness of U.S. exports—but also carry direct consequences for American shipowners. MarineTraffic data shows that at least 193 Chinese-built ships are under U.S. beneficial ownership. <br><br> The largest exposures include Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. (39 ships), Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd. (34), and Tidewater Marine Service Inc. (29). Other U.S.-linked owners include MT Maritime Management (7), JP Morgan Chase (6), Sunstone Ships (5), Seabulk Fleet Management (4), and Tropical Shipping (1), with a further 68 ships held by other entities. <br><br> ![image1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image1_9d5ab505d3.png) _Source: MarineTraffic_ <br><br> The exposure spans a wide array of vessel types. Bulk carriers dominate the picture, accounting for 104 of the 193 ships. Offshore supply vessels follow with 27, while container ships number 15. The remainder includes general cargo ships (11), oil/chemical tankers (7), crude oil tankers (6), heavy load carriers (3), drill ships (2), Ro-Ro carriers (2), and a handful of specialised vessels such as anchor handlers, tugs, and passenger ships. <br><br> This broad reliance on Chinese shipyards illustrates the depth of integration between U.S. maritime interests and Chinese industrial capacity. The proposed fees may aim to shift future procurement away from China, but in the near term, they risk penalising domestic firms, disrupting trade flows, and raising costs for U.S. exporters. <br><br> As highlighted in this report, MarineTraffic data shows that no segment is entirely insulated. Even sectors like Ro-Ro, which are less exposed, could face ripple effects through vessel availability, pricing pressure, or retaliatory tariffs. <br><br> While the policy may succeed in discouraging future procurement from Chinese yards, the reality remains that U.S. shipyards are currently unable to meet global demand, with key capabilities—such as LNG carrier construction—unavailable domestically. In the near term, shipyards in Korea and Japan, already competitively positioned, are more likely to benefit. As the global shipping landscape undergoes this imminent shift, stakeholders must prepare for the far-reaching ramifications of these proposed port fees. With MarineTraffic’s advanced maritime intelligence, companies can swiftly adapt to changes in vessel connections, rerouting, and rising costs.

        "content": "The U.S. is contemplating one of the most significant shifts in maritime trade policy in recent memory. A proposed executive order—currently being developed by the Trump administration and coordinated through the National Security Council—seeks public comment on introducing new port fees of up to $1.5 million per call on vessels connected to China, whether by ownership, flag, or place of construction. These measures are part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on Chinese maritime infrastructure. If implemented, the fees could increase port call costs for affected vessels by as much as 3,000%, potentially reshaping global shipping dynamics. <br><br> Given the structure of the global fleet, the implications are considerable. MarineTraffic data shows that nearly 28% of all commercial vessels worldwide are linked to China in one or more ways. The exposure differs by sector, with MarineTraffic data showing that one in two vessels in some categories will be affected. This reflects China’s longstanding role as a central player in global shipbuilding and maritime logistics—a position built over decades of investment and industrial consolidation. The proposed policy introduces a new variable into global shipping calculations, with potential impacts across key cargo segments and trading routes. <br><br> ![image5.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image5_8e190d6321.png) _Source: MarineTraffic_ **Measuring Exposure: China's Maritime Reach** <br><br> China’s role in global shipping is deeply embedded and highly visible at U.S. ports. MarineTraffic data shows that since January 2024, approximately one in three vessels calling US ports were built in China. That’s a substantial presence in its own right—yet it represents only one part of the broader picture. <br><br> When taking into account all vessels linked to China—whether through construction, ownership, or flag (China or Hong Kong) —the exposure rises significantly. In the dry bulk segment, **49% of vessels calling at U.S. ports in 2024 have some form of Chinese link**. For container ships, the figure is 38%; for tankers, 30%. Even among gas carriers and Ro-Ro vessels, exposure stands at 18% and 15%, respectively. <br><br> ![image3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image3_b6e10d446d.png) _Source: MarineTraffic_ <br><br> This reflects China’s dominance in global shipbuilding. Chinese yards account for roughly 50% of global output, and secured over 70% of new commercial ship orders in 2024. Nearly 37% of the global dry bulk fleet and 24% of container ships were built in China. The country’s competitive advantage—driven by scale, cost-efficient production, and control over steel supply—has allowed it to outpace rivals in South Korea and Japan. <br><br> This position is no accident. China’s dominance in shipbuilding has been driven by long-term state support, a vast and cost-efficient labour force, and favourable access to domestic steel—often the single largest input cost in ship construction. Yards benefit not only from cheap raw materials but also from integrated supply chains and financing from state-backed lenders, allowing them to offer attractive pricing and terms. Unlike their counterparts in Korea and Japan, Chinese builders have also been more flexible in accommodating bespoke designs, further widening their appeal. Combined with improving quality standards and accelerated delivery timelines, China has positioned itself not just as a shipbuilder, but as the default production base for much of the global fleet. <br><br> Should the proposed $1.5 million per-call fee on Chinese-linked vessels be implemented, the impact would be immediate. While future orders may shift to non-Chinese yards, capacity constraints—particularly in the U.S., where commercial shipbuilding is limited—mean that any realignment will be slow and costly. The U.S. has not built an LNG carrier in over four decades and currently produces only a small number of merchant ships each year. <br><br> The data makes clear: Chinese-linked vessels are not a marginal presence in U.S. trade—they are a structural feature. Replacing them will take far more than policy—it will require time, global coordination, and substantial industrial investment. <br><br> **Dry Bulk: Heavy Exposure to U.S. Fees** <br><br> Dry bulk is the most exposed vessel segment to the proposed U.S. port fees targeting Chinese-linked ships. MarineTraffic data shows that 48.7% of the global dry bulk fleet is connected to China through construction, ownership, or flag—the highest level of exposure across all vessel types. This includes standard bulk carriers as well as general cargo vessels and multipurpose (MPP) ships. Notably, the more specialised the dry bulk vessel, the more likely it is to be linked to China, further increasing the risk of disruption in niche shipping segments. <br><br> ![image6.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image6_7fc33bde31.png) _Source: MarineTraffic_ Since January 2024, more than 8,000 dry bulk carriers with ties to China have called at U.S. ports. Of these, 37.4% were built in Chinese shipyards, 4.75% are owned—at any level—by Chinese entities, and 5.65% sail under a Chinese flag. This deep integration underscores the vulnerability of dry bulk trade flows, which support critical sectors of U.S. industry, from agriculture and energy to construction and manufacturing. <br><br> According to Kpler cargo data, the United States exported over 300 million tonnes of dry bulk cargo in 2024, accounting for roughly 6% of global dry bulk flows. While this may seem modest at first glance, it represents a significant share for a single country—highlighting the U.S.'s pivotal role in global commodity supply chains. These exports include vital cargoes such as soybeans, coal, corn, and petcoke. On the import side, the U.S. received around 125 million tonnes of dry bulk goods, with cement, steel, and fertilisers making up the lion’s share. Any disruption to the availability or routing of dry bulk vessels—especially at the scale implied by the proposed port fees—could trigger cascading effects across global supply chains and industrial operations. <br><br> The financial impact of these fees is staggering. With the proposed $1.5 million surcharge per port call, voyage costs could rise by as much as 161%—a significant increase that would directly raise freight rates for critical trade routes. For example, coal shipments from the U.S. Gulf to Europe could see voyage costs rise from $12.40 to $32.40 per tonne—a 161% increase. Grain exports from Houston to Rotterdam would jump from $16.15 to $39.23 per tonne, a 143% increase. Petcoke cargoes to Turkey would climb from $23.40 to $53.40 per tonne, up 128%. <br><br> ![image1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image1_6f4ef587b8.png) Source: Kpler Insight, Argus <br><br> <ul> Even under a lower $500,000 fee scenario, the cost implications remain significant: coal shipments to the ARA region would increase by 54%, grain to Rotterdam by 48%, and petcoke to Turkey by 43%. These are not marginal changes—they represent structural cost increases across key routes that underpin U.S. exports. </ul> See the table below for a full breakdown of cost impacts by route and cargo type: ![image2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image2_0a9502e557.png) Source: Kpler Insight, Argus <br><br> These cost hikes would make U.S. exports far less competitive on the global market and drive up the price of dry bulk imports that support domestic industries. U.S. manufacturers relying on imported steel, cement, and fertilisers would face higher input costs, with these expenses inevitably passed on to the consumer. In essence, the proposed fees risk acting as a self-imposed tax on both U.S. exporters and industrial buyers. <br><br> The ripple effects are already emerging. There are reports that vessel owners are refusing to offer ships for future U.S. coal shipments, citing regulatory uncertainty and cost risk. The agricultural sector alone could face up to over a billion dollars in additional annual freight costs—threatening U.S. competitiveness in an already tight and price-sensitive global market. <br><br> **Container Shipping: Navigating Potential Disruption** <br><br> In the container sector, the picture is more nuanced. MarineTraffic data shows that 38% of container ships globally are linked to China—whether through construction, ownership, or flag. Of this, 24% are Chinese-built, 18% are Chinese-owned, and nearly 14% sail under the Chinese flag. <br><br> While only 22% of container ships calling at U.S. ports are Chinese-built, over 11% fly Chinese or Hong Kong flags—more than any other segment. This suggests that reflagging may be a quick fix for some operators. But even so, China’s presence in newbuild deliveries is only growing. Globally, over 70% of container ship orders in 2024 went to Chinese yards. <br><br> The implications for U.S. importers are considerable. Any disruption in Asia–U.S. West Coast traffic could spill over into inventories, port congestion, and freight costs, just as supply chains were beginning to stabilise post-COVID. <br><br> **Tankers: A Third of U.S.-Calling Vessels Linked to China** <br><br> The tanker segment shows substantial exposure to China across the global fleet. MarineTraffic data indicates that 30.1% of tankers worldwide are linked to China—through construction (21.4%), ownership (14.6%), or flag (7.9%). <br><br> These vessels are the backbone of international energy flows, moving crude oil, refined products, and chemicals across long-haul corridors between the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Latin America. China-linked tankers are deeply embedded in these routes, and any disruption to their operations—whether through punitive port fees or regulatory restrictions—would strain the availability of compliant vessels. <br><br> The resulting costs go beyond the fee itself. With fewer eligible tankers in the mix, scheduling challenges increase, trade patterns become less efficient, and charterers may need to reroute or delay cargoes. For refiners, traders, and shippers, this means higher freight rates, longer lead times, and reduced flexibility. <br><br> Replacing Chinese-linked capacity will take years. Redirecting orders to Korean or Japanese yards, or reshuffling ownership structures, is not a quick fix. In the near term, the proposed U.S. measures introduce not only financial penalties but operational uncertainty. The impact will ripple far beyond shipping desks, affecting fuel costs, delivery timelines, and trade competitiveness worldwide. <br><br> **Gas Carriers: Strategically Vulnerable** <br><br> Gas carriers—including both LNG and LPG vessels—may have lower direct exposure to China compared to sectors like dry bulk or containers, but their strategic significance is notably higher. MarineTraffic data indicates substantial Chinese involvement in global gas carrier operations: 16.5% of LNG carriers and 19.0% of LPG carriers worldwide have connections to China. Specifically, among LNG carriers, 7.1% are Chinese-built, 13.9% are Chinese-owned, and 4.7% sail under the Chinese flag. For LPG carriers, these figures are slightly different, with 10.5% built in China, 10.5% Chinese-owned, and 3.7% Chinese-flagged. <br><br> Energy industry experts caution that imposing restrictions on Chinese-linked gas carriers could disrupt crucial supply routes connecting Asia, Europe, and Latin America. If such measures are strictly enforced, the global market could shift in favour of competitors like Qatar and Australia, nations already benefiting from significant scale advantages in LNG shipping. <br><br> **Vehicle Carriers: A Rare Exception** Ro-Ro vessels, which carry vehicles and rolling equipment, are the least exposed segment. Just 13% are Chinese-built and virtually none are flagged or owned in China. These ships may avoid the brunt of new maritime rules, though they could still be affected indirectly by congestion, fleet shortages, or cascading effects from other segments. <br><br> That said, the sector is not immune to broader trade frictions. The Trump administration has also proposed new tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles, meaning auto shipping could be hit on multiple fronts. Even if Ro-Ro vessels themselves escape direct penalties, the cargo they carry may soon become entangled in the same geopolitical crossfire. <br><br> Looking ahead, the exposure of the vehicle carrier sector is set to rise sharply. China has secured over 80% of the global newbuilding orderbook for Ro-Ro carriers. This orderbook represents just under a third of the existing Ro-Ro fleet, suggesting that China is on course to dominate future capacity in this sector. If port fees are applied to new vessels based on build location, automakers and logistics providers could face significantly higher shipping costs as these ships enter service over the coming years. <br><br> **The Strategic Trade-Off** <br><br> The proposed restrictions represent one of the most significant interventions in maritime trade policy in recent decades. At their core, these measures aim to reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese shipbuilding and logistics. However, with nearly a third of all U.S. port calls involving Chinese-built, owned, or flagged vessels, the fallout will extend far beyond Chinese stakeholders. <br><br> Exporters of coal, grain, and energy are already feeling the effects. Shipping availability is tightening, and some operators are preemptively cancelling sailings or reconfiguring trade lanes in anticipation of regulatory enforcement. These disruptions not only risk raising freight rates—undermining the competitiveness of U.S. exports—but also carry direct consequences for American shipowners. MarineTraffic data shows that at least 193 Chinese-built ships are under U.S. beneficial ownership. <br><br> The largest exposures include Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. (39 ships), Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd. (34), and Tidewater Marine Service Inc. (29). Other U.S.-linked owners include MT Maritime Management (7), JP Morgan Chase (6), Sunstone Ships (5), Seabulk Fleet Management (4), and Tropical Shipping (1), with a further 68 ships held by other entities. <br><br> ![image1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image1_9d5ab505d3.png) _Source: MarineTraffic_ <br><br> The exposure spans a wide array of vessel types. Bulk carriers dominate the picture, accounting for 104 of the 193 ships. Offshore supply vessels follow with 27, while container ships number 15. The remainder includes general cargo ships (11), oil/chemical tankers (7), crude oil tankers (6), heavy load carriers (3), drill ships (2), Ro-Ro carriers (2), and a handful of specialised vessels such as anchor handlers, tugs, and passenger ships. <br><br> This broad reliance on Chinese shipyards illustrates the depth of integration between U.S. maritime interests and Chinese industrial capacity. The proposed fees may aim to shift future procurement away from China, but in the near term, they risk penalising domestic firms, disrupting trade flows, and raising costs for U.S. exporters. <br><br> As highlighted in this report, MarineTraffic data shows that no segment is entirely insulated. Even sectors like Ro-Ro, which are less exposed, could face ripple effects through vessel availability, pricing pressure, or retaliatory tariffs. <br><br> While the policy may succeed in discouraging future procurement from Chinese yards, the reality remains that U.S. shipyards are currently unable to meet global demand, with key capabilities—such as LNG carrier construction—unavailable domestically. In the near term, shipyards in Korea and Japan, already competitively positioned, are more likely to benefit. As the global shipping landscape undergoes this imminent shift, stakeholders must prepare for the far-reaching ramifications of these proposed port fees. With MarineTraffic’s advanced maritime intelligence, companies can swiftly adapt to changes in vessel connections, rerouting, and rising costs. Whether you're a shipowner, trader, or policymaker, our platform facilitates smarter, faster decision-making—helping you anticipate disruptions and identify opportunities. <br><br> **Data That Matches the Exposure to Chinese Shipping: Vessel Identity, Ownership & Risk** <br><br> As global shipping adjusts to rising geopolitical scrutiny, understanding who owns, built, manages, or flags a vessel is no longer optional—it’s essential. In response, MarineTraffic has introduced the [Vessel Particulars and Ownership API](https://developers.kpler.com/spec/1240abb4-7ed9-42e2-ae5e-e13a047a16ec#Vessels%20API_Field%20Definitions), designed to give stakeholders full transparency across the commercial fleet. <br><br> **The API provides structured access to:** <br><br> **- Six layers of ownership, including beneficial, registered, technical, ISM, commercial manager, and operator** **- Historical ownership and flag records** **- Classification society, P&I club** **- General vessel particulars, covering around 60 fields for Class A and B vessels—such as flag, build year, dimensions, tonnage, capacity, and engine specs** <br><br> With 95% data completeness across the active commercial fleet, the API offers unmatched depth for fleet profiling, compliance monitoring, and strategic planning. <br><br> 🔗 Explore the [Vessel Particulars and Ownership API](https://developers.kpler.com/spec/1240abb4-7ed9-42e2-ae5e-e13a047a16ec#Vessels%20API) or contact us to enable access via your platform or data lake. <br><br> **MarineTraffic enables you to:** <br><br> - **Monitor** vessel links by flag, ownership, and construction country - **Track** vessel reflagging, rerouting, and trade patterns - **Analyse** port call trends and estimate cost impacts by vessel type - **Understand** fleet composition at the vessel and segment level"

        "content": "Greek shipping is on track to boost its share of the global fleet from 21% to 25%, according to Simos Palios, Chairman of Diana Shipping Inc. Speaking at the 10th Delphi Economic Forum, Palios expressed confidence in the industry's momentum, citing consistent new vessel construction across Asia. <br> ![Polaris.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Polaris_dcf5b6f9d0.png) </br> >Every four days a Greek ship is built in China, every six in South Korea, and every seven in Japan, he said, highlighting the rapid growth. Palios credited Greece’s dominance in global shipping to the expertise of its shipowners and voiced admiration for the new generation entering the field. “They are far better trained than we were, and I envy them,” he said. He believes the younger generation is well-equipped to take Greek shipping to even greater heights. Addressing recent U.S. trade policy developments, Palios urged caution. He suggested waiting to evaluate the real effects of American tariffs, using a gambling metaphor: >We must first see where the roulette ball lands. He also downplayed the impact of recent dips in U.S. stock markets on his company, maintaining that a stock market presence remains advantageous for shipping firms. Palios concluded by urging young Greeks to rediscover their maritime heritage. >The sea is an excellent profession, he said, noting that salaries can start at €2,500 and rise above €14,000. He also called for the reduction of bureaucratic hurdles in Greece to further empower the country’s shipping industry."

The fire was brought under control with intervention. No fatalities have been reported, and an investigation has been launched into the incident. ![PETROBRAS I on fire.](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/PETROBRAS_I_ab6e07e1bb.png)*Platform PETROBRAS, image credit: Sindicato dos Petroleiros do Norte Fluminense* According to the Norte Fluminense Oil Workers' Union (Sindicato dos Petroleiros do Norte Fluminense), a labor union representing oil workers in the region, the fire broke out at 7:25 AM local time on the Chern-1 platform. This was followed by a plume of smoke that was visible from nearby platforms. While reports suggest an explosion may have occurred, it is unclear if this was the case. Emergency vessels battled the fire for around four hours, and by 11:25 AM, the fire was brought under control. The gas flow of the platform was stopped at the time for safety reasons. In the chaos of the operation, one worker fell into the ocean but was quickly rescued by present vessels and was alive and conscious. All 176 non-essential workers from the platform were then evacuated, and 32 of these were taken to hospitals for medical attention. Of these 32, fourteen workers have been reported to have suffered burns, while the others have been admitted to hospitals for smoke inhalation. The Brazilian state-owned gas giant Petrobras has stated that the Chern-1 platform has not produced oil since 2020 and was sold to Perenco Oil and Gas of Brazil Ltd., an independent oil and gas company, in April 2024. However, the handover of the platform to its new owner has not been completed yet, and it still remains under Petrobras's management. Petrobras has revealed that they are forming a commission to thoroughly investigate the incident and determine its cause."

The vessel itself is operated by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and makes deliveries to JFE Steel Corporation of raw materials required in steel production. The vessel is a 2024-built bulk carrier registered in Liberia. It has a length of 299 meters, a width of 50 meters, and a gross tonnage of 111,000. The new shore-to-ship bunkering service is an addition to the truck-to-ship bunkering services that Osaka Gas has been offering since 2019. Osaka Gas has also announced an upcoming ship-to-ship bunkering service, which will be available from the 2026 fiscal year. The new bunkering vessel is expected to have a capacity of 1500 tons and is currently under construction under the Shitanoe Shipbuilding Co., Ltd, that is situated in the Oita prefecture in Japan. LNG bunkering methods are being welcomed in Japan due to a lack of LNG bunkering infrastructure. The global decarbonization trends, driven by the net-zero emission goals set by the International Maritime Organization of achieving 50% of the level of emissions in 2008 by 2050, have also led to an increase in demand for LNG in the global market. Osaka Gas is also exploring the production of synthetic or e-methane that would be chemically identical to LNG but have an improved carbon footprint."

The captain and a crew member initially attempted to control the blaze before the emergency service arrived. The crewmember subsequently received medical treatment for suspected smoke inhalation. Local firefighters responded to the emergency with special equipment, including a turntable ladder and a command vehicle, to coordinate the operation and extinguish the fire. The vessel was positioned approximately 10 metres below the pier, and access was difficult, prompting the deployment of a multi-purpose boat to transport firefighters and equipment to the site. Upon arriving, the firefighting team discovered smoldering embers hidden behind the cabin’s wall paneling. Equipped with breathing apparatus, the team dismantled the paneling and insulation to fully extinguish the concealed fire. At around 4:30 am local time, the firefighters successfully extinguished the fire. No further injuries were reported."

The explosion and the resulting fire have been reported to have originated at the Shahid Rajaee section, which is the largest container terminal at the Bandar Abbas port and handles millions of tons of cargo annually. It handles around 85% of Iran's non-oil and gas exports and imports. The initial explosion is said to have rocked the area and damaged the windows of buildings several kilometers from the source. Additional explosions continued to occur hours after the initial one. Firefighting efforts were quickly underway, supported by helicopters and other aircraft. By the afternoon of April 27, the Red Crescent Society in Iran reported that the fire had been mostly extinguished and that regular activities had resumed in some parts of the port. It is believed that the explosions and fire occurred in a container storage site north of the port's container loading quays. Although the exact cause of the explosions is still uncertain, it is being conjectured that the chemicals stored within the port fueled the fire and the explosions. Reports indicate that the port had received a shipment of sodium perchlorate, which is then converted to ammonium perchlorate and used as a propellant in ballistic missiles. A shipment of sodium perchlorate from China was tracked to this port, and it is being conjectured that this chemical could be the cause of the explosions and the fire."

        "author": "Dimitris Ampatzidis",
        "content": "# Introduction Recent U.S. tariffs imposed under President Trump’s trade policies are poised to reshape the global shipping industry in ways uncannily similar to the effects of international sanctions. As seen with sanctions on Russia, such interventions drive traders toward opaque logistics workarounds—creating grey fleets, obscured cargo origins, and fragmented trade routes. When sanctions hit Russian oil in 2022, Kpler tracked a doubling in dark tanker activity, with over 1,000 vessels - 10% of the global fleet - engaging in deceptive practices by 2024. Tariff regimes, although legalistic rather than punitive, introduce comparable incentives for circumvention. As traders face mounting compliance burdens and rising costs, the risk of a parallel, grey logistics system extending beyond oil into dry bulk and container markets is growing. # Key Takeaways 1. Around 10% of the global oil tanker fleet turned grey within 24 months post-sanctions; dry bulk and container segments may follow, with **400–600 dry bulkers** and **40–60 container ships projected to try to evade tariffs by 2026**. 2. **Trade route manipulation is accelerating**, with Vietnam, Mexico, and Panama emerging as key masking hubs for Chinese cargo bound for the US - often involving short transshipment port calls under 48 hours. 3. 18,000 dry bulkers and 6,000 container ships globally, over 7,000 and 1,500 respectively are over 15 years old. 4. **Freight volatility and compliance costs are intensifying**, with insurers already raising premiums **4–10%** on high-risk trades; similar surcharges are now expected for tariff-exposed cargos. 5. Repeated loops between China and Southeast Asia, followed by long-haul U.S.-bound legs, are increasing among small, reflagged operators. # A Sanctions-Style Disruption, Triggered by Tariffs Trump’s expanded tariffs are shaking up logistics much like sanctions have in the energy sector. In both cases, trade faces structural friction - rerouting, regulatory complexity, and a growing divide between legitimate and grey practices. With sanctions, oil traders responded by deploying aged, poorly tracked tankers under shell ownership. Tariffs are triggering similar behaviours in container and dry bulk segments. In the short term, tariff announcements induce cargo front-loading. During the 2018–2019 US–China trade war, transpacific container volumes surged just before each tariff deadline, only to drop off immediately afterward. Today’s tariff cycle is producing similar effects: sudden port congestion, delayed clearance, and temporary overbooking of vessels ahead of policy changes. Shipping lines are once again warning clients to remain agile. But operational clarity is scarce. Importers must now determine tariff applicability based on intricate rules of origin. Legitimate traders are forced to dedicate resources to documentation and customs compliance, while regulators worldwide intensify inspections for circumvention. The result is logistical friction - longer lead times, higher cost, and widespread uncertainty. Over the medium term, evasion strategies start taking root. Indirect routing through third countries for Chinese-origin products because of 145% tariffs - such as Vietnam, Malaysia, or Mexico, as these ones have considerably lower ones (46%, 24%, and 25% respectively, after the buffering period of 90 days started at 10th of April) - is already being used to mask origin. In the last tariff cycle, U.S. authorities discovered that dozens of Chinese-origin goods were illegally relabelled as “Made in Vietnam.” Similar practices are accelerating, now layered with repackaging, partial assembly, or bonded storage stops to create the façade of compliant trade. A parallel network is emerging. Feeder vessels move cargo from Chinese ports to low-scrutiny hubs like Haiphong or Manzanillo, where containers are transshipped onto larger vessels bound for U.S. ports. These short stops - often less than 48 hours - facilitate origin laundering. In some cases, AIS tracking goes dark en route, before the vessel reappears in known tariff-evasion transit zones such as the UAE or Caribbean. As major carriers avoid legal exposure, the vacuum is filled by small, loosely regulated operators. These firms often use older ships, shell companies, and flags of convenience. Some already mirror sanction-era oil trade practices, such as operator switching, misdeclared paperwork, and unusual routing patterns. # A Structural Shift in Motion Drawing on post-sanction trends in oil, where ~10% of the global tanker fleet pivoted into grey operations within 24 months, Kpler forecasts that: **Dry bulk shipping** (mainly steel and aluminium) - with moderate financial incentives and medium traceability - could see 5–8% of the fleet shift into a trade focusing on bypassing the tariffs by 2026. This equates to 400–600 vessels, particularly among 7,000+ bulkers aged 15 years or older. **Container shipping**, with higher traceability but vulnerable feeder segments, could see 2–4% of its fleet trying to avoid the tariffs, 40–60 vessels, primarily older feeder ships below Panamax class. These vessels often share key traits: older build (15+ years), private or shell ownership, and registry under flags of convenience. # Long-Term Impacts: Fragmentation of the Maritime System Persistent tariffs encourage permanent structural changes. Trade routes evolve. Direct China–U.S.volumes fall, while Vietnam, Mexico, and other rerouting hubs register disproportionate US-bound export growth - well beyond their domestic production capacity. This is a red flag for origin laundering, and Kpler already detects surges in cargo traffic from these nodes. Ultimately, global shipping risks a bifurcation: a regulated, high-cost fleet adhering to tariff rules, and a grey network leveraging opacity to remain profitable. While container and dry bulk markets are structurally different from oil, the growth drivers - financial arbitrage, enforcement asymmetry, and low-traceability routes - are already present. # Conclusion The structural parallels between sanctions and tariffs are no longer theoretical. They’re materializing in vessel behaviour, port patterns, and fleet segmentation. With tariff scope expanding and enforcement intensifying, grey trade dynamics are no longer confined to tankers. Dry bulk and container markets are next. Stakeholders should monitor grey fleet indicators closely - fleet age, flag switching, port call anomalies, and rising traffic from non-producing intermediaries. _To find out more about Kpler’s Risk & Compliance offering, visit [here](https://www.kpler.com/demos/risk-compliance-demo?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=risk&compliance_commodities_maritime_news_demo_request)._"

A thunderstorm, accompanied by powerful winds and heavy rains, overtook several passenger boats that were transporting sightseeing passengers. Passengers reported that the weather was normal as the vessels set off, but it quickly devolved into a situation with high waves and heavy rain. Reports indicate that visibility was reduced to around one meter. Due to the severe weather conditions, two boats reportedly overturned, leading to around 84 passengers falling into the water. The response was quick, and first responders, along with nearby vessels, arrived to help. Chinese personnel arrived soon after, and more than 500 responders have been mobilized, including 80 divers, along with 16 small underwater remotely operated vehicles, which are working to find the missing passengers. As of the night of 4th May, 70 people have been rescued and provided with medical attention."

Although MSC has not made any statement regarding the damage to the vessel or how it deviated from its charted path, GPS spoofing is suspected to be the cause of the incident. ![MSC ANTONIA grounded near Jeddah.](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/MSC_ANTONIA_adfe866138.png)*Vessel MSC ANTONIA, image credit: Hannes Van Rijn* The vessel made a port call in [Port Sudan ](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/1679?name=PORT-SUDAN&country=Sudan)and was bound for [Jeddah](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ports/807?name=JEDDAH&country=Saudi-Arabia), Saudi Arabia at the time of the incident. As of now, the vessel remains grounded approximately 100 nautical miles off the coast of Jeddah. GPS spoofing is a cyberattack technique in which false GPS signals are sent to receivers, leading them to misinterpret their location. Such manipulation can disrupt navigation and mislead vessels off their course. It is being speculated that the vessel was a victim of GPS spoofing, which caused it to lose its charted path and run aground. Further cementing the possibility of a GPS spoofing attack is the fact that the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) posted a warning on May 9th regarding incidents of multiple vessels experiencing electronic interference and disruptions while traveling in the Red Sea around the areas of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Port Sudan."

        "content": "# Overview April 2025 marked a strategic escalation in maritime sanctions enforcement, as regulators transitioned from asset-focused actions to dismantling broader ownership and logistics networks. The month saw over $1.7billion in crude flows tied to newly sanctioned vessels and companies, most with links to Iranian commodity trades. Authorities intensified scrutiny of reflagging practices and ship management firms, with emerging registries like Curacao and Guyana becoming central vectors of risk. Kpler’s proprietary data highlighted these shifts in advance, flagging 63 operational and 51 management-related risk events tied to sanctioned entities. # Key takeaways $1.7billion in sanctioned cargo moved in 2025 alone, tied to 41 vessels blacklisted in April. US, UK, and EU actions expanded to penalize ship operators and ownership networks, not just flagged vessels. Flags of convenience surged, with Panama, Barbados, and Guyana accounting for a growing share of sanctioned ships. Kpler flagged 114 high-risk behaviors across sanctioned entities before regulatory actions - reinforcing the value of predictive risk intelligence. Over 12% of the ships we identified back in February ([MarineTraffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/maritime-news/34/risk-and%20compliance/2025/11896/predicting-sanctions-in-maritime-trade-leveraging-data-on-da)) as likely to be sanctioned in 2025 have already been sanctioned by the authorities. # Market Analysis April 2025 saw sanctions enforcement tighten around maritime trade and strategic commodities. In the U.S., OFAC updated its maritime sanctions advisory, sharpening guidance to detect Iranian oil evasion across a growing “shadow fleet” of tankers ([U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0113#:~:text=subsequently%20re,mitigating%20Iranian%20oil%20sanctions%20evasion)). The month also brought new OFAC designations targeting vessels that delivered refined petroleum to Yemen’s Houthi-controlled ports after a humanitarian exemption lapsed ([U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0113#:~:text=In%20conjunction%20with%20the%20re,license%20on%20April%204%2C%202025)). Three tankers and their owners were blacklisted for supporting the Houthis – an Iranian-aligned group known to deploy mines and drones against Red Sea shipping, threatening global navigation ([U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0113#:~:text=to%20Ansarallah%2C%20commonly%20known%20as,discharge%20of%20refined%20petroleum%20products)). These actions underscore heightened compliance risks for shippers, as even post-conflict relief shipments (like fuel into Yemen) face scrutiny once licenses expire. UK and EU authorities similarly advanced measures targeting illicit maritime networks and commodity flows. In late April, the UK implemented a new sanctions package that not only added tech export bans (including oil & gas exploration software) but also intensified pressure on Russia’s energy exports ([Gov UK](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2025/504/made)). London has now specified dozens of “shadow fleet” oil tankers for sanctions – bringing the total number of Russian-linked tankers under UK sanctions to 133, the most in Europe ([Gov UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-largest-sanctions-package-against-russia-since-2022?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&utm_source=0a23ba4c-3ee7-47fb-99a6-eafd6be6fa2a&utm_content=immediately#:~:text=The%20new%20sanctions%20will%20put,of%20any%20nation%20in%20Europe)). Brussels’ parallel 16th sanctions package (effective late February) banned EU port access and services for an additional 74 vessels involved in covert Russian oil shipments ([European Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions-against-russia/timeline-sanctions-against-russia/)). These coordinated UK/EU steps are reshaping global shipping patterns, forcing sanctioned or high-risk ships to rely on non-Western ports and insurers. While the United Nations did not announce new sanctions in April, UN-backed embargoes (for example on arms and oil transfers in conflicts like Yemen and North Korea) continue to influence the maritime domain. Overall, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are signaling zero tolerance for sanctions evasion at sea, tightening the compliance screws on oil, gas, grain, metals and other key trade flows going into Q2 2025. Implications for the Shipping Industry In April 2025, 41 new vessels and 20 new companies were added to official sanctions lists. These 41 vessels were involved in over 79 million barrels of oil transfers in 2024, and more than 21 million barrels just in the first four months of the year. The 20 companies were directly or indirectly linked to more than 43 vessels that already showed serious risk signs before the sanctions — including over 63 operational risks (like turning off tracking systems, spoofing, or dark ship-to-ship transfers) and 51 management risks. ![Picture1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture1_28eb3d6dbe.png) **Graph 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the last five years (April 2020 to April 2025) - Kpler._ The graph illustrates a steady rise in the number of sanctioned vessels and companies since 2020, with a particularly sharp uptick visible in April 2025. This coincides with OFAC’s April 2025 designations targeting vessels involved in transporting Iranian-origin bitumen and HSFO, as well as the associated ship management firms, including GLORY INTERNATIONAL FZLLC and PRIME TANKERS LLC. The surge reflects a regulatory shift toward targeting operational networks - rather than just individual ships - by penalizing beneficial owners, ISM managers, and technical operators. The pronounced increase in April suggests a sweeping enforcement round, which aligns with broader Western efforts to dismantle opaque maritime networks engaged in sanctions evasion, especially those supporting Iran’s shadow exports. This escalation reinforces the mounting compliance burden on industry actors as due diligence requirements now extend beyond vessel activity to the full management and ownership chain. ![Picture2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture2_8432caf522.png) **Graph 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the last two years (April 2023 to April 2025) - Kpler._ The stacked area chart illustrates a sharp increase in the number of sanctioned vessels by flag state, with a notable acceleration starting in late 2024 and peaking in April 2025. While Iran and Russia continue to account for the largest share, the most significant growth in April stems from a broader proliferation of other flags - including Panama, Barbados, Guyana, Curacao, and Sao Tome and Principe. This reflects a clear shift in evasion tactics, where sanctioned or high-risk vessels increasingly reflag to less scrutinized registries. The spike aligns with April 2025 designations by OFAC and aligned regulators, which targeted shadow fleet operators engaged in dark ship-to-ship (STS) transfers, sanctioned cargo movements (notably Iranian bitumen and Russian petroleum products), and vessels managed by blacklisted entities like GLORY INTERNATIONAL FZLLC. The diversification in flags also signals the need for enhanced due diligence, as risk exposure is no longer confined to traditionally sanctioned registries but is now diffused across a wider geopolitical landscape. ![Picture3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture3_e3f72cfa94.png) **Graph 3.** _Total vessels and companies added to sanctions lists over the last twelve months (May 2024 to April 2025) - Kpler._ The bar chart shows monthly designations of sanctioned vessels and companies between May 2024 and April 2025. April 2025 reflects a modest resurgence in vessel designations following a relative dip in March, with over 40 vessels and around 15 companies sanctioned. This uptick aligns with OFAC’s April actions that targeted maritime actors linked to Iranian oil and bitumen exports, as well as new compliance risks related to STS transfers and AIS manipulation. While the peak of enforcement was observed in January 2025 - driven by sweeping sanctions packages related to Russian petroleum logistics and Iranian dark fleet operators - the activity in April demonstrates that regulators remain active in scrutinizing deceptive maritime practices. The sustained designation of companies, including ship managers and operators, underscores the ongoing trend of targeting the organizational structures enabling sanctions evasion, a pattern that has intensified since Q4 2024 and is expected to persist. The 41 vessels sanctioned in April 2025 had transported over 79 million barrels of oil in 2024 and more than 21 million barrels in just the first four months of 2025. At an average Brent crude price of $83/bbl in 2024 and $82/bbl in Q1 2025, these flows equate to a total cargo value exceeding $6.5 billion for 2024 and an additional $1.7 billion so far in 2025 - bringing the combined value of sanctioned flows to approximately $8.2 billion in just over 16 months. # Conclusion Throughout April 2025, enforcement actions by OFAC continued to target entities linked to Iranian oil and bitumen exports. Several vessels - Global Eagle, Global Maharani, and Global Genesis - remained under OFAC sanctions for their involvement in transporting sanctioned cargo, including items classified under HS code 271490 (bitumen/asphalt), with multiple voyages originating in Iran. These cargo movements are explicitly restricted under measures imposed by OFAC, the UK’s OFSI, and the EU Commission’s sanctions framework against Iran. Moreover, there is notable evidence of increased high-risk activity through ship-to-ship (STS) operations. Global Eagle alone engaged in multiple high-risk STS transfers during April, including an STS with Global Maharani on April 22 off the coast of Mormugao, involving over 11,700 tonnes of suspected sanctioned product. While no dark STS events were recorded during this month, such frequent and high-volume STS pairings - particularly when coupled with AIS gaps - highlight elevated compliance concerns. Vessels such as Glory Star 1 and Global Genesis also exhibited AIS manipulation patterns or extended offline periods, particularly near high-risk jurisdictions such as Iran and the United Arab Emirates, suggesting potential spoofing or obfuscation of location data. The repeated involvement of sanctioned ship management entities - most notably GLORY INTERNATIONAL FZLLC - as ISM, commercial, and technical managers across several vessels reaffirms coordinated attempts to circumvent maritime sanctions enforcement. These findings coincide with OFAC’s April 2025 listings that targeted vessels and operators engaging in deceptive practices designed to support Iranian commodity flows. While enforcement bodies did not announce additional sanctions programs during April, the expansion of existing designations to vessel operators underlines the shift in regulatory scrutiny from assets to networks. For insurers and compliance analysts, April 2025 highlights the growing complexity of sanctions evasion and the rising risk exposure tied to vessel and company networks. With over $1.7 billion in sanctioned cargo moved in just the first four months of the year - much of it linked to Iranian and Russian flows - traditional due diligence is no longer sufficient. Kpler’s Risk & Compliance platform empowers users to stay ahead of enforcement by surfacing high-risk behaviors such as AIS spoofing, repeated dark STS activity, and ties to sanctioned management firms. As regulators broaden their focus to include entire operational ecosystems, early detection is essential to safeguarding portfolios, clients, and reputations across the maritime supply chain.

It is flagged in the Netherlands and was built in 2024. The vessel is not only the largest offshore installation vessel, with a gross tonnage of 47,017, but it is also the first to be able to operate on methanol and has advanced emission control technologies. The powerful 6,000 kWh battery pack further reduces the vessel's emissions. The methanol used in this landmark bunkering was ISSC-certified green methanol, which has much lower lifecycle emissions than conventional methanol. OCI HyFuels supplied the 500 tons of this fuel. The advent of methanol bunkering has been welcomed at the port of Amsterdam as it synergizes well with their vision of becoming a multi-fuel port and achieving net-zero emissions. There are already a number of LNG suppliers offering their services at the port, and recently, a Hydrogen bunkering was also successfully carried out."

LNG as a maritime fuel can emit up to 80% less nitrogen oxides and virtually eliminate the emission of sulfur oxides compared to conventional heavy fuel oil. LNG also reduces CO2 emissions by around 23%. However, engines that use LNG as a fuel are notorious for releasing unburned methane into the atmosphere, which is 28 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. Successful mitigation of the release of this methane into the atmosphere, known as \"methane slip,\" would accelerate the maritime transition to LNG."

Two sailors were reported to have swam to shore after jumping into the sea, while the remaining three disembarked directly onto the quay. An ambulance was deployed at the scene, but no medical assistance was required. The Norwegian Coastal Administration took over the response effort. A fire and rescue service arrived on the scene, and a rescue vessel, RS Bergen Kreds, was dispatched to assist the distressed vessel. Although the vessel is reported to have no leaks, the fire department has laid down booms as a precaution. The cargo vessel had completed loading gravel at the Henda Pukk AS facility when it suddenly listed and tipped onto its side. As of now, the vessel’s cargo hold is believed to be half-filled with water. A sludge suction unit was ordered to pump out the water and help in stabilize the vessel."

        "author": "Dimitris Ampatzidis",
        "content": "_Contributing author: Dimitris Kotsias, Market Analyst - Dirty Products at Kpler (dkotsias@kpler.com)_ # Overview Maritime identity laundering has evolved from a niche tactic into a systemic enabler of large-scale sanctions evasion. The manipulation of Automatic Identification System (AIS) signals, reuse of scrapped vessel identities, and shadowy ownership structures now underpin the operations of the so-called \"Grey Fleet\" - a clandestine logistics network facilitating embargoed oil flows from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. At the extreme edge of this spectrum, zombie vessels - resurrected identities of scrapped ships - represent a growing risk to safety, enforcement, and the credibility of sanctions regimes. # Key takeaways - Zombie vessels are real ships operating under the identity of scrapped vessels, allowing illegal cargoes to masquerade as legitimate. - AIS spoofing and identity hijacking have surged post-2022, coinciding with expanded Western sanctions. - These vessels pose serious safety and environmental risks, often operating without verifiable ownership, insurance, or oversight. - Regulatory bodies like the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have started to intervene but are struggling to keep pace with the tactics employed by the grey fleet. - Kpler estimates show that by now, 10% of the global oil tanker fleet is part of the grey fleet - highlighting the scale of the challenge. # The Mechanics of Identity Laundering at Sea \"Identity laundering\" in shipping refers to the deliberate falsification or swapping of vessel identities to mask illicit operations. While this method predates the 2022 sanctions surge, it has flourished under the cover of expanding embargoes. Core to this tactic is AIS manipulation. Vessels digitally camouflage their movements by: - Broadcasting false coordinates. - Hijacking IMO/MMSI numbers of legitimate vessels. - Disabling transponders to create blackout periods during high-risk operations. This results in a fleet that operates without clear jurisdiction or visibility - a digital ghost armada transporting sanctioned crude undetected. # Zombie Vessels: The Most Deceptive Evolution A zombie vessel is a ship that pretends to be another one that was legally scrapped. This isn’t just a mistake on paper - it’s a deliberate move to hide illegal activity. In March 2025, we observed the sanctioned VLCC _VERONICA III_ (9326055) begin using the identity of _DS VECTOR_ (9203289), a ship that was dismantled in 2018. It broadcasts fake AIS signals in the Eastern Caribbean Sea. By April 2025, the vessel had arrived at Amuay, Venezuela, where it conducted a dark STS transfer with a non-sanctioned vessel that had picked up high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) from El Palito Refinery. ![image1.jpg](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/image1_347dd1b732.jpg) **Image 1.** _Satellite imagery for the STS on 4th of April 2025 - Copernicus._ In April and May 2025, the VLCC received 3 cargoes of HSFO, from three separate smaller vessels, LR1 _TAILWINDS_ (9280354) and LR2s _COLON_ (9503574) and _ORIENTAL PEARL_ (9281011). The STS operations were confirmed by satellite imagery, as AIS coverage outside Venezuela is very limited or in cases like the zombie fleet, extremely misleading. The three cargoes’ origin is the El Palito and Cardon refineries in Venezuela and the pattern exhibited by _VERONICA III_ is very typical for Venezuelan exports. VLCCs (often piggybacking on a dead vessel’s identity), are gradually topping-up with Crude or HSFO from Venezuela, and once fully laden they depart usually to the East. Another recent example that establishes this method of concealing the cargo’s origin, is the Suezmax _APUS_ (9280885). The vessel is pinging as the dead vessel _FREESIA I_ (9159660), adopting its identity even in the port line-ups, making it look like _FREESIA I_ is the one loading ex Jose Oil Terminal. In reality, APUS loaded ~140kt of HSFO from the Port of Jose, but the destination is not currently known. There are also cases that unfortunately, despite the indications of a ‘zombie’ vessel, we cannot confirm who’s the real culprit behind it. For example, vessel _ALANA_ (9172583) was seen in November 2023 at the Chittagong breakyard in Bangladesh. However, recently this name has emerged in the documentation of loadings at Cardon, but so far we do not have a visual confirmation that could link _ALANA_ (dead vessel) to an operational one that is using _ALANA’s_ identity. But this method of employing ‘dead’ vessels for their identity is fairly new, so we are closely monitoring the situation to identify as many of these cases as possible. Kpler's vessel tracking has found many examples of scrapped ships being \"brought back to life\" to hide illegal operations. So far, we have identified over 20 scrapped ships being used this way, connected to more than 23 active vessels, mostly operating in high-risk export areas. # Operational and Safety Hazards Zombie vessels often sail without legitimate registration, valid insurance, or enforceable safety standards. Their age and mechanical degradation pose heightened risks: - AIS spoofing disrupts collision-avoidance systems, increasing maritime accident potential. - Untraceable ownership means no clear liability in case of environmental disasters. - In conflict zones, ships using false IDs may be misidentified as hostile, leading to tragic consequences. # Sanctions Integrity at Stake Grey fleet vessels enable large-scale circumvention of sanctions: - They facilitate unreported STS (ship-to-ship) transfers, often in international waters. - Kpler estimates from late 2024 indicate that over 10% of the global tanker fleet is engaged in opaque or deceptive activities. These include identity laundering, AIS spoofing, and dark STS transfers - normalizing regulatory evasion as standard practice. # The Regulatory Catch-Up Game Global enforcement bodies are taking note. In April 2025, OFAC banned the reuse of IMO numbers from scrapped vessels and ramped up scrutiny on identity changes ([OFAC](https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/934236/download?inline)). However, enforcement remains slow relative to the speed of evasion tactics. Solutions in development include: - Satellite verification systems with machine learning to detect physical discrepancies. - Cross-border data sharing to flag suspicious activity in near real-time. - AIS signal integrity assessments as part of port-state control procedures. Yet, despite these initiatives, the grey fleet continues to outmaneuver traditional compliance infrastructures. # Conclusion Zombie vessels represent the bleeding edge of maritime deception - combining digital obfuscation with recycled identities to operate beyond the reach of law and oversight. They highlight an urgent need for global enforcement synchronization, advanced verification technologies, and real-time maritime intelligence. As regulatory frameworks slowly adapt, the burden of detection increasingly falls on proprietary tracking tools and robust market surveillance systems - areas where Kpler continues to lead. Without decisive action, identity laundering risks becoming institutionalized within global trade flows, eroding both safety and trust at sea. _To find out more about Kpler’s Risk & Compliance offering, visit [here](https://www.kpler.com/demos/risk-compliance-demo?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=risk&compliance_commodities_maritime_news_demo_request)._"

The initial assessment revealed that around 150 square metres of the coral reef had been damaged, affecting six coral species. Currently, environmental concerns are about the debris that has been found scattered on the reef, including cardboard boxes, rubber hoses, fabric scraps, tires, and other waste materials. Moreover, the vessel also carries 3000 cement bags, further escalating the environmental risk if they fall into the sea. Authorities suspect the vessel may have been avoiding Myanmar officials, although this remains unconfirmed. Thailand’s DNP is seeking compensation of 12 million baht ($366,600) from the vessel owner, who is yet to respond. Recovery efforts have been hampered by ongoing monsoon conditions. The authorities confirmed that the affected areas will be temporarily closed to allow the reef to recover.

This report unpacks the data, the geopolitics, and the operational signals compliance teams can no longer afford to ignore. # Key takeaways - May 2025 saw the largest one-month spike in vessel designations to date, with 176 ships and 16 companies added. - Over half the sanctioned tankers were flagged to Russia or Iran, but the real story is the quiet rise of Panama, Comoros, and other non-sanctioned flags now on the target. - Despite regulatory pressure, sanctioned oil continues to flow, over $55 billion worth moved by newly listed tankers in the past 17 months, mostly to India, China, and Türkiye. - AIS manipulation, and dark STS transfers are now high-risk markers, not just red flags, regulators are penalizing indirect involvement and third-party facilitation with greater frequency and precision. - The line between commercial operations and geopolitical risk is increasingly blurred; for maritime and energy companies, sanctions compliance is now a frontline priority, not merely a back-office responsibility. # Market Analysis May 2025 marked a significant escalation in maritime sanctions enforcement, with global regulators intensifying efforts to disrupt illicit shipping practices across oil, gas, and even dry bulk trades. In Washington, the [U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) broadened its crackdown on Iran’s petroleum exports](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0135), while [London](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-to-announce-largest-ever-sanctions-package-targeting-shadow-fleet-as-uk-ramps-up-pressure-on-russia) and [Brussels](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/05/20/russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-eu-agrees-17th-package-of-sanctions/) unveiled sweeping new restrictions targeting Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet” of tankers. Meanwhile, voices at the United Nations echoed these efforts, [calling for greater transparency around North Korea’s covert coal shipments](https://press.un.org/en/2025/250501_sc.doc.htm). On May 8, OFAC imposed sanctions on a Chinese “teapot” refinery, three Shandong-based port logistics firms, and several shipping companies, vessels, and ship captains tied to Iran’s sanctions-evasion networks. A week later, on May 13, OFAC escalated its campaign by blacklisting nearly two dozen additional entities involved in all facets of Iran’s oil smuggling ecosystem, from front companies brokering sales to maritime service providers supporting vessel operations. U.S. officials underscored that third-country facilitators would not be exempt from enforcement actions if found complicit in circumventing sanctions. Despite this aggressive posture, OFAC demonstrated limited regulatory flexibility. On May 20, the agency issued a targeted general license allowing safety and environmental operations on the Iranian tanker MV TINOS I (IMO 9969821), which had been seized and was anchored in U.S. waters. The move reflects a balancing act: pursuing robust sanctions enforcement while mitigating environmental and navigational risks posed by immobilized tankers. Collectively, these developments reflect a coordinated international shift toward more proactive maritime sanctions enforcement, one that prioritizes disruption of illicit logistics networks and sends a strong deterrent signal to actors operating in the grey areas of global trade. The month’s most sweeping actions came on May 20, when the European Union and United Kingdom nearly simultaneously escalated sanctions against the secretive flotilla carrying Russian oil. In Brussels, [EU ministers approved the 17th package of Russia sanctions](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/05/20/russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-eu-agrees-17th-package-of-sanctions/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=AUTOMATED%20-%20Alert%20-%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_id=3318#:~:text=The%20Council%20adopted%20today%20its,that%20support%20Russia%27s%20war%20economy), described as “the most wide-sweeping since the start of the war,” with a heavy focus on maritime evasion. A staggering 189 additional tankers believed to be part of Russia’s shadow fleet were blacklisted, now doubling the number of vessels banned from EU ports and services. Many of these ships are owned or flagged in third countries and have been engaged in transporting Russian crude via high-risk practices like disabling tracking systems and performing mid-ocean cargo transfers ([MarineTraffic LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7330905018226634752/)). The new [EU list](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/05/20/russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-eu-agrees-17th-package-of-sanctions/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=AUTOMATED%20-%20Alert%20-%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_id=3318#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20EU%20imposes,of%20the%20Russian%20oil%20shipping) reaches beyond just ships: it also freezes the assets of several shipping companies in the UAE, Türkiye and Hong Kong that manage or operate the embargoed tankers, as well as one notable insurer of Russian oil cargoes. In a sign of widening scope, the EU package even encompassed three modern LNG carriers which are state of the art ice-class ships owned by Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, which had been chartered to transport natural gas from Russia’s Yamal LNG project via ship-to-ship transfers. Brussels had largely shied away from Russian LNG transport until now, so the blacklisting of these high-profile gas carriers sent a potent signal that any vessel facilitating sanctioned energy exports (whether oil or gas) is fair game. EU officials noted that since the introduction of the G7/EU oil price cap and anti-shadow fleet measures, [Russia’s energy revenues have dropped significantly year-over-year](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/05/20/russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-eu-agrees-17th-package-of-sanctions/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=AUTOMATED%20-%20Alert%20-%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_id=3318#:~:text=Since%20the%20EU%20introduced%20the,than%20those%20of%20March%202022), evidence, they argue, that tighter maritime sanctions are biting. London matched the EU’s hard line with its own record-breaking action against the dark tanker fleet. On May 9, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government unveiled the [UK’s “largest ever” Russia sanctions package](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-to-announce-largest-ever-sanctions-package-targeting-shadow-fleet-as-uk-ramps-up-pressure-on-russia#:~:text=The%20Government%20will%20today%20sanction,since%20the%20start%20of%202024), built around a mass listing of about 100 oil tankers suspected of covertly carrying Russian crude. British authorities stressed that these aging, poorly insured ships pose not just a sanctions risk but also a direct threat to maritime safety and infrastructure, while noting incidents of “reckless seafaring” and even suggesting shadow tankers may have damaged undersea data cables in European waters. Later in the month, coinciding with the EU’s 17th package, the UK rolled out an additional round of sanctions on May 20 that listed 18 more tankers and dozens of related entities. These included two Russian ship captains and even a UK-based accountant accused of helping Moscow acquire tankers via shell companies. By casting a spotlight on a British national’s role in the shadow fleet’s expansion, the UK underscored that Western participants in these schemes will be held to account. Upping the pressure further, UK officials hinted at tightening the oil price cap mechanism, and potentially lowering the price threshold closer to Russia’s production cost to erode Russian oil profits that slip through the cracks. Taken together, the EU and UK moves in May represent a trans-Atlantic one-two punch against the murky tanker network propping up Russia’s oil exports. # Implications for the Shipping Industry Beyond the headline-grabbing designations, May’s developments also delivered important signals about enforcement and compliance expectations for maritime actors. The UK’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) demonstrated a newly aggressive posture by levying its first-ever enforcement fine in the maritime sector. The OFSI issued a £5,000 penalty against Svarog Shipping Company for failing to respond to an information request related to Russia sanctions. While modest in amount, the penalty carries outsized significance: it makes clear that even non-cooperation or lapses in due diligence can trigger sanctions consequences. Meanwhile in Washington, regulators continue to update guidance for shipowners and insurers on best practices ranging from scrutinizing AIS transmission gaps to verifying counterparties – reflecting lessons learned from recent deceptive shipping cases. And at the United Nations, maritime sanctions evasion is drawing increased alarm. In a UN Security Council briefing on May 7, the United States presented evidence of North Korea’s illicit coal exports by sea, spotlighting how Pyongyang uses foreign-flagged bulk carriers to smuggle coal and iron ore to China in defiance of UN embargoes. With hundreds of vessels now banned by Western authorities for sanction-breaking voyages, vetting a ship’s history and ownership has become paramount. No longer can one assume that using an older “off-radar” tanker or engaging in an STS transfer at sea will escape notice. The May designations show that authorities are actively tracking such behavior via satellite data and inter-agency intelligence. In addition to mounting sanctions pressure, vessels are facing increasing real-world threats in key maritime zones. According to the [UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO)](https://www.ukmto.org/ukmto-products/weekly-reports/2025), ships transiting the Strait of Hormuz and southern Red Sea experienced repeated GPS signal interference in May, with disruptions lasting several hours and forcing crews to rely on backup navigation methods ([UKMTO, 24–30 May 2025](https://www.ukmto.org/-/media/ukmto/products/20250530_ukmto_summary_report-30may25.pdf?rev=3d68c75f04d543959242b52e71dcf1d8)). During the same period, vessels anchored off Ras Isa, Yemen, were reportedly denied departure even with UN clearance, with some boarded by armed personnel under threat of force ([UKMTO, 26 April–2 May 2025](https://www.ukmto.org/-/media/ukmto/products/20250502_ukmto_summary_report-02may25.pdf?rev=bcf11e93303f4ca8a68ea37839112291)). Meanwhile, the [U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI)](https://www.oni.navy.mil/ONI-Reports/Shipping-Threat-Reports/Worldwide-Threat-to-Shipping/) recorded several violent boarding attempts in Southeast Asia and the Gulf of Guinea, including knife-point robberies and armed crew kidnappings ([ONI WTS Report, 30 April–28 May 2025](https://www.oni.navy.mil/Portals/12/Intel%20agencies/piracy/WTS/20250528%20WTS.pdf?ver=McIsu5zoz7IQqx1qxrlbKg%3d%3d)). These developments identify the growing operational and physical risks for vessels, particularly those already flagged for compliance concerns, when operating in or near conflict-affected regions. In May 2025, 176 ships and 16 companies were added to global sanctions lists. These tankers had moved more than 503 million barrels of oil in 2024, and over 242 million barrels in just the first five months of 2025. Most of this oil came from Russia (374 million barrels in 2024 and 193 million in 2025 so far) and Iran (32 million in 2024 and 17 million in 2025). In total, 82% of their oil shipments were linked to Russian or Iranian sources. The oil mainly ended up in India (153 million barrels in 2024 and 74 million in 2025), China (96 million in 2024 and 76 million in 2025), and Türkiye (65 million in 2024 and 26 million in 2025). These three countries received about 55% of all the oil moved by these vessels. The 16 companies added to the global lists were tied to more than 28 ships that had already shown high-risk behavior before the sanctions. This included at least 14 cases of dangerous practices like turning off their tracking systems, faking their location, or doing dark ship-to-ship transfers. They also had 28 risk flags related to management. ![Picture1.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture1_03d28e3e69.png) **Graph 1.** _Sanctioned vessels and companies through the last five years (May 2020 to May 2025) - Kpler._ In the last six months, sanctions designations in the maritime sector have surged at an unprecedented rate, with the number of listed vessels rising from just under 1,100 in November 2024 to around 1,600 by May 2025, a 45% increase, while sanctioned companies climbed from around 460 to nearly 670, marking a 40% rise. This sharp escalation reflects a strategic shift: regulators are moving beyond reactive enforcement toward preemptive disruption of high-risk networks, targeting not only tankers but also the web of operators, insurers, managers, and intermediaries behind them. The data signals that authorities are acting on more sophisticated intelligence and deeper cross-jurisdictional cooperation, rapidly identifying and sanctioning entities linked to deceptive practices. ![Picture2.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture2_12aadcef0d.png) **Graph 2.** _Sanctioned vessels per top 10 flag registry through the last two years (May 2023 to May 2025) - Kpler._ Over the last two years, the flag profile of sanctioned vessels has shifted significantly, with sharp growth in designations tied to non-traditional registries. As of May 2025, Russian- and Iranian-flagged vessels make up more than half of all sanctioned ships. However, Panama has emerged as a major concern, with its sanctioned fleet nearly quadrupling since mid-2023. Comoros, China, and North Korea have also seen steady increases, while newer entries like Guyana, Curacao, Guinea, and Barbados have surged in just the last six months. This trend points to deliberate flag-hopping, as operators seek out jurisdictions with weaker oversight. The implication for compliance teams is clear: flag state alone is no longer a reliable risk filter, what matters now is the broader behavioral and enforcement context behind each registration. ![Picture3.png](https://kp-strapi-media-maritime-news-prod-main.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Picture3_144de6435d.png) **Graph 3.** _Total vessels and companies added to sanctions lists over the last twelve months (June 2024 to May 2025) - Kpler._ Sanctions over the past year have followed a pattern of sharp bursts in numbers rather than steady growth. January and May 2025 alone accounted for nearly 360 vessel designations combined, far exceeding any other months alongside major spikes in company listings. These surges reflect coordinated regulatory campaigns aimed at disrupting entire maritime networks in one sweep. The uneven monthly distribution highlights the need for agile compliance systems that can react quickly to sudden waves of sanctions rather than relying on routine updates. The 176 vessels sanctioned in May 2025 had collectively transported over 503 million barrels of oil in 2024 and more than 242 million barrels in the first five months of 2025. Using the average Brent crude price of $80 per barrel in 2024 and the May 2025 average of $64.45 per barrel , the estimated value of these cargoes exceeds $40.2 billion for 2024 and an additional $15.6 billion for 2025. This brings the combined value of sanctioned oil flows linked to these vessels to approximately $55.8 billion over the past 17 months. # Conclusion Sanctions enforcement is no longer confined to headlines or government statements, it now shapes the day-to-day reality of commercial decision-making. Every fixture, every cargo approval, every port call comes with higher stakes, as the risks hidden in opaque ownership, outdated flag assumptions, or AIS gaps can translate into real exposure. With regulators acting faster and more comprehensively than ever, navigating the space between legitimate operations and illicit networks requires more than just technical checks; it calls for critical judgment, institutional memory, and the willingness to ask uncomfortable questions. And the impact doesn’t stop when the workday ends. Supporting vessels that quietly move sanctioned oil isn’t just a business oversight, it helps sustain global instability, from conflicts abroad to supply chain shocks at home. The decisions made in boardrooms and compliance reviews ripple outward, influencing everything from fuel prices to international security. In that sense, protecting a company’s compliance posture also protects the credibility of the systems we all live within, professional, legal, and moral alike. _To find out more about Kpler’s Risk & Compliance offering, visit [here](lhttps://www.kpler.com/demos/risk-compliance-demo?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=risk&compliance_commodities_maritime_news_demo_request)._"

In response, Bremen Water Police arrived and detected the smell of alcohol on the 55-year-old Russian captain. A voluntary breathalyzer test revealed a blood alcohol level that exceeded the permitted limit. The captain was immediately barred from continuing the voyage. The blood sample of the captain was collected for further analysis, and a $6000 security deposit was imposed. An investigation has been launched against the captain on suspicion of endangering maritime safety. The 123.04 metres-long vessel has been relocated to another berth at Bremen Port."
