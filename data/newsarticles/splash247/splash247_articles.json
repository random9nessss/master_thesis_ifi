        "content": "The container sector is heading into its normal post-Lunar New Year lull that typically lasts until April/May. The scale of the drops in spot rates is large, but the sector still remains one of the more profitable shipping sectors. The weekly Drewry World Container Index slumped 5% to $3,095 per feu yesterday. However, the index was 118% higher than the 2019 pre-pandemic average of $1,420. The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, published today, was down another 6% week-on-week to 1,758.82 points, hitting lows not experienced since 2023, before the Red Sea shipping crisis kicked in sending rates back up last year. “Carriers face an uphill battle to reverse the recent rate slide with cargo volumes still muted after the strong January cargo rush that had set new throughput records at key ports,” consultants at Linerlytica noted in a recent market report."

        "content": "Flex LNG has set out to leave the Oslo Stock Exchange in favour of listing its shares solely in the US. The Øystein Kalleklev-led company, backed by John Fredriksen, plans to present its plan for voluntary delisting from Oslo in May. Flex, which also trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), said the move was driven by the relatively high costs of maintaining a dual listing, specifically the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR), which would drive administrative costs of complying with dual reporting requirements. The company with 13 LNG carriers in its fleet also noted that the majority of its trading takes place in the US and that loss of Oslo trading should be mitigated by NYSE’s plan to increase its trading hours. “Having to deal with two sorts of regulations, which is quite costly in terms of consultants, auditors, and such, and given the fact that 95% of our trading today is on the NYSE…we have decided to propose to the board to delist in Oslo and save that money and focus on one set of requirements instead of having to deal with two conflicting sets of reporting,” Flex LNG chief executive Kalleklev told investors at the fourth quarter earnings presentation."

According to MarineTraffic, it was supposed to make a port call in Jeddah on January 29. Security consultancy Diaplous Maritime Services stated that the ship was posing a navigational hazard to other vessels in the area. Ambrey, another security firm, claimed that the fire was related to an explosion involving dangerous cargo. Reports claim that thick smoke is coming from the forward section of the containership. The crew has abandoned the vessel which is currently drifting."

        "content": "Shipping nuclear propulsion start-up CORE POWER has reached out to naval architecture firm Glosten for the design of a floating nuclear power plant (FNPP) to power ports in the United States. CORE POWER’s FNPP concept is a nearshore infrastructure system that includes a barge-based nuclear power plant, barge support services, electrical grid integration, and operational teams. The FNPP will provide an estimated 175GWh of clean electricity annually. The connection to the barge will allow ports to achieve zero-emissions electrical generation for visiting ships, terminal cranes, equipment, and port vehicles. Glosten will develop the operational concept and design the floating facility for the FNPP as well as a regulatory path for the barge, navigate site location approvals, and identify a potential supply chain network for fabrication, assembly, integration, transportation, and installation. “Glosten’s job is to turn CORE POWER’s vision into a design that demonstrates the practicality of providing reliable, zero-emissions nuclear power to port facilities and has a defined path to regulatory approval,” said Morgan Fanberg, CEO of Glosten. “Nuclear fission is a well-understood and practised process. It allows us to access an enormous energy resource safely, reliably, and on demand without emitting greenhouse gases. FNPPs will be shipyard-manufactured and mass-assembled, ensuring delivery speed and low costs,” added Mikal Bøe, CEO of CORE POWER. The project is currently in the concept phase and is being designed with the intent to serve a non-specific port located in the southern United States."

The vessel’s crew, made up of 25 nationals from Bulgaria, Ukraine, the Philippines, Mexico and Romania, was captured on November 19, 2023, when armed Houthis stormed the ship via helicopter. This started the Red Sea shipping crisis during which the Hamas-supporting Houthis attacked more than 100 vessels. Secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Arsenio Dominguez welcomed the release of the vessels’ crew, facilitated by discussions between the Hamas movement in Gaza and efforts from negotiators in Oman. “This is a moment of profound relief for all of us – not only for the crew and their families but also for the wider maritime community. I am grateful for all the member states, regional entities and international partners whose steadfast support and strategic engagement were pivotal in securing the crew’s freedom and ensuring their wellbeing,” Dominguez said. He added that innocent seafarers must not become collateral victims in wider geopolitical tensions and that this event marks the return to operations in the Red Sea as the maritime industry has been accustomed to. “IMO will continue to rigorously uphold its commitment to the safety of seafarers worldwide, who continue to face risks in their essential work,” the IMO secretary-general added. The release of theGalaxy Leadercrew comes days after the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect. The Houthis claimed that the release was in support of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and that they were committed to supporting the truce. The Houthis stated that as long as the ceasefire remains, international merchant ships may transit the Red Sea. However, Israeli-owned and Israeli-flagged tonnage will remain targets. Also, if the British and American military forces continue their attacks on Yemen, ships from those countries could be targeted too."

Due diligence is due to get underway through to the middle of next month. The deal faces one significant hurdle however. When HMM sold off its LNG division to IMM Private Equity in 2014, it came with a 15-year no compete clause. HMM has attempted to buy back its old LNG division from IMM in the past without success. The price differential between what HMM is reportedly bidding for SK Shipping and what Hahn & Co are after would suggest HMM is happy to forgo the LNG carriers for now. Local media suggests HMM is bidding KRW2trn ($1.4bn) to take Hahn’s 71.43% stake in the tanker giant, with the private equity firm having previously valued SK Shipping at twice that price. SK Shipping has a fleet of 62 ships according to shipping database Equasis, which lists the fleet as made up of 14 LNG carriers, 14 LPG carriers, 20 crude tankers, six product tankers and seven bulk carriers. Last September, HMM unveiled expansion plans through to the end of the decade, setting aside a massive KRW23.5trn ($17.48bn) that will see its container fleet nearly double while its tanker and dry bulk fleets will triple in size come 2030. A KRW5.6trn has been earmarked to expand the company’s dry bulk and tanker business from 36 ships to 110 vessels of 12.56m dwt."

        "content": "The European Union has officially approved its 16th package of sanctions imposed against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while the UK came out today with its own series of measures designed to stymie the Russian war machine. The new measures, announced on the third anniversary of the all-out war, target Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers, banks, aluminum imports, and other sectors. “For three years now, Russia has relentlessly bombed Ukraine, attempting to steal land that isn’t theirs to take,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said in a statement. The resumption of short cuts and old trading patterns would cut the ton-mile multiplier While Europe remains steadfast in its support of Uklraine, across the Atlantic, the new Donald Trump administration is attempting to bring the war to an end with officials in Washington DC saying American sanctions against Russia could be eased as negotiations for a settlement progress. “This would have ramifications for vessel supply, as the resumption of short cuts and old trading patterns would cut the ton-mile multiplier. The status of the vast shadow tanker fleet would be called into question, with a possible gradual shift back to the compliant fleet leaving many elderly tankers sidelined and in search of employment, end of life care or termination,” analysts at broker Hartland Shipping suggested in their latest weekly report. “The resolution could improve efficiency in oil transportation by reducing reliance on costly alternative routes and shadow fleets, leading to lower logistics costs and enhanced market stability,” Signal Ocean maintained in a recent report. On dry bulk, analysis by BIMCO shows that over the past 12 months Ukraine has seen an 87% year-on-year jump in shipments, while Russia dry bulk volumes have taken a 6% year-on-year fall. The primary reason for Ukraine’s spike in shipments lie in the success of its coastal corridor. Since August 2023, Ukraine has exported dry bulk cargoes via a coastal corridor, and despite Russian attacks on ships in September and October 2023, this has proven to be an effective solution. Nonetheless, volumes remain 36% lower than before the war began. “Over the past 12 months, tonne mile demand from Ukrainian and Russian cargoes has increased 3% y/y combined. Unlike volumes, tonne mile demand was already higher than pre-war levels during the second year at war because sanctions on Russian coal increased sailing distances. The demand increase has primarily benefitted ships in the panamax and supramax segments, whereas capesize demand remains below pre-war levels,” commented Filipe Gouveia, shipping analysis manager at BIMCO."

The deal will see the formation of a joint venture majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi-based ports and logistics giant, which received a 30-year extendable concession for the terminal inJune 2023. At the time it obtained the concession, AD Ports Group said it expected to invest about $220m to build a 400-metre quay wall at a 16-metre depth, plus a 10-hectare logistics area, during the first phase of the project and more than $500m over the life of the concession. CMA CGM shipping line ranks second in imports and transhipment in Congo, with historically an overall container volume market share in the country of about 35%. In 2021, the Marseille-based carrier also partnered up with AD Ports for a new container terminal inKhalifa Port, which was launched last December. CMA CGM’s subsidiary, CMA Terminals, holds a majority stake in that venture. “Our investment with AD Ports Group at the Port of Pointe Noire is a new milestone of our strategic collaboration between CMA Terminals and AD Ports Group as we enable modern, sustainable ports and maritime infrastructure for the next wave of global trade,” said Christine Cabau Woehrel, executive vice president for assets and operations at CMA CGM. The New East Mole terminal in Pointe Noire will handle containers, general, breakbulk and other types of cargo at the Central West African nation’s biggest Atlantic port. “We believe this partnership will position the Republic of Congo at the centre of maritime trade, in line with projections for annual growth of 3% to 5% in container volumes forecast for the country over the medium term,” added Mohamed Eidha Al Menhali, regional CEO at AD Ports Group."

        "author": "Bojan Lepic",
        "content": "Conservation and environmentalist groups have sued US president Donald Trump and his administration over his order to roll back the ban on future oil and gas leasing. The court battle against Trump is a two-parter. Several organisations are collectively challenging the order by the US president to revoke Biden’s withdrawal of certain areas of the ocean from future oil and gas leasing. Another set of groups is requesting the court to reinstate a federal court ruling that invalidated an attempt by the first Trump administration to undo offshore protections put in place by former president Barack Obama. In January, the Biden administration permanentlyprotectedthe entire eastern U.S. Atlantic coast, from Canada to the southern tip of Florida, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, Federal waters off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, and an area in the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska. This equates to more than 2.5m sq km of federal waters which is an area equal to around a quarter of the total land mass of the United States. Earlier in his administration, Biden also protected part of the Beaufort Sea and reinstated protections in the Chukchi Sea as well as canyon areas in the north and mid-Atlantic that Trump attempted to undo in his first administration. Last week, Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing theNational Energy Dominance Councilfocused on boosting the country’s production and export of fossil fuels. At the time, Trump revealed that Burgum was directed to undo Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order rescinding 68 executive orders and 11 presidential memoranda from the Biden administration, including those protecting ocean areas. Now, environmentalist groups – Northern Alaska Environmental Center, Alaska Wilderness League, Oceana, Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, Healthy Gulf, Center for Biological Diversity, Turtle Island Restoration Network, Natural Resource Defence Council, and Greenpeace – accuse the president of exceeding his constitutional and statutory authority by issuing a sweeping executive order revoking the protections. Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, enacted in 1953, the president has the authority to limit leasing activity. The groups argue that there is no provision in the act to allow a president to undo such withdrawals. In 2017, an Alaska federal court shut down Trump’s attempt to revoke Barack Obama’s protections. US District Judge Sharon Gleason ruled that presidents have the power to remove certain lands from development but don’t have the power to revoke the removals of their predecessors, putting a stop to Trump’s plans. The same groups that won that case filed a new motion asking Judge Gleason to reinstate her judgment against Trump, essentially blocking his attempt to reopen the protected waters to offshore drilling. The judgement was considered moot after Biden took office and rescinded the contested executive order. Just like in 2017, the League of Conservation Voters, Defenders of Wildlife, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Center for Biological Diversity, Northern Alaska Environmental Center, Greenpeace and Alaska Wilderness League claim Trump’s executive order upended the core reasoning behind the court’s dismissal. Currently, an executive order could be revoked only by an act of Congress which is one of the main reasons why the groups believe that Trump is overstepping his authority. The Trump administration currently faces more than 70 lawsuits challenging the crackdown on illegal immigration and end birthright citizenship, rollback of legal protections for transgender people, and dramatically shrinking the federal government."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Diversity, equity and inclusion are key to finding the talents shipping needs to deal with digitalisation and decarbonisation, writes WISTA International. As the maritime industry embraces digitalization and strives to meet its decarbonization objectives, fostering diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is essential to ensure success. A diverse workforce brings a range of perspectives to the table, at a time when attracting new talent will be critical for an industry demanding both innovation and long-term commitment to deal with a multitude of complex challenges. However, recent shifts in corporate and political landscapes threaten progress on DEI, with shipping far from immune, says WISTA International. Shortly after his inauguration as US President, Donald Trump signed two executive orders that directly affected DEI policies within the federal government. One reverses efforts by the previous administration to expand DEI programs, while the other bans DEI measures from being taken altogether. Meanwhile, citing a 2024 US supreme court ruling banning affirmative action in college admissions, McDonalds discontinued some of its DEI policies in January. Other US corporates have also made their moves: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergrecentlyended the technology giant’s commitments to DEI, while GM, Pepsi and Amazon have removed some—or all—references to DEI from their annual reports. But some of the world’s most powerful CEOs have reiterated their commitment to DEI, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman and Alexandr Wang of Scale AI. Meanwhile Costco shareholders voted against a proposal to end its efforts. Furthermore, studies like that done by IT consulting firm HCMoneyball point firmly towards DEI as a driver for stronger financial performance that helps businesses attract and retain top talent. The tenth Women in the Workplace report conducted by McKinsey & Company showed women still make up a less than 29% of C-suite positions in the US, from 17% in 2015. Women also continue to face barriers at the point of entry, where they remain less likely than men to be hired overall, leaving them underrepresented from the start. Once in place, women are also far less likely to get promoted to a management role. Compared to corporate America, the imbalance is even more pronounced across the maritime world, where the WISTA International Women in Maritime Survey 2021 showed that women made up just 29% of the overall workforce. Focusing in on seafarers, women’s share of personnel numbers represents a mere 2%. For a shipping industry behind the curve on equality yet competing with other sectors for the brightest and best to push forward with digitalisation and decarbonisation, attracting skills and talents from the entire pool of potential candidates is critical. International Maritime Organization (IMO) Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez has vowed that the IMO will focus on enhancing support provided to seafarers to deal with decarbonisation, diversity and criminalisation in 2025, “We have made progress, particularly when it comes to gender in the maritime sector, but the reality is that there is more to come,” he said, adding that he would remain firm on his commitment. “Now is not the time to turn back when we are just making significant progress in these areas,” says Elpi Petraki, President WISTA International. “DEI has been shown to offer a competitive advantage that shipping companies should not ignore. It is crucial for attracting the diverse talents we need to foster innovation in dealing with the big issues we as an industry face today.” Research shows that women are surpassing men in college results through hard work and aptitude – the very qualities that companies want and need, she adds. Policies that make employees feel valued and included only help companies retain the skilled and intelligent staff that they increasingly need. McKinsey’s report concluded that at rates of change before the growing roll back, it would take 48 years for women of all colours to reflect their share of the US population in senior company leadership. WISTA’s Petraki argues that the problems faced by shipping companies have not been caused by DEI, but the lack of it. She adds that organisations which are accountable to shareholders may be using anti-DEI rhetoric to disguise their poor performance for other reasons, when the reality is that DEI enhances profitability. Social change can often lead to a backlash, adds Petraki, but backing down in the face of an assault of DEI threatens to undermine the work done to make a global industry more progressive and attractive to all of the available talent. “Blaming progressive policies for the problems faced by people, companies and the world will do nothing to remedy the real issues we all face in shipping,” adds Petraki. “Change is not easy, and nor is it inevitable. But recent developments confirm it remains essential.”"

The biggest ships on the biggest volume markets are the most affected. Capesize day rates of $1,279 per day from Australia to China were 82% lower on January 24 than on December 24. On the Brazil to China route, rates were off by only 29% to $7,934 between the same dates. Capesizes are reportedly carrying more bauxite than coal these days, and even cold weather in Europe has only weakly supported the transatlantic voyage carrying coal from Bolivar to Rotterdam. Rates were reported at $9.88 per tonne, or $15,502 per day on January 24, having been as high as $24,340 a week earlier after averaging $17,000 per day in December and $25,700 a day for calendar 2024. The Baltic Exchange 5TC capesize average for January so far is $10,949 which is the lowest number since Lunar New Year affected January and February 2023 which were respectively $9,065 and $3,749 per day. Panamaxes carry more coal than capesizes, but their regular coal voyage, a round trip from South China to Indonesia and back, has displayed a sickly pallor for months now. In January the chart showed a further decline, with rates falling 45% to a below opex $2,872 compared to $5,175 just 30 days earlier. Ships sailing from China to the west coast of North America were being fixed at $5,614 on January 24, down 6% over 30 days, while those sailing from China to Europe were rated at $3,525, down 25% over 30 days. Panamaxes outbound from Mississippi to North China via Panama were rated at a more robust $14,357 on January 24, having trickled down by 7% since December 24. Those sailing from Santos to North China via Panama were rated at $7,936 on January 24, down 21% on the month. This case of January blues extended to the Atlantic. North Atlantic round voyages were down $33% at $6,975 while trips out to Asia were down 11% at $12,906. The geared bulk carriers fared no better in January with rates falling on every route. The worst offender was the South China to Indonesia round voyage. Earnings for an ultramax bulker on this voyage fell 47% over 30 days to a clammy $5,614 on January 24. The North China – Australia round voyage lost 29% to sit at a wheezy $6,581 per day on an ultramax. The voyage out from the Indian ocean to Asia lost 36%, lolling at $7,488 on January 24. The Baltic Exchange 63 dwt time charter average was in bed with the chills at $8,078 on January 24, down 31% from $11,671 a month earlier. Even the handysize market was in search of a remedy to collapsing freight rates with the HS7TC average down 28% at $7,406 on January 24. The US Gulf to Europe voyage was least affected, with a 12% reduction in day rates to $10,550, though rates on the reverse rate were off by 30% at $5,714 per day. The Southeast Asia to Australasia round voyage was hardest hit, falling 35% to 6,694. The China to US west coast rate was off by a third in a month at $6,700 per day. Every undergraduate can tell you that drinking a case of snakebite will make you ill. The question is, how long will the hangover last? Send your hangover remedy recipes on a postcard to Xi Jinping, Beijing, China. A DJ Trump of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC, USA, has already sent a list of demands to add to the sanctions declared by the previous tenant of his home. These will only add to Xi’s headache. His reaction will go a long way to determining the destiny of the dry bulk freight market in the Year of the Snake."

        "content": "Italian offshore engineering and construction giant Saipem and offshore engineering and services player Subsea 7 have reached an agreement in principle on the key terms of a possible merger of the two companies. The combination of Saipem and Subsea 7 will be completed by way of an EU cross-border statutory merger carried out incorporating Subsea 7 into Saipem, with the latter to be renamed Saipem7. The new firm will have a combined backlog of €43bn ($45.2bn) and revenue of around €20bn ($21bn). According to a memorandum of understanding signed by the two companies, Saipem and Subsea 7 shareholders will own 50% each of the share capital of the combined company. Subsea 7 shareholders will receive 6.688 Saipem shares for each Subsea 7 share held. The London-based firm will distribute an extraordinary dividend for an amount equal to €450m ($473m) immediately before completion. Post-completion, Saipem7 is expected to pay a dividend of at least 40% of free cash flow after repayment of lease liabilities. The new company will be headquartered in Milan and listed on both the Milan and Oslo stock exchanges with completion set to occur in the second half of 2026. The parties will submit the final terms of the proposed combination to their respective boards for approval and to enter into a merger agreement around mid-2025. After the merger is completed, Siem Industries, the largest shareholder of Subsea 7, would then own approximately 11.9% of the combined company’s capital, while Eni and CDP Equity – the largest shareholders of Saipem – would own around 10.6% and approximately 6.4%, respectively. CDP Equity, Eni and Siem Industries have entered into a separate memorandum of understanding to support the merger and agree on the terms of a shareholders agreement, to be effective from the completion of the proposed combination. As part of this, the chairman of the Saipem7 will be designated by Siem Industries and the CEO will be designated by CDP Equity and Eni – this role will most likely fall to Alessandro Puliti, the CEO of Saipem. Saipem7 will be structured into four businesses – offshore engineering and construction, onshore engineering and construction, sustainable infrastructures, and offshore drilling. The offshore engineering and construction business will be incorporated into an operationally autonomous company named Subsea7 and branded as Subsea 7 – a Saipem7 company. As it stands, it will be led by John Evans, CEO of Subsea 7. It will comprise all of Subsea 7’s business and the asset-based services business of Saipem, representing approximately 83% of the combined group’s EBITDA of the last 12 months as of September 30, 2024. The company will be headquartered in London. When merged, the new company will be a global organisation of over 45,000 people, including more than 9,000 engineers and project managers in more than 60 countries."

        "content": "Following a new investment, Japan’s NYK Line has become the majority owner of the crew transfer vessel (CTV) operator Northern Offshore Group. N-O-G, an operator of over 60 CTVs in the global offshore wind industry, has had an operational and technical collaboration with NYK since 2019. The company has now become a part of the NYK Group after a majority of its shares were acquired by NYK. Through this latest investment, N-O-G will be able to leverage NYK’s global network while the Japanese company will gain important operational experience in preparation for the anticipated future expansion of offshore wind in waters closer to Japan. David Kristensson, Northern Offshore Group CEO, will continue to lead the company while Carl-Johan Hagman, NYK executive officer and NYK Group Europe region head, will become the chairman of N-O-G’s board of directors. “For several years, NYK and N-O-G have had a close partnership that has very naturally evolved into this co-ownership. N-O-G will continue to operate as an independent entity but will have the ability to draw on the global resources of the wider NYK Group,” said Hagman. Last month, NYK launched a crew transfer vessel shipmanagementjoint venturefor domestic offshore wind projects with local towing player Akita Eisen Kisen Kaisha. This came following a memorandum of understanding for CTV operations mainly in the waters off Akita prefecture in 2021."

In it, they claimed that the accident was caused by a strong storm. A joint criminal investigation into the 1,638 teuNewnew Polar Bearis still being conducted by authorities of both Finland and Estonia. The Chinese media outlet stated that the report was currently going through several ministries, but that type of report can’t be used as evidence in the investigation by the two countries. Finland and Estonia have requested information on the ship from China but Beijing has stayed silent on the matter apart from the report. The Balticconnector gas pipeline was damaged in early October last year in the Finnish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Later that month, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation stated that the damage was caused by an external mechanical force and that they had founda heavy objectnear the damaged pipeline. It turned out that the mentioned heavy object was an anchor from the Hong Kong-registered vessel and the Finnish authorities found that the same type of paint was identified on the anchor as on the Balticconnector and that it was most probably from theNewnew Polar Bear."

Compatriot owner and operatorArriva Shipping, which recently signed up for an 8,000 dwt battery hybrid bulker newbuilding at Jiangsu Soho Marine Heavy Industry, will take the vessel on charter and manage the commercial operation for wood products trader Viken AT Market. Viken AT Market ships about 1m tons of Norwegian timber to the continent annually mostly with conventional diesel-powered ships. “Norway’s coastal fleet must swiftly transition to more climate-friendly practices, and we are thrilled to provide transport with nearly zero emissions to Viken AT Market. They also deserve commendation for their forward-thinking approach and willingness to invest in the solutions we can now offer,” stated Bjørn Ødegård, commercial director at Arriva Shipping. The vessel’s concept was developed by Bergen-based Skarv, with support from Grieg Shipbrokers to realise the technology and yard agreement. The ship is designed to sail most efficiently at low speeds, which helps ensure economically viable operations despite the higher cost of ammonia compared to traditional fuels, Skarv said, adding that its 160 cu m ammonia tank, mixed with marine gasoil as pilot fuel, will provide enough fuel for a 14-day round trip from Norway to the continent. “This is our first ship capable of sailing on ammonia from day one, allowing it to operate with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. Simultaneously, the engine is linked to an electric propulsion system that utilises batteries and has access to shore power,” remarked Jan Øivind Svardal, CEO of Skarv Shipping.

        "content": "Mark O’Neil, president and CEO, Columbia Group, writes for Splash today. It’s time to see shipmanagement as a verb, not a noun—it should be viewed as a dynamic, ever-evolving field rather than a static industry. As efficiency, automation, and AI shape the future of shipmanagement, it is crucial to recognise that shipmanagement is more than just a sector within the maritime industry—it is an active service that demands expertise, human intelligence, and a tailored approach. To optimise it, we must shift away from a ‘one size fits all’ mindset and embrace a model that mirrors the personalised approach of ship owners. Traditionally, shipmanagement has been seen as an industry driven by standardised solutions designed to streamline operations and reduce costs. However, this approach is fundamentally flawed. True shipmanagement requires active engagement, hands-on decision-making, and meticulous attention to vessel operations. It is not merely a business model but an ongoing process that demands knowledge, dedication, and a commitment to excellence. Technology should support, not replace, the invaluable knowledge and experience of seafarers Consider a seasoned maritime professional who knows every detail of the vessels under his care. He does not simply oversee shipmanagement as an abstract function; he is deeply involved at every level, understanding each nut, bolt, and coil of rope on every ship. This level of engagement distinguishes effective shipmanagement from passive oversight. The industry must adopt this mindset to deliver real value to ship owners. One of the biggest challenges today is the increasing reliance on technology at the expense of human intelligence. AI and automation play a vital role, offering powerful tools for data analysis, predictive maintenance, and operational efficiency. However, their effectiveness depends on the expertise behind them. Without skilled maritime professionals interpreting data, making informed decisions, and adapting to ever-changing conditions, AI is ineffective. Technology should support, not replace, the invaluable knowledge and experience of seafarers. At Columbia Group, we prioritise our people, recognising that their expertise is just as vital to the future of shipping as the technological advancements reshaping the industry. Furthermore, shipmanagement should not be a standardised service. It must go beyond offering generic packages to truly understanding each client’s unique needs. A well-optimised approach is flexible, tailored, and built on strong partnerships. This requires moving past basic pricing and service models in favour of customised solutions that meet the specific demands of individual owners and operators. At its core, shipmanagement must be about integration. The industry needs to move beyond traditional third-party and second-party management structures and adopt a holistic approach that combines maritime logistics, energy, and leisure services. Shipmanagers should not operate as distant service providers but as integrated partners, working closely with owners to maximise performance, cost efficiency, and sustainability. This shift will ensure that ship management remains a proactive practice rather than a passive service offering. Ultimately, shipmanagement must evolve beyond conventional thinking. It must be recognised as a service that is both dynamic and deeply personal—one where human expertise and technological innovation work in harmony. The future of the industry depends on a model that emphasises customisation, partnership, and continuous engagement. Only by adopting this approach can we truly optimise shipmanagement as an active and ongoing process, creating lasting value for owners and operators alike. The evolution of shipmanagement requires rethinking the role of managers, operators, and technology. This means fostering close relationships with shipowners, understanding their individual needs, and delivering value through expertise, precision, and the strategic use of technology. By treating shipmanagement as a verb—an active and ongoing process—the industry can drive meaningful improvements in efficiency, service quality, and operational success."

The wreck was battered by swells of up to 6.8 m striking every 15 seconds, and the massive force of this constant battering caused the accommodation block to first break off, which then led to a number of larger cracks on the hull, forward of the accommodation.

        "content": "Last year has proven to be the third most profitable year in the history of container shipping, and likewise it proved to be the third best year in the 121-year history of Denmark’s largest shipping concern, Maersk. Top management in Copenhagen today laid out how the Houthis from Yemen could dictate the line between black or red ink for the coming year. Maersk reported its third-best financial year ever today with an EBIT for 2024 of $6.5bn. The Danish carrier forecasted global container volume growth in 2025 will be around 4%. However, the very big dividing line between profit and loss this year, according to Maersk, will centre around the Red Sea. The Houthis of Yemen have put their campaign against merchant shipping on hold, with no attacks reported in 2025 so far, as Israel and Hamas take steps toward peace. The situation remains tense however with very few liners returning to take the Suez route between Asia and Europe. Maersk’s EBIT forecast for 2025 ranges from zero to $3bn, depending on whether the Red Sea opens in the middle of the year or the end of the year. The company added its outlook for 2025 is subject to “considerable macroeconomic uncertainties” impacting container volume growth and freight rates. Suez Canal transits last year for the container sector as a whole were down 90% from 2023, according to data from Jefferies, an investment bank. The main economic impact of the Red Sea routes’ potential reopening would be to return capacity to the container shipping system, equivalent to around 6% to 8% of existing vessels due to faster sailing, according to data from S&P Global. At the same time, new container vessels adding nearly 24% of new capacity are coming, launching over the next three years. Vincent Clerc, Maersk’s CEO, claimed today his company was “uniquely positioned” to support customers in an era that he described as having “geopolitical changes and disruptions which continue to reinforce the need for resilient supply chains”. Cash-rich Maersk revealed yesterday it has started a 12-month share buyback program of up to DKK14.4bn ($2.01bn). The purpose of the program is to adjust the capital structure of the company ultimately through the cancellation of shares repurchased, Maersk stated in a release. The Danish liner is nearing the end of its first week in a new alliance, launching the Gemini Cooperation with Hapag-Lloyd covering the main east-west trades. The ambition is to deliver a flexible and interconnected ocean network with industry-leading schedule reliability above 90% once fully phased in."

Nevertheless, the Italian city is set to become Hungary’s primary port in the coming years as construction has just got underway on a 30 hectare site the Hungarian government has bought with the port project set to be complete by 2028. Adria Port, a Hungarian state-owned company, is developing the $209m project, which will feature 650 m of quayside and a 30 hectare logistics centre. “If the country does not have its own sea exit and seaport capacity, it will always be at the mercy of others. We would like to change this situation,” said Levente Magyar, Hungary’s foreign minister, visiting the site last week. Hungary became a landlocked country more than a century ago in the wake of World War One and the loss of sea access via Croatia. If the country does not have its own sea exit, it will always be at the mercy of others The country has also recently signed a pact with Bulgaria to create a transport corridor to provide export links via the Black Sea. The principal port of Hungary, Budapest or the Csepel Freeport, lies on the river Danube and handles more than 1.2m tonnes of cargo per year."

After eight consecutive days of no reported incidents, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency carried news yesterday of an incident in the southern Red Sea. The master of a vessel reported being hailed on the radio by an entity claiming to be the Yemeni Navy demanding that they turn on AIS, a well-known method of Houthi engagement with passing ships. A crewmember then reported having heard suspected gunshots. The disruption brought about by the Houthis’ campaign to target more than 70 merchant ships over the past five months has seen traffic slump by more than two-thirds in the Red Sea, but for vessels heading to the region armed guards have become necessary. Amid a tight supply and demand situation, prices for private maritime security guards onboard have shot up dramatically this year, rekindling the era of Somalian piracy more than a decade ago. The demand for extra security has also been bolstered by the sudden return of Somalian pirates who have started targeting ships and crews for hijack and ransoms. Another nine Somali pirates were arrested by the Indian Navy on March 29, having abducted an Iranian dhow."

The Kjell Inge Røkke-dominated outfit, once known as American Shipping Company, holds a 19.6% stake in Solstad Maritime equal to about 91.4m shares which it intends to distribute to its shareholders, and excess cash as a special dividend. AMSC became a shareholder in Solstad Maritime in Solstad Offshore restructuring, to which it contributed the vesselNormand Maximusin exchange for shares. The two other large shareholders in the company are Aker Capital, with a 42% stake, and Solstad Offshore, holding 27.3%. AMSC entered the offshore sector in May 2022 when it took ownership of the 2016-built offshore subsea construction vesselNormand Maximus. In August 2023, the company sold its Jones Act-compliant tankers business, American Tanker Holding Company (ATHC), for gross cash proceeds of $249.3m, divided between consideration for the shares in ATHC and repayment of a shareholder loan, reflecting an enterprise value of ATHC of nearly $747m. “Following transformational transactions over the past two years, distributing SMH shares and liquidating the company will be the next milestones for AMSC in achieving its long-term goal of maximizing shareholder value. During the last 11 years, AMSC will have distributed more than NOK65 per share in cash in addition to the SMH shares. We are truly grateful for the sustained support from our shareholders over many years and believe a direct exposure through the SMH share will be an excellent opportunity to create value going forward,” said Pål Lothe Magnussen, CEO of AMSC. Solstad Maritime is expected to have a first day of trading on the Oslo Exchange during the second quarter of 2025."

Used on 19 vessels across Ultranav, the trial with Signol is an additional initiative aimed at saving fuel and lowering emissions. Signol is a tech-enabled behaviour change service that helps shipping companies fully engage crews in reducing emissions through their daily tasks. By using behavioural science, Signol claims to motivate and engage crewmembers to make more sustainable and fuel-efficient decisions. This is achieved through behaviour change techniques delivered via a web app and targeted emails. Examples include: Signol claims its techniques have reduced fuel consumption and emissions by 4-12% for maritime clients. “We recognise the significant potential in Signol’s service and firmly believe that every tonne of saved CO2 counts. Even small adjustments to our daily routines can contribute to the overall goal,” said Bas Blaak, Ultranav’s head of energy efficiency and sustainability. In 2024, Ultranav participated in the investment round for Signol, a company that claims to have already saved aviation and shipping customers $25m in fuel costs and more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Ahead of a big green meeting at the International Maritime Organization next week, John Maggs from the Clean Shipping Coalition writes on how getting a global fuel standard and levy over the line will set us up for the future. The international shipping sector provides an outsized and growing contribution to the climate crisis. Slower, more efficient ships can help slash climate emissions, but this will not happen without ambitious regulation. Fortunately, the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) current revision of the rules around its Carbon Intensity Indicator, a metric for measuring and regulating ships’ carbon emissions provides such an opportunity. Governments are consulting and reviewing evidence on barriers to efficiency and potential solutions, with a final decision on improving the indicator due by January 1 2026. If properly designed, these new rules could address almost half of shipping’s climate impacts and deliver massive ocean health co-benefits. But the outcome is far from certain. The scope of the problem The vast majority of internationally traded goods travel by ship, and these massive ships burn a lot of fuel. As a result, the shipping industry generates around three per cent of all climate emissions globally—a contribution equivalent to that of the whole economy of a country like Germany or Japan. Ships also undermine ocean health. I am not just talking about the environmental harm caused by oil spills when a tanker runs aground or sinks. As we have seen recently in the Black Sea this remains a very serious problem, but ships are also responsible for a myriad of other routine yet damaging operational practices—some legal, some not—that threaten ocean wildlife: oil and chemical discharges, toxic paint coatings, underwater noise pollution, sewage and grey water discharges, and the dumping of plastics, to name just a few. Human health is also threatened, with an estimated 250,000 deaths and millions of childhood asthma cases annually caused by toxic air pollution from fossil-fuel powered shipping. In all these areas, regulation has failed to keep up with the growth of the industry. Sporadic and weak measures mean the problem keeps getting worse. Turning the page? The Carbon Intensity Indicator revision provides the IMO with an important opportunity to address both the climate and ocean health impacts of global shipping and turn the tide on some of these problems. By far the most effective way to reduce ship climate impacts is to slow ships down. A ten per cent speed reduction can lower the emissions of an individual ship’s journey by almost 20%. Even though this will mean, in some cases, using additional ships, there are still large net emission reduction benefits. What’s more, slowing ships down can happen immediately—we don’t need new technology just to take our foot off the gas pedal. We must also look at wind power. In a case of “back to the future,” new high-tech sails can dramatically reduce fuel burn (and thus emissions) on existing ships, and can go even further when new ships are designed from scratch to use wind as their primary means of propulsion. No other transport mode can harness wind power directly in this way – it is shipping’s climate crisis superpower. Most underwater noise pollution is caused by ship propellers, compromising the ability of whales and other marine life to forage and reproduce. Using sails and slowing ships down has a dramatic effect on noise levels, and slower ships are also less likely to strike and kill whales and other marine wildlife. Any action that reduces the amount of fuel burned not only reduces climate emissions, but also cuts emissions of everything connected to burning fuel, including the particulates that are harmful to human health. The oily sludge that ship fuels generate, which sadly still often ends up being discharged illegally at sea, is also reduced. Reducing fuel burn also decreases the volume of toxic waste produced by the exhaust gas cleaning systems, known as scrubbers, that shipowners are installing to avoid using cleaner fuels. This shocking new waste stream is largely unregulated and dwarfs other shipping pollution in terms of volume. An outsider looking in could easily assume that ship owners would operate their vessels more efficiently purely out of self-interest and a desire to minimise costs, but there are a number of factors working against this. For instance, there’s industry’s “split incentive” – whereby the entity responsible for the technical efficiency of a ship and its equipment isn’t always the one paying for the fuel. Inefficient ship operation is also often written into long-established conventions and contractual arrangements—the most famous one being the instruction in charter agreements to travel at “utmost dispatch” (quickly) and then wait at the destination if you get there too early. Slowing down and arriving on time would make more sense, and have a massive impact on climate emissions, but would also be a breach of the agreement. And in a booming market when few ships are without work, an individual owner acting from a business perspective might prefer to speed up and squeeze in an extra trip. Unfortunately, this is the worst approach from a climate, environment and ocean health point of view. It is rare that a single measure or regulation holds the potential to have such wide-ranging positive impacts on the climate and environmental footprint of an industry. The revision of the IMO’s Carbon Intensity Indicator truly holds the possibility to set the shipping industry on a much more sustainable course. Next week’s IMO meeting, which is set to discuss the shipping sector’s impact on the global climate (Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships – ISWG-GHG 18) must agree on an ambitious set of new climate measures, including a global zero- and near-zero GHG fuel standard, along with a levy on ship emissions to drive emission reductions and ensure a just climate transition for international shipping. However, to keep the cost of the shipping energy transition down and see to it that emission cuts happen quickly enough to meet the IMO GHG strategy’s 2030 and 2040 goals, these measures must be aligned with an ambitious, transparent and enforceable energy efficiency measure. To build a more ocean-friendly shipping industry, governments must close their ears to “special pleading” from industry and make sure both the fuel standard and levy align with the concurrent IMO’s Carbon Intensity Indicator revision, ahead of April’s Intersessional Working Group on Air Pollution and Energy Efficiency."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "James Peacock, who leads product development at XMAR, tackles an issue likely to be one of the talking points at this year’s Geneva Dry. Chartering has always been a balancing act of relationships, instinct, and expertise. With artificial intelligence (AI) making waves in every industry, it’s fair to ask: could machines ever take over the role of a charterer? On paper, AI ticks all the right boxes: data crunching, pattern spotting, and route optimising. But the reality is more complicated, and assuming that AI will simply make charterers obsolete misses the point. What AI can do (and does well) AI is brilliant at handling the grunt work. Need to analyse a mountain of vessel positions, freight rates, and historical fixtures? AI can do it in seconds. It doesn’t get tired, doesn’t forget things, and doesn’t let emotion cloud its judgment. Tools already exist that can predict optimal routes, flag potential fixtures, and even estimate bunker costs. In logistics, a 2023 McKinsey report found that automating repetitive tasks with AI led to 15 to 20% efficiency gains. Shipping, with its endless data and paperwork, is ripe for that kind of transformation. Whether it’s managing voyage data, calculating fuel consumption, or identifying trends, AI can make life easier for charterers by handling tasks that would otherwise eat up their day. Where AI falls short But chartering is about more than spreadsheets and graphs. It’s about navigating grey areas and knowing when to bend a little to get a deal across the line. Machines are great at following patterns, but can they sense when a shipowner’s ‘maybe’ really means ‘yes, if you push’? Can they pick up on the slight hesitation in someone’s voice during a negotiation? Take recruitment as an example. AI tools have been used to scan CVs, but they’ve repeatedly missed good candidates because they didn’t fit the mold the algorithm expected. In the same way, AI risks missing nuances in chartering, like geopolitical shifts, local quirks, or even the subtle power of relationships that have been built over decades. The data challenge AI is only as good as the data you feed it, and the maritime industry isn’t exactly known for its tidy databases. Too many shipping companies rely on outdated systems, with critical information locked up in spreadsheets or buried in emails. A 2022 Splash survey found that 68% of shipping executives rated their internal data systems as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. For AI to make reliable decisions, it needs reliable data. That’s where platforms like XMAR come in, not to replace charterers but to give them the tools to do their jobs better. By organising data, automating admin, and surfacing insights, platforms can help charterers focus on the bigger picture. A changing role, not a disappearing one So, will AI replace charterers? Probably not. But it will change the job. Instead of spending hours sorting through emails or calculating voyage costs, charterers could spend more time on strategy and negotiation. Imagine having an AI assistant that flags opportunities, predicts market trends, or drafts fixture notes for you to review. Look at doctors. They now use AI for diagnostics, but they’re still the ones making the final call. The same goes for charterers. AI won’t take over, it’ll be a second set of eyes, a tool to sharpen decisions. Moving forward The question isn’t whether AI will replace charterers, it’s how we use it to make charterers better at what they do. Shipping is still a people business. Relationships matter. Trust matters. But that doesn’t mean we can’t embrace technology to lighten the load. A number of platforms are showing that you don’t have to choose between man and machine. The future of chartering isn’t about one replacing the other, it’s about working together. Interested to find out more about the intersect between chartering and technology?

After being towed to the installation site, their position is maintained by a mooring system consisting of anchors and mooring lines. The duo said the aim is to establish a joint ownership and operation system for new vessels fit to carry out the work and a procurement framework for mooring systems, in anticipation of the floating wind sector ramp-up in the 2030s. The Japanese government aims to deploy 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 30-45 GW by 2040, including floating wind where there is a growing interest due to Japan’s limited shallow coastal areas. The country has been looking to raise its domestic procurement for offshore wind in a bid to bolster the local supply chain. Japan’s largest shipowner by fleet numbers has been gradually growing its offshore wind business in Asia with investments in several segments, including crew transfer vessels, construction service operation units, and module carriers that will serve the Japanese offshore wind sector. Fukada has also diversified from its initial marine salvage operations, with towing and installation work for the domestic floating offshore wind market and offshore surveys, in addition to construction and marine civil engineering business. “We will continue to support power generation companies so that they can proceed with ease without the interface risks associated with the procurement of construction vessels and mooring systems,” the companies said in a release on Friday."

        "content": "The UK has announced the Clean Industry Bonus (CIB), a new incentive scheme looking to increase investments in the offshore wind sector and push the country closer to its goal of decarbonising its energy system by 2030. The scheme will provide an initial £27m ($33.5m) in funding for every gigawatt of capacity from offshore wind projects. To qualify for the CIB, developers must commit at least £100m per gigawatt for fixed-bottom offshore wind farms and £50m per gigawatt for floating offshore wind farms. If an application for the project exceeds the minimum investment standards it will be considered for the incentive. The CIB application window will close on April 14. Following the application window, the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will assign a score to submitted CIB extra proposals. The UK has already revealed plans to expand its current offshore wind capacity from 15GW to between 43GW and 50GW by 2030. The UK’s grid operator did say last year that the government’s target to source 95% of power from clean energy was a major but attainable challenge. The country will hold more renewable auctions later this year, in which developers will bid for government-backed price guarantees on generated electricity. The new funding will be awarded through the contracts given in these auctions."

        "content": "As shipping slithers somewhat apprehensively into the Year of the Snake, analysts reckon tankers – whether hauling gas or oil – are best placed to see an uptick in fortunes. The Lunar New Year is not starting too well with many sectors struggling to break even in January. The cross-sector ClarkSea Index, a weighted barometer covering all shipping segments, eased back by 8% last Friday to $21,128 a day, the lowest level for more than a year and with the average in 2025 so far down by 10% year-on-year, though still up 13% on the 10-year trend. One analyst to have stuck his neck on the line with his predictions is Dr Adam Kent, the head of Maritime Strategies International (MSI), who gave delegates attending last week’s Marine Money event in London his take on where each segment is in terms of the cycle, with Kent suggesting LNG, currently experiencing record lows, is best placed for an upswing. The average spot rate assessment for a 174,000 cu m ship fell by 31% to $14,000 a day as of last Friday, while the equivalent rate for a 145,000 cu m steam turbine unit now stands at just $2,500 a day, down 29% week-on-week. Protracted weakness, especially for older steam turbine units, is seeing more vintage gas tankers head for demolition, while many owners are contemplating lay-ups as a record volume of newbuilds readies to leave Asian drydocks. Has the sector nearly bottomed out, and will it post a solid upswing, as Kent has forecast?Splash Extrasought the views of other shipping analysts to pick out improving segments to watch out for in the Year of the Snake. Giuseppe Rosano, who heads up London broker Alibra Shipping, concurred that LNG ought to perform better in the months ahead. He also singled out LPG, spurred by resilient Asian petchem and regional demand as well as increased supply from the Middle East and Africa. Tanker freight markets work on fine margins of utilisation “Ethane and clean ammonia trade should increase too, keeping new orders for LPG vessels high,” Rosano said. Looking closely at the MSI slide above, Mark Williams, the founder of UK consultancy Shipping Strategy, argued that oil tankers are nearer a cyclical upswing than the graphic suggests. Williams placed his tanker optimism down to US overtures towards Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump’s plans to increase oil production, along with more Atlantic basin oil production. At the same time, Williams pointed out more tankers are turning 25 in the next few years and the fleet will shrink even as tonne-miles – if not overall tonnes – could grow. “Tanker freight markets work on fine margins of utilisation – there is upside potential,” Williams said. Holding similar views is Ralph Leszczynski, the head of research and consultancy at Banchero Costa, who admitted he is concerned about the “really scary” LNG orderbook, which will see more than 100 newbuildings deliver this year alone, resulting in a net fleet capacity increase of 13% year-on-year. “I highly doubt at this point that there will be enough extra cargoes on the market and/or sufficient increase in tonne-miles to absorb all of these new vessels. Hence the supply-demand balance for LNG is actually likely to get worse rather than better this year,” Leszczynski said, who then went on, like Williams, to express greater confidence in crude tankers, especially VLCCs. Unlike LNG, the crude tanker orderbook is very modest with Banchero Costa data showing the VLCC fleet is expected to see zero growth this year, and the aframax fleet will expand by only 1%, whilst the shadow fleet, Leszczynski argued, will increasingly struggle under harsher sanctions and controls. “The Trump government will encourage more US crude exports, and will probably try to strong-arm both Europe as well as China to buy more from the USA at the expense of Russia and Iran, which is beneficial for tonne-miles,” Leszczynski predicted, dismissing upswing prospects for containerships and dry bulk. Splash Extracontacted more than 20 analysts for their Snake shipping forecasts. However, with today’s incredibly volatile markets and uncertain geopolitical situation, most experts were not willing to stick their necks out. One analyst who wished not to be named confided that with “Trump 2.0” there are so many fast and unexpected moving parts that the smart play was to adopt famous maritime economist Martin Stopford’s view of never giving a forecast. Most shipping sectors are expected to see quieter activity levels in the coming days due to the Lunar New Year holidays. Typically, container shipping is most affected followed by dry bulk and to an extent tankers, though over the years, there have been exceptions. In 2024, dry bulk rates and tanker rates both jumped at the onset of the holiday while containers drifted downwards after a short squeeze at the start of the Red Sea diversions. Across all three sectors this year, freight rates have been on an easing trend heading into Lunar New Year, suggesting further downside from here may be limited. Normally the post-New Year period sees the beginning of a resurgence in dry bulk, somewhat of the status quo for tankers and the start of seasonal softness for containers."

        "content": "A new report from UCL’s Energy Institute Shipping and Oceans Research Group assesses the financial risks to the shipping industry from stranded assets due to stricter greenhouse gas regulations, possibly due for adoption at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) this year, in combination with the ongoing global transition to a low-carbon energy system. The report finds the shipping sector faces substantial supply-side risks linked to carbon-intensive vessels becoming obsolete and demand-side risks linked to decreased fossil fuel demand. The report finds that over 40% of ships globally transport fossil fuels, and nearly all ships are fossil-fuelled. To align with shipping’s estimated share of the carbon budget of 9.6 giga tonnes, ships representing over one third of the existing and ordered fleet value would need to quickly transition to zero-emission technologies or face premature scrapping. The transition away from fossil-fuels in the wider economy creates further risks of oversupply for fossil fuel carrying ships. In particular, liquefied gas tankers look likely to face the highest exposure to this risk, with 26–32% of fleet value at risk around 2030. Dr Nishatabbas Rehmatulla, principal research fellow at the UCL Energy Institute, said: “Our research to date consistently shows that the majority of the shipping stakeholders, particularly investors including shipowners and financiers, are not anticipating an ambitious transition. This research shows that an investment strategy that is based on watch and wait is a risky strategy, it could lead to rapid unanticipated write-downs and losses from forces within and outside the sector.” Retrofitting and repurposing ships would reduce the amount of stranded assets but can still be a costly alternative, the study suggests. Dr Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at the UCL Energy Institute said: “IMO set its direction in 2023, and therefore clarified the supply-side risks discussed here. That strategy’s ambition is close to that of the 1.5°C scenario used in this analysis. With evidence from earlier this month that further momentum is building behind a universal GHG price and package of IMO mid-term measures that can strongly incentivise transition, there will be further crystallisation of that risk this year. But perhaps a key point from this analysis is that at the point when it is beyond doubt that fossil fuel technologies, including LNG as a fuel and cargo, face rapid contraction, it will be too late for many to take corrective action.”"

The partners plan to further expand operations to include other Fincantieri sites located internationally. The joint venture will oversee the entire waste management process, focusing on optimising facilities to maximise the recovery of valuable materials such as iron, wood, plastic, and paper, aiming to increase recyclable fractions by 15% in the first year. The initiative will unfold in two phases: initially managing nearly 100,000 tons of industrial waste annually and later achieving full operational capacity through advanced infrastructure, including facilities for water treatment, copper recovery, and waste sorting. This circular economy-driven approach will be further reinforced by constructing treatment plants and expanding temporary storage with enhanced sorting and recovery capabilities. Pierroberto Folgiero, CEO of Fincantieri, commented: “The launch of the joint venture with a valuable partner like Hera Group adds a piece in our further commitment to the adoption of virtuous circular economy procedures within our shipyards.”"

Similar to the threats he made to Colombia a week prior, the American president yesterday put planned tariffs against Mexico and Canada on hold for 30 days, saying that the leaders of the two countries had acquiesced to his demands to bolster security at their borders with the US. Chinese tariffs, however, remain in play, with a blanket 10% levy now underway as of midnight today and Beijing replying in kind. China said today it will impose from next Monday a 15% tariff on LNG and coal imported from the US, as well as a 10% tariff on oil, agricultural machinery and large-displacement cars. Trump is scheduled to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this week. On Sunday, Trump indicated the European Union would be his next target for tariffs. In the first Trump trade war in the previous decade, the Chinese targeted US farmers and reduced imports of US grain. China is able to substitute this with more imports from Brazil, with minimal net tonne-mile impact. According to data from Clarksons Platou Securities, dry bulk, particularly grain and steel products, was the most impacted from the first Trump trade war with China, followed by LNG and LPG. Overall shipping tonne-mile growth fell 0.5% in 2018, then again by 0.5% in 2019, according to Clarksons data."

        "content": "Amid escalating tensions in an ongoing trade dispute, the anticipated conversation between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping was scrapped yesterday and has yet to be rescheduled. A tariff tit-for-tat has got underway between the world’s two largest economies with the US putting a blanket 10% levy on all Chinese imports, and Beijing responding, saying it will impose from next Monday a 15% tariff on LNG and coal imported from the US, as well as a 10% tariff on oil, agricultural machinery and large-displacement cars. In the first month of the Trump administration, the president has threatened – and then dropped – tariffs against Colombia, Canada and Mexico. Only China has felt the wrath of American tariffs to date. Judah Levine, head of research at box booking platform Freightos, said the recent tariff “drama” heightens the concern over how completely unpredictable and disruptive this second Trump administration may prove. How seriously tariffs alter trade flows has been brought into question. Tariffs have been a feature of Trump’s first administration as well as by his successor, Joe Biden and yet data from Linerlytica shows loaded container imports into the US outpaced exports by 2.4 times in 2024, a statistic that analysts at Linerlytica said in a weekly report provides “clear evidence that import tariffs imposed since 2018 have been completely ineffective” in reducing the US trade imbalance. Total laden imports grew by 24% between 2017 and 2024, the Linerlytica data shows, while laden exports shrunk by 8% over the same period, driving a 54% increase in the number of empty containers repositioned out of the US. “Trump’s tariff wall might be a stage, but like walls to keep out migrants, it is difficult to achieve much in four years,” Martin Stopford, the world’s most famous maritime economist, toldSplashin the wake of Trump’s election win last November. In a conversation withSplashearlier, Khalid Hashim, managing director of Thailand’s largest dry bulk owner, Precious Shipping, said he was sanguine about Trump and tariffs. “Trade flows under Trump 1.0 and Biden’s continuation and increasing Trump’s 1.0 into Biden 1.0, have increased, not decreased, trade flows into the US,” Hashim said. “If the past is any predictor of trade flows, then as we have seen all such disruptions tend to have an immediate, but extremely short-term impact, before leading to increased tonne-mile and increased trade.” Looking at the tanker and dry bulk trades, broker Braemar has suggested China tariffs on US crude and coal imports are unlikely to impact tonne-miles. The market stands to lose roughly three VLCCs per month of US crude to China, according to Braemar, but this slack is likely to be picked up by other importers in Northeast Asia. On coal, Braemar notes China’s customs data confirms that some 10.7m tonnes of coking coal were imported from the US in 2024, alongside 1.5m tonnes of thermal coal, a combined annual record. For context, however, total coal imports into China last year reached 543m tonnes. “For dry bulk commodities like coal, grains, and iron ore, we don’t anticipate major negative effects,” said Stamatis Tsantanis, chairman and CEO of capesize pure-play Seanergy Maritime. “Ultimately, tariffs are just one factor; geopolitical events play an equally important role,” Tsantanis said. “The next six months will be critical as the current administration aims to end conflicts while implementing new trade policies. The outcome of these efforts, and how tariffs interact with global events, remains uncertain. Significant volatility is expected over the next three to six months as the market adjusts to the evolving landscape, making this a pivotal period for global trade and economic stability.”"

However, Israeli-owned and Israeli-flagged tonnage will remain targets, the Houthis said, adding that continued attacks on Yemen by British and American military forces could see ships from those countries targeted too.

        "content": "US box imports reached a record high in January with deliveries from China up for a second month, according to Canadian logistics and supply chain management tech specialist Descartes. Imports in January stood at 2,487,470 teu, surpassing the previous record in January 2022 by 21,455 teu. Boxes from China hit 997,909 teu of last month’s total, a jump of 10.6% over December and just 2.4% shy of the all-time high of 1,022,912 teu set in July 2024. The spike comes against a backdrop of tariff instability, with the US placing a fresh 10% tariff on Chinese goods on February 4, while more punitive 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada were suspended until March to allow for more discussions. “The impact of new and potential tariffs, coupled with a late Chinese Lunar New Year, may have contributed to higher US container imports in January,” said Jackson Wood, director of industry strategy at Descartes. Although the logistics indicators show a good start to 2025, Descartes highlighted that new US tariffs on China, continued trade policy conflicts, and geopolitical upheaval in the Middle East are increasing concern for firms with global supply chains. “As trade tensions escalate, businesses and consumers alike may face the risk of higher prices and prolonged market volatility,” Wood added. Descartes also noted that despite elevated volumes for a seventh consecutive month, overall port transit time delays were not significantly lengthening at the top 10 US ports."

        "content": "China’s retaliatory tariffs on some American goods came into effect on Monday, while Donald Trump, the American president, vowed yesterday to impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US, with a full announcement to come today. “Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff,” Trump said yesterday. In the opening three weeks of Trump’s return to the White House, the president has announced many tariffs, much of which have since been rescinded or postponed. “For the shipping and supply chain sector we are at a point where any such statements should be taken with some scepticism – at least in terms of deciding to suddenly change supply chains and sourcing patterns. As the developments over the past week has shown then not only statements related to tariffs but also actual executive orders are prone to rapid changes and postponements,” Lars Jensen, who heads up container shipping consultancy Vespucci Maritime, commented in a recent social media posting. “It is hard to assess the impact of tariffs on shipping and trade given their traffic light nature: green, amber, red, repeat, broken,” commented broker Hartland Shipping in a weekly report. China’s latest tariffs on US goods include a 15% border tax on imports of US coal and liquefied natural gas products. There is also a 10% tariff on American crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars. Beijing’s action is in response to a blanket 10% tariff Trump has levied on all Chinese imports. In a complaint lodged with the World Trade Organization (WTO), China said the US import taxes were “discriminatory and protectionist” and violated trade rules. The trade war between the world’s two largest economies to date has not had a huge effect on global seaborne volumes. According to Clarksons Research, the US tariffs on China affect 67m tonnes per annum of trade based on 2024 volumes, while China’s response affects a further 23m tonnes per annum, taking total freshly tariffed trade to around 0.7% of global seaborne trade in tonnes and 1.4% in tonne-miles. “Based on these fresh US and Chinese polices, direct impacts on bulkers (coal), tankers (crude) and LNG are limited (less than ~1% of global trade ‘tariffed’ for each),” Clarksons noted in its most recent weekly report."

The pariah ship suffered damage when encountering bad weather off the far north of Norway while carrying 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. After many countries refused to let the vessel dock, the UK came to its rescue in October, allowing it to call at Great Yarmouth on the country’s east coast. The cargo was transferred to theZimrida, a handysize bulk carrier, in November. TheZimridathen left the UK in mid-December arriving at Abidjan anchorage on December 30 at which point many locals protested its arrival. The ship “does not represent any danger for the port facilities, even less so for the population”, the port authority said in a statement yesterday, adding that it had taken necessary precautions. “There is therefore no specific danger in the cargo intended for the Ivorian loader being unloaded in Abidjan port before the ship returns to the sea,” the port authority said. Some 8,000 tonnes of the shipment are due to be unloaded at the port this week after which theZimridais due to call in Angola and Tanzania. The ship is carrying seven times the amount of ammonium nitrate that caused the 2020 port explosion in Beirut (pictured), which killed more than 200 people."

Sørvest F was supposed to be up for bidding later this year. It is an extension of the Sørlige Nordsjø II won by a partnership between Parkwind and Ingka Investments in 2024. However, the decision not to put the area up for tender was made after the transmission system operator Statnett conducted a study for possible solutions to connect a new wind farm in Sørvest F to the onshore grid. Of the five possible solutions, four involved so-called hybrid concepts that connect the area to Norway and neighbouring countries while only one connects it solely to the mainland. It also revealed that hybrid solutions need the state’s backing and significant technological development before an interconnected grid can be done. “We are currently facing high costs, both for offshore wind production and associated grid solutions. Statnett’s study shows that hybrid cables will not solve these challenges. Offshore wind production will need a lot of government support, regardless of which grid solution we choose. Therefore, we will prioritise floating projects,” said Terje Aasland, Norway’s minister of energy. He added that he did not want to further expose the Norwegian power system to the challenges seen in Germany and other European countries. The primary reason for prioritising floating offshore wind projects is the ability to connect them to the Norwegian mainland with single-point connections."

The severity of the downturn is highlighted by the fact that January average bulker speeds across the globe are at lows not witnessed for more than a decade, according to data from Banchero Costa (see chart below). Monthly average laden speeds have been recorded by Ursa Shipbrokers at 10.59 knots, below the previous record lows of January 2024 and December 2024, both at 10.66 knots. “The reasons are to cut down on emissions with all the environmental regulations hitting shipowners, but most importantly to cut down on voyage costs as lower speeds – or slow steaming – allow for lower bunker expenses,” Ralph Leszczynski, Banchero Costa’s head of research, toldSplash. Leszczynski said this has been particularly relevant over the last five years as bunker costs have been bumped up by the switch to more expensive low sulphur fuels, and voyage distances have increased. The Baltic Exchange’s dry bulk index fell for a sixth straight session on Tuesday to an over one-year low as rates weakened across all vessel segments. The weak freight rates are also impacting the sale and purchase scene with the spread widening between buyers and sellers. “Buyers seek discounts supported by weak freight markets and sellers are benchmarking against December sales or waiting to see if earnings pick up after the Chinese New Year holidays,” brokers Hartland noted in a recent report."

MAMII is exploring options to advance these research projects to on-ship trials as soon as possible. MAMII was launched in September 2022 by Safetytech Accelerator at a time when LNG as a shipping fuel was attracting a great deal of negative press. MAMII brings together industry leaders, technology innovators, and maritime stakeholders to advance technologies for measuring and mitigating methane emissions in the maritime sector and promote the adoption of validated solutions. It currently has more than 20 shipping and energy companies as anchor partners. While methane slip – unburnt methane released during the combustion process – remains the largest source of methane emissions on ships, emissions across the LNG supply chain, from loading to engine delivery, are also a concern. Three companies – Xplorobot, Sorama and framergy – were selected by MAMII to help address theneed to detect, measure and capture fugitive methane emissions from LNG fuelled ships. Xplorobot provides a handheld device and AI-powered platform to detect and measure fugitive methane on ships using computer vision to pinpoint leak locations, overlay real-time emission rate data, and integrate seamlessly with existing systems for quick issue resolution without requiring specialised training. Sorama develops acoustic cameras that detect fugitive gas by visualising sound and vibration fields in 3D. Framergy specialises in adsorbents and catalysts for methane emission management."

        "content": "Arnaud Dianoux, Opsealog’s managing director, explores recent research into how harmonising digital information will enhance operational efficiency, sustainability, and compliance in the offshore sector. The maritime industry stands on the cusp of a transformation driven by data standardisation; a shift as impactful as the introduction of the shipping container in the 1950s. Modern vessels generate vast amounts of data – up to 20 gigabytes daily – from sensors, engines, and reports. Yet much of this data remains isolated onboard, with limited real-time transmission to shore. Standardisation ensures consistency and accuracy in interpreting this data, much like how English became the universal language of shipping. For example, mixing up speed units – knots versus statute miles – can lead to costly errors over time. Standardisation eliminates such risks by providing a common framework for communication across the industry. Strategic advantages, beyond compliance While regulatory bodies like the IMO and EU are pushing for data standardisation, the benefits extend far beyond compliance. Standardising data helps optimise key performance indicators (KPIs) such as fuel efficiency, engine performance, and emissions, enabling more precise decision-making. It enhances transparency, allowing shipowners and charterers to track performance, ensure contract compliance, and build stronger business relationships. Standardisation also plays a key role in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting, simplifying data collection and boosting stakeholder trust. Moreover, it helps streamline predictive maintenance, identifying issues before they escalate and reducing downtime. Boosting data’s game A large majority of today’s vessels manually engage in daily position reporting in various formats, while some are also equipped with hardware that assists with fuel monitoring. Without standardisation, however, this data often fails to reach its full potential. Standardised data allows for cross-fleet comparisons, automating data collection, and reducing the manual effort that currently burdens crews. This reduces errors, improves efficiency, and maximises operational effectiveness. Encouragingly, the maritime sector is already taking meaningful steps toward embracing data standardisation, with industry groups leading the charge. These collaborative efforts demonstrate the sector’s recognition of standardisation’s transformative potential and highlight the progress being made in laying the foundation for a more efficient, transparent, and sustainable future. One example is the Smart Maritime Council’s introduction of Version 1.0 of its Standardised Vessel Dataset for Noon Reports, which creates a consistent reporting framework across the industry. Similarly, the Energy LEAP initiative, supported by major energy companies, has developed a Vessel Emissions Reporting Standard, streamlining emissions data for regulatory compliance. Finally, The International Support Vessel Owners Association (ISOA) has published data standardisation guidelines that apply to and beyond noon reporting. Its work follows on from the industry-developed white paper 10 Principles to Decarbonise the OSV Industry, which states: “Performance data should be transparent and shared in a standardised format, ensuring credibility and ease of access.” These efforts reflect a growing consensus that standardisation is key to improving efficiency, transparency, and sustainability across the sector. Surmountable challenges Data standardisation is not without its challenges, particularly in offshore operations where specialised tasks and a variety of intricate operations complicate the development of universal standards. Data security and ownership concerns also pose potential barriers. Overcoming these issues requires strong governance policies and collaborative frameworks to build trust and ensure smooth implementation. As fleets adopt cleaner technologies and multi-fuel systems, operators will need increasingly granular data to optimise performance and stay ahead of regulatory changes. Data standardisation forms the backbone of evidence-based decision-making, allowing operators to plan retrofits and build next-generation vessels. Data standardisation is more than a technical necessity; it’s a catalyst for the future of maritime operations. It enables immediate action on energy efficiency, provides a clear baseline to measure the impact of innovations, and ensures continuous monitoring of best practices in applying new systems. Embracing this shift will not only ensure regulatory compliance but also unlock new opportunities for growth, efficiency, and sustainability. By investing in standardised data practices today, operators can lead the way in shaping the future of the industry."

Soren Toft-led MSC previously ordered 11,500 teu and 10,300 teu 10-ship series at Changhong International in 2023, which was followed by twelve 19,000 teu LNG dual-fuel megamaxeslast August. The world’s largest container carrier has a fleet of about 6.4m teu, commanding around 20% share of the global operated fleet. The company’s massive orderbook now stands at more than 130 ships, which is, following the latest deal, projected to boost the fleet by an additional 2.15m slots in the coming years. Changhong International has also confirmedthe earlier reportedorder for 11,400 teu LNG dual-fuel boxsips from George Economou’s TMS Group."

        "content": "Researchers at Rutgers University-New Brunswick have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that will help predict endangered whale habitats, guiding ships along the Atlantic coast to avoid them. The tool is designed to prevent deadly accidents and inform conservation strategies and responsible ocean development. Using an AI-powered computer program that learns from patterns detected between two vast databases, the researchers said their method improved upon present abilities to monitor the ocean for the distribution of important marine species, such as the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale. North Atlantic right whales have been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1970. There are approximately 370 individuals remaining, including about 70 reproductively active females, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The effort was led by Ahmed Aziz Ezzat, an assistant professor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the School of Engineering, and Josh Kohut, a professor in marine sciences who in January became dean of research at the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences Kohut likened the output of the program to what might be learned by tracking the movements of people in a house as well as determining whether there is food in the kitchen and a television set on in the den. Such factors might determine why people are where they are at certain times of the day. Detecting certain patterns, he said, conveys predictive power. “With this program, we’re correlating the position of a whale in the ocean with environmental conditions,” Kohut said. “This allows us to become much more informed on decision making about where the whales might be. We can predict the time and location that represents a higher probability for whales to be around. This will enable us to implement different mitigation strategies to protect them.” Initially, the researchers sought to develop high-resolution models of the North Atlantic right whale presence to support responsible offshore wind farm development and operation. But they said the results have far broader implications and have made the details public as an addendum to their research paper. “These tools are valuable and would solidly benefit anyone engaged in the blue economy – including fishing, shipping and developing alternative forms of energy sustainably,” Ezzat said. “This approach can support a wise and environmentally responsible use of these waters so that we achieve our economic objectives, and at the same time make sure that we cause minimal to no harm to the environmental habitat of these creatures.” Unlike typical computer programs, where instructions are explicitly written out, the machine-learning program employed by the researchers analysed large data sets to discover patterns and relationships. As the AI program encountered more data, it adjusted its internal model to make better predictions or classifications. “The outcome of the machine-learning model is basically a prediction of where and when you will have a higher likelihood of encountering a marine mammal,” Ezzat said, describing what he characterised as a “probability map.”"

        "content": "The Houthis traded fire with fire once again yesterday, claiming they had carried out a strike on an American navy heavy load ship calledOcean Jazz, something disputed by the US military who in turn took out some Houthi military installations in Yemen in attacks coordinated with UK counterparts. With the Red Sea shipping crisis showing no sign of clearing up, shippers are becoming increasingly anxious about the availability of empty containers, a potential supply chain headache last witnessed during the covid pandemic. Meanwhile, in London, Arsenio Dominguez, the new secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), opened the first sub-committee meeting under his tenure reiterating his message calling for peace in the Red Sea. “I will continue to reiterate my three key messages on the situation: seafarers are innocent victims, and their safety is paramount; the principle of freedom of navigation should be upheld and allow safe trade of essential goods; and the call for de-escalation of the situation,” Dominguez said while also calling for the immediate release of theGalaxy Leadercar carrier and its crew, abducted by the Houthis two months ago. Seafarers are innocent victims No sector has witnessed greater diversion disruption more than container shipping, with around 90% of all boxships opting to take the longer route around the African continent on voyages between Asia and Europe rather than risk being targeted by the Iranian-backed Houthis, who have fired missiles and drones at some 35 merchant ships since November in their response to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. This soaking up of container tonnage has sent freight rates rocketing, while importers are scrambling to get access to containers at origin, something that is expected to become far more difficult in the coming three weeks towards the Chinese lunar new year. The Container Price Sentiment Index (xCPSI) developed by Container xChange, a German box-buying platform, assesses the prevailing market sentiments among supply chain professionals on the anticipated trajectory of container prices in the upcoming weeks. As of January, the xCPSI values have surged to historic highs. Christian Roeloffs, CEO of Container xChange, pointed out that supply chains currently hold a surplus capacity of over 6m teu, accumulated over the last two years due to a demand deficit. This excess capacity acts as a “vital cushion” to absorb potential shockwaves in the supply chain, he said. “The degree of impact hinges on the duration of the Red Sea crisis,” Roeloffs said. “Should it persist for an extended period, and the excess capacity continues to be absorbed, we could potentially face serious challenges. Drawing a comparison to the Ever Given situation, where disruption occurred during a period of extreme difficulty in securing capacity and historic peak demand, rates skyrocketed to 10 times pre-pandemic levels. While we aren’t currently at those historic highs, the recent rate surge is noticeable when viewed in the short term.” This week CMA CGM, the world’s third-largest liner, announced an empty container imbalance surcharge of $100 per unit on top of similar equipment surcharges out of Turkey to the Mediterranean and North Africa announced last week. Meanwhile, German carrier Hapag-Lloyd has detailed a new landbridge box service through Saudi Arabia. The company said it would offer land connections from Jebel Ali, Dammam and Jubail to its ocean shuttle service out of Jeddah."

The contract covers an 18,000 cu m unit costing about KRW127bn ($87.6m) with no specified delivery date. H-Line’s fleet predominantly consists of capsize bulkers, but the company is also active in the LNG and car carrier segments. It has placed most of its orders in these segments since 2021, when it also signed its first shipping deal with Rio Tinto for an LNG-fuelled 180,000 dwt bulker. The company’s LNG bunkering newbuild will be 144 m long, equipped with two independent tanks, and feature an LNG dual-fuel propulsion system. HJSC built the world’s first LNG bunker ship for NYK in 2014—the 5,100 cu m Green Zeebrugge, currently on charter to Danish marine fuel supplier Monjasa in the UAE. The shipbuilder said it expects to benefit from the anticipated uptick in the LNG bunkering sector, where several owners, including Avenir, Fuzhou Wuyang, Singfar, Peninsula and Equatorial Marine, had most recently placed newbuilding orders. “As global LNG demand and supply increase, the LNG bunkering ship market will also continue to grow,” said Yoo Sang-cheol CEO of HJSC, adding: “We will focus on securing unrivalled competitiveness in the market by accumulating eco-friendly, high-value-added shipbuilding technologies worthy of the reputation of a leading shipbuilding company.”"

        "content": "The world’s first commercial sailing roro vessel,Neoliner Origin, has been launched at the RMK Marine shipyard in Türkiye. The vessel, which started construction in November 2023, is being built for the French shipping company Neoline. It is a 136 m long and 24.2 m wide cargo ship with 3,000 sq m of sail and a pair of foldable 76 m high carbon masts. The vessel also boasts a loading capacity of 1,200 linear meters or 265 20-foot containers. The maximum cargo weight of the sailing roro is 5,300 tonnes. RMK Marine said that the vessel would reduce fossil fuel consumption by over 80% and would “harness the power of the wind as its primary driving force”. As far as GHG emissions are concerned, they can be reduced by up to 90%. This unique vessel will be operational in the summer of 2025 with first trials planned for the spring. It will operate on a route between Saint-Nazaire and Baltimore. On its way, it will make stops in Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon and Halifax."

        "content": "The Ultrabulk-managed general cargo shipUltra Galaxy, which was abandoned by its crew of 18 seafarers on Monday after a heavy listing, has run aground with efforts to prevent a fuel and oil spill currently underway. The South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) said on Wednesday that attempts are being made to salvage the vessel’s fertiliser cargo as well. The confirmation of the grounding off the coast of Brand se Baai on the West Coast, 385km north of Cape Town, occurred on Tuesday around 10 pm local time. Preliminary indications are that the vessel has a full load of fertilizer in bags onboard as well as low-sulphur bunkering fuel and hydraulic and related oils. Salvage operations are currently underway. On Monday, one tug was dispatched and arrived at the location on Tuesday. Another tug with more personnel and extra equipment departed from Cape Town on Tuesday evening to assist in the salvage efforts. Other measures are also being undertaken for the containment of any possible spills of the vessel’s cargo contents. “We are closely working with SAMSA and the appointed salvors, focusing all efforts on the vessel’s recovery. There are no initial reports of pollution and as a precautionary measure oil spill response equipment and assets have been mobilised although operations are currently hampered by the adverse weather conditions,” a spokesperson of Transworld Fleet Management, the ISM manager of theUltra Galaxy, toldSplash. Transworld also revealed that the two tugs were standing by near the vessel awaiting a suitable break in the weather to resume operations. The vessel was located some 60 nautical miles west of Doring Bay when it sent its initial distress call at 3 am local time on Monday. Three ships closest to the casualty vessel – theFivos, theRio Grande Express, and the fishing vesselMalachitediverted from their routes to assist. The entire 18-strong Filipino crew escaped from the listed vessel in a life raft and wererescuedby theMalachiteand taken to St Helena Bay. The Panama-registered 13,800 dwtUltra Galaxyis a 124 m long general cargo vessel built in 2008. According to available data from Equasis, it is owned by Fujita Shoji and managed by Denmark-based dry bulk operator Ultrabulk. At the time of its distress call it was en route to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Steven Jones, the founder of the Seafarers Happiness Index, reflects on frustration felt about the treatment of seafarers in many ports around the world. When thinking about seafarers’ happiness, it is tempting to assume their greatest challenges occur far out at sea. However, new insights reveal a different story—seafarers are increasingly speaking out about the troubling treatment they face in ports worldwide. Ports, the very places meant to offer safe haven, respite and support, are becoming sites of frustration and mistreatment. Issues like abandonment often arise when vessels dock, but smaller indignities accumulate too, creating an environment of tension and needless neglect that takes a heavy toll on seafarers’ morale and well-being. The latest Seafarers Happiness Index highlights some of the worst experiences, painting an unflattering picture of certain ports. Crews report unwelcoming, even hostile environments, with access to shore leave denied, poor treatment, and essential support systems failing when needed most. Frustration is mounting, as seafarers deal with a mix of petty bureaucracy, ineffective systems, and policies that make life unnecessarily difficult. One recurring issue is the maddening inefficiency of “port buses” that either fail to turn up or operate on schedules more hopeful than reliable. Seafarers are left waiting endlessly, their much-needed shore leave disrupted by unreliable transport. This inconvenience, which is exacerbated by port gates deliberately kept closed to seafarers, adds to the feeling that their needs are unimportant. Instead of granting easy access to nearby towns, ports often force crews to enter or exit through remote gates, far from civilisation—wasting time, adding costs, and sending a clear message about their value. Worse still, this lack of support is frequently accompanied by rude, arrogant, and offensive behaviour from port personnel. Seafarers have voiced concern about the sheer disrespect they face at the hands of gate staff. While security is necessary, there is no excuse for the aggression, rudeness, and hostility that some crews encounter, especially when these ports should be places of welcome and assistance. It is deeply troubling when port authorities, who we might suppose want to help (or at least not hinder seafarers), end up making matters worse. There seems to be a significant disconnect between some ports and the needs of one of their most important stakeholders: seafarers. A closer look at the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports of many port operators may hint at the problem. Page after glossy page of graphs, imagery, and lofty commitments, yet rarely is there even a mention of seafarers. This omission has become the norm. Port’s’ “social” priorities appear to have a seafarer-shaped blind spot. When reporting on stakeholders, seafarers are often overlooked, seemingly considered unimportant to the operation of ports. This disregard seemingly legitimising, certainly explaining, the poor treatment they so frequently receive. It is not always the port itself that is leading the negative spiral. Often it can be the decisions of customs and immigration authorities. So, we would ask whether ports are doing enough to push back, to explain the problems and to champion crews and to stand up for them? Again, it would seem probably not. Port personnel—whether on the gates or in the boardrooms—need to take a hard look at how their operations affect seafarers. Some honest self-assessment is needed. Port authorities should take the time to truly experience how their own port functions. Is the gate closest to town unnecessarily closed? Try taking the port bus—observe how sparse the information on schedules is, how dirty the seats are, and how unhelpful the staff may be. Consider how it feels to be required to wear full PPE just to visit the local shops. What’s the experience like at the gate? How are seafarers treated? Only by stepping into their shoes can we truly understand the challenges they face—and only then can we determine if we are doing enough to make them feel welcomed, valued, and respected. Until seafarers are recognised as key stakeholders and important port users then it seems problems will persist. The message is clear that ports need to modify their operations to ensure that crews can easily, safely, and respectfully access the services they need. Until that happens, the industry faces a significant, self-inflicted problem, and that is a very depressing reality."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Emanuele Grimaldi, the chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping, writes for Splash today. In an era marked by growing uncertainty, knowledge and trusted sources are more powerful than ever. The International Chamber of Shipping’s annual Barometer survey, the fourth edition of which was recently launched, obtains critical insights into the evolving risks and challenges confronting the ICS maritime leadership community across the world. With multiple years of data, we can now track trends that reveal where the industry feels confident, where vulnerabilities lie, and how these dynamics are shaping operational decisions. Some risks have remained consistent. Cyber-attacks, for example, have been flagged as a top concern year after year, reflecting the growing reliance on digitalisation and the vulnerabilities it exposes. Similarly, political instability has long been identified as a major risk, particularly as geopolitical tensions escalate. However, the 2023-24 Barometer highlighted a new, pressing concern: malicious physical attacks on ships and crew, driven by heightened global conflict. These risks are not theoretical; they are influencing the daily decisions of shipowners, operators, and stakeholders across the supply chain. The growing threat of political instability and physical attacks in critical regions, such as the Red Sea, has forced owners to make difficult yet necessary choices. Rerouting vessels around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid dangerous waters has become an increasingly common practice. While these diversions are essential to protect crews and assets, they come with longer transit times, increased costs, and operational disruptions. Meanwhile, ports in the Western Mediterranean and Africa have responded by scaling up investments to meet rising demand as ships avoid volatile regions. For the first time, the 2023-24 Barometer survey identified the availability of trained crew and skilled personnel as a top issue for industry leaders. This development aligns with warnings highlighted in the Shaping the Future of Shipping Summit in Manila, which discussed the growing challenges in maintaining an adequate supply of skilled seafarers. As the shipping industry competes for talent in a tight global labour market, leaders may need to look beyond traditional recruitment grounds. Attracting and retaining talent will require making the industry more appealing to the next generation of workers. This includes demonstrating strong commitments to values such as diversity and equity, – principles that are increasingly important to workers across industries. At the same time, regulatory pressures remain a dominant factor shaping operations. This is no surprise given the significant strides made toward mid-term greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations, with expectations for adoption in 2025. These measures are essential for achieving the industry’s decarbonisation goals, but they also demand significant investment and innovation. For ports, shipowners, and stakeholders across the maritime value chain, the path to decarbonisation hinges on regulatory clarity and confidence. Clear signals from policymakers will enable businesses to make the long-term investment decisions needed to transition to green fuels and sustainable operations. As we confront these challenges, it is clear that the shipping industry plays a vital role not only in keeping $14trn in global trade moving but also in addressing broader societal goals, such as decarbonisation and digitalisation. To succeed, we must ensure that our industry functions in ways that allow us to meet sustainability targets, reap the benefits of technological advancement, and keep trade flowing uninterrupted – even in turbulent waters. These risks demand coordinated responses that prioritise security, stability, and the continuity of global trade. The best way to navigate these challenges is through collective effort. As the collective voice of the international shipping industry, ICS articulates and advocates these factors critical to our success – creating supportive, forward-thinking regulations – to international regulators International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization as well as to other government regulators and relevant stakeholders. This is where the Barometer plays an invaluable role. By identifying shared concerns, measuring where priorities align, and highlighting where they diverge, the Barometer helps to shape a cohesive and informed approach to tackling the industry’s most pressing challenges. It provides the clarity and insights needed to sow the seeds for a future in which shipping – and global trade – can thrive. As we navigate the turbulent waters of today’s world, we must do so with a firm grasp of the challenges facing individual sectors, the industry as a whole, and the broader economic and geopolitical forces at play. Knowledge, as the Barometer demonstrates, truly is power. With the right information, collaboration, and support, the maritime sector can not only overcome its challenges but emerge stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for the future.

        "content": "The New Nuclear for Maritime Houston Summit has been making headlines this week for bullish comments on how atomic propulsion will have a place in the future merchant fleet. HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE), an intermediary holding company for HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding sector, unveiled a nuclear-powered 15,000 teu containership model (pictured) at the event utilising small modular reactor (SMR) technology. Unlike conventional ships, nuclear-powered vessels do not require engine exhaust systems or fuel tanks. HD KSOE has optimised the space previously occupied by large engine room equipment to accommodate additional containers. The company has also applied a marine radiation shielding system using a double-tank method with stainless steel and light water to ensure safety. Furthermore, HD KSOE, in collaboration with global energy technology company Baker Hughes, has applied a supercritical carbon dioxide-based propulsion system, improving thermal efficiency by approximately 5% compared to existing steam-based propulsion systems. HD KSOE plans to establish a marine nuclear demonstration facility at its Future Technology Test Center. “Nuclear-powered vessels can be a game-changer in the current shipbuilding market, where carbon neutrality is emerging,” said Patrick Ryan, chief technology officer of class society ABS, which gave the Korean builder an approval in principle for the new design. Since February last year, HD KSOE has been accelerating related technology development through joint research on next-generation SMRs with TerraPower. In December last year, the company secured an order to manufacture the main equipment for TerraPower’s Natrium reactor, which is being constructed in Wyoming. Also speaking at the summit, Christopher Wiernicki, ABS’s chairman and CEO, who told delegates: “New nuclear technology is a global decarbonisation solution and a commercial shipping disruptor. There is no net zero by 2050 without nuclear.” ABS published the industry’s first comprehensive rules for floating nuclear power in October last year. “New nuclear is a transformational technology. It disrupts the commercial model, the economics of shipping, as well as the operation of vessels and of course their design,” said Wiernicki. “Not only does it offer zero carbon operations but higher power with faster transit speeds, increased cargo storage due to the elimination of fuel storage and it unlocks the potential for reverse cold ironing where the vessel powers the port. Finally, critically, it eliminates the need to bunker fuel potentially over the entire lifespan of the asset.” Contrary to conventional wisdom about the high cost of nuclear technology, Wiernicki said he believes new nuclear can be highly competitive. “The economics are compelling over the life of a vessel,” he said. “When you account for fuel differentials, the cost of compliance and residual value, it costs roughly the same as fossil options, only with zero carbon operations. And it gets much more attractive when compared to the high cost of green fuels.”"

Greek shipping tycoon George Procopiou has acquired the entire share capital of the Astir Palace hotel group from Middle East interests, having bought a 30% stake last October. The portfolio includes four hotels, the centrepiece being the Four Seasons Astir Palace in Vouliagmeni, south of Athens, which tends to host some of the largest gatherings at the biennial Posidonia. Procopiou is one of Greece’s largest shipowners with companies including Dynagas and Dynacom. He has also built an international real estate portfolio comprising more than 2,500 properties. Shipowners have had a long history of buying into hotels. In Japan, Meiji Shipping, Shoei Kisen and Uni-Asia all have hotel interests, as does Sea Consortium’s Tim Hartnoll and Graham Porter from Tiger Group Investments. In Norway, many families have hotel and shipping holdings including the Glastads, the Wenaas family and Finn Olsen Rederi. Among the largest hoteliers cum shipowners is Singapore-based Kuok Group, whose shipping interests include Pacific Carriers, while its global hotel brand is the five-star Shangri-La chain. Aristote Onassis, arguably the most famous shipowner in history, owned Monaco’s Hôtel de Paris for much of the 1950s and 1960s before falling out with then ruler, Prince Rainier III."

UK maritime security consultants Ambrey warned yesterday that the 45,000 dwtRuenhad reportedly been sighted sailing eastwards 160 nautical miles southeast of Eyl, Somalia. The European Union naval force also said yesterday that this week’s pirate activity far out to sea could have involved the use of theRuen, a ship whose 18 crew have already been waiting for three months to hear about ransom negotiations. TheAbdullah, a Bangladeshi bulk carrier abducted by Somali pirates on Tuesday in the Indian Ocean, anchored off Somalia yesterday with 23 crew onboard. The ship was boarded with ease approximately 600 nautical miles east of Mogadishu. Emboldened by their vessel capture earlier this week, Somali pirates have set out again to sea to snare more ships passing by. Ambrey has received a report of four suspected pirate skiffs departing from the Hobyo, Nugal, and Mudug areas in Somalia, with 36 armed people onboard. Piracy was rampant off Somalia for a four-year period from 2008, but then it went dormant for about five years. Earlier this month, the Maritime Security Centre Horn of Africa (MSCHOA) reported an unnamed hijacked fishing dhow departing Somalia with 11 armed persons onboard. In January, Liberian-flagged capesize Lila Norfolk was boarded by armed men some 460 nautical miles off Somalia but subsequently rescued by the Indian Navy."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Global seaborne trade flows are set for choppy conditions in the wake of President Donald Trump’s decision on Saturday to levy 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on goods from China starting tomorrow. For energy imports from Mexico and Canada, the tariff level has been set at 10%. Canada and Mexico have ordered retaliatory measures, while China said it would challenge tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take unspecified countermeasures. Trump, meanwhile, has said the European Union will be up next in his tariffs campaign. Trump also implied over the weekend that he will take more trade actions as soon as mid-month targeting computer chips, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminum, copper, oil and gas. The de minimis exemption, which permits imports under $800 without duties, is also being eliminated for all goods from Mexico and Canada, and potentially China too. According to analysis from Freightos, Mexico and Canada combined to supply nearly $900bn of US imports in 2023 and about 28% of total US imports through November for 2024. Container shipping is expected to be hit by a contraction in seaborne volumes as the tariffs take hold leading to higher prices and a decrease in demand. In the tanker markets, the effects are also potentially seismic. In 2024, analysis by broker Braemar shows Mexico exported around 500,000 barrels per day of crude and 100,000 barrels per day of fuel oil to the US, and imported around 320,000 barrels per day of gasoline and 160,000 barrels per day of diesel from the US – all by sea. By the end of 2024 Canada was exporting around 330,000 barrels per day of crude oil to the US via seaports in the east and west of the country. It exported another 3.5m barrels per day of crude overland to the US. It exported around 120,000 barrels per day of gasoline and 65,000 barrels per day of diesel to the US via seaports. Braemar suggests Canada will likely seek to divert its energy exports to China and Europe while US replacement for Canadian pipeline flows to the US Gulf would most likely come from the Middle East and South America, all positive from a tonne-mile perspective. In the first Trump trade war in the previous decade, the Chinese targeted US farmers and reduced imports of US grain. China is able to substitute this with more imports from Brazil, with minimal net tonne-mile impact. According to data from Clarksons Platou Securities, dry bulk, particularly grain and steel products, was the most impacted from the first Trump trade war with China, followed by LNG and LPG. Overall shipping tonne-mile growth fell 0.5% in 2018, then again by 0.5% in 2019, according to Clarksons data."

On August 29 2022, theOS35bulk carrier was departing the Bay of Gibraltar anchorage and collided with the LNG carrierAdam LNG. The impact caused a breach in holds two and three of theOS35, leading to the vessel’s controlled beaching to the east of Gibraltar, where it was subsequently dismantled with the ship becoming a feature of the tiny British territory’s coastline for many months. The investigation found that the master and bridge team of theOS35did not monitor the manoeuvre out of the Western Anchorage effectively and made an error in their understanding of the effects of the tidal flow and wind. The Gibraltar Port Authority (GPA) has been recommended to consider introducing compulsory pilotage for vessels departing from the Western Anchorage. Had a pilot been onboard the report suggests that the manoeuvre astern by theOS35would not have been their chosen option for the location and conditions that were found on the day. Had theOS35’sturn to port been initiated as the anchor was being lifted there was sufficient sea room to continue moving ahead and turn to port to depart the anchorage to the west. There was also suitable sea room to pass between the vessels ahead, which would have provided greater control of the vessel than by manoeuvring astern, where the manoeuvre is more difficult to control and monitor."

        "content": "Evidence of just how busy China has been pumping products to consumers ahead of Donald Trump’s tariffs comes from Shanghai, the world’s busiest container port, with news the financial metropolis handled more than 5m teu in January, a record amount that puts it on track for another landmark year. Putting the monthly record in perspective, Shanghai handled the same volume of boxes in the space of 31 days that Manila, the busiest container port in the Philippines, handled throughout 2024. Shanghai became the first port in the world to handle more than 50m teu last year, notching up a total of 51.51m teu. Port operator Shanghai International Port Group stated in a release: “Ports are the barometer of foreign trade. The performance of Shanghai Port in the first month of the new year reflects the active foreign trade and strong resilience of our country’s economy.” An update from China-based Gerudo Logistics yesterday noted a renewed surge in shipping demand post-Chinese New Year. “With factories ramping up production, there is a noticeable spike in export volumes, particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles, and automotive parts. This surge is leading to tight capacity, especially on popular trade lanes to Europe and North America,” Gerudo noted, going on to warn about congestion at major ports, including Shanghai, Ningbo, and Shenzhen, as backlogs from the holiday period are cleared. A tariff tit-for-tat has got underway between the world’s two largest economies with the US putting a blanket 10% levy on all Chinese imports this week, and Beijing responding, saying it will impose from next Monday a 15% tariff on LNG and coal imported from the US, as well as a 10% tariff on oil, agricultural machinery and large-displacement cars."

        "content": "The number of vessels hit by sanctions has surpassed 1,000 with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showing that more 800 of these ships do not have confirmed insurance. Moreover, the average age of sanctioned ships – 21 years – is some eight years older than the global average, adding to growing concern that the sprawling so-called shadow fleet could lead to multiple costly environmental catastrophes. Despite slowing, the grey fleet is still growing by around 10 tankers a month, according to brokers BRS. Nearly two in three vintage tankers carried Iranian, Venezuelan, or Russian cargoes last year, according to estimates from broker Gibson. Global insurer Allianz’s 2024 shipping report noted of the shadow fleet: “Despite efforts to crack down on these vessels, the number of tankers is actually increasing, and we have seen a number of groundings and collision incidents.” In recent weeks the UK has teamed up with a number of north European neighbours to challenge the insurance coverage of vessels heading from Russia through the Baltic and along the English Channel. The Danish government led discussions with neighbours for months last year looking at ways of barring some of Russia’s shadow fleet from transiting the Baltic Sea, something that gained added importance following a collision involving a laden Russian shadow tanker in March last year. Russia sends about a third of its seaborne oil exports through the Danish straits with around one in three of these ships having unknown insurance. Today, some 175 tankers laden with Russian oil transit the Baltic each month, according to Craig Kennedy who runs theNavigating Russiasubstack and proposed similar Baltic insurance checks in a paper for the Brookings Institution in May last year. If the insurance verification program is successful in the Baltic, Kennedy has suggested setting up a similar one in the Aegean. “Together with the Baltic, this would deny Russia the ability to load up to 80% of its oil exports on shadow tankers. Instead, Russia would be compelled to use mainstream tankers, thus increasing the exposure of export revenues to price cap constraints,” Kennedy wrote.

According to British maritime security consultants Ambrey, the tanker was boarded by 10 suspects armed with AK-47s. The suspects reportedly damaged communication equipment, took control of the bridge, and locked all crewmembers. A report from the International Chamber of Commerce stated the pirates ordered for the engines to be switched off and for the vessel to drift with the intention of stealing the cargo and bunkers. The crew’s arms and legs were tied. While waiting for the off-take vessel the pirates stole crew and ship properties. They then moved all the crew into the steering gear room and informed the crew that there were explosive devices fixed on all doors and the crew could only exit after two hours. According to Ambrey, the suspects looted the tanker’s cash and some assets before deboarding and departing. The crew were able to break free after two hours and repaired some of the equipment that was damaged. No explosives were found. No injuries were reported and the tanker continued on its journey."

The company said it had terminated the contract forEnergos Power, one of the two FSRUs currently operating at the Deutsche Ostsee terminal. The 2021-built 174,000 cu m vessel is owned by US-based LNG venture Energos Infrastructure for a long-term contract with the German government and subchartered to Deutsche Regas. Deutsche Regas said the move follows a “significant market distortion in Germany” caused by the state-owned Deutsche Energy Terminal (DET), which has been marketing its capacities for the regulated LNG terminals at prices significantly below the cost-covering fees since late last year. “DET’s ruinous pricing policy since December 2024 is one of several reasons for terminating the sub-charter contract. Deutsche ReGas regrets being forced to take this step,“ said Ingo Wagner, managing partner of Deutsche ReGas. Deutsche ReGas also operates the LNG terminal in Lubmin, where it is working to develop a hydrogen import terminal in partnership withHöegh Evi. Wagner added the company continues to consult with the German government regarding its latest move and that in the event of a supply shortage, “an immediate solution can be found at any time from ReGas’s perspective.” Energos Infrastructure acquired the FSRU from Greece’s Dynagas asTransgas Powerin 2024 together with Transgas Force, renamed Energos Force, for operations in the port of Stade under the direction of DET."

Around $900 will be financed using the company’s own funds, $500m using bilateral mortgage loans from two banks, $1.8bn will be financed via three leasing structures, and $1.1bn through a syndicated credit facility backed by the China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The 24 ships ordered last October for delivery between 2027 and 2029 will be built in China at Yangzijiang Shipbuilding and New Times Shipyard and equipped with the latest low-emission and fuel-efficient high-pressure LNG dual-fuel engines. The vessels can also be operated using biomethane and will be ammonia-ready. The financing will be carried out based on Hapag-Lloyd’s Green Financing Framework, which in turn complies with the standards of the Green Loan Principles of the Loan Market Association (LMA). The green financing covers around 80% of the investment volume, with maturities ranging between 10 and 18 years, the company said. Once delivered, the ships will add about 312,000 teu of new capacity to the world’s fifth-largest liner. “We are continuously modernising our fleet in order to deliver a high quality of service and to achieve our ambitious decarbonization goals,” said Mark Frese, chief of finance at Hapag-Lloyd., adding: “The successful conclusion of several attractive financial transactions confirms that green financing components are becoming increasingly important.”"

This would be unacceptable on land, and it is unacceptable at sea,” the letter to the UN boss warned, demanding the UN body create an enhanced coordinated military presence, missions and patrols in the region and that all efforts possible are brought to bear to release the many seafarers currently being held hostage in the Middle East."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Hapag-Lloyd and Louis Dreyfus Armateurs are among a host of shipping lines and organisations initiating a big pushback campaign today against the growing use of biofuels in shipping, warning that an area the size of Germany would need to be recultivated to meet potential projected growth of this alternative marine fuel. The eighteenth Intersessional Working Group on Greenhouse Gases (ISWG-GHG 18) starts its meeting at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) today, discussing regulatory measures to enable the shipping industry to become net zero by 2050. Determined to push back against the rise in biofuel use, many NGOs and shipping lines have come out in force today arguing that the majority of biofuels produced now from food crop-based feedstocks come with direct and indirect deforestation, and many other sustainability issues ranging from water scarcity to food security. Fuelling cargo ships with deforestation is a terrible idea “Unless legally-binding safeguards are introduced, there is a risk that a large amount of fossil fuels will be replaced with unsustainable biofuels,” signatories to one campaign that also include Hoegh Autoliners argue in an open letter sent to the IMO. Nearly a third of global shipping could run on biofuels in 2030, new analysis from NGO Transport & Environment (T&E) shows, up from less than 1% today. The study by Cerulogy on behalf of T&E shows that palm and soy oil would likely make up nearly two-thirds of the biodiesel used to power the shipping industry in 2030 as they represent the cheapest fuels to comply. This poses a serious climate problem, warns T&E, as palm and soy are responsible for two to three times more carbon emissions than even the dirtiest shipping fuels today, once deforestation and land clearance are taken into account. The fuel-intensive shipping industry would need vast amounts of farmland. 34m hectares in 2030 – the total area of Germany – will be needed to produce enough crops to meet the increased biofuels demand from the shipping industry. When the EU decided to encourage the use of biofuels in 2009, the consumption of palm oil-based biofuels doubled between 2010 and 2020, reaching close to a third of EU biofuels use. Scientific evidence later demonstrated that 45% of palm oil expansion happened at the expense of carbon rich ecosystems like forests or peatlands over that same period. Similar findings have been uncovered for other crop-based feedstock such as soy. Evidence on the negative impacts has prompted countries such as France, Norway, the Netherlands, and others to restrict or stop palm and soy-based biofuels in domestic use. Europe has also decided to exclude the use of feed- and food-based biofuels from its flagship shipping fuels regulation (FuelEU). Signatories have called on the IMO and member states to discourage the use of crop-based biofuels by ships and to consider the excluding crop-based biofuels from the eligibility list for compliance with existing and future MARPOL Annex VI regulations. Signatories argued that with biofuels, the industry risks deploying a cure worse than the disease to address shipping’s climate impact. Constance Dijkstra, shipping manager at T&E, said: “Fuelling cargo ships with deforestation is a terrible idea. Burning crops for fuel is bad for the planet and bad for global food security. The IMO should consider the climate impact of bad biofuels to avoid doing more harm than good.” A separate letter sent to the IMO today – led by Biofuelwatch and the Global Forest Coalition – has addressed similar concerns. In April the IMO will finalise new climate rules for shipping to try to phase out fossil fuels with a global fuel standard (GFS) likely to be implemented which could either speed up shipping’s transition to renewable energy, or see the industry become a large demand sector for biofuels. An influential proposal from Brazil risks replacing fossil fuels with biofuels, which raises serious concerns among conservation groups about the potential environmental and food security impacts of this plan. According to a recent submission to the IMO by T&E, biofuels could make up almost half (44%) of shipping’s energy demand by 2035, most of which will derive from food- and feed-based crops (soy and palm oil), unless the fuel standard is carefully designed to exclude these categories. Biofuelwatch mobilised a similar warning on aviation a few years ago. Now, sensing a new potential danger, the NGO is worried that shipping could make the same, or even bigger mistake. While many shipping companies have embraced recycled vegetable oil as an alternative fuel, campaigners have hit out at this too arguing that wastes and residues, including animal fats, are in limited supply and existing demand far exceeds their availability. Furthermore, many of those residues and wastes have high indirect greenhouse gas emissions, due to competition between biofuels and other uses. Analysis from T&E shows a 20,000 teu boxship travelling between China and Brazil would alone require the yearly waste oil from more than 2,000 McDonald’s restaurants, while to run it on animal fats would require over 1m pigs."

        "content": "There has been widespread international condemnation of a Russian missile strike on a Greek-operated bulk carrier off Romania this week, although security analysts are unsure whether this was a hit specifically aiming at a merchant ship or a misguided strike as part of a wider campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure in the region. Marking the first confirmed strike on a merchant ship in the Black Sea this year,the Saint Kitts and Nevis-flagged Aya was struck by a Russian-launched missile on Wednesday nightafter departing from the port of Chornomorsk, Ukraine with a cargo of grain bound for Egypt. The ship sustained damage to its port side, including a cargo hold and a crane. The vessel was built in 1997 and is operated by Piraeus-based VRS Maritime Services. Data from MarineTraffic shows the ship left from Chornomorsk port in Ukraine at 7:31 am local time on Wednesday and made an urgent diversion having crossed international waters. Having been hit in Romania’s exclusive economic zone by a Kh-22 cruise missile with a 1,000 kg warhead which was launched from a Russian Tupolev Tu-22M bomber, the ship veered starboard and made for Romania’s territorial waters with images released showing much of the ship’s deck badly mangled. The vessel is currently anchored off Constanta, Romania’s largest port. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the incident via social media yesterday. He said that a Russian missile hit “an ordinary civilian vessel” carrying wheat cargo bound for Egypt after the ship had left Ukrainian waters. Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said the strike was “a brazen attack on freedom of navigation and global food security” while the US ambassador to Ukraine “strongly condemned” the attack and said Russia was responsible. A United Nations spokesperson said the incident was a “stark reminder” of the threats still faced in the Black Sea by civilian vessels. Russia, for its part, has remain tight-lipped on the incident, thefirst confirmed attack on a merchant ship in the Black Sea since last November. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly requests the Russian Federation to stop any attack on commercial ships and to respect the freedom of navigation enjoyed by the states in the Black Sea,” Romania’s Foreign Ministry stated. According to the Romanian ministry, the ship was 55 km from Sfântu Gheorghe, a commune in Tulcea county in Romania’s exclusive economic zone when it came under attack. An exclusive economic zone is the maritime area adjacent to a nation’s territorial waters. Whether the ship was an intentional target remains unclear. Kristian Bischoff, a threat analyst at Risk Intelligence, pointed out, via a post on social media, that the Russians have recently stepped up targeting of infrastructure on Zmiinyi Island (also known as Snake Island,made famous in the early days of the war between Ukraine and Russia) and nearby offshore platforms. The Russian missiles used tend to lock on to radio signatures or radar, and if no major radar installations are in place on, for example, Zmiinyi Island, the missiles then lock onto the next major signature nearby, which could well be vessels passing by."

        "content": "To be a dry bulk analyst for most of the past three decades has in effect meant being a China watcher. Similarly, being a shipping reporter in the 2020s increasingly equates to being a very close follower of geopolitics. This year has been hugely turbulent for the world, and its trading routes, and yet shipping has managed to roll with the punches and profited as is often the case when a period of disruption ensues. The ClarkSea Index, a weighted barometer of all the shipping sectors managed by Clarksons Research, is ending the year on a comparative whimper at $22,509 a day, the lowest level for more than a year, though the average in 2024 so far is up 7% year-on-year and up 31% on the 10-year trend. The Red Sea shipping crisis, the Panama Canal drought, the war in Ukraine, and the rise of the so-called shadow fleet have been story arcs that have keptSplashreporters up late at night throughout the year while ensuring highly profitable returns for many shipping sectors. The world is breaking apart as today’s top superpowers vie for mastery in every continent. For shipping, the servants of global trade, as Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, what this means is simply cargoes will move in different ways but ultimately they will end up in the hands of the end consumer. However, this creates greater fragmentation for a world fleet that today is already struggling, having been built for a totally optimised trade. Fragmentation requires more ships to transport the same volume of cargo, and yet we are in a situation where the world’s top shipbuilders – arguably one of the real winners across shipping in 2024 – are increasingly full up through to 2028, and ships are having to be pressed into action for longer than before.

The flagship company of Jamnagar-based Shreeji Group, led by Ashokumar Haridas Lal and Jitendra Haridas Lal, is planning to use roughly $33.5m from the IPO proceeds to buy secondhand supramax bulk carriers and some $2.2m for repaying debt. Shreeji operates along India’s west coast with services spanning major ports and internationally in locations such as Puttalam Port in Sri Lanka. As of last September, the company counts a fleet of more than 75 vessels consisting of barges, mini bulk carriers, tugs, and floating cranes, implying that the new vessel additions would mark its entry into the supramax trades. Shreeji said it has identified the 2009-built 58,743 dwtKapta Mathiosfrom Mykonos Shipping and the 2012-built 55,700 dwtGlovis Mermaid(pictured) from Unity Maritime as the main candidates for the fleet expansion.

The disagreement between the two companies started in April this year when Dolphin Drilling terminated a contract for theBlackford Dolphinrig with the Nigerian company over missed payments. The Nigerian company took the Norwegian firm to court in an attempt to force Dolphin Drilling to complete the work under the terminated deal. Then, Technova Africa got involved and obtained an ex parte order of arrest against the rig which was lifted in mid-June. In July, the Norwegian rig owner submitted a bank guarantee of $20m which enabled the firm to remove the 1974-built rig from Nigerian waters. In October, the rig arrived in Indian waters and it finally started its $154m long-term drilling contract with Oil India in November. Initially, the work was supposed to start as early as the second quarter of 2024 but the court case delayed the start of operations. Dolphin Drilling said in a statement that the case against the Nigerian oil firm had a ‘positive outcome’ and that it received the final award from the court. The court also awarded certain subsidiary entities of the company sums of approximately $100m which the offshore driller will attempt to collect immediately."

        "content": "Denmark has taken its next step in cracking down on Russian-linked shadow tankers passing through its waters The Danish Maritime Authority will carry out port state controls on tankers it deems high risk who anchor off Skagen in the far north of the country, a popular anchorage. Ships found with safety defects or not having the right papers or insurance risk being detained. Denmark has been leading littoral states around the Baltic in discussing ways to clamp down on ageing tankers carrying Russian oil, following a number of accidents and the severing of cables in the region. Russia sends about a third of its seaborne oil exports through the Danish straits with around one in three of these ships having unknown insurance. Today, some 175 tankers laden with Russian oil transit the Baltic each month, according to Craig Kennedy who runs theNavigating Russiasubstack. The number of vessels hit by sanctions surpassed 1,000 late last year with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showing that more 800 of these ships do not have confirmed insurance. Moreover, the average age of sanctioned ships – 21 years – is some eight years older than the global average, adding to growing concern that the sprawling so-called shadow fleet could lead to multiple costly environmental catastrophes. Last September, Danish authorities banned 27 Russian-linked ships from calling at local ports or anchorages. In December, Denmark was among nine European nations around the Baltic and the North Sea to start demanding insurance details from Russian-linked ships passing through their waters Seabed gas pipelines, power cables and fiber optic cables have all been attacked – likely by merchant ships dragging their anchors – in recent months across the Baltic, forcing NATO to establish Baltic Sentry, a naval protection operation. Baltic Sentry, in which Denmark is involved, involves a range of assets, including frigates, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and drones. Last month, the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) activated an advanced UK-led reaction system to track potential threats to undersea infrastructure and monitor the Russian shadow fleet. The JEF is a UK-led Northern European multinational military partnership. The naval operation named Nordic Warden harnesses AI to assess data from a range of sources, including the Automatic Identification System (AIS) ships use to broadcast their position, to calculate the risk posed by each vessel entering areas of interest. Specific vessels identified as being part of Russia’s shadow fleet have been registered into the system so they can be closely monitored when approaching key areas of interest. If a potential risk is assessed, the system will monitor the suspicious vessel in real time and immediately send out a warning, which will be shared with JEF participant nations as well as NATO allies including Denmark. 22 areas of interest – including parts of the English Channel, North Sea, Kattegat, and Baltic Sea, are currently being monitored from the JEF’s operational headquarters in the UK, where personnel from all 10 JEF nations work side by side. A joint statement from the heads of state or government of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden last month noted: “Russia’s use of the so-called shadow fleet poses a particular threat to the maritime and environmental security in the Baltic Sea region and globally. This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.” In related news, London-listed tech firm Windward launched today its Critical Maritime Infrastructure Protection solution, a first-of-its-kind AI-powered solution designed to protect the world’s essential maritime infrastructure including cables, pipelines, and rigs against growing threats. “The economic and geopolitical implications of undersea infrastructure sabotage are staggering,” said Ami Daniel, CEO of Windward. “Beyond the immediate disruptions, national stability and financial implications for businesses relying on cables for connectivity and operational continuity are immense. While recent incidents remain under investigation, the growing risks—whether accidental or intentional—underscore the urgent need for advanced monitoring. With our Critical Maritime Infrastructure Protection solution, we aim to defend all stakeholders from this new kind of warfare.”"

        "content": "The relationship between shipowners and technology providers must be fixed to save shipping’s decarbonisation ambitions, writes Benny Hilström, vice president of business development at WinGD. Shipowners and operators need technology providers that keep their promises in order to avoid frustration, disruption and delay. That applies in day-to-day operations and is even more critical when promises are made around new technologies that require significant investments. As someone who has worked on both sides of the technology provider/shipowner relationship, I see worrying signs that this essential trust is being eroded – and putting commercial and environmental sustainability at risk. Our industry needs to move forward with bold decisions and commitments to our decarbonisation ambitions, but this can only happen from a foundation of trust. As a shipowner, you spend up-front based on assurances of future performance. So when technology underperforms, is unreliable, or fails to meet initial claims, trust erodes. The problem is compounded when suppliers shift blame, revise earlier performance guarantees or deliver slow, costly resolutions. This undermines confidence not just in the technology but in the providers themselves. This erosion of trust becomes even more significant when it comes to decarbonisation investments. With soaring stakes and mounting carbon costs, shipowners are hesitant to commit, often due to overpromised claims or technologies abandoned when challenges arise. This cycle of disappointment only slows decision-making, making it harder to take the bold steps needed. No doubt, supplying innovative technologies is tough. Suppliers invest upfront in the solutions they think customers will need only to find the wind has changed – this fuel is out of fashion, that regulation throws a curveball, someone else has gotten there first. The pressure to go to market first and to sell in volume is enormous to recoup research and development spending, including all those dead ends. The trust of customers cannot be sacrificed to market pressures. Unlike consumer goods, maritime technology failures come with significant long-term costs. For the supplier, this means taking responsibility, delivering fast and cost-effective solutions, and fostering genuine collaboration. Meaningful partnership, mutual transparency and aligned interests are the key to a supplier-customer relationship in shipping. Those ideas are often touted but seldom deployed. Across my experience spanning both ship technology and shipowning, the partnerships maintained on this basis have been successful. Having the owner fully engaged from the very start – whether you are designing a new engine or trialling a new service concept – happens to be the best way to deliver a solution the shipowner needs in a way the technology company can manage. The technical challenges facing shipping are extreme as we grapple with climate ambitions, the optimisation potential of digitalisation and a trade outlook that is increasingly volatile. Even the biggest companies – including the ones I have worked for – cannot do it alone. Trusted partnerships are the only solution both to those challenges and to more successful day-to-day ship operations. By prioritising trust and accountability, the industry can overcome technical challenges, optimise operations and realise its decarbonisation ambitions. Without it, the path to a sustainable maritime future remains in jeopardy."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Following exhaustive research showing how jobs onboard are still too 24/7, the United Nations’ International Labour Organization (ILO) will look to tighten up the language surrounding work/rest regulations at sea at a Special Tripartite Committee of the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), scheduled to be held in Geneva in April. The ILO’s focus on work/rest hours follows on from a 64-page report from another UN institution, the World Maritime University, which carried out a survey in 2022, receiving more than 9,000 responses from seafarers around the world. The survey found that seafarers report, on average, working for 11.5 hours, resting for 10.8 hours, and sleeping for 7.0 hours daily. Notably, 28.1% of seafarers acknowledge resting less than 10 hours, thus violating rest hours standards. Seafarers report working on average 74.9 hours per week, significantly higher than the global 43 hours per week identified by the ILO’s 2018 general survey. Other key takeaways from the survey include the statistic that 78.3% of respondents report not having one full day off during their entire contract period, contradicting the intention of the MLC. 88.3% of seafarers admit to exceeding work/rest hours limits at least once a month. Alarmingly, 16.5% exceed the limits more than ten times a month. Only 31.6% of seafarers admit to never adjusting their work/rest records. High compliance rates reported by port state control masked seafarers’ reported non-compliance, creating what the authors of the WMU report have described as a “false narrative at policy levels”. The root causes lie in the regulatory framework that is very loose, allowing flag states to compete on granting manning certificates with low numbers and expecting shipowners and shipmanagers to self-regulate. One idea under discussion is for each vessel to be given a protected website, run by the flag state, where each seafarer is allowed to log in under guaranteed secrecy terms. Moreover, for all the industry discussion about automation and autonomy leading to lower meaning requirements at sea, 87.6% of respondents to the WMU survey said there is an imbalance between work demand and crewing levels. International Maritime Organization rules including the MLC and the Seafarers’ Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping Code (STCW) detail the amount of hours crew should be working with multiple accident reports over the years citing fatigue as a cause for many casualties. Under the MLC, hours of work are stated as either maximum hours of work, or minimum hours of rest. The maximum hours of work must not exceed 14 hours in any 24-hour period, and 72 hours in any seven-day period. The minimum hours of rest must not be less than 10 hours in any 24-hour period, and 77 hours in any seven-day period. Reconciling wellness with excessive demands appears implausible, suggested Steven Jones, the founder of the Seafarers Happiness Index, in a recent article forSplash. “Crews face overwhelming demands while grappling with chronic underreporting of work hours, and the threat of punishment for infractions,” Jones argued, adding: “Seafarers face a difficult choice: being honest about over work can lead to punishment, while dishonesty may allow them to escape consequences. This creates a troubling lack of incentive for proper, effective, open, and transparent recording of work hours.” Other topics up for debate at April’s MLC summit in Geneva surround violence and harassment, repatriation, and shore leave."

This agreement follows LS Cable & System’s recent MoU with Norwegian energy giant Equinor for cooperation on the 750 MW Firefly floating offshore wind project in South Korea. South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy has included floating offshore wind power for the first time in its 2024 fixed-price contract competitive bidding for wind and solar power facilities. The Firefly project was selected and LS Cable & System’s partnership with Equinor will give it an early market advantage. The company was also responsible for developing the first Korean dynamic cables designed to operate stably in harsh offshore environments. Through the new agreement, the two Korean companies will work with Balmoral Comtec to establish an operational system for floating offshore wind cables. Furthermore, LS Marine Solution will enhance installation efficiency and ensure stable maintenance. “Although floating offshore wind currently accounts for only about 1% of the market, it is expected to grow rapidly,” an LS C&S official stated. The Firefly project, otherwise known as Bandibuli, is a 750MW floating offshore wind farm which will be utilising Siemens Gamesa’s 15MW large-scale wind turbines.

        "content": "Conservation and environmentalist groups have sued US president Donald Trump and his administration over his order to roll back the ban on future oil and gas leasing. The court battle against Trump is a two-parter. Several organisations are collectively challenging the order by the US president to revoke Biden’s withdrawal of certain areas of the ocean from future oil and gas leasing. Another set of groups is requesting the court to reinstate a federal court ruling that invalidated an attempt by the first Trump administration to undo offshore protections put in place by former president Barack Obama. In January, the Biden administration permanentlyprotectedthe entire eastern U.S. Atlantic coast, from Canada to the southern tip of Florida, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, Federal waters off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, and an area in the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska. This equates to more than 2.5m sq km of federal waters which is an area equal to around a quarter of the total land mass of the United States. Earlier in his administration, Biden also protected part of the Beaufort Sea and reinstated protections in the Chukchi Sea as well as canyon areas in the north and mid-Atlantic that Trump attempted to undo in his first administration. Last week, Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing theNational Energy Dominance Councilfocused on boosting the country’s production and export of fossil fuels. At the time, Trump revealed that Burgum was directed to undo Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order rescinding 68 executive orders and 11 presidential memoranda from the Biden administration, including those protecting ocean areas. Now, environmentalist groups – Northern Alaska Environmental Center, Alaska Wilderness League, Oceana, Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, Healthy Gulf, Center for Biological Diversity, Turtle Island Restoration Network, Natural Resource Defence Council, and Greenpeace – accuse the president of exceeding his constitutional and statutory authority by issuing a sweeping executive order revoking the protections. Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, enacted in 1953, the president has the authority to limit leasing activity. The groups argue that there is no provision in the act to allow a president to undo such withdrawals. In 2017, an Alaska federal court shut down Trump’s attempt to revoke Barack Obama’s protections. US District Judge Sharon Gleason ruled that presidents have the power to remove certain lands from development but don’t have the power to revoke the removals of their predecessors, putting a stop to Trump’s plans. The same groups that won that case filed a new motion asking Judge Gleason to reinstate her judgment against Trump, essentially blocking his attempt to reopen the protected waters to offshore drilling. The judgement was considered moot after Biden took office and rescinded the contested executive order. Just like in 2017, the League of Conservation Voters, Defenders of Wildlife, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Center for Biological Diversity, Northern Alaska Environmental Center, Greenpeace and Alaska Wilderness League claim Trump’s executive order upended the core reasoning behind the court’s dismissal. Currently, an executive order could be revoked only by an act of Congress which is one of the main reasons why the groups believe that Trump is overstepping his authority. The Trump administration currently faces more than 70 lawsuits challenging the crackdown on illegal immigration and end birthright citizenship, rollback of legal protections for transgender people, and dramatically shrinking the federal government."

Alphaliner reports that Evergreen is in the market for a new series of eleven 24,000 teu megamax vessels. Analysts at Alphaliner are also reporting CMA CGM is close to tying up a contract with CSSC Group in China for another series of twelve 18,000 teu ships just a few days after placing firm orders for 12 compact 18,000 teu containerships with South Korea’s HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI). Splashreported yesterday Hapag-Lloyd has returned to South Korea for six 16,800 teu vessels at Hanwha Ocean. “Many projects remain under discussions in both South Korea and China and we expect to report the finalization of several projects in the coming weeks,” stated the latest container report from MB Shipbroking, adding: “With fairly limited demand for new tanker, gas and bulk carrier orders, a number of shipyards remain heavily focused on container newbuilding projects. As a result, we have seen a stabilization of pricing and with the slightly lower interest rates a softening of payment terms.” At the end of 2024, the containership orderbook was 8.3m teu, a new record compared with the previous high of 7.8m teu in early 2023, according to analysis carried by BIMCO in early January. In the opening six weeks of 2025, this record orderbook has continued to grow, and with confirmation of all the above orders the global orderbook will have surpassed 9m teu for the first time. The extant fleet today stands at 31.7m teu. June last year saw the extant global liner vessel fleet reach 30m teu for the first time. The pace of growth of the global container fleet has been remarkable. It took the industry around 50 years to reach the 5m teu mark in 2001. By contrast, the leap from 20m teu to 30m teu was achieved in just seven years."

        "content": "Ina Reksten, who runs Norwegian vessel optimisation specialist Manta Marine Technologies, acknowledges many of her clients are struggling to meaningfully translate all the data heading their way. “It sounds straight forward, but a good outcome requires not only strong programming skills and setting data parameters, but also understanding of how a vessel operates, knowledge on how charter contracts are structured and close collaboration with the customer,” she says. Reksten’s recommended approach is to first establish a routine for using her systems for operational efficiency. Once there is sufficient data collected, then Manta can move into more sophisticated analyses to allow customers to use the data for strategic decision making and tailor-made reporting. “There are a lot of different solutions out there and an enormous amount of data available,” Reksten concedes. Based on discussions with her customers, Reksten advises owners to understand and be able to measure and report that any new technology delivers as intended, and not just in monetary terms, but also in terms of reducing emissions. “One of the difficulties we see with any new technology is the methods of performance validation towards the customer,” Reksten says, useful advice, and something that will, no doubt, be shared on April 29 when the Norwegian moderates Geneva Dry’s Digital Efficiency Drivers At Sea session, a power hour looking at how digitalisation can enhance dry bulk shipping operations to the benefit of both shipowners and charterers. This quick-fire session aims to eliminate some of the myths surrounding digital miracles at sea, while highlighting projects that are making a genuine impact and providing advice for potential customers in terms of selecting tech partners. Geneva Dry brings together all elements of the commodities shipping sector to host the ultimate dry bulk shipping event. Split into sectors, panels will bring together analysts, financiers, miners, traders and shipowners to discuss where the markets are headed.

        "content": "Energy supermajor BP has formally withdrawn its application for the 320-kilometre-long cable and interconnection plan for its Beacon Wind project located in US federal waters between Cape Cod and Long Island. This follows Beacon Wind’s decision in January 2024 to terminate a previously awarded state contract for energy from the array. The cancellation of the deal came after partners Equinor and BP split up and divided their offshore assets. BP retained control of Beacon 1 and Beacon 2 lease areas while Equinor gained control of the Empire Wind offshore wind projects off Long Island. The company said in a statement that the decision was made to allow for more time in the evaluation of the project’s design and configuration. “Since the project submitted its application and queue position, New York’s approach to offshore wind project interconnection has evolved in the direction of coordinated offshore transmission,” BP said. Beacon 1 was initially supposed to deliver its 1,230MW of power to the New York City grid via a newly planned energy centre in Astoria. The project was later revised and the transmission cable got to its 320 km length. BP has previously requested a year-long delay in the application process from the New York Public Service Commission which would allow it to reassess its point of interconnection in the city. This is another hit for the US offshore wind industry which is reeling from president Donald Trump’sbanon new offshore wind leases on the country’s outer continental shelf."

        "content": "Similar to 15 years ago during the last Somalia piracy cycle, new maritime security companies are emerging. A total of 33 incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships were recorded around the world in the first three months of 2024, an increase from 27 incidents for the same period in 2023, according to the International Maritime Bureau, part of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), including two hijackings by Somali pirates. ICC secretary-general John Denton commented: “The resurgence of Somali pirate activity is worrying, and now more than ever it is crucial to protect trade, safeguard routes, and the safety of seafarers who keep commerce moving. All measures to ensure the uninterrupted free flow of goods throughout international supply chains must be taken.” The return of Somali pirates comes at a time when the Houthis from Yemen are also firing on merchant ships passing by their shores, with around 80 vessels targeted over the past six months. As a result of the heightened security concerns for merchant shipping, prices for private maritime security guards onboard have shot up this year, according torecent analysis from sister titleSplash Extrawith many ex-soldiers looking to get in on the action. London-based security specialists Subrosa Group yesterday launched a brand new maritime security division. The group’s CEO, Niall Burns, commented: “The establishment of our maritime security division is a direct response to the critical need for elite armed protection for large vessels navigating increasingly perilous waters worldwide. Incidents of maritime attacks are alarmingly on the rise, endangering the security, safety, and welfare of mariners on a daily basis as they traverse the oceans.” The rise in demand for private maritime security companies (PMSCs) has once again brought calls for this industry to face greater regulation. The number of PMSCs peaked in 2011, during the previous Somali piracy cycle, when 11 new PMSCs were applying every month for membership to the Security Association of the Maritime Industry, a body that disbanded in 2016."

        "content": "Today marks the end of the Joe Biden administration in the US, one of the most profitable four-year periods for shipping. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the shipping industry has many questions about what the future of global trade holds, some of which could be answered swiftly with the incoming American president vowing to sign many executive orders immediately after being sworn in. The offshore wind sector is expected to be one of the big losers during Trump’s second tenure, while many are watching to see how the 47th president delivers on campaign promises for tariffs, a more tough line with Iran, as well as claims the war in Ukraine can be brought to a quick end. In the first Trump trade war, the Chinese targeted US farmers and reduced imports of US grain. China is able to substitute this with more imports from Brazil, with minimal net tonne-mile impact. According to data from Clarksons Platou Securities, dry bulk, particularly grain and steel products, was the most impacted from the first Trump trade war with China, followed by LNG and LPG. Overall shipping tonne-mile growth fell 0.5% in 2018, then again by 0.5% in 2019, according to Clarksons data “Trump’s tariff wall might be a stage in that, but like walls to keep out migrants, it is difficult to achieve much in four years,” Martin Stopford, the world’s most famous maritime economist, toldSplashin the wake of Trump’s election win last November. Burak Akdemir, managing director of London-headquartered dry bulk owner Range Shipping, toldSplashlast week: “A peacemaker Trump in a second term could lead to a recalibration of US-China relations, which would significantly impact global trade. If tensions ease, it might restore confidence and boost trade volumes, potentially benefiting dry bulk trade flows tied to Chinese imports of iron ore, coal, and grain.” Conversely, though, Akdemir warned if protectionist policies or geopolitical uncertainties persist, trade disruptions could restrain growth, shifting flows to other emerging markets. “The dry bulk sector’s response will hinge on the balance between cooperation and competition under Trump 2.0,” Akdemir said. In conversation withSplashearlier, Khalid Hashim, managing director of Thailand’s largest dry bulk owner, Precious Shipping, said he was sanguine about Trump and tariffs. “Trade flows under Trump 1.0 and Biden’s continuation and increasing Trump’s 1.0 into Biden 1.0, have increased, not decreased, trade flows into the US,” Hashim said. “If the past is any predictor of trade flows, then as we have seen all such disruptions tend to have an immediate, but extremely short-term impact, before leading to increased tonne-mile and increased trade.” One area that could face headwinds from Trump’s second term is in shipping’s decarbonisation path. “The work currently ongoing at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to get new regulations and set targets globally might hit a dead end,” warned analysts from Sea-Intelligence in a recent report. “This, in turn, would accelerate a trend, where regulation regarding decarbonisation of shipping, would have to be made locally, and not globally.” Summing up the prospects for shipping with Trump back in the Oval Office, analysts at broker Hartland Shipping wrote recently: “The most confident conclusion we can make is that the volatility and uncertainty in today’s shipping markets is only going to increase under Trump 2.0.”"

        "content": "Norwegian OSV owner and operator Havila Shipping is disputing allegations of default that have been made by three different banks. As part of Havila’s restructuring deal, three banks and bondholders had planned to have their debt settled by the end of 2024. Alongside this, these banks decided to extend the agreement for another year related to two vessels in operation and four sold vessels. Within the framework of the restructuring, a cash settlement of NOK499.6m was refinanced through a bond issue. Furthermore, a non-interest-bearing debt of NOK 522.3m was converted into shares. The three banks, which extended the restructuring agreement last year, are financing the PSV vessel Havila Foresight and the subsea vessel Havila Harmony. Total interest-bearing debt related to these vessels amounts to NOK151.5m and non-interest-bearing debt related to these and four sold vessels amounts to NOK 616.3m. According to the restructuring agreement, the two vessels will service this debt through 2025, and the remaining interest-bearing debt will be refinanced and settled in cash at the end of 2025, and the remaining non-interest-bearing debt will be converted into shares. However, the Fosnavåg-based firm said in a filing that it had received a letter on behalf of the three banks that extended the restructuring agreement alleging that the refinancing by taking out bond loans, which were used to redeem the debt of lenders who, according to the agreement, chose settlement at the end of 2024, violates the restructuring agreement. The remaining lenders claimed that they would be entitled to declare default on the outstanding debt, both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing, as well as to claim default interest and enforce security. Havila said it believes there is no default and fully disputed the remaining lenders’ understanding of the restructuring agreement, adding that it would seek legal clarification of the matter if necessary."

The Houthis in Yemen have continued to attack, despite repeated strikes from US and UK forces against them, while Iranian special forces have completed their latest hijacking, and elsewhere more dhows have been abducted by reemerging pirates in Somalia. US fighter aircraft shot down an anti-ship cruise missile the Houthis fired toward the American destroyer USS Laboon yesterday while on Friday the Houthis mistakenly targeted a Russian ‘dark’ tanker, believing it had links to the UK. Other suspicious approaches were reported over the weekend too with the Houthis promising retaliation for recent strikes by US and UK forces. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam took to social media site X to call the strikes a “blatant violation of national sovereignty” while on Friday Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, argued: “One would have hoped that saving Palestinian children’s lives would be met with the same urgency to act and to provide protection granted to shipping lanes.” More and more ships are shunning the Suez Canal, something most acutely felt in the container sector, but also spreading to other segments. Qatar, for instance, has now halted sending gas shipments via the Suez, since the US and UK attacks on Friday. More naval assets are heading to the volatile region with Germany the latest nation to join the trade protection initiative. Berlin has announced it is sending the Hessen frigate to the Red Sea, joining a host of other nations. Meanwhile, Empire Navigation’s suezmax tanker, St Nikolas, seized by Iran in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday, was located over the weekend byTankerTrackers.comeast of Iran’s Qeshm Island. Empire Navigation has received confirmation that all crewmembers aboard the St Nikolas are safe and in good health. In April last year, Washington seized the tanker after it was caught transferring Iranian oil off Singapore. Finally, in today’s roundup of the security situation in the region, the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) has warned that two Yemeni fishing vessels were hijacked on Friday night near Mareeyo in Somalia. The IMB has warned all vessels to keep well clear of the area. Piracy was rampant off Somalia for four years from 2008 but then it went dormant for about five years. Recently, Somali pirates have been hijacking several vessels such as dhows and then targeting merchant ships passing by with a view to then demanding ransoms for kidnapped crews."

        "content": "Mads Frank Markussen, head of freight research and FFA at CM Navigator, part of Copenhagen Merchants, returns to the increasingly discussed issue of artificial intelligence and the future of chartering. Consolidation and financialization are reshaping global markets, particularly in the freight and commodity sectors. As a handful of larger players gain disproportionate control over freight capacity and capital, smaller firms must turn to data-driven tools in order to stay competitive. This dynamic has accelerated the digitalisation of freight, prompting significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Recent AI advancements in other sectors, especially in language models both in the US and China, mean that now agents can “reason” through complex tasks. Even though we are not seeing any AI fixing, we have automated most of the calculations of freight rates and are now doing more than 500,000 freight rate calculations every day. In many ways, consolidation in the shipping industry has accelerated the need for AI-driven solutions. A small number of shipowners and operators control much of the global tonnage, creating an imbalance in market knowledge, reach and negotiating power. Meanwhile, financialization, most evident in the rising trading volumes and algorithmic price-setting in the FFA markets, has made physical freight pricing more volatile. As hedge funds inject speculative capital into the market, short-term rate movements no longer purely reflect physical supply and demand. In this environment, automated tools become indispensable, providing real-time price assessments grounded in both physical transactions and forward curves. We may only be 12 months away from large-scale AI freight agents These shifts are not only changing how freight is priced but also how commodity traders perceive risk. Historically, freight was seen as a service cost, secondary to the core commodity trade. Now, with derivatives allowing participants to hedge or speculate, freight itself functions more like a standalone asset class. This evolution creates pressure for faster, more accurate calculations. And that is precisely where AI agents, technologies capable of autonomous decision-making, show extraordinary promise in many fields. The freight sector is rapidly emerging as a prime testing ground for AI agents. While simple chatbots have existed for years, the newest generation of language models has demonstrated reasoning abilities: they can break down complex tasks, consider multiple steps, and arrive at more accurate conclusions. This capability, exemplified by systems like ChatGPT’s advanced chain-of-thought reasoning, means that AI agents can autonomously do a wide number of tasks. In the future, they will do more. Given the sophistication of these reasoning engines and the fact that digitalisation has already streamlined data collection, I believe we may only be 12 months away from large-scale AI freight agents. Currently, we have automated most calculations for things such as major grain tradeflows, drastically reducing labour-intensive processes and creating time for what matters: talking to customers. Instead of multiple teams poring over spreadsheets and shipping indices, one AI platform could perform thousands of simulations in minutes, instantly updating rates as political, economic, or logistical variables change. As consolidation drives up competitive pressure and financialization demands more complex hedging strategies, digitalisation continues to pave the way for data-centric solutions. This confluence of market forces has sparked an unprecedented wave of investment in AI for freight. The age of autonomous AI freight agents that can calculate an unlimited amount of options day and night SHINC (Sundays and Holidays Included) is here. For an industry long reliant on manual processes and opaque pricing, AI brings speed and efficiency, and a more level playing field in markets dominated by large global players. Now everyone can become global in seconds. The race is on, and within a year, these AI agents could well become the norm rather than the exception in global freight trading.

The company has agreed to offload the 2005-built 12,984 dwtClyde Fisherfor an undisclosed sum. The oldest and the largest vessel in FSL’s fleet is estimated by VesselsValue at about $8.3m. The 20-year-old unit built at Samho Tongyoung in South Korea came off charter with James Fisher earlier this year. In December, FSL disposed of its oldest tanker at the time, theCumbrian Fisher, built in 2004, for a net cash consideration of about $6.6m, and a profit of $2.3m. The trust will, following the sale, have six tankers of different sizes built between 2006 and 2008, all fixed on bareboat deals to James Fisher Everard, part of the James Fisher Group."

        "content": "Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer has become the latest backer of UK-based green fueltech specialist SulNOx. Ofer-controlled Singapore-based owner Eastern Pacific Shipping (EPS) has signed up to use SulNOx fuel conditioner onboard at least 30 of its vessels for a minimum of 18 months, while his EPS Ventures will take up to 8.5% stake in the London-listed company. The stake in SulNOx could be further increased by 3.3%, linked to successful introductions by EPS to shipping customers. The deal follows an extensive eight-month evaluation of SulNOxEco conditioner on EPS-managed containerships, tankers, bulkers and gas carriers, which demonstrated fuel savings of up to 5% with heavy sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) and also B30 biofuel. “This partnership with SulNOx is a significant step towards achieving EPS’s long-term sustainability objectives. By enhancing our operational efficiency and reinforcing our commitment to meeting global environmental standards, this collaboration further solidifies our position as a proactive leader in sustainable shipping practices,” said Cyril Ducau, CEO of EPS. SulNOx’s market cap has risen to £117m ($142m) in recent monthsbacked by a number of shipping-related investorssuch as Constantine Logothetis, Norway’s Nistad, McQilling of the United States, and Greenbull, co-founded by former Vitol senior executive Nick Mahoney. The company’s organic fuel additive has made significant progress in numerous heavy industries under pressure to cut emissions and meet regulatory targets, including shipping, with early users such as Teekay, Spring Marine and Marfin. Commenting on the latest deal with EPS, Radu Florescu, chairman of SulNOx, added: “Signing the marquee shipping name of EPS after an extensive evaluation period proves the effectiveness of SulNOx products beyond doubt at a time when the industry is crying out for solutions to reduce fuel consumption and associated emissions against a backdrop of increasing regulation. With this partnership, not only have we secured substantial, committed revenues, but there is also significant additional potential revenue from EPS’ introductions to some of the world’s largest fleets.”"

        "publication_date": "2025-01-28T21:08:26+00:00",
        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "You can take your pick of a wide variety of opinions about what Trump 2.0 will do to the global oil markets, but it’s a safe bet that nearly all those opinions amount to one effect: disruption. The US president has already dropped a heavy hint to Saudi Arabia to produce more crude oil to cut prices. Trump knows this will pressurise Russia, which relies on hydrocarbon earnings to fund its invasion of Ukraine. In his first term, Trump’s first foreign visit was to Riyadh and he sees the House of Saud as a key partner. Maybe he hopes the US will supplant Russia in the OPEC+ global oil cartel. That would fit his America First view of foreign policy and support his campaign promise to not only “drill baby drill” but to export more US energy. More US exports probably means more long-haul crude oil trade in the long-term. In the here and now, the first few weeks of 2025 ushered firmer VLCC activity. It looks like about 900 laden voyages will begin this month compared to 780 in December. Maybe charterers were booking cargoes before the Lunar New Year holiday interrupts. So far this month, average VLCC earnings as reported by the Baltic Exchange are up 44%, reading $36,265 on January 26 compared to $25,220 on December 24, the last reporting day of 2024. On West Africa to China voyages, rates rose 30% to $35,639. On Middle East to Singapore voyages, rates rose 40% to $31,611. On US to China voyages, VLCC day rates rose 66% in a month to $44,003 on January 26 but they had peaked earlier in the month at $55,519 on January 17. That equals just over $10m in gross hire for the maximum 35 day voyage. Assume opex of $10,000 a day, or a total of $350,000 for the voyage and a tidy operating profit will ensure a happy Lunar New Year for the small number of lucky owners who had ships in the right place at the right time. Suezmax earnings were no less exciting in January. Daily TCEs on the West Africa to UK/Continent suezmax voyage began the year at $22,400 per day, peaked at $32,492 on January 17, then declined to $27,479 on January 24. On the Middle East to Med voyage, rates began the year at a firm $37,566 and rose to a peak of $48,133 on January 20 before subsiding to $43,679 on the 24th. On the new Guyana to ARA voyage, rates started 2025 at $23,410 per day, topping $28,000 a day mid-month before returning to $23,575 on January 24. The Baltic Exchange aframax A6 average began the year at $29,272 and struggled all month, sitting at $24,133 by January 24. It was not all red ink: on Kuwait to Singapore voyages, daily TCEs added 10%, rising to $31,709. However, rates were off 7% on Southeast Asia to east coast Australia voyages at $21,517 per day on January 24. The real damage was done in the Atlantic and North Sea. US Gulf-ARA voyage rates fell 39% to $22,291. North Sea to Germany rates slumped 53% to $21,277 while North Sea to UK rates fared less badly, down 4% to $27,677. The German economy is clearly in a difficult place. The US cavalry is not coming to the rescue either – it is mounting up for a charge on Greenland. The big aframax story however is the new US sanctions which are already causing Indian and Chinese buyers to switch from Russian suppliers as they try to toe the line. The benefit may not accrue to ‘clean skin’ aframax owners; if buyers switch from Russian to Atlantic basin suppliers, cargoes may arrive on larger ships. Around two thirds of Russia’s 2024 crude oil exports went on aframaxes (about 1,600 voyages) compared to only one third of US exports which were more evenly split between VLCCs, suezmaxes and aframaxes / LR2s (around 500 each). Around 1,400 VLCCs loaded Saudi crude last year, over 80% of the seaborne total with only small numbers of suezmax and aframax cargoes making up the balance. Maybe 2025 will be not only the year of the snake but the year of the VLCC. The global oil products markets are adjusting to the advent of the massive 650,000 barrels per day Dangote refinery in Nigeria. Already, product tanker arrivals at Nigeria are down, from 90 in January 2023 to 42 in the first three weeks of 2024, with the monthly total likely to be around 50 to 55 ships. The Atlantic product tanker markets have been more than usually volatile in January – Dangote may be implicated. So far, daily TCEs on ARA-WAF voyages are holding up. For panamaxes, the rate was $20,068 on January 1 and $20,803 on January 24, having dipped below $17,000 on January 16. For MRs, the rate was actually up 30% from $14,827 on December 24, the last reporting day of last year, to $23,566 on January 24, via a low of $12,869 on January 8 and a high of $26,573 on January 20. Such volatility perhaps reflects changing market conditions in West Africa. In other Atlantic basin markets, the benchmark MR voyage from the USG to ARA lost 47% over the month from December 24 to January 24, falling from $21,082 to $11,093, but was as low as $6,510 on January 7. On the reverse, gasoline-laden voyage, rates zoomed upward 76% over the month to January 24, from $10,134 to $17,803, via a low of $6,418 on January 7 and a high of $21,520 on January 21. MR tanker sized exports from the USG to the east coast of South America were attracting $31,879 per day just before Christmas but only $18,656 on January 24, a fall of 41%. On the US Gulf-Caribs voyage, rates fell from $28,406 on December 24 to a measly $6,612 on January 9, then recovered to $26,573 on January 15, only to relapse to $9,762 on January 23. Then came a Friday feeling and a bump up to $12,861. Looking east, the LR2 benchmark voyage from Saudi Arabia to Japan ended 2024 on an acceptable $17,333 per day but quickly scrubbed up to a luminous $40,324 on January 15 only to stumble to $27,776 on January 24. The parallel LR1 voyage ended 2024 at $12,036 but increased to a peak of $26,414 on January 15 before slipping back to $16,245 on the 24th. As India’s refineries absorbed the new sanctions reality, day rates from Jamnagar to Chiba for 35,000 tonne cargoes were 29% lower on January 24, at a slovenly $8,074 per day, compared to a smarter $11,339 one month earlier and a suave $13,201 on January 17. South Korea’s refiners enjoyed January, with good export volumes supporting freight rates. On the voyage to the US west coast, MR tanker day rates were up 19% on January 24 compared to December 24, at $23,901, while on the voyage to Singapore they were up 44% at $12,873. Overall, the Baltic Exchange Clean Tanker Index was up 16% at 725 points on January 24 compared to 625 points on December 24"

The 2000-built 26,200 dwt vessel issued a distress call while transiting the Dover Strait, about 15 nautical miles off the coast of Ramsgate, UK. Rescue teams from the UK, the Netherlands, and France were tasked to the scene, including a fixed-wing aircraft, a vessel with firefighting and towing capability and lifeboats. No injuries have been reported, and the fire, which was reported at 09.35 hrs local time, has been contained by onboard fire suppression systems. The 214-m-long, 1,300 teuGrande Brasilewas on its way from Antwerp to Le Havre and is understood to be laden with containers and cars. “As a result of this casualty, cargo deliveries will likely be delayed, with significant cargo loss and damage,” W.E. Cox Claims Group said in a note. The ship, covered by Britannia P&I Club, is owned and managed by Grimaldi’s ACL Atlantic Container Line in Sweden and operated by the group on its West Africa and Northern Europe trades. The latest incident follows a deadly blaze the Grimaldi Group-controlled conroGrande Costa D’Avoriosuffered at the Port of Newark in New Jersey in 2023. In March 2019, Grimaldi’s conroGrande Americacaught fire and sank off the western coast of France while sailing from Hamburg to Casablanca in Morocco.

        "content": "While no merchant ships have been attacked in the region this year, there’s little sign authorities believe the Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to an end anytime soon. The European Union has announced it is extending the mandate of its maritime security operation, EUNAVFOR Aspides, for an additional year, reinforcing efforts to safeguard freedom of navigation in the Red Sea region. The operation will now continue until February 28, 2026, with a budget of over €17m ($17.8m) allocated for its extended period. In addition to protecting vessels, ASPIDES has been authorised to gather intelligence on arms trafficking and shadow fleets. Transits through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal have seen a very slight uptick in traffic in recent days, but most shipowners who have eschewed the region in favour of longer trips around the African continent are sticking with that policy as tension remains high in the Middle East with the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas still facing many hurdles. CMA CGM has announced a new service from India into the Red Sea passing by the Houthis in Yemen, a rare move by a global liner to deploy tonnage to the region. The new service is operated by three vessels and is operated jointly by Saudi-based Folk Maritime and Oman-based Asyad Shipping. An unloaded LNG tanker,Trader III, has been sailing through the Red Sea this week, the second vessel of its kind to take the passage so far this year. The leader of the Houthis warned last week his fighters have their fingers “on the trigger” ready to resume their campaign against merchant shipping passing by the Red Sea in the event that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas backfires. No ships have been attacked this year, with the Houthis saying they will step back so long as Israel’s war with Hamas ends. As and when the Red Sea does open up for merchant ship traffic will drive profits and losses for many shipping companies this year. Top management at Maersk laid out earlier this month how the Houthis from Yemen could dictate the line between black or red ink for the coming year. Maersk’s EBIT forecast for 2025 ranges from zero to $3bn, depending on whether the Red Sea opens in the middle of the year or the end of the year."

The report suggests the UN lacks an institutional structure to address maritime security comprehensively. “Neither the General Assembly’s ocean affairs and law of the sea process, the selected focus of the Security Council, nor the assemblies of the United Nations agencies proactive in maritime security, such as the [International Maritime Organization] or [the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime], have as sufficient mandate or legitimacy on their own to deal with maritime security challenges comprehensively and to bring strategic coherence to the United Nations efforts,” the report suggests. The UNIDIR is a voluntarily funded, autonomous institute within the UN. “An institutional mechanism will firstly have to address the task of more effectively mainstreaming maritime security across the United Nations system,” the report advises. “The acceleration of maritime activities and humanity’s growing dependency on the seas calls for more structured and sustained efforts to address maritime security within the United Nations system,” Dr Christian Bueger, lead author of the report, toldSplash. “This report provides a roadmap for developing those vital new approaches.”"

        "content": "Taiwan has blacklisted 52 Chinese-owned ships that operate under flags of convenience. The crackdown follows the severing of a subsea communications cable near Taiwan at the beginning of January. Taiwan’s National Coast Guard Administration identified a Cameroon-registered cargo ship,Shunxin 39(pictured), as the suspect in the incident. Taipei will now target vessels flagged under countries like Cameroon, Tanzania, Mongolia, Togo, and Sierra Leone, where it deems ship registration processes often lack stringent safety and regulatory standards. Of the 52 vessels identified, 15 were deemed threats due to their extended presence in Taiwanese waters over the past year. Among these, one vessel was flagged as a “high threat,” with several others categorised as posing medium or lower levels of risk. Earlier this month, theShunxin 39was ordered to return to waters near the Port of Keelung to be investigated. Due to rough weather, coast guard officers were not able to board the ship for investigation and could not detain it. The ship continued on its way to South Korea. It was later revealed that the vessel belongs to Hong Kong-based Jie Yang Trading headed by a Chinese citizen. Taiwan’s National Security Bureau said earlier this month ships which have previously been found to misreport information will be put on a list of ships for priority inspection at ports. Moreover, if these ships enter within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan’s coast and are close to where undersea cables are, the coast guard will be dispatched to board them and investigate. Other ships hanging around the Taiwanese coastline have sparked concern. For instance, the Belize-flagged Russian general cargo vessel,Vasily Shukshin, left Russia’s Vostochnyy port on December 8 and loitered off Taiwan’s coast on December 19, according to Ray Powell, director of Stanford University-affiliated maritime analyst group SeaLight. Powell said the vessel was “aimlessly criss-crossing” the area near Taiwan’s Fangshan undersea cable landing station for three and a half weeks “for no apparent reason,” but that it had since started to return to Russia earlier this week. According to data provider Windward, the frequency of underwater infrastructure sabotage has increased from just two incidents in 2000 to 75 incidents in 2024 with the seas around Taiwan as well as the Baltic becoming hotspots for ships deliberately dragging anchors to take out critical subsea infrastructure."

The Sindre Matre-led company has contracted Jiangsu Soho Marine Heavy Industry to see the 8,000 dwt vessel delivered in the third quarter of 2026. The newbuild will be a sister vessel of the company’sNor Viking(pictured), delivered in 2022, and another unit ordered at Dayang Offshore Equipment in 2023, with delivery expected in the first half of 2025. The vessel will feature a 2 MW battery hybrid system and reduce emissions and energy use while meeting strict environmental regulations and customer demands for efficient logistics, the company noted. “This investment aligns with our goal of modernising the fleet and reducing our carbon footprint,” said Arriva chief executive Matre. Founded in 1972 by Johannes Matre, the company is located with a head office in Ølensvåg and branch offices in Stavanger and Gdansk. The short sea shipping player owns and operates eight self-discharging bulkers ranging from 2,000 dwt to 8,000 dwt, in addition to five to 10 chartered vessels that mainly operate in Northern Europe."

Under the award, Shearwater will commence a six-month survey starting in the first half of 2025. The field unit will be comprised of a Shearwater seismic vessel as a source vessel and a dual ROV vessel for node deployment. This follows the company recently completing a 4D towed streamer operation for ExxonMobil in Canada. “We see a steady increase in deepwater 4D OBN monitoring activity internationally, and Shearwater is well positioned for this growth […],” said Irene Waage Basili, CEO of Shearwater. Last week was a big one for ExxonMobil in Guyana. The supermajor submitted its environmental impact assessment for the development of its seventh oil project in the Stabroek block named Hammerhead. It will consist of 14 to 30 development wells, the installation and operation of an FPSO, and the installation of a gas export pipeline from the FPSO. The project would start production in 2029, once it receives the required governmental approval, with a crude oil production capacity estimated at 120,000 and 180,000 bpd, increasing the country’s production capacity to more than 1.4m bpd. Also, the fourth FPSO to be operated by an ExxonMobil-led consortium in Guyana is on its way to the South American country’s waters from Singapore. TheOne GuyanaFPSO will be followed by two more FPSOs in the next two years."

Finnish telecom operator Cinia said on Friday that it had detected minor damage in Swedish waters on its C-Lion1 undersea fibre-optic link connecting Finland and Germany, the third time this particular cable has been struck since November last year. “The preliminary investigation relates to suspected sabotage,” said Swedish police spokesperson Mathias Rutegard. Seabed gas pipelines, power cables and fibre optic cables have all been attacked – likely by merchant ships dragging their anchors – in recent months across the Baltic, forcing NATO to establish Baltic Sentry, a naval protection operation. Baltic Sentry involves a range of assets, including frigates, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and drones. The European Commission said on Friday it will propose boosting surveillance of undersea cables and establishing a fleet of vessels available to carry out repairs in emergencies. A joint statement from the heads of state or government of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden last month noted: “Russia’s use of the so-called shadow fleet poses a particular threat to the maritime and environmental security in the Baltic Sea region and globally. This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.”"

Two anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired at theChem Ranger, a Marshall Island-flagged chemical tanker overnight. Shipping databases show the ship is managed by Interunity Management in Greece. “The crew observed the missiles impact the water near the ship. There were no reported injuries or damage to the ship,” US Central Command said on social media platform X. US Navy warplanes carried out further strikes yesterday in response to the latest attacks. More than 30 merchant ships have been targeted by the Houthis since November, leading to a massive redrawing of the global seaborne map. US president Joe Biden on Thursday admitted the US counterstrikes had yet to deter the Houthi attacks, but added: “Are they going to continue? Yes.” The European Parliament adopted yesterday a resolution condemning the recent attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and calling for immediate and concerted EU efforts including a naval operation. During a meeting with shipping industry representatives yesterday, Arsenio Dominguez, the new secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization reiterated the message that seafarers are innocent victims in the volatile Red Sea situation. Secondly, freedom of navigation must be upheld, to guarantee global trade and the flow of goods by sea. Further, there must be caution and restraint to avoid further escalation of the situation in the Red Sea and broader area, Dominguez said. Ships in all segments are diverting to avoid the dangerous situation in the Middle East (see charts from Jefferies below) with traffic through the Suez Canal nosediving by more than a third year-on-year in the opening days of 2024. One segment where the longer voyages are likely to raise concerns is the livestock carrier sector.Bloomberghas reported theBahijahlivestock carrier appears to have diverted towards South Africa on its voyage from Australia to the Middle East, the extra weeks onboard to get to its final destination will likely lead to a number of animals perishing."

This is another hit for the offshore wind industry in the US which is reeling following president Donald Trump’sfreezeof all offshore wind leasing on the country’s outer continental shelf. New Jersey has probably taken the brunt of these new policies and the Atlantic Shores project is a prime example of it. Shell abandoned its involvement in the 1,510MW project in January and took a nearly $1b write-down on the project. At the time, EDF said it would be pushing forward with the already permitted project. However, more bad luck for EDF and its project was on its way. Earlier this month, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilitiespulled the plugon the state’s fourth offshore wind solicitation. This was due to two of the three initial bidders withdrawing from the solicitation and Atlantic Shores remaining as the sole bidder. New Jersey approved three offshore wind developments which were supposed to be part of the solicitation round – Atlantic Shores southern project, Attentive Energy Two, and Leading Light Wind. There used to be four projects but Ørsted cancelled its Ocean Wind project in 2023 citing increased costs of development. Atlantic Shores also proposed a second ‘northern’ project but was declined by the NJ Board. Trump has placed a target on the EDF-led project with his speeches from last year and showed his disdain for the project during speeches at Mar-a-Lago. The project was not safe from the president even on social media. Another company to announce write-offs in 2024 was Eversource Energy which took a hit of around $1.6bn relating to three of its wind projects – South Fork Wind, Revolution Wind, and Sunrise Wind."

        "content": "Rob Mortimer, managing director of fuel specialist Fuelre4m, takes a challenging look at the outcomes from last week’s IMO Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships My biggest takeaways from the recent convening of 107 parties, representing 97% of the world’s shipping tonnage are: Let’s set the bar a little higher. Let’s talk about using technology that is available today to measure the Total Pollution Receipt (TPS) of a fuel, including blockchain ‘chain of custody’ from ingredients, through production and distribution, all the way to what we at Fuelre4m like to call PPP – Piston Pushing Power. And let’s consider the Fuel’s Energy Conversion Rate (FCR). How much of the megajoules of energy is converting to pushing power. The shipping industry needs to stop burying its head in the sand and gets to grip with the efficiencies of fuel, not just focusing on the mantra that fossil fuels are bad, especially when they don’t know how much of the fuel is converting to thrust, and then repeating the same mistakes by not knowing the energy conversion or the supply chain pollution of other fuels either. To me, cutting GHG and fossil fuel emissions isn’t a game of strategy, manipulating numbers to support the fuel technology of 2050 while ignoring the extra pollution created on the long and dirty journey to get there. It’s about genuinely optimising the combustion and consumption of every fuel now. This IMO session has seen those with business interests in biofuels seeking to cover up the facts that, although CO2 production is ‘lower’ in biofuel blends, the energy density is also lower and, due to a poor combustion rate, a measure of FCR has shown that, as well as introducing fuel stability issues, a B20 blend requires 7%-8% more of the B20 fuel to produce the same PPP as LSFO. So the 84% credit on the B20 is cancelled by the 6-7% increase in LSFO consumption AND due to the higher temperature needed for primary combustion of biofuels, NOx goes mad. But nobody is measuring – yet. Wait until the biofuel suppliers have built the distribution and supply market. Then, once everyone is onboard, let’s tax the NOx that nobody told you about. Even better, let’s catch it and trade it! Being pragmatic, I applaud that the IMO is driving forward, negotiating with all parties to try to find clear seas to drive towards the goal. Let’s not lose sight of the reality, though – fossil fuel consumption in the shipping industry increased last year. It will rise again for the next 25 years, with the mix of fuels changing but the pollution increasing, and in 2050 we’re going to look back and realise that the Net-Zero Framework became a game of ‘where to hide the skeletons’. Cutting consumption and optimising the combustion of all fuels, old or new, is the only way to cut pollution. Burning something else at a different point in the fuel’s lifecycle, or at a less efficient FCR, is just whitewashing the greenwashing. Let’s not catch and trade pollution. Let’s cut the production of emissions at source, and reward that."

        "content": "Dutch floater expert SBM Offshore will be conducting a study with Brazilian state-owned oil and gas giant Petrobras for the application of carbon capture modules on FPSOs. The module design is based on a successful engineering and design study done by SBM Offshore and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, qualified by DNV. The design is based on a combination of Mitsubishi Heavy’s proprietary CO2 capture technology and SBM Offshore’s Fast4ward principles. According to SBM, the compact modular solution allows a significant reduction of overall emissions associated with the production of oil and gas from FPSOs. The solution is being developed as part of the company’s EmissionZERO program. The scope of the study covers the design and the commercial evaluation of various carbon capture system configurations to be installed on future FPSOs deployed on Petrobras fields. More precisely, it will look at various turbine types and machinery set-ups, gas flow rates and gas turbine power installed as well as different CO2 concentrations and gas composition. “We continue to work towards decarbonization solutions in the design of our products and our offshore operations. Through this study, we will be able to advance the carbon capture module design jointly with our partner MHI for CO2 reduction on future FPSOs,” said Olivier Icyk, chief business officer at SBM Offshore."

        "publication_date": "2025-02-20T05:53:47+00:00",
        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Under current and prospective policies from the International Maritime Organization, European Union, and the US, the business case for green shipping corridors could improve markedly – but not sufficiently – according to a new 72-page report published by UMAS, UCL and the Global Maritime Forum (GMF). Titled ‘Building a Business Case for Green Shipping Corridors’, the report looks at the significant commercial challenges associated with green shipping corridors, how these could change under future regulation, and what additional support may be needed to ensure the viability of such projects. Green shipping corridor projects – which focus on initiating the maritime value chain for scalable and sustainable fuels such as hydrogen-derived e-ammonia and e-methanol – have thus far faced an insurmountable cost gap. Against the backdrop of an evolving global and regional policy landscape, the business case for such first mover initiatives will begin to improve, but targeted support will be needed to ensure uptake of e-fuels. The report emphasises the important role of regulation in enabling shipping’s energy transition and the wider implications for the industry operating under a future compliance regime where fleet and bunkering strategies will need to become more sophisticated. Policies such as the IMO’s new global fuel standard, the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), and the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will play a critical role in reducing costs for green shipping corridors but fall short of fully bridging the gap between the cost of e-fuels and the cheapest solution to meet compliance. The report explores the potential opportunities and options that could be available for green shipping corridors in three different shipping sectors—gas carriers, container ships and bulk carriers—to highlight how public and private efforts could accelerate early adoption of e-fuels. The scenarios explored reveal that while biofuels and blue ammonia are lowest cost options over the near term, scalable e-fuels such as e-ammonia are expected to become increasingly competitive as production costs fall and compliance requirements tighten, indicating that targeted support would only be required over the short term. With 62 green shipping corridors initiatives already announced, support for these early mover projects could enable significant strides to be made in the development of sustainable fuel production and in investment in the storage, bunkering, and port infrastructure required to decarbonise the wider shipping industry later in the transition. Deniz Aymer, senior consultant at UMAS, commented, “Upcoming regulation will shift the business case for green shipping corridors – as well as shaping how the wider shipping industry approaches compliance. To fully bridge the cost gap, however, targeted support for e-fuels is needed. But this short-term support will pay future dividends by ensuring that scalable and sustainable fuels are available to the wider industry when needed.” To accelerate progress, the report outlines actionable solutions for industry and policymakers. It highlights how business models will need to adapt under incoming regulation and how long-term commitments from cargo owners and shipowners and operators can help de-risk investment and drive e-fuel adoption. Strategic partnerships across the value chain will be essential for sharing risks and rewards, ensuring a more equitable cost distribution while advancing green shipping corridor projects. Despite this, the business case for green shipping corridors will remain challenging without targeted measures to support the uptake of e-fuels. Mechanisms such as Contracts for Difference (CFDs), e-fuel auctions, and/or multipliers for overcompliance with e-fuels will be crucial to the short-term viability of these initiatives. Economic support could be underwritten by the IMO through revenues raised by a levy on shipping industry emissions. In the absence of a global levy, however, national governments may need to step in to directly support corridor projects. Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, commented, “The most important role Green Corridors can play is to coordinate and kick-start the value chain for tomorrow’s shipping fuels. Participants in corridors will need to be creative in how they leverage a range of regulations, but it’s clear from this work that the scale of their impact will depend on policymakers delivering targeted support for e-fuels.”"

Described as the world’s first charter for such a vessel, the deal will see a 40,000 cu m newbuild enter service in late 2026. The newbuilding project follows a memorandum of understanding between NYK, Nihon Shipyard, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK) and Yara to explore the development of an ammonia-fuelled ammonia gas carrier. The use of the 180-m-long vessel will greatly contribute to significantly reducing GHG emissions from shipping and developing an ammonia supply chain, the companies said in a joint release. “We believe that using alternative fuels, especially ammonia, is essential to reaching the net-zero goal,” stated Hironobu Watanabe, managing executive officer at NYK. “Our successful collaboration with NYK enables us not only to comply with future regulations related to CO2 emissions from sea-going vessels but also helps us to ensure that our customers can receive carbon-intensity compliant clean ammonia throughout our supply chain from well to wake,” said Murali Srinivasan, senior vice president of commercial at Yara Clean Ammonia, the company which operates the largest global ammonia network with 15 ships."

Alessandro Bresciani, vice president of Baker Hughes, commented, “Carbon reduction in the transportation sector is one of today’s most urgent and high-potential opportunities. Ammonia will play a key role in significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” Last October, a local rival of Hanwha Ocean, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, unveiled its own zero-carbon ammonia dual-fuel engine which it claims will be the first engine in the world to use a high-pressure ammonia direct injection method. Last week, MAN Energy Solutions reported that its liquid gas injection ammonia engine, currently undergoing testing at its research centre in Copenhagen, has run at 100% engine load for the first time."

The wide-ranging 16th package of sanctions is expected to see more than 70 ships blacklisted, bringing the total list to over 150, mostly aged tankers. The new round of sanctions, set to be adopted next week, will mark the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It will also include a Russian aluminium import ban, restrictions on Russian banks, measures to strengthen the G7 oil price cap, and new export bans. “The EU is clamping down even harder on circumvention by targeting more vessels in Putin’s shadow fleet and imposing new import and export bans. We are committed to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X. The move on the latest EU sanctions comes after US President Donald Trump’s administration agreed to hold more talks with Russia on ending the war in Ukraine after an initial meeting in Saudi Arabia that excluded Kyiv and its European supporters with US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, suggesting any peace deal will come with relaxation of sanctions."

        "content": "The 18th Intersessional Working Group on Greenhouse Gases (GHG) concluded on Friday at the International Maritime Organization with the GHG levy in combination with a global fuel standard as the most favoured candidate mid-term measure for reducing GHG emissions from shipping. Analysis of the participation at the meeting carried out by UCL Energy Institute showed that 66% of MARPOL signatories now support a levy, which will be decided upon when member states meet up in April for the 83rd gathering of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC). Guy Platten, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), said he was “broadly satisfied” with the progress made, but much work urgently remains to be done. Bryan Wood-Thomas, vice-president environment and climate at the World Shipping Council, liner shipping’s lobby group, said he was pleased to see constructive efforts to bridge different perspectives and proposals into a global solution. “Any GHG obligations should be set out in the form of clear, legally-binding regulations. While there are tough conversations to have, it is better to have those conversationsnow and ensure the measures agreed have the integrity and clarity required to be effective. Regulations create a level playing field, while guidelines play a role in providing detailed guidance for implementation,” Wood-Thomas said."

        "content": "Two new reports led by UCL Energy Institute and Oceans Research Group show what’s at stake at the upcoming International Maritime Organization (IMO) meetings and in the crucial period in the run-up to the Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting set for April. The IMO is expected to agree on policies, called mid-term measures, that will be key for achieving IMO’s strategic objectives – including completing international shipping’s decarbonisation by around 2050, and contributing to a just and equitable transition for all states. The eighteenth Intersessional Working Group on GHG (ISWG-GHG 18) is the penultimate negotiating session, before MEPC 83 – the meeting at which IMO has committed to agree in principle, a MARPOL amendment draft for a new Chapter 5, which will enshrine the legal definition of the new policy measures, comprising of a technical measure – a greenhouse gas (GHG) fuel standard, which mandates reducing GHG intensity of shipping’s energy use over time and an economic measure – a price on GHG emissions, and specification of distribution of any revenues raised. From the analysis of the submissions to the IMO, there are now two main camps, one that favours a global fuel standard (GFS) in combination with a levy and another with only the GFS with a credit trading scheme but not including a universal price on carbon. The former now has strong support from 51 countries, comprising of 70% of tonnage, a level of support which is important if a vote is called. “The broad support we’ve gained from across regions highlights the rising global agreement on a structured carbon pricing mechanism that prioritizes fairness,” commented Albon Ishoda, the Marshall Islands’ special envoy for maritime decarbonisation, a man who has been leading from the front for many years in the carbon levy debate. The great unknown at MEPC will be how much of a wrecking ball the US will be with returning president, Donald Trump, showing his disdain for green regulations in the opening weeks of his new administration. Dr Annika Frosch, research fellow at the UCL Energy Institute, said: “With 70% of tonnage now supporting a global fuel standard along with a carbon levy, it is crucial that the upcoming round of negotiations focuses on discussing the distribution of revenues, both within and outside the shipping sector.” Splash will be bringing readers updates from April’s MEPC gathering."

        "content": "A new analysis shows that Tamil Nadu, India’s southernmost state, could deliver up to $75bn of economic growth and 805,000 from the offshore wind manufacturing supply chain by 2030. The analysis, done by Ocean Energy Pathway with support from the Global Wind Energy Council and international consultancy COWI, shows that achieving the country’s target of 37GW of offshore wind by 2030 will bring substantial social and economic benefits to India as a whole, and Tamil Nadu in particular. According to the World Bank, India has the potential for 91GW of fixed offshore wind along its coastline. If India’s long-term full potential for offshore wind is realised, the report forecasts that by 2040, offshore wind will contribute to a total economic growth of $125bn and additional employment of 1.25m people. But Tamil Nadu stands out, with high wind speeds, shallow seabed depths, and proximity to industrial hubs which already represent 46% of India’s total capacity for manufacturing offshore wind turbines. The study said that government commitment, financial incentives, and supportive policies are crucial to attracting investment into India’s offshore wind sector and ensuring its long-term viability. The report also offers recommendations to unlock the offshore wind potential in Tamil Nadu and across India as a whole. Namely, it calls for establishing a clear pipeline with sufficient volumes for offshore wind development to attract OEMs to invest in new production facilities within Tamil Nadu and for creating financial incentives for investors to accelerate the offshore wind build-out in Tamil Nadu, such as providing a guaranteed power offtake. It also points out the need for setting out a clear institutional framework articulating guidelines, regulations, processes, and responsibilities to make the opportunity more attractive to businesses and investors. The report also sees a need for a strategic approach to publicly provided enabling infrastructure as well as clearly defined local content requirements which support local offshore wind development. “This report shows that there are tangible opportunities to supercharge the stellar growth that Tamil Nadu has enjoyed in manufacturing, through a strategic focus on offshore wind,” said Charles Ogilvie, executive director of Ocean Energy Pathway."

It will also sport a gas combustion unit of 27.7 MW that will enable the vessel to perform cool-down and warming-up services to other vessels’ fuel tanks or cargo tanks.

Richards Bay is poised to be South Africa’s liquid fuel industrial hub after Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) signed two strategic terminal operator agreements for the development of the country’s first LNG import terminal and a liquid bulk terminal at the Port of Richards Bay’s South Dunes precinct. The signed agreement with Zululand Energy Terminals for 25 years is in line with the government’s aims to introduce at least 6,000 MW of gas-to-power projects to meet the country’s limited and depleting energy supply. Phase one of the LNG terminal will yield a 2m tonnes per annum capacity, potentially growing to 5m tonnes. The liquid bulk terminal, meanwhile, will be operated by FFS Tank Terminals and will serve the growing demand for bunker fuels in the region. “The development of these two terminals is a game changer in the economic landscape of the region,” Transnet stated in a release."

        "content": "US president Donald Trump has signed an executive order establishing a new council focused on boosting the country’s production and export of fossil fuels. Trump signed another executive order which formally created the National Energy Dominance Council with the primary purpose of driving up domestic oil and gas production. The new council, to be headed by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, will be granted authority over federal agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, and transportation. It was given instructions to cut bureaucratic red tape, enhance private sector investments, and focus on innovation. Trump also revealed that Burgum was directed to undoBiden’s banon future offshore oil drilling. Biden, on his way out, removed around 2.57m sq km of offshore federal waters along the east and west coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and portions of Alaska’s Northern Bering Sea. The ban, however, is not repealable without an act of Congress because it is protected by the 72-year-old Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and a Supreme Court decision which states that a presidential order cannot undo a previous one. The US Congress consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives which both have a Republican majority, albeit very slender ones. Another development regarding fossil fuels revealed during the executive order announcement was the award of a conditional export authorization for the Commonwealth LNG project in Louisiana. The facility will export 9.5m tons of LNG per year at a new facility in Cameron Parish. This is the first approval of new LNG exports since former Biden paused considerations in January 2024. Commonwealth LNG is scheduled to reach a final investment decision in September, with the first LNG production expected in early 2029. It is still awaiting a permit from FERC but that is expected to occur later in the year. Trump said during the signing at the Oval Office that the US was blessed with “liquid gold” and that the country was “going to make more money than anybody’s ever made with energy”."

        "content": "The dark fleet casts its shadow over the International Chamber of Shipping’s (ICS) latest annual flag state performance table with four new countries – familiar homes to Russia’s fleet – added to the list. Cambodia, Eswatini, Gabon and Guinea-Bissau have been added to the survey, which charts the best and worst performing major flag states, while the British Virgin Islands, Costa Rica and Uruguay have been removed due to their relatively small fleet sizes. “The new additions, Cambodia, Eswatini, Gabon and Guinea-Bissau are reportedly used by some shipping companies seeking to bypass US/EU/G7 sanctions, leading to concerns as to whether international maritime standards are being properly enforced on board ships flying the flags of these States,” the ICS stated in a release. “Eswatini’s emergence as a flag state presents a distinct concern as it is not a member of the UN IMO and is therefore not a signatory of its international maritime conventions. ICS strongly encourages Eswatini and other new flag states to prioritise IMO membership and the ratification and implementation of IMO conventions to demonstrate their commitment to global maritime governance and the responsible operation of those ships registered with their fleets,” commented ICS secretary-general, Guy Platten. Splashhas reported repeatedly about the growth of shipping registers fuelled by the shadow fleet and Russia’s determination to keep exports flowing despite sanctions. San Marino, Guyana, Sierra Leone, Comoro Islands, Guinea Bissau and most notably Guinea were the flag states that stood out for their extraordinary fleet growth in the latest data compiled in the late January issue of Clarksons Research’s World Fleet Monitor. It is in Africa where flag states have mushroomed the most in step with the growth of the shadow fleet – Sierre Leone up by 105%, the Comoro Islands by 104%, Guinea Bissau leaping by 340%, and most extraordinary of all, Guinea’s flag state growing by 99,094% over the past 12 months. “For more than 50 years, shipping has been a global industry operating under global rules, and it is vital that flag states adhere to their obligations to enforce the highest global safety standards. I hope that this year’s table helps shipping companies to carefully consider the performance of flag administrations when making decisions about the flags which they choose for their ships to fly,” said ICS’s Platten. The number of vessels hit by sanctions surpassed 1,000 late last year with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showing that more 800 of these ships do not have confirmed insurance. Moreover, the average age of sanctioned ships – 21 years – is some eight years older than the global average, adding to growing concern that the sprawling so-called shadow fleet could lead to multiple costly environmental catastrophes. Despite slowing, the grey fleet is still growing by around 10 tankers a month, according to brokers BRS. Nearly two in three vintage tankers carried Iranian, Venezuelan, or Russian cargoes last year, according to estimates from broker Gibson. Global insurer Allianz’s 2024 shipping report noted of the shadow fleet: “Despite efforts to crack down on these vessels, the number of tankers is actually increasing, and we have seen a number of groundings and collision incidents.”"

Stella Maris is a Norway-based carbon capture and storage company developing a full CCS value chain, including carbon capture, intermediate storage, offshore transportation, and permanent sequestration of CO2 captured from industrial sources. The company holds a 40% stake in the Havstjerne reservoir on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Developed in partnership with Harbour Energy, the Havstjerne CO2 injection and storage project is a cornerstone of Stella Maris’ activities, with its technical feasibility validated by extensive seismic data and reservoir studies. The European Union’s Innovation Fund has selected the Havstjerne CO2 injection and storage project for a grant of up to €225m, payable against expenditures upon certain investment and commercial operation milestones. This is considered the largest EU grant for a CCS project to date. “The acquisition of Stella Maris is a logical step in expanding our portfolio of strategic investments within the carbon capture space, and we are excited to integrate these solutions to help industrial emitters achieve their decarbonisation targets,” said Lars Gunnar Vogt, CTO of Yinson Production. Altera Infrastructure has already sold several of its subsidiary companies outside its core business. Namely, it sold its 18-vessel-strong tanker business for an undisclosed sum in November 2024 to the Angelicoussis Group. The formerly named Altera Shuttle Tankers has been renamed this week toMaran Shuttle Tankers. Earlier in 2024, the company also offloaded its anchor-handling and towage unit, ALP Maritime, to Dutch-basedBoskalis.

        "content": "The US is considering slapping huge fees on Chinese-built ships calling at its ports, while also clamping down on Chinese ownership of terminals on home soil. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has finally outlined the ways it feels Washington DC can fight back against the dominance China has in maritime, and particularly shipbuilding after a months-long investigation instigated by the Joe Biden administration. Now Biden’s successor at the White House, Donald Trump, must deliberate whether to enact what the USTR has suggested. The USTR calls for US port fees for Chinese-built ships of up to $1.5m for every call. The wording of the proposal could impact any ship operator that has even just one Chinese-built ship in its fleet or on order. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing commented: “The US measures will not only fail to revitalise its shipbuilding industry but will also raise shipping costs on related routes, exacerbate its domestic inflation, reduce the global competitiveness of US goods, and hurt the interests of its port operators and dockworkers.” If the intention is to drastically increase costs, this proposal is likely to do the job The US has been engaging with Korean and Japanese shipbuilders in a belated bid to bolster its faded shipbuilding sector, while one of Trump’s first acts back in power was to enact a blanket 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Other suggestions floated by the USTR to claw back some maritime control call for greater use of American-flagged ships. The trade office is calling for 1% of US export products to be moved on US-flagged vessels by US operators, increasing this figure to 5% within three years, and 15% by year seven. “If the intention is to drastically increase costs for US importers and make US exports uncompetitive, this proposal is likely to do the job,” commented Lars Jensen, the head of container advisory Vespucci Maritime, via LinkedIn. The president will now have to decide whether to carry out the USTR’s recommendations. Another White House executive order filed last week could see Chinese investment in American ports come to an end. The new America First Investment Policy published by the Trump administration states that US should not allow China to take over US critical infrastructure, including shipping terminals. China’s state-run COSCO, the world’s largest shipping company, has port interests in Long Beach via its subsidiary OOCL. Last month, in the last couple of weeks of the Biden administration, COSCO, was among a host of Chinese shipping-related names added to a list of companies the US Department of Defense views as having links to the People’s Liberation Army. While being on the Pentagon’s blacklist carries no specific penalties, it discourages US firms from dealing with these companies that Washington views as military entities."

        "content": "The EU Atalanta naval force which handles piracy operations in the Indian Ocean has warned that the decision last week by a Bangladeshi company to pay ransom to free its ship and crew could lead to further attacks on merchant shipping. Ships sailing off the Somalian coasts were urged yesterday to maintain a heightened state of vigilance in light of the recent escalation in piracy threats with the European naval force adding that the conclusion of the monsoon period could further facilitate piracy activities in the region. Splash reported yesterday that Somali pirates hadreleaseda hijacked Bangladeshi ship, Abdullah, and its crew of 23 early on Sunday after a $5m ransom was paid. The ship had been taken on March 12. The naval team said yesterday that the payment of ransom could create a new wave of dhow hijackings leading to future skiff attacks on merchant vessels. Naval forces have freed fishing boats seized by gunmen and thwarted other attempted attacks. Last month, Indian commandos boarded and recaptured a vessel seized in December, the Maltese-flagged Ruen. All 17 hostages were rescued and 35 alleged pirates were brought to Mumbai to face prosecution. Up to 18 dhows have been hijacked, according to the Atalanta taskforce which has identified several possible pirate camps on the Somali coasts situated between Xaafuun and the village of Garacad, with a hot spot north of Eyl, where the Ruen and the Abdullah had been at anchorage for several weeks. The typical pirate strategy, the Taskforce explained in an update, involves the seizure and hijacking of a dhow, which is subsequently utilised as their mother ship. They then blend in with usual traffic and deploy skiffs from the mother ship to attack vessels navigating as far as 600 nautical miles or more, off the East Somali coast. The return of Somali pirates comes at a time where the Houthis from Yemen are also firing on merchant ships passing by their shores, with around 80 vessels targeted over the past six months. As a result of the heightened security concerns for merchant shipping, prices for private maritime security guards onboard have shot up this year, according to recent analysis from sister title Splash Extra with many ex-soldiers looking to get in on the action."

Ingka Investments, the investment arm of Ingka Group, the largest IKEA retailer, has a 20% stake in Source Galileo’s UK offshore wind projects which includes the PortWind project. The project has a target installed capacity of around 2GW with the potential to deliver enough renewable energy to help power over 3m households annually. The project has secured a 2.5GW grid connection into the Chickerell 400kV substation, near Weymouth, which includes provision for a 350MW battery energy storage system. “It is still early days for the PortWind project, but this MoU shows the direction of travel and supports our Green Energy Island aspiration for Portland to become a leading renewable energy hub on the south coast,” said Ian McQuade, general manager of commercial operations at Portland Port."

        "content": "Floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) specialist Golar LNG has marked its exit from the LNG shipping business with the sale of its last remaining gas carrier. The Nasdaq-listed company is shipping out the 2003-built steam turbine LNG carrier,Golar Arctic, for $24m. The Tor Olav Trøim-backed company said the 140,000 cu m vessel should change hands in the first quarter, without naming the buyer. Golar had been exploring alternatives for theGolar Arcticever since its sale to Italian state-controlled gas grid operator Snamfell throughin 2023. The vessel was earmarked for a floating storage and regasification unit(FSRU)conversion in 2022 under a $283m deal that did not materialise in time. “The sale of the Golar Arctic marks the conclusion of Golar’s planned exit from the LNG shipping segment, 50 years after taking delivery of our first LNG carrier in 1975,” said Golar CEO Karl Fredrik Staubo, adding: “Over the last 50 years LNG shipping has been the foundation for Golar’s pioneering maritime LNG infrastructure advances, including FSRUs and FLNGs. Golar’s transition into a focused FLNG infrastructure company is now complete.” Golar’s other LNG carrier, the 2004-built 148,000 cu m Fuji LNG, discharged its last cargo in January and has now arrived in China for conversion into an MKII FLNG at theCIMC shipyard. The converted 3.5mtpa unit is expected for delivery in 2027, joining Golar’s two operational FLNGs,HilliandGimi."

Eurobulk, run by the Pittas family, admitted to violating APPS in April 2023 during a port call by the Good Heart in the port of Corpus Christi as well as falsification of records during that same port call. US district judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos has now ordered the company to pay a criminal fine of $1.125m. The company must also serve a four-year-term of probation during which it will be subject to an environmental compliance plan with a monitorship to ensure future compliance. “It is crucial that we strive to eliminate threats to our waters through holding overseas corporations accountable,” said US attorney Nicholas Ganjei. “Our office will continue to seek justice when foreign vessels fail to comply with the APPS and then seek to cover it up. The environmental harm inflicted and falsification of records merit the sentence imposed today.” The Good Heart’s former chief engineer, Greek national Christos Charitos, 72, previously pleaded guilty and was sentenced for an APPS charge for failing to record discharges in the vessel’s Oil Record Book (ORB). Christos was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine. On at least two occasions in April 2023, Charitos ordered lower ranking engine personnel to discharge the contents of the duct keel – a pipe tunnel that begins in the engine room and runs forward under the cargo holds – directly into the sea without using the Oily Water Separator (OWS). The discharges contained oil. Also in April 2023, Charitos ordered the second engineer to make a fresh water connection to the OWS. By making such a connection, the oil content meter on the OWS was tricked so that the OCM could not verify the actual oil content of the discharge from the OWS. All of these discharges should have been recorded in the ORB. However, no entries were made."

The board of the listed oil and gas shipping business of COSCO Shipping Group has approved the construction of two aframaxes, two LR2s, and two panamax tankers, the company said in a filing. The newbuilding project, which also requires a green light from the shareholders, would be carried out by the group yards of COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry. The 74,000 dwt panamax crude and product tankers will be built in Dalian at about $64m each for CSET subsidiary Hainan COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation. Both ships will be methanol fuel-ready. COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry Yangzhou is to receive the remaining orders. The aframaxes, costing $86m per ship, will be 114,200 dwt and sport methanol dual-fuel engines, the same as the 109,900 dwt LR2s, priced at $89m each. COSCO’s energy shipping arm sports a fleet of more than 150 crude and product tankers and has stakes in nearly 90 LNG carriers, in addition to LPG and chemical tankers. CSET also recently revealed a $1.1bn fundraising move for an 11-ship newbuilding program, comprising three aframaxes, six VLCCs and two LNG carriers."

        "content": "Donald Trump has wasted little time in carrying out his vow to up pressure against Iran with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) yesterday slapping sanctions on more than a dozen people and firms that are accused of facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China. The 20-year-old, Comoros-flaggedSiriVLCC and its master, along with the 21-year-old, Panama-flaggedCH Billionaframax and the 22-year-old, Hong Kong-flaggedStar ForestVLCC were all sanctioned yesterday as was India-based crew management company Marshal Ship Management. “The Iranian regime remains focused on leveraging its oil revenues to fund the development of its nuclear program, to produce its deadly ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, and to support its regional terrorist proxy groups,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a news release. Further shipping-related sanctions are expected as the American president carries out his so-called ‘maximum pressure’ strategy on Iran. According to analysis from TankerTrackers.com, of the 503 active tankers that continue to transport Iranian crude oil and refined products, 283 – or 56% – have still not been blacklisted by OFAC. The real outcome of increased sanctions on Iran for the tanker markets as a whole will likely become more apparent later this year, according to analysis from investment bank Jefferies, as Iran’s exports diminish and are replaced by other producers with spare capacity and utilising compliant tankers to do so at the expense of the dark fleet."

        "content": "The world’s three largest containerlines have set their sights on India as the country readies massive investments towards its goals of becoming a global maritime powerhouse. The government of Narendra Modi has revealed billion-dollar moves on all things shipping through public/private ventures with MSC, Maersk and CMA CGM amongst the first to join India’s plans to bolster its maritime infrastructure. Earlier this month, India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, revealed a $2.9bn maritime development fund scheme for the long-term financing of the country’s shipbuilding and repair industry. The government will contribute 49% of the fund and seek the remainder from ports and the private sector. Denmark’s Maersk, the world’s second-largest liner, has signed a memorandum of understanding with India’s Cochin Shipyard to explore ship repair and shipbuilding opportunities. The strategic partnership, which aligns with India’s aim to be among the top 10 maritime nations by 2030 and the top five by 2047, is expected to see the first Maersk vessel repair at Cochin Shipyard already in 2025. The Indian government-controlled Cochin Shipyard was established in 1972 and is the country’s largest shipbuilding and repair yard. The collaboration with Maersk will initially focus on ships up to 7,000 teu for afloat repairs and up to 4,000 teu for drydocking, with capabilities expected to expand over time. According to local media, France’s CMA CGM is expected to emulate this move with a delegation set to visit India shortly. Prime Minister Modi recently visited the company’s chief executive, Rodolphe Saadé, at the French liner’s headquarters in Marseille to discuss CMA CGM’s initiatives in India, including upcoming developments on shipbuilding and ship repair opportunities. Meanwhile, MSC chief executive Soren Toft has been visiting India this week to meet with Piyush Goyal, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, to discuss multiple potential investments. Goyal said on social media the talks focused on investments in inland container terminals, shipbuilding, maintenance, and container manufacturing, as well as vessel partnerships and policy reforms to enhance the nation’s global maritime competitiveness.

Trump wasted little time getting down to his agenda, signing many executive orders and shocking neighbours by his aggressive, swaggering opening statements on assuming power. Trump vowed on Monday that the US would take back the Panama Canal, claiming falsely that the waterway was now operated by China. “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back,” Trump said. China does not control or administer the canal, but Hong Kong’s Hutchison Ports has managed two ports located near the canal’s Caribbean and Pacific entrances. In the wake of Trump’s speech yesterday, Panamanian authorities said they have initiated an audit of Hutchison Ports. Panama’s president Jose Raul Mulino responded on X stating the canal “is and will continue to be Panamanian.” In Monday’s speech, Trump also repeated his promise to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America while later on in the day Trump also signed an order to withdraw the US from the United Nations’ Paris climate agreement, something that augurs poorly for impending green discussions at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) where a global carbon levy on shipping is expected to be discussed in April."

The new round of sanctions, set to be adopted next week, will mark the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It will also include a Russian aluminium import ban, restrictions on Russian banks, measures to strengthen the G7 oil price cap, and new export bans. “The EU is clamping down even harder on circumvention by targeting more vessels in Putin’s shadow fleet and imposing new import and export bans. We are committed to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X. The move on the latest EU sanctions comes after US President Donald Trump’s administration agreed to hold more talks with Russia on ending the war in Ukraine after an initial meeting in Saudi Arabia that excluded Kyiv and its European supporters with US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, suggesting any peace deal will come with relaxation of sanctions."

        "content": "Shipping nuclear propulsion start-up CORE POWER has announced that it will develop a US-anchored maritime civil nuclear program that will bring floating nuclear power to the market by the mid-2030s. The program, named Liberty, will encompass modular construction of advanced fission technology and create the regulatory and supply chain frameworks necessary to enable this technology to be rolled out worldwide. The first part of the program will see the mass production of floating nuclear power plants (FNPPs). The expertise gained in rolling out FNPPs on a large be a starting point for the second part of the program which involves developing nuclear propulsion for civil ships. FNPPs will be produced in shipyards on a modular production line, making use of well-established shipbuilding processes and leveraging an already skilled workforce. They will be manufactured as power barges that can be moored at ports and coastal locations, as well as larger-capacity generation units anchored further offshore. A fleet of FNPPs can be mass-produced and towed to customer locations without complex site preparations, while a central yard carries out commissioning, maintenance, refuelling, and waste management. The program envisions opening the orderbook for FNPPs in 2028 and reaching full commercialisation by the middle of the next decade. Unlike conventional nuclear technologies, these reactors operate at near atmospheric pressures – negating the need for a large emergency exclusion zone and improving the insurability of FNPPs and nuclear-powered commercial ships. Nuclear technology would also enable a ship to run on a single fuel load for its entire design life while minimising the amount of waste produced. According to CORE POWER, nuclear-propelled ships will also provide improvements in speed, efficiency, and cargo-carrying capacity. The second phase will focus on developing the supply chain and workforce while the third phase will see the development of business operations models and the creation of the manufacturing base. CORE POWER will also look to work together with the IMO and the International Atomic Energy Authority to create a civil liability convention for nuclear-powered ships. “The Liberty program will unlock a floating power market worth $2.6tn, and shipyard construction of nuclear will deliver on time and budget. Given that 65% of economic activity takes place on the coast, this will allow nuclear to reach new markets,” said CORE POWER CEO Mikal Bøe."

        "content": "The US is considering slapping huge fees on Chinese-built ships calling at its ports, while also clamping down on Chinese ownership of terminals on home soil. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has finally outlined the ways it feels Washington DC can fight back against the dominance China has in maritime, and particularly shipbuilding after a months-long investigation instigated by the Joe Biden administration. Now Biden’s successor at the White House, Donald Trump, must deliberate whether to enact what the USTR has suggested. The USTR calls for US port fees for Chinese-built ships of up to $1.5m for every call. The wording of the proposal could impact any ship operator that has even just one Chinese-built ship in its fleet or on order. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing commented: “The US measures will not only fail to revitalise its shipbuilding industry but will also raise shipping costs on related routes, exacerbate its domestic inflation, reduce the global competitiveness of US goods, and hurt the interests of its port operators and dockworkers.” If the intention is to drastically increase costs, this proposal is likely to do the job The US has been engaging with Korean and Japanese shipbuilders in a belated bid to bolster its faded shipbuilding sector, while one of Trump’s first acts back in power was to enact a blanket 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Other suggestions floated by the USTR to claw back some maritime control call for greater use of American-flagged ships. The trade office is calling for 1% of US export products to be moved on US-flagged vessels by US operators, increasing this figure to 5% within three years, and 15% by year seven. “If the intention is to drastically increase costs for US importers and make US exports uncompetitive, this proposal is likely to do the job,” commented Lars Jensen, the head of container advisory Vespucci Maritime, via LinkedIn. The president will now have to decide whether to carry out the USTR’s recommendations. Another White House executive order filed last week could see Chinese investment in American ports come to an end. The new America First Investment Policy published by the Trump administration states that US should not allow China to take over US critical infrastructure, including shipping terminals. China’s state-run COSCO, the world’s largest shipping company, has port interests in Long Beach via its subsidiary OOCL. Last month, in the last couple of weeks of the Biden administration, COSCO, was among a host of Chinese shipping-related names added to a list of companies the US Department of Defense views as having links to the People’s Liberation Army. While being on the Pentagon’s blacklist carries no specific penalties, it discourages US firms from dealing with these companies that Washington views as military entities."

The $1.4bn export terminal will be known as Texas City Logistics and ONEOK and MPLX will each own a 50% interest in the joint venture. MPLX will build and operate the facility, with construction expected to be completed in early 2028. “Given our high expectations for future growth and demand for more energy infrastructure, including export capacity, these projects with MPLX complement our disciplined capital allocation strategy,” said ONEOK’s president and CEO, Pierce Norton. On the new terminal, analysts at Jefferies suggested: “This would provide some excess capacity for US exports where current constraints are impacting pricing across the LPG value chain (including VLGC spot rate potential).” The US has averaged 1.9m barrels per day of LPG exports recently against terminal capacity of 2m barrels per day."

        "content": "Shipping has been warned that Somali pirates are back hunting for targets. British maritime security consultants Ambrey has issued a notice to clients detailing a suspected pirate action group sighted departing Marreya, Eyl, to the northeast of Somalia. Merchant vessels are advised to increase vigilance, and to engage armed security where possible if the vessel has a permissible freeboard. Yesterday the European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR) Operation ATALANTA reported that a Yemeni-flagged dhow was taken by pirates on Sunday. Then dhow is now likely being used by pirates as a mother ship to stage attacks on merchant vessels. Piracy was rampant off Somalia for a four-year period from 2008, but then it went dormant for about five years. From March last year, Somali pirates have been back in the headlines, abducting a number of vessels and their crews."

The company won a 600-day priced contract extension with TotalEnergies in the UK North Sea for the 2011-builtValaris Stavanger. The extension is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2025 in direct continuation of the current program. The total contract value for the priced extension is over $75m. Work under the initial contract with TotalEnergies started in May 2024 and will end in June 2025 when the extension will kick in. The 2001-builtValaris 249was awarded a 100-day contract with BP offshore Trinidad. The contract is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2026 in direct continuation of the rig’s previous program with another operator. The total contract value is approximately $16.8m. Following the BP deal, the rig will start work with Shell in June 2026. The deal is supposed to last for a year and end in June 2027. Shell has three priced options with an estimated duration of 50 days each. The 1998-builtValaris 247was awarded a one-well contract with Jadestone Energy offshore Australia. The contract will start in March 2025 in direct continuation of the rig’s current program with Eni. The deal with Eni started in December 2024 and will end in March 2025. The rig is working on a $180,000 dayrate. BP exercised a two-well priced option for the 2005-builtValaris 106in Indonesia. The option period has an estimated duration of 80 days and is expected to begin in May 2025 in direct continuation of the existing firm program the rig has been working on since January of last year. The operating day rate is $95,000. The company also agreed to short-term bareboat charter agreement extensions through February 28 for theValaris 116,Valaris 146, andValaris 250jackups, which are leased to ARO Drilling. Valaris and ARO are negotiating with Saudi Aramco regarding longer-term contract extensions for these rigs. The new contracts and contract extensions have an associated contract backlog of around $120m. The company’s total contract backlog decreased to around $3.6bn from approximately $4.1bn as of October 30, 2024. The backlog excludes lump sum payments such as mobilization fees and capital reimbursements. The offshore driller also decided to retire three semisubs from its fleet – theValaris DPS-5which has been idle since last working in the third quarter of 2024 as well as theValaris DPS-3andValaris DPS-6, which have been stacked for several years. The company stated that the rigs would either be repurposed for alternative uses outside the drilling sector or scrapped. Another rig left the Valaris fleet following a $24m sale. The 25-year-old jackupValaris 75which has been stacked in the US Gulf of Mexico for five years. As part of the purchase and sale agreement with an undisclosed client, future operations are restricted to the Gulf of Mexico. “We are committed to prudently managing our fleet and will retire or divest rigs when the expected future economic benefit for an asset does not justify its costs. Consistent with this approach, we have decided to high-grade our fleet by retiring three semi-submersibles for which we see limited attractive, long-term contract opportunities, as well as selling the Valaris 75. These actions reduce costs for idle rigs, benefit our cash flow and further focus our fleet on high-specification assets,” said Anton Dibowitz, president and CEO of Valaris."

Agents can negotiate competitive rates for port services, provide cost transparency, and streamline disbursements, he says. By coordinating essential services like bunker supply and crew changes, agents help minimise turnaround times and unnecessary expenses. “In an industry where every hour counts, a skilled agent significantly enhances shipowners’ operational efficiency and profitability,” Mølholt insists, a message he and his team will be trying to get across to delegates in Geneva in April as a sponsor of the trade summit. The team at Inchcape is especially looking forward to the brand new Digital Efficiency Drivers At Port session on Day Two of Geneva Dry where an expert panel will elaborate on what more can be done to ensure ships spend less time at port, discussing whether terminals are doing enough to drive efficiency across the dry bulk supply chain, as well as identifying which technologies are driving change. Mølholt says his dry bulk clients are prioritising a mix of local intelligence, competitive pricing, cost efficiency, operational transparency, and digitalisation. “Clients seek ways to optimise voyages and reduce unnecessary costs amidst market volatility and fluctuating freight rates. There is a growing demand for real-time data and digital tools that enhance visibility into port congestion, weather conditions, and ETA predictions,” the Inchcape executive says. Delegates attending Geneva Dry on April 28 and 29 can expect to get the full picture on dry bulk prospects, broken down into individual cargoes, with special sessions on coal, iron ore, agri-commodities, and minor bulks. Split into sectors, panels will bring together analysts, financiers, miners, traders and shipowners to discuss where the markets are headed.

        "content": "Pierre Aury has some advice for would-be shipping investors. An old topic for a new year. I’ve already made my opinion quite clear about the fact that shipping companies trading in competitive spot markets should not be listed. In this column, we will acknowledge how wrong it is that a number of these companies are listed and that investors are looking for the best way to select which of these companies to invest in. A number of investors are hard-bent on using the so-called price-to-net asset value (NAV) ratio. The rationale is simple and is that if the share price multiplied by the number of shares is below the NAV of a company then the shares of that company are a good purchase. I am of the opinion that relying heavily, or worse solely, on this metric is flawed. NAV represents the book value of a company’s assets minus its liabilities. It is by definition a static and backward-looking metric. It is looking at a company from a breaking-it-up point of view as it fails to account for forward-looking factors such as market trends, revenue growth potential, or upcoming changes in asset values. For instance, in shipping, where asset values can fluctuate dramatically due to market conditions, NAV will not give any clue regarding future economic developments. A shipping company with a ‘great’ P/NAV ratio might look undervalued but if freight rates are in a long-lasting downturn, its fleet’s market value could deteriorate rapidly, rendering the use of the P/NAV ratio misleading. The share price of a given company can be discounted to its NAV all the way down leading to a big loss in the end. NAV is impacted by accounting policies. Valuation of vessels often involves assumptions, estimates or models. Companies might overstate their asset values creating an inflated NAV that leads to misleading P/NAV ratios. The P/NAV ratio provides no insight into a company’s profitability or cash flow generation capacity. A low P/NAV could signal undervaluation, but if the company consistently underperforms the discount could be justified. Market sentiment can create a disconnect between share price and NAV. A low P/NAV could indicate investors’ concerns about governance, liquidity or market conditions. Illiquid stocks often trade at steep discounts to NAV due to the lack of buyers, even when fundamentals are sound and most shipping stocks compared to stocks in other markets, are illiquid. NAV calculations often fail to fully account for financial risk. Some companies with significant leverage might show an attractive P/NAV ratio, but their debt levels can pose substantial risks, especially in volatile markets like shipping. Investors focusing solely on P/NAV might miss these underlying potential problems. NAV being essentially backward looking will not account for strategic elements like potential mergers, acquisitions, or synergies. A company’s true value might come from its market position or competitive advantage, which are not captured in NAV. The P/NAV ratio fails to consider these qualitative factors that could significantly influence long-term valuation. But the main problem is that using the P/NAV ratio implies that the price of the shares of a shipping company is driven by shipping which is only partly true. The share price of a company is driven by the overall world financial market, the local financial market where the shares are listed, the market in which the company operates and the specific circumstances of that shipping company. Would-be investors in shipping should use this P/NAV metric in conjunction with other valuation tools, such as price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, discounted cash flow (DCF) models, and qualitative analysis of market trends and competitive positioning."

        "content": "More nations – including Denmark, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – are sending naval assets towards the Middle East as pressure grows on the Houthis to rein in their attacks on merchant shipping in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Of concern, however, are a trio of Iranian naval ships that have started patrolling the area. The Houthis from Yemen have been waging a campaign to target Israeli-linked vessels in the wake of the war breaking out between Israel and Hamas three months ago. In total, some 25 ships have been targeted in the past couple of months with drones and missiles, and one car carrier and its crew remain in Yemeni waters having been hijacked in November. US secretary of state Antony Blinken reiterated yesterday that Houthi militants in Yemen must know they will face “consequences” for continued attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Monday marked a rare day where there were no confirmed attacks on merchant ships in the region, with just one suspicious approach reported. Over the weekend, the number of transits through the Suez Canal fell to the lowest since the waterway was blocked by the Ever Given containership in early 2021, according to Inchcape Shipping Services. “These attacks are having a real effect on the prices that people have to pay for food, for medicine, for energy. Ships have to get diverted to other places. Insurance rates go up,” Blinken said while on another whistlestop tour of the Middle East yesterday. “And the basic principle of freedom of navigation is what’s at stake. So the international community has a real stake in upholding that principle.” Most containerlines have re-routed their vessels from the Red Sea to longer voyages around the Cape of Good Hope adding up to two weeks of delay. By contrast, tanker and dry bulk diversions have been minimal until very recently. According to HSBC, the liner diversions have pushed spot rates on the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) to all-time highs, outside of the covid era. “Should the crisis remain unresolved in the next couple of weeks, elevated spot rates could lead to higher contract rates as liners are negotiating their annual contracts with retailers. This could potentially help prevent the sector profits from declining too much vs the expectations before the disruptions,” a new shipping report from HSBC argued, while analysts at Linerlytica have charted what carriers are up to in terms of choosing to divert or not. While in the early stages of the Red Sea shipping crisis, dry bulk and tankers remained largely unaffected this is now changing. Over the past week, the numbers of panamax and geared bulkers entering the South Atlantic from the North Atlantic has jumped according to new analysis from brokers Braemar, signalling some avoidance of the Red Sea. Braemar had detected a similar pattern for larger capesize ships a week ago. For tankers, analysis from Vortexa shows diversions have picked up in the span of the last two weeks, but these are not occurring en masse as tankers and volumes continue to flow via the Red Sea. Instead, these diversions are at large constrained to US/EU/Israel-linked entities."

In the six years – and 73 monthly reviews neatly composed – I can confidently say we’ve never compiled a more action-packed snapshot of the shipping headlines than this issue, the trending news items bringing to mind once again comments made by Graham Porter at a session I moderated last October at our Monaco Maritime CEO Forum. “The world is breaking apart. I think that’s what’s causing all this chaos. We’re on a very different trend. It’s no longer collaboration, it’s independent pull. Pull your resources and hold them yourself,” said Porter, the chairman of Tiger Group Investments, and one of the co-founders of Seaspan, a line of thought that seems all the more prescient when skimming through all the news this month, what with reelected Donald Trump making claims for the Panama Canal, Greenland and Canada and US authorities going after the likes of COSCO and China’s shipyards, while Europe and Taiwan have had to fend off a growing armada of anchor-dragging, cable-cutting merchant ships. “I’ve rarely seen a year start with more uncertainty. Buckle up and enjoy the ride,” one seasoned shipowner told us last week. If January is anything to go by, 2025 promises to be more mad than last year to cover as a shipping reporter.

However, the current sandblasting method, which removes rust and coatings by blasting abrasive materials against the surface, scatters waste materials and removed paint as debris, necessitating recovery efforts,” MOL explained in a release. By replacing sandblasting with a laser blasting method that generates minimal waste, dust, and noise, MOL expects to reduce environmental impact and improve occupational health. MOL said it aims to make the use of laser blasting more common place going forward, also touting the system’s robot, saving labour costs."

The Stig Remøy-led offshore vessel owner said the vessel will be the most energy-efficient in their category and delivered in the summer of 2027 for operations in both renewable energy and oil and gas sectors. No price has been divulged, but Olympic noted that the project would generate contracts worth approximately NOK1bn ($89.3m) for Norwegian businesses, including NOK700m for the maritime cluster in Northwestern Norway. The ships will feature the Kongsberg Maritime UT7623 SEV (sustainable energy vessel) design and “exceed the requirements of the Paris Agreement by a significant margin”. “Olympic has taken a leading role in the transition to environmentally and climate-friendly vessels, and this marks a new milestone in that journey. These vessels will set a new standard for energy consumption and leave an extremely low climate footprint,” said Remøy, Olympic’s majority owner. The company said the fleet expansion move comes on the back of its strong financial performance, with fleet revenue for 2024 expected to reach NOK1.6bn—more than double the 2023 numbers. In 2022, Olympic ordered two methanol-ready offshore wind construction service operation vessels (CSOVs) from compatriot shipbuilderUlstein, which were delivered in July and November 2024 and go underOlympic BoreasandOlympic Notos, respectively."

        "content": "San Marino, Guyana, Sierra Leone, Comoro Islands, Guinea Bissau and most notably Guinea are the flag states that stand out for their extraordinary fleet growth in the latest data compiled in Clarksons Research’s World Fleet Monitor, statistics that highlight the whack-a-mole game authorities in the West are having to fight in their bid to crack down on the growing shadow fleet. San Marino’s growth will likely raise questions within European circles – its fleet growing by 663% over the past 12 months to 1.1m gt. Guyana in South America has also been making headlines in recent months, its fleet growing by 576% in the past year to 3.3m gt. The fleet is also notable for its average age, standing above 40 years old. It is in Africa, however, where flag states have mushroomed the most in step with the growth of the shadow fleet – Sierre Leone up by 105%, the Comoro Islands by 104%, Guinea Bissau leaping by 340%, and most extraordinary of all, Guinea’s flag state growing by 99,094% over the past 12 months. Another flag that has been in the news a great deal for its shadow fleet links, Barbados, saw its fleet grow by 177% in the past year, according to Clarksons data. Under pressure, the London-headquartered Barbados ship registry has said that by the end of January it will have asked a total of 46 ships to remove the country’s flag as a result of UK sanctions. The number of vessels hit by sanctions surpassed 1,000 late last year with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showing that more 800 of these ships do not have confirmed insurance. Moreover, the average age of sanctioned ships – 21 years – is some eight years older than the global average, adding to growing concern that the sprawling so-called shadow fleet could lead to multiple costly environmental catastrophes. Despite slowing, the grey fleet is still growing by around 10 tankers a month, according to brokers BRS. Nearly two in three vintage tankers carried Iranian, Venezuelan, or Russian cargoes last year, according to estimates from broker Gibson. Global insurer Allianz’s 2024 shipping report noted of the shadow fleet: “Despite efforts to crack down on these vessels, the number of tankers is actually increasing, and we have seen a number of groundings and collision incidents.” In recent weeks the UK has teamed up with a number of north European neighbours to challenge the insurance coverage of vessels heading from Russia through the Baltic and along the English Channel. Today, some 175 tankers laden with Russian oil transit the Baltic each month, according to Craig Kennedy who runs the Navigating Russia substack and proposed similar Baltic insurance checks in a paper for the Brookings Institution in May last year. If the insurance verification program is successful in the Baltic, Kennedy has suggested setting up a similar one in the Aegean. “Together with the Baltic, this would deny Russia the ability to load up to 80% of its oil exports on shadow tankers. Instead, Russia would be compelled to use mainstream tankers, thus increasing the exposure of export revenues to price cap constraints,” Kennedy wrote."

        "content": "China’s remarkable thirst for bauxite to manufacture aluminium has helped prop up cape rates considerably in recent years. Now for the first time, the capesize fleet is carrying more bauxite than coal, according to broker Arrow. “Volumes from Guinea have surged at the start of the year, whilst panamaxes have been cannibalising capesize coal cargoes. This leaves bauxite as the number two capesize commodity, after iron ore,” Arrow stated in a report. China imported 159m tonnes of bauxite last year, up by 18m tonnes over 2023’s total, with 77% of all shipments carried out on capes, according to AXS data. Volumes from Guinea have surged, whilst panamaxes have been cannibalising capesize coal cargoes “This owes not just to Guinea’s emergence as the world’s dominant supplier of the raw material, but also the rising capesize share of Australian bauxite trades in recent years, quadrupling from 2021 to reach 20% last year,” explains a new report from another broker, Braemar. “Infrastructure improvements in West Africa, led by Guinea and including Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and Ghana, are expected to drive further increases in supply for the seaborne market, and especially supply for China,” predicts rival broker BRS who is forecasting exports of the mined product from West Africa to China to increase by another 20m tonnes this year. “Beijing’s continuous promotion of the ‘New Three’ (namely electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and solar panels) is significantly boosting the demand for aluminium products,” BRS pointed out in its latest weekly dry bulk report. “Considering the longer voyage distances, the bauxite market is expected to exert an increasing influence on the capesize segment via heightened volatility in the fronthaul route,” BRS concluded. The remarkable rise of the seaborne bauxite trades will be one of many discussion points atGeneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping event, which is set to reconvene at the Hotel President Wilson on the shore of Lake Geneva on April 28 and 29 this year."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Julian Panter, the CEO of SmartSea, on why maritime must embrace digital transformation to stay afloat in the 21st century. The maritime industry is under threat of long-term risks such as operational inefficiencies and regulatory non-compliance due to some companies clinging to outdated and legacy practices. A rapidly evolving technological landscape presents unprecedented opportunities as well as challenges for the maritime industry. While some companies are actively adopting digital solutions, many still remain hesitant to use newer and innovative technologies that have the potential to completely reshape operations. Companies can also be slow to invest in new opportunities because they can struggle to see the overall picture past the initial investment cost. A study by McKinsey & Company* last year estimated that global shipping companies could reduce operational costs by as much as 15-25% through the implementation of digital technologies. While the initial investment in digital technologies may seem substantial, not just in terms of cost but also implementation, the long-term savings are undeniable. The air transport industry is estimated to be 10 to 15 years ahead in terms of technology adoption For example, digitalisation streamlines complex maritime operations by automating manual processes and enabling real-time data analysis. Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain are facilitating better fleet management, route optimisation, and cargo tracking. Companies like OneLink, for example, are already helping numerous vessels with state-of-the-art shipping monitoring support services and security solutions. Predictive analytics can also forecast maintenance needs, reducing downtime and costs associated with unexpected equipment failures. Smart sensors on vessels provide real-time data about engine performance, fuel consumption, and weather conditions, allowing operators to make informed decisions that save time and resources. Additionally, AI-driven voyage optimisation leverages real-time data and machine learning to determine the most efficient routes, factoring in variables like weather patterns, sea currents, and port congestion, further enhancing operational efficiency. At SmartSea we are seeing more and more need for further collaboration and a unified approached with it comes to digitalisation. We are focussed on learning lessons that were made through our parent company SITA in the aviation industry. We are transforming the maritime digital ecosystem through the development of our integrated maritime management platform, utilising the same technology used by SITA in aviation. Maritime is light years behind the aviation industry, and we really must not shy away from data sharing and sharing best practices to progress. Digital transformation of the industry also has the potential to enhance workforce productivity and safety. By using tools like AI-driven voyage optimisation this not only minimises wastage and resource, it could also attract the seafarers of tomorrow, making the industry more appealing to a younger, technology-driven talent. Added to this, the maritime industry is facing increasingly stringent environmental and safety regulations, such as the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) 2023 guidelines for carbon intensity reduction. With the recent Fuel EU regulations now being implemented, advanced emissions monitoring systems, such as EmissionLink, can track and report their findings in real-time, helping companies comply with environmental standards. By resisting the advances in adopting a digital approach, companies could face some severe legal and financial liabilities. If this wasn’t proof enough of the value of integrating digital solutions to their business, companies that fail to integrate also risk losing vital market share to competitors. Early adopters of digital transformation are already reaping the benefits of improved operational efficiency, enhanced decision-making, and better customer experiences. Digitalised fleets and smart ports also outperform traditional systems in terms of cost, efficiency, and reliability. The path to digital transformation is not without its challenges. It requires significant investment, a cultural shift within organisations, and a willingness to embrace change. However, the risks of not transforming far outweigh the costs of doing so. Collaboration with technology providers, such as SmartSea, as well as industry stakeholders and regulators should help accelerate the adoption of digital solutions. But this must be a collaborative effort. The maritime industry really must embrace digital transformation to remain competitive and sustainable. SmartSea is powered by SITA, the global leader in technology for the air transport industry. We are passionate about boosting digital innovation in a sector that can be greatly enhanced by solutions for the air transport industry, which is estimated to be 10-15 years ahead in terms of technology adoption. As such, the benefits of digital innovation are too significant to ignore."

No ships have been attacked this year, with the Houthis saying they will step back so long as Israel’s war with Hamas ends – a truce that is now increasingly looking in trouble. Israel’s security cabinet has supported president Donald Trump’s demand for all remaining Israeli hostages to be returned on Saturday Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered troops to amass inside and around Gaza in response to Hamas’s announcement that it was postponing freeing more hostages until further notice. The ceasefire was already under stress after Trump called last week for Gazans to be evicted from their territory and for the US to take over the area and redevelop it as the “Riviera of the Middle East”. In response to the increasing tension in and around Gaza, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, the Houthi leader, said in a televised speech yesterday: “Our hands are on the trigger and we are ready to immediately escalate against the Israeli enemy if it returns to escalation in the Gaza Strip.” While there haven’t been any incidents since the rebel group announced a truce last month, the number of vessels sailing through the Gulf of Aden remains unchanged, according to the Joint Maritime Information Cente. Major shipowners, especially containerlines, have remained cautious about returning to the Red Sea. In support of Hamas, the Houthis initiated a campaign against merchant ships passing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, targeting more than 100 ships since November 2023, leading to a major rerouting for most ships heading between Asia and Europe."

        "content": "Japanese information and telecommunication expert OKI has developed a ship classification AI system technology which automatically classifies ship types through deep learning of underwater sounds. This technology makes it possible to continuously and automatically acquire ship classification data, even in environments such as busy ports with high ship traffic and at night, when visual identification using cameras is difficult. Internal verification experiments by OKI have demonstrated that the system can classify ships with 90% or better accuracy, even with only small amounts of learning data extracted from ship sound data. Drawing on its long history of research into underwater acoustic products, the company has developed systems that analyze the characteristics of sounds received by underwater microphones. The newly developed technology uses AI deep learning to automatically classify ships based on their underwater sounds. This system technology creates deep learning models from sounds recorded by underwater microphones installed in the sea, then automatically classifies ships based on their frequency characteristics. This allows the classification of ships without relying on human skill levels. Since it requires less human labour than before, it can also address the growing labour-saving demand in recent years. Deep learning models typically require large amounts of learning data to accurately identify sound types. However, the amount of publicly available underwater sound data is limited. This is solved by data augmentation which artificially creates variations for actual ship sound data, and semi-supervised learning, which trains the model using ship sound information from partial data. This way OKI’s solution enables classification through the use of only small amounts of learning data. “Going forward, we will seek co-creation partners to gather field data and conduct practical verification with a view to commercializing this technology,” said Yoichi Kato, senior executive officer of OKI."

The biggest sanctions package against Russia’s shadow fleet brings the total number of oil tankers sanctioned by the UK to 133—more than any other European nation. Publishing details of the sanctions, Britain said the ships being targeted had transported more than $5bn worth of Russian oil and oil products in the last six months alone. Last November, in what is now the UK’s second-largest campaign against the shadow fleet, 30 ships were blacklisted, followed by another 20in December. “The new sanctions will put further pressure on Putin’s energy revenues, the most vital source of funding for his illegal invasion,” Britain’s Foreign Office said. Earlier on Monday, theEuropean Unionadopted its 16th package of sanctions against Russia, with 74 new vessels added to the sanctions list, bringing the total to 153. In January, the US announced amassive sanctions actioncovering 183 Russian-controlled and shadow fleet ships, the largest to date."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Shipmanagers have expressed concerns in connection with the International Maritime Organization’s future net-zero framework and have suggested changes which they believe would make the proposals more effective. Acting on behalf of the global shipmanagement sector, InterManager, the international association for shipmanagers, has submitted a proposal to the next meeting of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC83) to suggest changes. The submission warns that, in its current form, the greenhouse gas (GHG) proposal doesn’t properly account for the involvement of a third-party International Safety Management (ISM) Manager. Highlighting that roughly 20% of the global fleet is operated by a third-party technical shipmanager as the ISM Manager, the submission asserts the need for further refining to make it applicable in practice and to avoid future national implementing acts being open to inevitable and avoidable litigation by shipmanagers. “In comparison to the charterer and shipowner, the shipmanager has no material influence over the GHG intensity of a ship. Shipmanagers have no say regarding the type of engine powering the managed ship, nor whether sails, solar, fuel cells or other installations are installed onboard. Such choices are decided exclusively by the shipowner,” InterManager explained in a release. “Ship managers are not consulted and, in addition, have no influence as to which fuels are procured and supplied to any of the managed ships, neither contractually nor in practice. The matter is negotiated between the shipowner and the charterer and agreed in the charter party agreement for the ship, together with speed and consumption, the remaining significant parameters impacting on its GHG intensity,” the submission states. However, the current proposed draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI on the IMO net-zero framework suggest making shipmanagers the sole responsible entity for penalties related to GHG emissions. InterManager maintains this clearly misidentifies the shipmanager as the polluter to be held responsible and penalised which could lead to legal challenges. Further, by assigning liability for compliance fees to the shipmanager, they in turn, are forced to ask shipowners to provide upfront financial security to cover potential risks of insolvency or defaults. This forces significant amounts of equity to be tied up in security, limiting cash flow available for growth or investment in new ships. InterManager president Sebastian von Hardenberg (pictured) commented: “We shipmanagers are fully committed to playing our part in shipping’s journey to net zero. However, when it comes to the GHG intensity of a ship, ship managers have no say whatsoever in any of the decisions that result in material impact; they are not even consulted. In shore terms, we are the facility managers, not the factory owners.”"

        "content": "Brazil’s state-owned oil and gas giant Petrobras has cancelled a tender for chartering an FPSO for the Barracuda-Caratinga revitalization project. Initially, Petrobras started the contracting process for the FPSO back in the summer of 2023 but it suffered several setbacks and postponements due to a lack of sufficient interest from floater owners. The company required a unit capable of producing 100,000 bpd of oil and 6 mscfd. One of the main reasons behind Petrobras’ issues and the lack of participation from companies in FPSO tenders was the Brazilian firm’s tendency to use the lease-and-operate format which made the usual participants in these tenders look elsewhere. However, one floater specialist did eventually submit an offer in the autumn of 2024. India’s Shapoorji Pallonji Energy was the only company to submit a proposal for the FPSO, marking the first time an Indian company participated in a Petrobras bidding competition. Shapoorji’s offer, even though it was the only one, was considered too high by Petrobras. The Indian firm requested a daily rate of submitted an offer of a daily rate of $1.636m. As a result, the company revoked the tender and stated that it had done so “based on uncontrollable supervenient fact, which alters the economic viability of the project in the current contract model”. The Brazilian giant is now preparing a new tender by year-end which will be done under the build-operate-transfer model which should, in theory, attract more companies. Under this model, the builder of the FPSO will operate the unit for several years after which the ownership will be taken over by Petrobras. This model will also be used for the two Sergipe-Alagoas FPSOs and the Albacora field revitalization project. According to Petrobras’ 2025-29 business plan, the FPSO for the Barracuda-Caratinga revitalization project should start operations in 2029."

        "content": "The US is considering slapping huge fees on Chinese-built ships calling at its ports, while also clamping down on Chinese ownership of terminals on home soil. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has finally outlined the ways it feels Washington DC can fight back against the dominance China has in maritime, and particularly shipbuilding after a months-long investigation instigated by the Joe Biden administration. Now Biden’s successor at the White House, Donald Trump, must deliberate whether to enact what the USTR has suggested. The USTR calls for US port fees for Chinese-built ships of up to $1.5m for every call. The wording of the proposal could impact any ship operator that has even just one Chinese-built ship in its fleet or on order. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing commented: “The US measures will not only fail to revitalise its shipbuilding industry but will also raise shipping costs on related routes, exacerbate its domestic inflation, reduce the global competitiveness of US goods, and hurt the interests of its port operators and dockworkers.” If the intention is to drastically increase costs, this proposal is likely to do the job The US has been engaging with Korean and Japanese shipbuilders in a belated bid to bolster its faded shipbuilding sector, while one of Trump’s first acts back in power was to enact a blanket 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Other suggestions floated by the USTR to claw back some maritime control call for greater use of American-flagged ships. The trade office is calling for 1% of US export products to be moved on US-flagged vessels by US operators, increasing this figure to 5% within three years, and 15% by year seven. “If the intention is to drastically increase costs for US importers and make US exports uncompetitive, this proposal is likely to do the job,” commented Lars Jensen, the head of container advisory Vespucci Maritime, via LinkedIn. The president will now have to decide whether to carry out the USTR’s recommendations. Another White House executive order filed last week could see Chinese investment in American ports come to an end. The new America First Investment Policy published by the Trump administration states that US should not allow China to take over US critical infrastructure, including shipping terminals. China’s state-run COSCO, the world’s largest shipping company, has port interests in Long Beach via its subsidiary OOCL. Last month, in the last couple of weeks of the Biden administration, COSCO, was among a host of Chinese shipping-related names added to a list of companies the US Department of Defense views as having links to the People’s Liberation Army. While being on the Pentagon’s blacklist carries no specific penalties, it discourages US firms from dealing with these companies that Washington views as military entities."

Indonesia’s Attorney-General’s Office named Yoki as one of seven suspects, four of whom were officials of Pertamina subsidiaries. The suspects were accused of manipulating the domestic refinery oil production policy and forcing refiners to import crude from abroad. Pertamina is legally required to source crude from domestic suppliers before relying on imports. However, between 2018 and 2023, the accused allegedly conspired to claim that crude oil supplied by Indonesian producers did not meet Kilang Pertamina refinery’s standards. Abdul Qohar, director of special crimes at the Attorney General’s office, told reporters that the specifications did in fact match and that the crude oil produced by contractors was exported instead. Yoki allegedly facilitated imports with inflated prices, resulting in the state paying 13 to 15% more than the actual cost, benefiting brokers who are also accused of profiting illegally from the shipments. The scheme caused the state losses of about $12bn, the prosecutor said. Yoki has led the shipping arm of Indonesia’s top energy producer since September 2022.

        "content": "The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed sanctions on more than 30 persons and vessels in multiple jurisdictions for their role in brokering the sale and transportation of Iranian petroleum-related products, the latest in a series of measures the new Donald Trump administration is taking in its so-called maximum pressure campaign against the Middle East nation. Among those sanctioned yesterday are oil brokers in the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, tanker operators and mangers in India and China, the head of Iran’s National Iranian Oil Company, and the Iranian Oil Terminals Company, as well as 13 vessels. “Iran continues to rely on a shadowy network of vessels, shippers, and brokers to facilitate its oil sales and fund its destabilising activities,” said secretary of the treasury Scott Bessent. “The United States will use all our available tools to target all aspects of Iran’s oil supply chain, and anyone who deals in Iranian oil exposes themselves to significant sanctions risk.” Yesterday’s action is the second round of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales since Trump returned to power last month. “Individuals and entities in or adjacent to the shipping industry should ensure that their sanctions and export control policies and procedures are robust and ready to react and adapt to the invigorated enforcement environment,” law firm Seward & Kissel advised in a recent Iran advisory to clients. Increased sanctions on tankers used to move Iranian oil should boost demand for compliant VLCCs, possibly at the same time as VLCCs return to moving Atlantic basin crude into India to replace lost Russian barrels, analysts at broker Braemar suggested. This could ease competition for suezmax cargoes, Braemar said, thereby softening the blow of any potential loss of long-haul Russian business."

The ship was designed in collaboration with Norway’s Ulstein and will be equipped with a DP2 system and be 120 m long and 23 m wide. It will have a cargo capacity of 8,000 dwt. Operations are expected to begin in mid-2027."

        "content": "Shipping is reeling from what could be the most seismic decision to effect the industry yet in the opening weeks of Donald Trump’s second term in office. The American president will make a decision, likely in around a month’s time, on whether to carry out suggestions made by the office of the US Trade Representative following an investigation carried out over the past year into China’s growing dominance in maritime, especially in the realm of shipbuilding. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements with March 24 set as the deadline for public comments to be made after which the president will make his decision. The majority of ocean-going ships would pay the maximum port fee given their net tonnages, according to analysis by Jefferies, an investment bank. “These fees would likely require re-organizing fleet patterns and make US calls more lucrative on a freight rate basis, which operators would aim to pass on,” a note from Jefferies stated. We might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance The most affected sector is likely containerships given their multiple port calls. A $1.5m fee spread against the average 10,000 teu ship calling in the US would equate to $150 per teu or $300 per feu, according to Jefferies calculationsw, taking today’s China-Los Angeles rate quotes up from $3,000per feu to $3,300 per feu. A VLCC cargo from the US Gulf to China costs $8.3m in today’s market or $4.20 per barrel, but that would rise to $4.95 per barrel including a $1.5m fee according to Jefferies. Were Trump to approve of the USTR measures, Dutch bank ING said the ripple effects will impact global supply chains, investor confidence, and international relations, creating even more uncertainty further on, as businesses grapple with enduring low arrival reliability with potential new disruptions and increased costs. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of just 1%. The US has been engaging with Korean and Japanese shipbuilders in a belated bid to bolster its faded shipbuilding sector, while one of Trump’s first acts back in power was to enact a blanket 10% tariff on Chinese imports. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing commented on the USTR’s recommendations: “The US measures will not only fail to revitalise its shipbuilding industry but will also raise shipping costs on related routes, exacerbate its domestic inflation, reduce the global competitiveness of US goods, and hurt the interests of its port operators and dockworkers.” In the five weeks since Trump has returned to the White House he has upended world trade with tariffs, a push for peace in Ukraine, a renewed ‘maximum pressure’ strategy on Iran, and the creation of a National Energy Dominance Council among many measures taken. For shipping, carrying out the USTR’s recommendations – a very popular move with American unions – could prove to be the most dramatic ruling yet. “As the Trump 2.0 reality show unfolds, as it does daily, often with singular market-moving tweets, we might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance across shipping sectors. Underwhelming spot earnings render shipping sentiment downbeat while we seek greater clarity on today’s geopolitical, trade and social threats,” noted a recent report from broker Hartland Shipping."

        "content": "French energy major EDF has written down $940m in the value of its stake in the Atlantic Shores wind energy project off New Jersey after its former partner in the project, Shell, did the same last month. This is another hit for the offshore wind industry in the US which is reeling following president Donald Trump’sfreezeof all offshore wind leasing on the country’s outer continental shelf. New Jersey has probably taken the brunt of these new policies and the Atlantic Shores project is a prime example of it. Shell abandoned its involvement in the 1,510MW project in January and took a nearly $1b write-down on the project. At the time, EDF said it would be pushing forward with the already permitted project. However, more bad luck for EDF and its project was on its way. Earlier this month, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilitiespulled the plugon the state’s fourth offshore wind solicitation. This was due to two of the three initial bidders withdrawing from the solicitation and Atlantic Shores remaining as the sole bidder. New Jersey approved three offshore wind developments which were supposed to be part of the solicitation round – Atlantic Shores southern project, Attentive Energy Two, and Leading Light Wind. There used to be four projects but Ørsted cancelled its Ocean Wind project in 2023 citing increased costs of development. Atlantic Shores also proposed a second ‘northern’ project but was declined by the NJ Board. Trump has placed a target on the EDF-led project with his speeches from last year and showed his disdain for the project during speeches at Mar-a-Lago. The project was not safe from the president even on social media. Another company to announce write-offs in 2024 was Eversource Energy which took a hit of around $1.6bn relating to three of its wind projects – South Fork Wind, Revolution Wind, and Sunrise Wind."

        "content": "The Panama Canal board of directors has approved funding for the construction of a new lake in the middle course of the Indio river watershed, a massive project designed to help ensure the waterway can combat droughts. For much of 2023 and last year, the canal was forced to slash transits and maximum drafts as Panama endured its worst drought on record forcing a shift in global seaborne trading patterns that have yet to fully correct. Work on the $1.2bn project, which includes a huge dam, is slated to begin in 2027 and take four years to complete. A reservoir will be built with capacity for 1.5bn cu m in the Indio river basin and an 8.7 km transfer tunnel, which would go from there to the Panama Canal basin, with the aim of strengthening the freshwater supply capacity of the two artificial lakes that feed the waterway, Gatún and Alajuela. Between June 2023 and September 2024, transits through the Panama Canal were restricted due to low water levels in the Gatun Lake. There were restrictions to both the total number of transits and ship draft, and ships competed for limited transit slots. Despite getting back to normal operations by Q4 last year, shipping volumes have yet to fully recover. Between September 2024 and January 2025, ship capacity in deadweight tonnes transiting through the Panama Canal was 10% lower than the 2019-22 average, according to analysis by BIMCO. “Although there were no transit restrictions during this period, transits of dry bulk, LNG and, to a lesser extent, tanker ships have not recovered to their historical levels,” said Filipe Gouveia, shipping analysis manager at BIMCO. “Transit fees, changes in trade patterns and the establishment of a new normal could all be keeping ships from fully returning to the canal,” he added."

        "content": "UK consulting and engineering firm Wood has responded to recent media speculation regarding an approach from Dubai-based company Sidara for a possible offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the company. Wood confirmed the reports on Tuesday and directed its shareholders to take no action concerning the proposal. The company also stated that there was no certainty that the offer would be made nor did it disclose any terms of a potential offer. Dar Al-Handasah Consultants Shair and Partners, also known as Sidara, is now required to announce a firm intention to make an offer for the company by March 24 or to state that it would not be making any offer. Sidara sent four takeover bids to Wood in 2024. Thefourth bid, which was at the time described as “final”, was sent to the UK firm in late May 2024. The cash offer of 230 pence per Wood share valued the company at around £1.58bn ($2bn). The first offer from the Dubai-based firm was for 205 per share and was sent on April 30, 2024. The following offer was a 3.4% improvement on the first while the third was a 3.8% improvement on the previous one. Wood believed that none of the offers were good enough and refused all four, stating that they significantly undervalued the company and its prospects. Before Sidara started making offers, US-listed private equity group Apollo offered to buy Wood five times, with the largest valuing the company at about $2.1bn. The US firm eventually withdrew from the acquisition in May 2023."

        "content": "The European Union has officially approved its 16th package of sanctions imposed against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while the UK came out today with its own series of measures designed to stymie the Russian war machine. The new measures, announced on the third anniversary of the all-out war, target Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers, banks, aluminum imports, and other sectors. “For three years now, Russia has relentlessly bombed Ukraine, attempting to steal land that isn’t theirs to take,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said in a statement. The resumption of short cuts and old trading patterns would cut the ton-mile multiplier While Europe remains steadfast in its support of Uklraine, across the Atlantic, the new Donald Trump administration is attempting to bring the war to an end with officials in Washington DC saying American sanctions against Russia could be eased as negotiations for a settlement progress. “This would have ramifications for vessel supply, as the resumption of short cuts and old trading patterns would cut the ton-mile multiplier. The status of the vast shadow tanker fleet would be called into question, with a possible gradual shift back to the compliant fleet leaving many elderly tankers sidelined and in search of employment, end of life care or termination,” analysts at broker Hartland Shipping suggested in their latest weekly report. “The resolution could improve efficiency in oil transportation by reducing reliance on costly alternative routes and shadow fleets, leading to lower logistics costs and enhanced market stability,” Signal Ocean maintained in a recent report. On dry bulk, analysis by BIMCO shows that over the past 12 months Ukraine has seen an 87% year-on-year jump in shipments, while Russia dry bulk volumes have taken a 6% year-on-year fall. The primary reason for Ukraine’s spike in shipments lie in the success of its coastal corridor. Since August 2023, Ukraine has exported dry bulk cargoes via a coastal corridor, and despite Russian attacks on ships in September and October 2023, this has proven to be an effective solution. Nonetheless, volumes remain 36% lower than before the war began. “Over the past 12 months, tonne mile demand from Ukrainian and Russian cargoes has increased 3% y/y combined. Unlike volumes, tonne mile demand was already higher than pre-war levels during the second year at war because sanctions on Russian coal increased sailing distances. The demand increase has primarily benefitted ships in the panamax and supramax segments, whereas capesize demand remains below pre-war levels,” commented Filipe Gouveia, shipping analysis manager at BIMCO."

        "content": "One of this month’s big talking points in tramp shipping has been the creation of a rival to the Clarksons-backed SEA platform, bringing into question the future of fixing. Five of the world’s leading shipbroking firms—Arrow, Gibson Shipbrokers, Howe Robinson, IFCHOR Galbraiths and SSY—have united to introduce Ocean Recap – a purpose-built recap and charter party management platform. Developed in partnership with Signal Ocean, Ocean Recap seeks to address what the brokers described in a release as “growing concerns of monopolisation” and data security in the recap and charter party space, in likely reference to the SEA platform which has come to dominate this field of tramp shipping. Tech firm Marcura is also a player in this segment, having established a charterparty administration platform 14 years ago, well before the creation of SEA. It seems that the conversation is shifting from the future of fixing to fixing the future Jeroen Wolthuis, CEO of Ocean Recap, said the new platform prioritises independence, security, and industry collaboration. “This is not just a service; it’s a commitment to preserving the integrity and privacy of our clients’ data while revolutionising how recaps and charter parties are managed. We invite brokers, charterers and owners to join us as early adopters and help shape the future of this critical industry,” Wolthuis said. Manu Ravano, co-CEO of IFCHOR Galbraiths, said his company’s involvement with Ocean Recap is about ensuring that there is choice in the market when it comes to the streamlining of the fixture process. “The past decade has seen a rush to digitalisation in the chartering space, with a wave of new platforms offering pre- and post-fixture services. Inevitably there has been consolidation and the risk is that one platform dominates,” Ravano told Splash Extra, adding: “Price of the service rendered, control of data and choice plurality are critical issues for any platform user in any market, and this is why we have acted.” “Doing something collectively like Ocean Recap is always positive, because if not in this case that means a monopoly has been created which is never good,” said Giuseppe Rosano, the founder of London broker Alibra Shipping. Pierre Aury, a shipping consultant who until the end of last year represented a number of companies in a shipbrokers association, said Ocean Recap was long overdue as the market has been seeking alternatives to SEA. “The main sales points regarding Ocean Recap are its independence and the fact that contrary to SEA it doesn’t claim ownership of the data uploaded on the platform,” Aury said “This is the latest in a litany of attempts to put chartering online,” commented Mark Williams, who runs consultancy Shipping Strategy. “Exchanges work great for cleared trading such as in stocks or currencies, when the exchange itself is the counterparty, but that cannot be the case for shipping. So for me, this system looks like a documentary tidy up, a welcome standardisation of charterparties and recaps – but of course, not a complete standardisation because not every broker is going to use it and there is no obligation to use it,” Williams said. “My guess is the five other brokerage houses that are getting together under the platform Ocean Recap will look at the Marcura suite of stand-alone processes, and keep adding the same to their platform, and competing with the two pioneers,” said Khalid Hashim, the managing director of Thai dry bulk concern Precious Shipping. Sarah Al Qahtani, commercial and operations manager at Saudi Arabian shipping giant Bahri, reacted to the Ocean Recap news favourably, tellingSplash Extra: “My initial reaction to this is that it seems that the conversation is shifting from the future of fixing to fixing the future. The recent collaboration among five leading shipbroking firms serves as a quintessential example of the collaboration and standardisation the industry urgently needs.” “As brokers continue to explore ways to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and respond to growing demands for digitalisation, platforms like these represent an important evolution in how the industry operates,” said Giannis Kazianis, treasurer at the Hellenic Shipbrokers Association (HSA). The future of fixing will be linked to further technological advancements, Kazianis said, suggesting this new platform may well be a catalyst for broader change. “We anticipate that more competitors will enter the sector, driven by the increasing need for innovation, improved transparency, and streamlined processes. As these platforms gain traction, they will likely alter how traditional chartering practices are approached, potentially leading to wholesale changes in how deals are brokered,” Kazianis suggested. HSA general secretary Dimitris Kittes stressed that ultimately there may be a trend towards consolidation, with a few dominant platforms emerging as industry standards. This would require a degree of interoperability and standardisation, allowing seamless data exchange between different systems. “Anything which makes the chartering process more efficient and transparent has to be a good thing and it’s not surprising that others have sought to follow the example of SEA as their concerns about monopolisation and data security can be justified,” said Tim Huxley, CEO of Hong Kong shipowner Mandarin Shipping. Huxley, a former broker with Clarksons, said he hoped that the use of all these new tools to manage fixtures does not lead to the disappearance of some of the fundamental skills of the shipbroker, of which the ability to draft a recap and charterparty and then interpret it in order to avoid later disputes are fundamental. “If those skills disappear, the only winners will be the lawyer,” Huxley warned, adding: “The quality of information that a shipbroker can provide and which assists their client in concluding a fixture will remain at the core of the shipbroking industry no matter what technological advances come about.” Huxley will be chairing the Chartering Spotlight session on April 28 atGeneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference, a panel discussion that will debate how brokers will evolve, and where the many platforms sit in terms of requirements with speakers from SEA, Arrow, Vale and Western Bulk all on stage."

The financial terms of the transaction are not disclosed. Flotation Energy will remain involved after the transaction as a development partner to the project. Morecambe is a 480MW fixed bottom offshore wind project located 30 km from the Lancashire coast in the Eastern Irish Sea. The project lease was secured in the UK Offshore Wind Leasing Round 4 in 2021, and consent applications have been submitted. ”CIP is very pleased to acquire Morecambe at an advanced stage of development and well placed to contribute to the UK’s Clean Power 2030 Action Plan,” said Nischal Agarwal, partner at CIP. The acquisition of Morecambe signals further growth for CIP’s UK renewables pipeline, which now stands at over 25GW, covering offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, BESS, and network infrastructure. With a pipeline of this scale, CIP looks forward to making a substantial contribution to the UK’s 2030 objective for energy infrastructure investment. In the UK, CIP has previously invested in the now operational 588MW Beatrice Offshore wind farm in Scotland and is currently developing the 100MW Pentland and the 3.6GW Ossian floating wind farm, also located in Scotland."

        "content": "The global bulker fleet is facing a significant slowdown, driven by a combination of factors that are not only causing a decline in average speeds, but also setting the stage for the emergence of what analysts at Veson Nautical believes is a two-tier market. The impact of an ageing fleet in the era of efficiency states that ageing vessels, stricter emissions regulations, and evolving market dynamics are all factors in the lower average speeds being witnessed. The new report from Veson Nautical cites data that suggests that older vessels, particularly those built before the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) criteria was enforced in 2013, have seen a noticeable decrease in speeds, relative to newer vessels and that this is the single largest contributory factor to the slowdown of the global bulker fleet. “We can conclude that a surplus of older, inefficient vessels in the fleet, which are now penalised by efficiency regulations for sailing at higher speeds, are a driving factor in declining average speed overall,” said report author Oliver Kirkham, senior valuation analyst at Veson Nautical. “However, the decline in average speeds is not just a matter of operational efficiency; it’s a sign of a deeper shift in the bulker market, where modern, compliant vessels are set to command a premium as older ships struggle to keep pace.” The report adds that the massive expansion of the bulker fleet during the mid-2000s, spurred by China’s economic growth, has left a large portion of the fleet increasingly inefficient. These vessels are now struggling to meet modern efficiency standards, creating a growing divide between newer, more efficient vessels and older ships that are nearing the end of their operational lives. “The difference in terms of efficiency between new bulker vessels and vessels even from five years ago is significant as improved design, fuel efficiency and compliance with green regulations really start to make an impact,” Kirkham said. “These modern vessels are expected to command a premium especially in markets such as the US and Europe that have stringent age restrictions and carbon regulations.” The report concludes that a declining number of transactions of modern bulker vessels in the sales and purchase market is evidence that new bulker vessels are providing commercial advantage and emissions compliance which enables owners to command a premium for their charter. However, some markets are still open to ageing vessels, especially when transporting cargoes with negligible time constraints. “As emissions regulations continue to tighten globally it is clear that ageing vessels will be pushed into niche markets while newer vessels will dominate more profitable routes,” Kirkham maintained. “However, the shipping industry as a whole is currently lacking a standardised and transparent system to offer precise and conclusive proof of a vessels’ fuel and carbon efficiency, and this will need to be resolved as the market evolves.”"

Donald Trump’s first weeks back in the White House dominated shipping headlines for tariffs, a push for peace in Ukraine, a renewed ‘maximum pressure’ strategy on Iran, and the creation of a National Energy Dominance Council. With Europe increasingly aware it is being left to its own devices, Brussels and the UK have come out with plenty of measures to combatBaltic subsea attacksand Russia’s ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A 16th package of EU sanctions sees more than 70 ships blacklisted, while the bloc contemplates seizing ageing substandard shadow tanker tonnage transiting through the Baltic, and the Danish Maritime Authority is now carrying out port state controls on tankers it deems high risk who anchor off Skagen in the far north of the country, a popular anchorage. While no merchant ships have been attacked in the region this year, there’s little sign authorities believe theRed Sea shipping crisisis coming to an end anytime soon. The European Union has announced it is extending the mandate of its maritime security operation, EUNAVFOR Aspides, for an additional year. Transits through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal have seen a very slight uptick in traffic in recent days, but most shipowners who have eschewed the region in favour of longer trips around the African continent are sticking with that policy as tension remains high in the Middle East with the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas still facing many hurdles. Oaktree Capital Management is cashing out of shipmanagement giantOSM Thome, with investors linked to JP Morgan Asset Management’s Global Transportation Group coming onboard in its place. OSM Thome’s founding shareholders, OSM Maritime Partners and Skagerak Holding, will continue as shareholders, resulting in what the shipmanager described as a “long-term ownership constellation that ensures both continuity and growth”. The Indian government laid out plans to develop a brand new containerline. To be calledBharat Container Line, the new entity will have around 100 ships in its fleet, including ships on charter.

        "content": "As Tropical Cyclone Zeila subsided, Australia’s Port Hedland and Dampier iron ore ports ramped up throughput, while at the same time iron ore futures in China fell over 2% to below RMB800 ($110) per tonne. These positives are still outweighed by the negative of weak steel demand in China. But for capesize bulker owners, there is hope. Last year’s daily average TCE for Australia-China iron ore voyages was $23,200 compared to $25,691 in 2023. So far this year the average is $3,962 but the first two months are always affected by Lunar New Year so one should not read too much into this data point. More relevantly, the daily hire TCE for a 182,000 dwt capesize increased 90% over 30 days to reach $12,721 on February 21. As the miners put their hard hats back on and get back to work, capesize earnings should improve. Brazilian miner Vale has reported a 2% increase in iron ore production levels to 328m tonnes for 2024, on which it made a $6.1bn profit. While that was down 23%, these are hardly disastrous numbers and the average capesize daily TCE for Brazil-China voyages last year was $22,818, higher than $20,813 in 2023, so the average for this year of $9,013 should likewise be read in the context of a 26% improvement over 30 days to $10,783 on February 21. One year time charter rates for capesizes have reportedly ticked back above $22,000 a day from lows of $18,000, which also points to some confidence in the outlook. As the hangover from Lunar New Year subsides, there has also been good news in the panamax freight markets. For instance, the daily TCE from Santos to Qingdao, a common agriproducts voyage, rose 43% over the 30 days to February 21, to reach $12,022. The parallel voyage from Mississippi to Qingdao added 8% over the same period to reach $15,904. The previously moribund China-Indonesia-China round voyage has sparked into life with rates more than tripling to $10,700 per day, while the China-west coast North America round voyage almost doubled in February to reach $12,214. China appears to be getting back to work too. After a 9% increase in infrastructure spending in 2024, the most recent data show that, to reach its 2021-2025 five year plan goals, the government will have to build another 3,800km of new railway lines this year, issuing new government debt to fund the completion, along with perhaps RMB1trn of capital injections into state banks to pay for more infrastructure. Whether or not it is all actually needed is another question. Geared bulker freight markets also reflected rising activity in Asia in February. The South China – Indonesia round voyage for a 63,000 dwt ultramax bulker was earning around $4,500 a day a month ago but that had recovered to $10,356 on February 21, its first day above $9,999 since December 16. The daily TCE on trips out from the Indian Ocean to Asia added 126%, growing from $8,882 to $11,205 by February 21 compared to January 21. Earnings on trips out from the Black Sea to Asia increased 4% from $11,838 to $12,363 over the same dates. The coal voyage starting empty from South China, loading in Indonesia and discharging on the east coast of India was rated at $11,433 per day on February 21, an increase of 88% over 30 days while the trip from China to West Africa added 33% to reach $10,708. Handysize bulker earnings have also rebounded from recent lows. In the Atlantic, the TCE from the east coast of south America to western Europe rose 17% to $14,782 while the backhaul added 21% to reach $5,993. The TCE on the US Gulf to western Europe voyage lost 2% to sit at $10,714, but the backhaul added 23% to reach $7,336. The Southeast Asian round voyage for handies attracted an assessed TCE of $9,506 for voyages booked on February 21, up 32% in a month, while the North Asia to North America and back round voyage went up 33% to $9,538. The best performer of all was the voyage from north China to the west coast of Thailand, which was assessed at $9,425 on February 21, a rise of 43%. Are these the green shoots of recovery or just seasonality at play? We will not be able to say until we are well into the second quarter. Meanwhile, 2025 to date is replaying 2023 which started weakly but ended strongly. We can all hope."

        "content": "In what it describes as a “surprise move”, Alphaliner is reporting Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC), the world’s largest containerline, has decided to shift all of its 19,200 to 24,300 teu megamax vessels, currently trading between Asia and North Europe, to the Asia – Med and Asia – West Africa trades. MSC, which from the start of this month has gone it alone on the main east-west trades, will now deploy ships with an average size of around 14,700 teu on Asia – North Europe. “According to the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI), Shanghai to North Europe rates stood at USD 1,578 per teu last week, which represents a drop of 44% over the first seven weeks of this year. Reducing capacity on this trade lane could be considered an attempt to reduce pressure on rates,” Alphaliner pointed out in its latest weekly report, noting too that spot freight rates for the shorter Shanghai – West Africa route are much better at around $4,000 per teu. “The spot rate decline into North Europe is much faster and deeper than the usual seasonality – yet at the same time Asia to Mediterranean is essentially following normal seasonality,” noted analysts at rival consultancy Sea-Intelligence."

        "content": "French energy major EDF has written down $940m in the value of its stake in the Atlantic Shores wind energy project off New Jersey after its former partner in the project, Shell, did the same last month. This is another hit for the offshore wind industry in the US which is reeling following president Donald Trump’sfreezeof all offshore wind leasing on the country’s outer continental shelf. New Jersey has probably taken the brunt of these new policies and the Atlantic Shores project is a prime example of it. Shell abandoned its involvement in the 1,510MW project in January and took a nearly $1b write-down on the project. At the time, EDF said it would be pushing forward with the already permitted project. However, more bad luck for EDF and its project was on its way. Earlier this month, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilitiespulled the plugon the state’s fourth offshore wind solicitation. This was due to two of the three initial bidders withdrawing from the solicitation and Atlantic Shores remaining as the sole bidder. New Jersey approved three offshore wind developments which were supposed to be part of the solicitation round – Atlantic Shores southern project, Attentive Energy Two, and Leading Light Wind. There used to be four projects but Ørsted cancelled its Ocean Wind project in 2023 citing increased costs of development. Atlantic Shores also proposed a second ‘northern’ project but was declined by the NJ Board. Trump has placed a target on the EDF-led project with his speeches from last year and showed his disdain for the project during speeches at Mar-a-Lago. The project was not safe from the president even on social media. Another company to announce write-offs in 2024 was Eversource Energy which took a hit of around $1.6bn relating to three of its wind projects – South Fork Wind, Revolution Wind, and Sunrise Wind."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Shipmanagers have expressed concerns in connection with the International Maritime Organization’s future net-zero framework and have suggested changes which they believe would make the proposals more effective. Acting on behalf of the global shipmanagement sector, InterManager, the international association for shipmanagers, has submitted a proposal to the next meeting of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC83) to suggest changes. The submission warns that, in its current form, the greenhouse gas (GHG) proposal doesn’t properly account for the involvement of a third-party International Safety Management (ISM) Manager. Highlighting that roughly 20% of the global fleet is operated by a third-party technical shipmanager as the ISM Manager, the submission asserts the need for further refining to make it applicable in practice and to avoid future national implementing acts being open to inevitable and avoidable litigation by shipmanagers. “In comparison to the charterer and shipowner, the shipmanager has no material influence over the GHG intensity of a ship. Shipmanagers have no say regarding the type of engine powering the managed ship, nor whether sails, solar, fuel cells or other installations are installed onboard. Such choices are decided exclusively by the shipowner,” InterManager explained in a release. “Ship managers are not consulted and, in addition, have no influence as to which fuels are procured and supplied to any of the managed ships, neither contractually nor in practice. The matter is negotiated between the shipowner and the charterer and agreed in the charter party agreement for the ship, together with speed and consumption, the remaining significant parameters impacting on its GHG intensity,” the submission states. However, the current proposed draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI on the IMO net-zero framework suggest making shipmanagers the sole responsible entity for penalties related to GHG emissions. InterManager maintains this clearly misidentifies the shipmanager as the polluter to be held responsible and penalised which could lead to legal challenges. Further, by assigning liability for compliance fees to the shipmanager, they in turn, are forced to ask shipowners to provide upfront financial security to cover potential risks of insolvency or defaults. This forces significant amounts of equity to be tied up in security, limiting cash flow available for growth or investment in new ships. InterManager president Sebastian von Hardenberg (pictured) commented: “We shipmanagers are fully committed to playing our part in shipping’s journey to net zero. However, when it comes to the GHG intensity of a ship, ship managers have no say whatsoever in any of the decisions that result in material impact; they are not even consulted. In shore terms, we are the facility managers, not the factory owners.”"

Ningbo Marine predominately owns bulkers, but it also has one 12,100 dwt tanker that joined the fleet in 2020. The latest vessels mark an upsize in the company’s ordering strategy after three 50,000 dwt bulkers were put in operation in recent years.

Five of the world’s leading shipbroking firms—Arrow, Gibson Shipbrokers, Howe Robinson, IFCHOR Galbraiths and SSY—have united to introduce Ocean Recap – a purpose-built recap and charter party management platform. “The past decade has seen a rush to digitalisation in the chartering space, with a wave of new platforms offering pre- and post-fixture services. Inevitably there has been consolidation and the risk is that one platform dominates,” Manu Ravano, co-CEO of IFCHOR Galbraiths, toldSplash Extra, adding: “Price of the service rendered, control of data and choice plurality are critical issues for any platform user in any market, and this is why we have acted.” Tim Huxley, CEO of Hong Kong shipowner Mandarin Shipping, said he hoped that the use of all these new tools to manage fixtures does not lead to the disappearance of some of the fundamental skills of the shipbroker, of which the ability to draft a recap and charterparty and then interpret it in order to avoid later disputes are fundamental. Huxley, a former broker with Clarksons, will be chairing the Chartering Spotlight session on April 28 atGeneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference, a panel discussion that will debate how brokers will evolve, and where the many platforms sit in terms of requirements with speakers from SEA, Arrow, Vale and Western Bulk all on stage."

        "content": "Shipping is reeling from what could be the most seismic decision to effect the industry yet in the opening weeks of Donald Trump’s second term in office. The American president will make a decision, likely in around a month’s time, on whether to carry out suggestions made by the office of the US Trade Representative following an investigation carried out over the past year into China’s growing dominance in maritime, especially in the realm of shipbuilding. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements with March 24 set as the deadline for public comments to be made after which the president will make his decision. The majority of ocean-going ships would pay the maximum port fee given their net tonnages, according to analysis by Jefferies, an investment bank. “These fees would likely require re-organizing fleet patterns and make US calls more lucrative on a freight rate basis, which operators would aim to pass on,” a note from Jefferies stated. We might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance The most affected sector is likely containerships given their multiple port calls. A $1.5m fee spread against the average 10,000 teu ship calling in the US would equate to $150 per teu or $300 per feu, according to Jefferies calculationsw, taking today’s China-Los Angeles rate quotes up from $3,000per feu to $3,300 per feu. A VLCC cargo from the US Gulf to China costs $8.3m in today’s market or $4.20 per barrel, but that would rise to $4.95 per barrel including a $1.5m fee according to Jefferies. Were Trump to approve of the USTR measures, Dutch bank ING said the ripple effects will impact global supply chains, investor confidence, and international relations, creating even more uncertainty further on, as businesses grapple with enduring low arrival reliability with potential new disruptions and increased costs. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of just 1%. The US has been engaging with Korean and Japanese shipbuilders in a belated bid to bolster its faded shipbuilding sector, while one of Trump’s first acts back in power was to enact a blanket 10% tariff on Chinese imports. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing commented on the USTR’s recommendations: “The US measures will not only fail to revitalise its shipbuilding industry but will also raise shipping costs on related routes, exacerbate its domestic inflation, reduce the global competitiveness of US goods, and hurt the interests of its port operators and dockworkers.” In the five weeks since Trump has returned to the White House he has upended world trade with tariffs, a push for peace in Ukraine, a renewed ‘maximum pressure’ strategy on Iran, and the creation of a National Energy Dominance Council among many measures taken. For shipping, carrying out the USTR’s recommendations – a very popular move with American unions – could prove to be the most dramatic ruling yet. “As the Trump 2.0 reality show unfolds, as it does daily, often with singular market-moving tweets, we might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance across shipping sectors. Underwhelming spot earnings render shipping sentiment downbeat while we seek greater clarity on today’s geopolitical, trade and social threats,” noted a recent report from broker Hartland Shipping."

        "content": "If you have spent the last 40 days or so under your desk wearing a tin foil hat to keep out the geopolitical noise, then you have my sympathy. As the new US administration thrashes about breaking stuff, traders and investors have displayed a curious calm, or perhaps an unwillingness to take a position until there is more signal to be discerned among the noise. Still, there are some facts to be reported. Oil prices have been falling with WTI losing over $4.60 in the 30 days to February 21 to sit at $70.40. Brent is down over $4 to $74.43 between the same dates. The OPEC basket price fell from $80.45 on January 24 to a low of $76.24 on February 13 but was back up to $78.19 on February 19. US oil exports should therefore be favourably priced for Far Eastern buyers but freight rates suggest weakening demand. The daily TCE for a VLCC sailing from the US Gulf to China slid steadily from $52,080 on January 21 to $41,827 on February 21. Contrarily the daily TCE for a VLCC from the Middle East to China fell only 9% from $46,108 to $41,739 while the TCE for the voyage from the Middle East to Singapore was down 8% to $44,671. China’s teapot refineries are being squeezed by sanctions on Russian oil (for now) and increasing import taxes on feedstock. This may affect spot oil purchase volumes with some reports saying four refineries with annual output of 18m tonnes are indefinitely shuttered. Suezmax tanker owners have fared better with the Baltic Exchange reporting a 24% increase in daily TCEs on the WAF-UKC voyage to $36,391 on February 21, the highest level since October last year. The Guyana-ARA suezmax TCE was up 26% over 30 days as of February 21, sitting at a lively $33,657 having surpassed $36,000 a few days earlier. Are EU buyers switching to Guyanese feedstocks over logistically difficult Middle Eastern supplies? The suezmax TCE from the Middle East to the Med lost 19% over 30 days to lounge at $38,791 on February 21. Who knows where Messrs Trump and Musk will push the global oil markets? The diverse aframax freight markets were on average rising in February, with some variation. Day rates from Kuwait to Singapore rose 2% to $30,891 while from Singapore to Australia the TCE assessment rose 7% to a still slim $20,910. In the Med, TCE assessments fell 14% to a still meaty $32,235 while aframaxes trading from the USG to ARA were rated at $31,967 on February 21, some 26% higher than a month earlier. The biggest rises were in the North Sea, with discharge in the UK returning $48,249 on February 21, up 70% over 30 days, and discharge in Germany returning $28,265 per day as per even date, up 35%. As crude oil markets wait for a geopolitical steer, oil products tanker markets have been volatile. For instance, the Atlantic MR basket moved from $27,030 on January 21 to a peak of $30,217 on February 4 before slumping to $15,755 on February 13 then regaining ground to sit at $22,391 on February 21. Daily TCEs on the eastbound voyage from the USG to ARA, affected by refinery maintenance, functioned as the sea anchor on rates, which have been stuck in four figures for all of February, averaging just $7,336 per day. Rates from the USG to the Caribbean looked flat, falling just 2% to $10,681 over the 30 days to February 21 but this masked a slump to just $4,256 on February 12 and subsequent recovery. Rate assessments on the westbound voyage from ARA to the US north east coast were also down 15% over 30 days albeit to a more consoling $16,090 per day. In the Pacific, MR earnings from South Korea to the US west coast were steady at $24,899 on February 21 having averaged $24,763 for the previous 30 days. However rates on the voyage from South Korea to Singapore fell by 16% to $14,139 whereas the MR day rate from South Korea to Australia rose 5% to $18,415. The TCE assessment on the MR tanker voyage from Singapore to the east coast of Australia rose by a hefty 22% to $20,260. From these data the Pacific looks rather positional and short-term with little overall direction. The benchmark LR2 voyage from the Middle East to Japan lost 30% over 30 days to February 21 to sit at a mediocre $22,845, while the mirror voyage from the Middle East to western Europe lost 34% over the same dates, to end up at $26,143. The daily TCE for an LR2 sailing from Algeria to Japan lost 30% with rates subsiding to a miserly $6,862. Where LR2s go, LR1s usually follow, so the daily TCE from Jubail to Rotterdam lost 17% to lie at $20,906 on February 21. The assessed TCE from the Mid East to Japan on an LR1 lost 12% to end up at $17,748 though it had dipped to $12,689 on February 2. However, from ARA to WAF, LR1 earnings added 18%, achieving $20,434 on February 21, while the cross-Med route to the EU gained 5% to reach a tasty $30,786 per day having dipped as low as $17,726 on January 30. Over the last 30 days the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index is up 1% and the BTCI is down 5%. The year has really yet to get going, and who knows where Messrs Trump and Musk, the Bert and Ernie of geopolitics, will push the global oil markets, the sanctioned tanker fleets or global oil supply chains?"

The project is expected to expand capacity from the Kipper field, delivering crucial gas supplies to the market ahead of winter 2026."

The price tag is considered firm for the bulker it bought eight years ago for $9.5m. Last year, Oldendorff was ranked as the top bulker seller in Europe, selling 20 ships, both young and old bulker tonnage, earning a fortune. While brokers are hesitant to declare a recovery, several report that the value decline is beginning to level off. On dry bulk, broker Hartland noted in its most recent weekly report: “The freight market is beginning to defrost, and this is encouraging a bit more positivity in the secondhand market. It is premature to talk of a recovery in values, but to some extent the dive is starting to flatten out.”"

The vessel is suspected of damaging the cable connecting Taiwan to its outlying Penghu Islands, Taiwan’s coast guard said in a statement. The Togo-flaggedHongtai58and its eight Chinese crewmembers have been taken to the port of Anping as investigations get underway in the latest cable cutting incident to hit the island. Taiwan blacklisted 52 Chinese-owned ships last month that operate under flags of convenience in the wake of the severing of another subsea communications cable. Taiwan’s National Coast Guard Administration identified a Cameroon-registered cargo ship,Shunxin 39, as the suspect in the incident. Taiwan’s National Security Bureau has said ships which have previously been found to misreport information will be put on a list of ships for priority inspection at ports. Moreover, if these ships enter within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan’s coast and are close to where undersea cables are, the coast guard will be dispatched to board them and investigate. According to data provider Windward, the frequency of underwater infrastructure sabotage has increased from just two incidents in 2000 to 75 incidents in 2024 with the seas around Taiwan as well as the Baltic becoming hotspots for ships deliberately dragging anchors to take out critical subsea infrastructure."

Reducing capacity on this trade lane could be considered an attempt to reduce pressure on rates,” Alphaliner pointed out in its latest weekly report, noting too that spot freight rates for the shorter Shanghai – West Africa route are much better at around $4,000 per teu. “The spot rate decline into North Europe is much faster and deeper than the usual seasonality – yet at the same time Asia to Mediterranean is essentially following normal seasonality,” noted analysts at rival consultancy Sea-Intelligence."

Inevitably there has been consolidation and the risk is that one platform dominates,” Manu Ravano, co-CEO of IFCHOR Galbraiths, toldSplash Extra, adding: “Price of the service rendered, control of data and choice plurality are critical issues for any platform user in any market, and this is why we have acted.” Tim Huxley, CEO of Hong Kong shipowner Mandarin Shipping, said he hoped that the use of all these new tools to manage fixtures does not lead to the disappearance of some of the fundamental skills of the shipbroker, of which the ability to draft a recap and charterparty and then interpret it in order to avoid later disputes are fundamental. Huxley, a former broker with Clarksons, will be chairing the Chartering Spotlight session on April 28 atGeneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference, a panel discussion that will debate how brokers will evolve, and where the many platforms sit in terms of requirements with speakers from SEA, Arrow, Vale and Western Bulk all on stage."

The company, which sold out ofdry bulkin 2022, has several newbuilding projects on its books, including offshore wind service operation vessels and wind-assisted roros backed by long-term charters with Sweden’s biggest utility,Vattenfalland the world’s biggest planemakerAirbus, respectively. “We are delighted by InfraVia’s investment in LDA because we share the same vision, the same values and, of course, the same ambitions for our group,” said Edouard Louis-Dreyfus, president of LDA, adding: “In our sectors, we are convinced that great opportunities lie ahead and are within our reach. It is this conviction that drives us to accelerate our ambitions, to propel Louis Dreyfus Armateurs into a new dynamic of growth and innovation.” The takeover, subject to prior consultation with employee representative bodies, is expected to close in the first half of 2025."

Three other shuttle tankers are currently under construction at Samsung for delivery in 2025 and 2026; however, they are not linked to the Brazilian state-owned giant. Last year, Maran Tankers, a unit of Greece’s Angelicoussis Shipping Group, ordered a trio of shuttle tankers at DH Shipbuilding in South Korea, delivering in 2027 into a long-term charter with Petrobras. Transpetro also has its own fleet renewal and expansion program that foresees the construction of 25 vessels.

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "The European Union has unveiled its Clean Industrial Deal that will prioritise the domestic production of renewable fuels for aviation and shipping, among a host of measures worth more than EUR100bn ($105m) designed to green many industry sectors. “The EU needs to secure access to such materials and reduce dependence on unreliable suppliers. Integrating circularity in our decarbonisation strategy is crucial to making the most of the EU’s limited resources,” the bloc stated in a release. Contained in the deal is the launch of a new mechanism under the European Hydrogen Bank to de-risk investments in fuels for shipping. European shipowners strongly welcomed the recognition of shipping under the five sectors across which the Clean Industrial Deal should be implemented. “Leveraging EU and national ETS revenues is essential to build industrial capacity in Europe and to bridge the immense price gap between conventional and clean fuels that can be up to five times more expensive. In this regard, grants- and auctions-as-a-service mechanisms can help pool national ETS revenues to support these objectives,” stated a release from the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA). “EU member states must use the 9bn of the shipping ETS revenues to support the production of clean fuels. We also urge the commission to cut red tape and ensure an international level playing field,” urged Sotiris Raptis, ECSA secretary-general. “We’re really pleased to see investments in renewable energy, green hydrogen, and clean transport infrastructure prioritised today,” said Joe Kramek, president and CEO oof the World Shipping Council, a liner lobby group. “If the Clean Industrial Deal is fully realised, it represents an opportunity for Europe to strengthen its position as a global shipping hub. As one of the world’s largest exporters, the EU’s economic power and global influence depend on shipping. However, without the necessary investment and commitment, the EU risks being left behind,” Kramek said. Faig Abbasov, shipping director at NGO Transport&Environment, said: “The Clean Industrial Deal is a step in the right direction, recognising the essential role that green hydrogen-derived fuels play in decarbonising shipping and aviation. But it lacks essential details on how the EU is going to bridge the price gap between fossil fuels and greener alternatives or address the need for larger and longer term offtake commitments.” “The Clean Industrial Deal has the makings of a robust blueprint for getting the EU clean and competitive, including in the shipping industry. Cheap energy is the bedrock of industrialisation and instrumental to the green transition, provided cost reductions do not take precedence over decarbonisation,” saids Aurelia Leeuw, director of EU policy at the SASHA Coalition, an NGO fording green links between aviation and shipping."

The gross contract value for the firm periods is $21m with an additional $27.7m for the option periods. All contracts have already started. The company’s current backlog stands at $27m firm and an additional $46.9m option periods. At the start of the month, GEOS secured a long-term charter deal for its 2021-builtEnergy SavannahMPSV taken under management last year. The company fixed the vessel to Swiss-based subsea services player Deepwave for two years."

        "author": "Bojan Lepic",
        "content": "UK-based energy giant BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead increase its investment in oil and gas production. The company buckled under pressure from investors who were unhappy over the company’s underperformance compared to its main rivals such as Shell and ExxonMobil. For example, BP shares have risen by 36% from the end of February 2020 until February 25, 2025. Shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively. As a result of the investor’s demands, BP stated that it would increase its investments in oil and gas from about $8.5bn a year to $10bn. At the same time, the company would decrease previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn. BP’s capex on low carbon will be around $2bn over the next two years, which is $10bn less than previous plans. In 2023, the company expected to spend $30bn during the decade. Now it sets a limit of spending $4bn by 2030. The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3m and 2.5m bopd by 2030, with hopes of major oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027. BP boss Murray Auchincloss said at the company’s capital markets day event that this was a “reset” of the UK firm and that BP misplaced its optimism for a fast transition. He added that the energy giant went “too far, too fast” in its efforts to cut its oil and gas business and shift to renewable energy. This shift has been the primary focus of the company since previous CEO Bernard Looney unveiled plans in 2020 to cut hydrocarbon production by 40% and increase spending on wind farms, solar, hydrogen, and other clean energy types. The company also announced plans to raise $20bn by selling assets. Its 125-year-old Castrol business will be reviewed ahead of a potential sale. BP will also seek a joint venture partner for its Lightsource solar business similar to the agreement it has with Jera for its offshore wind investments. BP’s EVP for regions, cities, and solutions William Lin stated that solar and offshore wind sectors have been affected by inflation while hydrogen investments ran into policy issues and higher costs combined with reduced customer willingness to pay. Another savings method from BP was a plan for a staff reduction of 5%. This includes 4,700 BP staff and 3,000 contractors. However, BP is not alone in this pivot as Shell and Equinor have also announced their plans to reduce green energy investments. The decision is partly political as US president Donald Trump announced it would be firmly behind fossil fuels with his “drill baby drill” policy. The moratorium on offshore wind in the US is also a firm sign of where Trump’s energy policies lie."

The study envisages the installation of a carbon capture module, based on Carbon Clean’s modular CycloneCC technology, on a Modec FPSO as a pilot programme. According to ModecThis will be a first-of-a-kind deployment of CycloneCC in an onboard carbon capture setting. Carbon Clean will provide FEED support to Samsung E&A, formerly Samsung Engineering, including equipment supply of the rotating packed bed technology used by CycloneCC and process design package licensing for the unit. Samsung E&A will perform detailed engineering to optimize the technology for the offshore environment and FPSO’s boundary conditions. The unit footprint of the CycloneCC is up to 50% smaller than conventional solutions, with its largest equipment sizes reduced by a factor of 10. It also delivers a height reduction of 70% compared to column-based technologies. The rotating packed bed will also be able to increase capture performance under vessel motions compared to columns. If the pilot is successful, the next stage may include the installation of a commercial, scaled-up CycloneCC unit on Modec’s FPSO fleet. “Onboard carbon capture is essential for decarbonizing offshore oil and gas operations. Its replicable, scalable design makes it logistically and commercially viable to be deployed across a fleet at a fraction of the cost of traditional amine systems,” said Aniruddha Sharma, chair and CEO of Carbon Clean."

        "content": "Shipping is reeling from what could be the most seismic decision to effect the industry yet in the opening weeks of Donald Trump’s second term in office. The American president will make a decision, likely in around a month’s time, on whether to carry out suggestions made by the office of the US Trade Representative following an investigation carried out over the past year into China’s growing dominance in maritime, especially in the realm of shipbuilding. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements with March 24 set as the deadline for public comments to be made after which the president will make his decision. The majority of ocean-going ships would pay the maximum port fee given their net tonnages, according to analysis by Jefferies, an investment bank. “These fees would likely require re-organizing fleet patterns and make US calls more lucrative on a freight rate basis, which operators would aim to pass on,” a note from Jefferies stated. We might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance The most affected sector is likely containerships given their multiple port calls. A $1.5m fee spread against the average 10,000 teu ship calling in the US would equate to $150 per teu or $300 per feu, according to Jefferies calculationsw, taking today’s China-Los Angeles rate quotes up from $3,000per feu to $3,300 per feu. A VLCC cargo from the US Gulf to China costs $8.3m in today’s market or $4.20 per barrel, but that would rise to $4.95 per barrel including a $1.5m fee according to Jefferies. Were Trump to approve of the USTR measures, Dutch bank ING said the ripple effects will impact global supply chains, investor confidence, and international relations, creating even more uncertainty further on, as businesses grapple with enduring low arrival reliability with potential new disruptions and increased costs. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of just 1%. The US has been engaging with Korean and Japanese shipbuilders in a belated bid to bolster its faded shipbuilding sector, while one of Trump’s first acts back in power was to enact a blanket 10% tariff on Chinese imports. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing commented on the USTR’s recommendations: “The US measures will not only fail to revitalise its shipbuilding industry but will also raise shipping costs on related routes, exacerbate its domestic inflation, reduce the global competitiveness of US goods, and hurt the interests of its port operators and dockworkers.” In the five weeks since Trump has returned to the White House he has upended world trade with tariffs, a push for peace in Ukraine, a renewed ‘maximum pressure’ strategy on Iran, and the creation of a National Energy Dominance Council among many measures taken. For shipping, carrying out the USTR’s recommendations – a very popular move with American unions – could prove to be the most dramatic ruling yet. “As the Trump 2.0 reality show unfolds, as it does daily, often with singular market-moving tweets, we might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance across shipping sectors. Underwhelming spot earnings render shipping sentiment downbeat while we seek greater clarity on today’s geopolitical, trade and social threats,” noted a recent report from broker Hartland Shipping."

The Smart Container Alliance aims to advance industry standards, advocate for policy change, and foster collaboration between technology providers, shipowners, customs authorities, and international regulatory bodies, including the European Union and the World Customs Organization. “Smart cargo and container telematics are the foundation for the 21st century supply chain with revolutionary new solutions for our society, authorities, governments and businesses to structurally reduce illicit trade, cargo contamination, cargo waste, theft and supply chain carbon footprint while simultaneously enhance product authentication, on-time delivery commitments, asset productivity and cargo integrity and quality,” stated Charles Vincent, CEO of ARVIEM. The alliance will act as a central platform for industry stakeholders to exchange knowledge, develop best practices, and promote the adoption of smart containers worldwide with many global liners vowing to make their entire container fleets smart in the coming years. “Standardising smart container data across alliance members will ensure greater interoperability, efficiency, and security in global trade, helping enforcement agencies combat illicit activity while improving the flow of legitimate goods,” commented Christian Allred, CCO of ORBCOMM. The launch of the Smart Container Alliance coincides with the reform of the EU Customs Union since its inception in 1968. Smart containers are set to play a key role in the shift towards a data-driven approach to customs checks, reinforcing security measures across European ports and beyond. With its headquarters in Brussels, the alliance will engage with policymakers, industry leaders, and enforcement agencies to support a harmonised approach to trade security. A key focus, according to the statement, will be aligning efforts with the European Port Alliance to counter criminal infiltration and reinforce supply chain integrity. Through partnerships, advocacy, and capacity-building, the Smart Container Alliance aims to pave the way for a safer, smarter, and more resilient global trade ecosystem."

In recent years, following a series of exposés into the industry, many nations have slapped significant restrictions on the livestock shipping business. The global livestock export fleet has just over 100 vessels remaining – some of which have been idle for a while. The oldest ship still actively trading had its 60th birthday last year with the average age of the global livestock carrier fleet now a very ancient 39 years old."

MSC, which from the start of this month has gone it alone on the main east-west trades, will now deploy ships with an average size of around 14,700 teu on Asia – North Europe. “According to the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI), Shanghai to North Europe rates stood at USD 1,578 per teu last week, which represents a drop of 44% over the first seven weeks of this year. Reducing capacity on this trade lane could be considered an attempt to reduce pressure on rates,” Alphaliner pointed out in its latest weekly report, noting too that spot freight rates for the shorter Shanghai – West Africa route are much better at around $4,000 per teu. “The spot rate decline into North Europe is much faster and deeper than the usual seasonality – yet at the same time Asia to Mediterranean is essentially following normal seasonality,” noted analysts at rival consultancy Sea-Intelligence."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Joy Basu, CEO of Smart Ship Hub, on why shipping needs to think predictive and not scheduled when it comes to looking after vessels. The transition to predictive maintenance is not just an upgrade it is the future of shipping as companies in their droves adopt technical innovations to ensure the best possible standard of care and quality of life for vessels. Scheduled maintenance has long been the standard in the shipping industry, where equipment and vessel components are serviced based on predefined intervals. However, this approach is increasingly outdated in the face of modern predictive maintenance technologies, which use data-driven insights to optimise maintenance schedules. The industry is already seeing a shift toward predictive maintenance with advancements in digital twin technology, AI-driven analytics, and cloud-based fleet management. Companies that embrace these innovations will gain a competitive edge, reduce operational risks, and enhance profitability. By monitoring engine performance, fuel consumption, and other critical parameters, predictive maintenance helps optimise ship efficiency. This leads to better fuel management, lower emissions, and improved operational performance. Shipping companies that continue relying on scheduled maintenance will face higher costs, inefficiencies, and regulatory challenges. Predictive maintenance is not just an upgrade—it’s the future.Investing in data-driven, AI-powered maintenance strategies today will ensure long-term profitability, sustainability, and a competitive edge in the evolving maritime industry. Traditionally the maritime industry has worked on scheduled maintenance which operates on a predetermined timeline, not on actual equipment condition. This often leads to either: The primary difference between condition-based vs. predictive maintenance is that the latter combines sensor measurements with precise algorithmic formulas to predict the exact moment when maintenance actions should be taken. Timely and effective maintenance of seagoing vessels is fundamental to the maritime industry’s core business of transporting cargo from A to B as safely and efficiently as possible. Well-maintained ships experience fewer unexpected failures or breakdowns, reducing the potential for accidents, delays and disruptions, while safeguarding the lives of the crews serving onboard. While vessel maintenance necessarily incurs costs, careful asset management should ultimately lead to savings by preventing more expensive repairs or replacements that could result from neglect or deferred action. Effective maintenance can also help to improve fuel efficiency and reduce other operational expenses by allowing the ship to sail in condition as close to optimal as possible, creating benefits for both the shipping company and the environment. The evolution of condition-based maintenance (CBM) has helped to increase the effectiveness of vessel care processes, moving away from a reliance on averages and statistical assumptions to an approach tailored specifically to the equipment or asset being maintained. Scheduling maintenance activities based on the actual condition of the equipment, rather than following a fixed calendar-based timetable, allows for resources to be deployed more efficiently and for the impact of maintenance procedures on vessel operations to be minimised. Current maintenance practices within the shipping industry typically involve a range of common processes and requirements that present significant opportunities for optimisation. Multiple stakeholders, including ship owners, classification societies and equipment manufacturers, all have a role to play in managing maintenance, but processes suffer from a lack of direct integration between the parties. The philosophy behind predictive maintenance, however, is to only perform those tasks when they are actually needed to ensure optimal uptime on the equipment. This generally means condition-based monitoring to ensure that maintenance is triggered when assets meet certain predetermined conditions. The maritime sector undoubtedly faces a range of challenges, both technical and structural, in deploying efficient and effective condition-based maintenance systems. However, many of these challenges could be substantially alleviated by integrating data and analytics-driven methods into the maintenance workflow and creating a data-driven condition-based maintenance (DCBM) process. By integrating data analytics with traditional maintenance methods, the industry has the potential to significantly improve both the reliability and operational efficiency of marine vessels. This will require the development of analytics-based diagnostic systems, real-time monitoring solutions, and comprehensive digital platforms to remove errors and inefficiencies from traditional processes and optimise workflows. The industry is already seeing a shift toward predictive maintenance with advancements in digital twin technology, AI-driven analytics, and cloud-based fleet management. Companies that embrace these innovations will gain a competitive edge, reduce operational risks, and enhance profitability."

        "content": "Belgian marine contractor Jan De Nul will provide its 2023-built heavy lift vesselLes Alizésto transport and install the monopile foundations on the Inch Cape wind farm offshore Scotland. The wind farm will comprise 72 turbines sited in the North Sea off the Angus coast with a total installed capacity of 1080MW. The project is fully backed by UK government contracts for difference. Inch Cape is developed by an equal joint venture between ESB and Red Rock Renewables. It recently reached a financial close and is now progressing into construction. When complete, the wind farm will generate enough green energy to power the equivalent of half of all Scottish homes. It will also be the UK’s first offshore wind farm to install 15 MW Vestas turbines. Engineering and project preparation for the transport and installation of the monopile foundations are already progressing and will begin in late 2025. The monopiles are up to 110 meters long and weigh up to 2,500 tonnes, equal to the weight of about 2,500 average cars. The monopiles will be loaded at a newly built quayside at the entrance to the Port of Leith in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jan De Nul will deploy the vessel at Inch Cape as its third consecutive assignment. In December 2024, the vessel finished installing 107 monopile foundations on Gode Wind 3 and Borkum Riffgrund 3 wind farms off Germany. This spring, the vessel will continue working on the installation of 72 monopiles on RWE’s Thor farm off Denmark. The heavy lifter is on a long-term charter to RWE, however, the German utility has already ensured the vessel could be made available to other developers during downtime between its projects."

We have been making great strides in opening the discussion in the maritime industry around bullying and harassment and promoting ourselves as an open and inclusive industry for seafarers.

Whilst this decision predominantly impacts transgender individuals that serve in the US military, it sends a troubling message and implications that will ripple across other industries, including maritime. Maritime has long been a diverse industry by nature of the cultures it employs onboard ship, relying on its skilled global workforce that brings together a plethora of different cultures, ethnicities, traditions, and beliefs.

        "content": "While much of the world is pushing back from carrying live animals by sea, one South American nation is gearing up to return to the livestock trades after a 52-year absence. Argentina has repealed a 1973 ban on livestock exports saying the decision was based on the Javier Milii-led government policy to promote “an economic system based on free decisions, adopted in an area of free competition, with respect for private property and the constitutional principles of free circulation of goods, services, and labour.” Argentina is already one of the world’s leading exporters of frozen beef with the Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Secretariat of the Ministry of Economy stating yesterday that the meat sector has emerged as a pillar of the country’s economic growth. In recent years, following a series of exposés into the industry, many nations have slapped significant restrictions on the livestock shipping business. The global livestock export fleet has just over 100 vessels remaining – some of which have been idle for a while. The oldest ship still actively trading had its 60th birthday last year with the average age of the global livestock carrier fleet now a very ancient 39 years old."

        "content": "John Fredriksen’s Frontline has secured a fresh refinancing deal for four of its vessels. The New York- and Oslo-listed tanker giant said it had entered into three senior secured credit facilities of $239m in total, which will refinance three VLCCs and one suezmax vessel and, in addition, provide revolving credit capacity in a total amount of up to $91.9m. The first deal, which will refinance outstanding debt on two VLCCs, has been struck with ING and First Citizens. It will provide up to $119.7m, with $51.6m revolving credit capacity. The third VLCC will be refinanced through a $72.3m arrangement with Crédit Agricole which provides a revolving credit of up to $25.4m. The company has also agreed a $47m loan with SEB secured by an unnamed suezmax which will refinance outstanding debt on the vessel and make an additional $14.9m available. All three financings have a tenor of five years and bear interest at the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a margin of between 160 and 170 basis points per annum. Last year, Frontline, with a fleet of over 80 ships, refinanced 10 suezmax tankers via a $512m sale-and-leaseback agreement withCMB Financial Leasing, generating net cash proceeds of $101m in the fourth quarter. Inger Klemp, Frontline’s chief of finance said the new deals leave the company with no debt maturities until the end of 2026. “Through these new financings we further strengthen our strong liquidity and reduce our borrowing costs and cash break even rates,” she noted."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Shipping is reeling from what could be the most seismic decision to effect the industry yet in the opening weeks of Donald Trump’s second term in office. The American president will make a decision, likely in around a month’s time, on whether to carry out suggestions made by the office of the US Trade Representative following an investigation carried out over the past year into China’s growing dominance in maritime, especially in the realm of shipbuilding. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements with March 24 set as the deadline for public comments to be made after which the president will make his decision. The majority of ocean-going ships would pay the maximum port fee given their net tonnages, according to analysis by Jefferies, an investment bank. “These fees would likely require re-organizing fleet patterns and make US calls more lucrative on a freight rate basis, which operators would aim to pass on,” a note from Jefferies stated. We might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance The most affected sector is likely containerships given their multiple port calls. A $1.5m fee spread against the average 10,000 teu ship calling in the US would equate to $150 per teu or $300 per feu, according to Jefferies calculationsw, taking today’s China-Los Angeles rate quotes up from $3,000per feu to $3,300 per feu. A VLCC cargo from the US Gulf to China costs $8.3m in today’s market or $4.20 per barrel, but that would rise to $4.95 per barrel including a $1.5m fee according to Jefferies. Were Trump to approve of the USTR measures, Dutch bank ING said the ripple effects will impact global supply chains, investor confidence, and international relations, creating even more uncertainty further on, as businesses grapple with enduring low arrival reliability with potential new disruptions and increased costs. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of just 1%. The US has been engaging with Korean and Japanese shipbuilders in a belated bid to bolster its faded shipbuilding sector, while one of Trump’s first acts back in power was to enact a blanket 10% tariff on Chinese imports. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing commented on the USTR’s recommendations: “The US measures will not only fail to revitalise its shipbuilding industry but will also raise shipping costs on related routes, exacerbate its domestic inflation, reduce the global competitiveness of US goods, and hurt the interests of its port operators and dockworkers.” In the five weeks since Trump has returned to the White House he has upended world trade with tariffs, a push for peace in Ukraine, a renewed ‘maximum pressure’ strategy on Iran, and the creation of a National Energy Dominance Council among many measures taken. For shipping, carrying out the USTR’s recommendations – a very popular move with American unions – could prove to be the most dramatic ruling yet. “As the Trump 2.0 reality show unfolds, as it does daily, often with singular market-moving tweets, we might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance across shipping sectors. Underwhelming spot earnings render shipping sentiment downbeat while we seek greater clarity on today’s geopolitical, trade and social threats,” noted a recent report from broker Hartland Shipping."

        "content": "Australian oil and gas player Karoon Energy has bought theCidade de ItajaíFPSO for $115m from Altera & Ocyan, the joint venture formed by the Brazilian company Ocyan and Altera Infrastructure. The FPSO was bought by Karoon’s wholly-owned Brazilian subsidiary Karoon Petróleo & Gás. The deal also includes approximately $8m of transaction costs. The unit was previously owned and operated by Altera & Ocyan and leased by Karoon for work on the Aussie firm’s Baúna project in the Santos Basin off Brazil. The acquisition is subject to customary approvals and the transaction is set to close by April 30, 2025. The unit has been operating on the Baúna project since the field came onstream in 2013. It was built in 1985 and converted to an FPSO in 2012. It has a fluid handling capacity of around 80,000 barrels of liquid per day and a storage capacity of approximately 631,000 barrels of oil. Karoon revealed that it would contract a new contractor to operate and maintain the FPSO on its behalf, while its Brazilian subsidiary will take over the overall ownership and strategic optimisation plans for the unit. The process of selecting a new contractor has already commenced. The selection is set to be made by mid-2025. Altera & Ocyan will continue to operate the FPSO until the new contractor is ready to take over operations and maintenance services. The acquisition is expected to be funded from existing cash on hand, subject to the timing of closing and near term cashflow. A deposit of $30m has been paid into an escrow account and the balance is payable on closing. “The purchase is economically attractive, generating significant value for shareholders with an expected rate of return comfortably above our mid-teens post-tax hurdle rate and potentially more than 20%. Most importantly, it provides certainty on the availability of the FPSO for the Baúna Project through to the end of field life,” said Julian Fowles, Karoon’s CEO and managing director. The acquisition of the FPSO is also expected to result in approximately a $4-6/bbl net unit operating cost reduction. The savings are anticipated to be realised from 2026 onwards. The expected decrease in operating costs and certainty of the long-term availability of the vessel should allow the field to operate profitably well into the 2030s. According to the company, this will enable access to a portion of the 8.7 – 16.4mbbl of Baúna’s contingent resource (1C to 3C), subject to further technical and commercial evaluation."

        "content": "As the week comes to an end there’s signs that the dry bulk markets – led by capes – are picking up finally. Will this mini-revival be sustainable all the way through to the end of April when Geneva Dry, the global dry bulk summit, returns for its second edition? Alexis Ellender, the lead analyst covering dry bulk for Kpler, reckons a seasonal improvement in cargo availability should have supported a firming in dry bulk markets by late April. Ellender is bullish on the outlook for Brazilian soybean exports, forecasting shipments to be up near 3% year-on-year in Q2. Higher vessel demand, plus associated port congestion, should boost panamax/kamsarmax earnings, he says. As for cape rates, while expecting them to be firmer come the end of April, Ellender says earnings will likely be more in the region they were back in 2023, not last year. There are downside risks to the demand outlook for geared vessels, Ellender warns. China and India are expected to import less seaborne coal this year than last, with a drop of around 60m tonnes year-on-year anticipated across the two countries combined, Kpler is forecasting. Turning off your AIS does not make you disappear anymore Meanwhile tariffs and trade barriers are set to slow the trade in steel products, Ellender cautions. Both of these would hit Pacific demand hardest, with Indonesia coal and Chinese steel product shipments likely to be affected. Geneva Dry has a strong tech focus, with a big team from Kpler, one of the world’s top maritime and commodities analytics companies, due to attend Geneva Dry on April 28 and 29. “For a long time, shipping was an industry that thrived in the shadows. Market information was guarded by those in the know and very few, if any, had a full picture of what was happening,” Ellender recounts. Technological advances and improved data analysis tools mean this is no longer the case, he says. “We now know what almost every vessel is doing,” he says, something that was demonstrated over the past year by the ease with which the shadow fleet of vessels linked to sanctioned countries and cargoes was identified and tracked. “Turning off your AIS does not make you disappear anymore. We have additional data sources and analytical techniques that mean there is nowhere to hide,” he says. Ellender will be speaking at the EVs And The Supercharging Of Dry Bulk session of April 28, an hour’s look at how electric vehicles are changing seaborne trading patterns, joining a host of charterers and shipowners on stage for a brand new panel. Demand for aluminium for use in vehicle manufacturing is set to increase supporting further growth in West Africa-China capesize bauxite trade, Ellender reckons, while he anticipates nickel exports from Southeast Asia will remain firm in the medium term and bulk copper concentrate shipments from South America to China will continue to support Pacific round-voyage trade for geared vessels. As for what the Kpler man is most looking forward to about the upcoming dry bulk summit, Ellender quickly replies: “Showing the dry bulk market that better data and global trade intelligence are their friends and can make money.” Geneva Dry brings together all elements of the commodities shipping sector to host the ultimate dry bulk shipping event. Split into sectors, panels will bring together analysts, financiers, miners, traders and shipowners to discuss where the markets are headed.

        "content": "Japanese shipowner Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) is joining forces with Cyprus-based dry bulk specialist SMT Shipping to jointly explore options for shipping direct reduced iron (DRI). Interest in DRI produced by reducing iron ore with natural gas or hydrogen is developing as the steel sector ramps up attempts to reduce CO2 emissions. MOL, which has been delivering iron ore to steel industries for many years, said that shipping of DRI requires specialised skills and care to prevent overheating and that SMT, with a fleet of over 65 vessels involved in shipping and transshipment of dry bulk cargo, is a world leader in this field. SMT has delivered transshipment solutions at an export operation of iron ore in Sierra Leone since 2021 and an import of iron ore in Trinidad since 2018. The two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding under which MOL committed to bolster the transport capacity of DRI to address increasing demand with necessary safety measures in collaboration with SMT Shipping. “To produce steel via DRI requires high-grade iron ore, not just in terms of Fe content, but also low impurity, something that is spurring the development of the huge Simandou iron ore mine in West Africa,” Derek Langston, global head of dry cargo research at Braemar told the nearly 600 delegates attending last year’s Geneva Dry. With this green transition, Langston said: “There are going to be new trades emerging. There are going to be new centres of steel production,” suggesting both the Middle East and Australia would become more prominent as steel manufacturers."

        "content": "The US offshore wind sector has suffered another knockdown in its bout with US president Donald Trump after EDP Renewables announced it would be postponing its Southcoast Wind project by four years. Portugal’s EDP Renewables said in its investment community conference call that it would be taking a $139m impairment charge on the project. Its partner on the project, Engie, will take the same impairment regardless of the fact that Southcoast Wind is fully permitted. The project, formerly known as Mayflower Wind, waspermittedon January 18 this year, only two days before the offshore wind-slaying current US president entered the White House. Construction of the 2.4GW offshore wind project off the coast of Massachusetts was supposed to begin in 2025. It was scheduled to be operational in 2030. After the decision by the developers, construction is now set to begin in 2029. According to EDP Renewables, final negotiations with Massachusetts were underway, financing and the interconnects were in place, and it even claimed that the project had an attractive PPA. Miguel Stilwell d’Andrade, chief executive of EDP Renewables, said during the call that it decided to take “the more prudent approach given recent executive orders and permit reviews”. However, the company has made it clear that it does not intend to abandon the project. Ocean Winds, a 50-50 joint venture between EDP Renewables and Engie and the developer of Southcoast Wind, also has leases for the Bluepoint Wind and the Golden State Wind projects in the New York Bight and California respectively. This decision comes only days after French energy major EDFwrote down $940min the value of its stake in the Atlantic Shores wind energy project off New Jersey after its former partner in the project, Shell, did the same last month. Last week, energy supermajor BPwithdrew its applicationfor the 320-kilometre-long cable and interconnection plan for its Beacon Wind project in US federal waters between Cape Cod and Long Island."

        "content": "A Venezuelan military ship was spotted in Guyana’s waters on Saturday morning sailing close to ExxonMobil’s producing FPSO claiming that the units were operating in “a disputed area”. In a national address, Guyana president Irfaan Ali revealed that the Venezuelan vessel, which entered Guyanese waters on Saturday morning, was part of its coast guard fleet. “During this incursion, the Venezuelan vessel approached various assets in our exclusive waters including FPSOProsperity. The patrol vessel transmitted a radio message declaring that the FPSO was operating in what it terms ‘disputed international waters’ before continuing its course southwesterly towards other FPSOs,” Ali said. He noted “unequivocally” that Guyana’s maritime boundaries are recognised under international law and that “this incursion is a matter of grave concern” President Ali has already informed the chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), an intergovernmental organisation that is a political and economic union of 15 member states and five associated members throughout the Americas, the Caribbean, the Atlantic Ocean, and other international partners of the incident. Reportedly, the CARICOM chair has already contacted the Venezuelan government on the issue. There are hundreds of Guyanese and other workers on various vessels involved in oil production in Guyana’s Stabroek offshore block. Monitoring of the area has been increased and the country’s coast guard will also dispatch more teams to the area. Venezuela has been laying claims to Guyana’s territory for the longest time even though the dispute was settled in 1899. The two are currently before the International Court seeking a final juridical settlement regarding the ownership of the 160,000 sq km Esequibo area. The US State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere reacted to the incursion as well, in a way protecting the interests of the US-based supermajor. It condemned the actions, describing them as “an unacceptable threat to Guyana’s internationally-recognised maritime territory”. “Venezuelan naval vessels threatening ExxonMobil’s FPSO unit is unacceptable and a clear violation of Guyana’s internationally-recognised maritime territory. Further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime. The United States reaffirms its support for Guyana’s territorial integrity and the 1899 arbitral award,” the statement said."

The company has applied for trading on Nasqad and Toro shareholders will get one common share of Robin in exchange for eight shares in Toro. “The Board believes that the creation of a business in a distinct sector of the shipping industry will provide significant benefits to both companies and their shareholders. “The transaction is expected to enable each of Toro and Robin to increase its focus on their respective line of businesses, enhance operational efficiencies, facilitate efficient strategic expansion, attract new investors, and, with this dividend distribution of Robin common shares, give Toro shareholders the flexibility to monetise or adjust their equity holdings according to the shipping sectors in which they want to invest,” the company said in a release. Castor spun off its eight-strong tanker fleet into Toro in 2022. Seven vessels have since been sold at a profit. The outfit expanded into the LPG arena with an en-bloc acquisition of four 5,000 cu m vessels in April 2023 and if the spinoff goes according to plan, Toro will move forward as an LPG carrier pure-play.

        "content": "Claudia Paschkewitz, director of sustainability, diversity and inclusion at Columbia Group, writes about the impact Donald Trump’s rulings on DEI will have on the maritime industry. US President Donald Trump’s recent ruling against diversity and inclusivity measures is a step backwards in the progress that has been made around the world, and it could have rippling effects through the maritime industry. We have been making great strides in opening the discussion in the maritime industry around bullying and harassment and promoting ourselves as an open and inclusive industry for seafarers. Through training and awareness initiatives, we have encouraged our workforce to welcome diverse crew members and appreciate the different strengths and skills they can bring to a team. Despite this, if often feels as though we are moving one step forward and two steps back. This tug-of-war between progression and regression has recently taken a sudden turn as major cooperations such as Google and McDonalds began rolling back their DEI initiatives following Trump’s executive order that ruled against affirmative action and Diversity, Equity and Inclusivity initiatives. Whilst this decision predominantly impacts transgender individuals that serve in the US military, it sends a troubling message and implications that will ripple across other industries, including maritime. Maritime has long been a diverse industry by nature of the cultures it employs onboard ship, relying on its skilled global workforce that brings together a plethora of different cultures, ethnicities, traditions, and beliefs. Without this, the industry would be unsustainable. Limiting opportunities and restricting one’s talent based on identity rather than skill undermines career progression as well as the evolution of the entire industry itself. Diversity is about having top talent. At Columbia Group, we are committed to lifelong learning and allowing seafarers to have control over their careers and learning. We look for hidden talent. It’s all about people for us, it doesn’t matter their race, sexuality or political persuasions, as long as the fit is right, the rest can all be developed. You can’t develop someone into being the right fit. Without diverse talent, maritime risks stagnation, failing to adapt to an evolving world. Discussions with Charles Watkins, CEO at Mental Health Support Solutions (MHSS) and member of OneCare Group (OCG), have highlighted it is evident that there is a real need for support amongst seafarers, particularly those form underrepresented backgrounds who are already at a disadvantage to their peers. Long working hours, a lack of connectivity, and various safety risks have already plagued the industry in recent months, and we do not need to add another factor into the equation. MHSS has recently welcomed a psychologist specialising in the LGBTQ+ community to its team to ensure someone is on hand to help people should they need it. It is initiatives likes these that highlight how far we have come and how damaging these extreme new measures will be. Beyond recruitment, retention is another issue. The younger generations are demanding a sense of social responsibility amongst their peers both inside and outside of the workplace. Gen-Z and Millennials are becoming increasingly vocal on the need for professional environments that share similar values to their own, particularly regarding the topics of diversity and inclusion. Dismissing these expectations not only risks losing future industry leaders and innovators but weakens maritime’s position compared to other sectors. Many industries such as technology and healthcare have already been seen to embrace inclusivity, recognising its crucial role in driving long-term success. Fostering an environment where individuals feel supported and valued is more than just the right thing to do. It is essential."

        "content": "Joy Basu, CEO of Smart Ship Hub, on why shipping needs to think predictive and not scheduled when it comes to looking after vessels. The transition to predictive maintenance is not just an upgrade it is the future of shipping as companies in their droves adopt technical innovations to ensure the best possible standard of care and quality of life for vessels. Scheduled maintenance has long been the standard in the shipping industry, where equipment and vessel components are serviced based on predefined intervals. However, this approach is increasingly outdated in the face of modern predictive maintenance technologies, which use data-driven insights to optimise maintenance schedules. The industry is already seeing a shift toward predictive maintenance with advancements in digital twin technology, AI-driven analytics, and cloud-based fleet management. Companies that embrace these innovations will gain a competitive edge, reduce operational risks, and enhance profitability. By monitoring engine performance, fuel consumption, and other critical parameters, predictive maintenance helps optimise ship efficiency. This leads to better fuel management, lower emissions, and improved operational performance. Shipping companies that continue relying on scheduled maintenance will face higher costs, inefficiencies, and regulatory challenges. Predictive maintenance is not just an upgrade—it’s the future.Investing in data-driven, AI-powered maintenance strategies today will ensure long-term profitability, sustainability, and a competitive edge in the evolving maritime industry. Traditionally the maritime industry has worked on scheduled maintenance which operates on a predetermined timeline, not on actual equipment condition. This often leads to either: The primary difference between condition-based vs. predictive maintenance is that the latter combines sensor measurements with precise algorithmic formulas to predict the exact moment when maintenance actions should be taken. Timely and effective maintenance of seagoing vessels is fundamental to the maritime industry’s core business of transporting cargo from A to B as safely and efficiently as possible. Well-maintained ships experience fewer unexpected failures or breakdowns, reducing the potential for accidents, delays and disruptions, while safeguarding the lives of the crews serving onboard. While vessel maintenance necessarily incurs costs, careful asset management should ultimately lead to savings by preventing more expensive repairs or replacements that could result from neglect or deferred action. Effective maintenance can also help to improve fuel efficiency and reduce other operational expenses by allowing the ship to sail in condition as close to optimal as possible, creating benefits for both the shipping company and the environment. The evolution of condition-based maintenance (CBM) has helped to increase the effectiveness of vessel care processes, moving away from a reliance on averages and statistical assumptions to an approach tailored specifically to the equipment or asset being maintained. Scheduling maintenance activities based on the actual condition of the equipment, rather than following a fixed calendar-based timetable, allows for resources to be deployed more efficiently and for the impact of maintenance procedures on vessel operations to be minimised. Current maintenance practices within the shipping industry typically involve a range of common processes and requirements that present significant opportunities for optimisation. Multiple stakeholders, including ship owners, classification societies and equipment manufacturers, all have a role to play in managing maintenance, but processes suffer from a lack of direct integration between the parties. The philosophy behind predictive maintenance, however, is to only perform those tasks when they are actually needed to ensure optimal uptime on the equipment. This generally means condition-based monitoring to ensure that maintenance is triggered when assets meet certain predetermined conditions. The maritime sector undoubtedly faces a range of challenges, both technical and structural, in deploying efficient and effective condition-based maintenance systems. However, many of these challenges could be substantially alleviated by integrating data and analytics-driven methods into the maintenance workflow and creating a data-driven condition-based maintenance (DCBM) process. By integrating data analytics with traditional maintenance methods, the industry has the potential to significantly improve both the reliability and operational efficiency of marine vessels. This will require the development of analytics-based diagnostic systems, real-time monitoring solutions, and comprehensive digital platforms to remove errors and inefficiencies from traditional processes and optimise workflows. The industry is already seeing a shift toward predictive maintenance with advancements in digital twin technology, AI-driven analytics, and cloud-based fleet management. Companies that embrace these innovations will gain a competitive edge, reduce operational risks, and enhance profitability."

        "content": "John Fredriksen-backed Paratus Energy Services has received a notice from an unnamed client that it would be exercising its options for early termination of the drilling contracts for two of Paratus’ jackups. The notice was given to the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Fontis Holdings. The earlier termination of the contracts for the 2007-builtCourageousand the 2008-builtIntrepidjackups will reduce Fontis’ backlog to approximately $39m, corresponding to 3% of Paratus’ overall $1.2bn backlog. The reasons cited for the early termination include unfavourable contract terms, such as limited suspension rights and indexation structure of dayrates, and economic considerations. The client, however, did not suggest that the action was driven by a reduced operational need for drilling rigs in 2026. Paratus believes that this action might enable the client to better align contractual terms across its service providers during 2026. Following this decision, the client has no remaining contractual flexibility to further shorten the contracts for any of Fontis’ rigs. In the company’s opinion, higher drilling activity will be required to meet the stated production goals of its client in Mexico. Regardless, Fontis will continue to explore opportunities for its fleet both inside and outside of this region. The drilling contracts for theCourageousand theIntrepidwill now expire on February 28, 2026, as opposed to their original expiration date of November 29, 2026, and May 27, 2026, respectively. Even though the client was not revealed, the two jackups have been under contract with Mexican giant Pemex for many years. Last week, the company was awarded a 78-day contract extension for theOberonrig. Paratus claimed in the Oslo Bors filing that all Fontis rigs are currently on contract and, with the exception of theTitania, all rigs are contracted into 2026. Paratus currently has all its 11 assets under contract, with 10 contracted into next year or beyond, and the majority of contracts extend into 2027 or 2028."

Through training and awareness initiatives, we have encouraged our workforce to welcome diverse crew members and appreciate the different strengths and skills they can bring to a team. Despite this, if often feels as though we are moving one step forward and two steps back. This tug-of-war between progression and regression has recently taken a sudden turn as major cooperations such as Google and McDonalds began rolling back their DEI initiatives following Trump’s executive order that ruled against affirmative action and Diversity, Equity and Inclusivity initiatives. Whilst this decision predominantly impacts transgender individuals that serve in the US military, it sends a troubling message and implications that will ripple across other industries, including maritime. Maritime has long been a diverse industry by nature of the cultures it employs onboard ship, relying on its skilled global workforce that brings together a plethora of different cultures, ethnicities, traditions, and beliefs. Without this, the industry would be unsustainable. Limiting opportunities and restricting one’s talent based on identity rather than skill undermines career progression as well as the evolution of the entire industry itself. Diversity is about having top talent. At Columbia Group, we are committed to lifelong learning and allowing seafarers to have control over their careers and learning. We look for hidden talent. It’s all about people for us, it doesn’t matter their race, sexuality or political persuasions, as long as the fit is right, the rest can all be developed. You can’t develop someone into being the right fit. Without diverse talent, maritime risks stagnation, failing to adapt to an evolving world. Discussions with Charles Watkins, CEO at Mental Health Support Solutions (MHSS) and member of OneCare Group (OCG), have highlighted it is evident that there is a real need for support amongst seafarers, particularly those form underrepresented backgrounds who are already at a disadvantage to their peers. Long working hours, a lack of connectivity, and various safety risks have already plagued the industry in recent months, and we do not need to add another factor into the equation. MHSS has recently welcomed a psychologist specialising in the LGBTQ+ community to its team to ensure someone is on hand to help people should they need it. It is initiatives likes these that highlight how far we have come and how damaging these extreme new measures will be. Beyond recruitment, retention is another issue. The younger generations are demanding a sense of social responsibility amongst their peers both inside and outside of the workplace. Gen-Z and Millennials are becoming increasingly vocal on the need for professional environments that share similar values to their own, particularly regarding the topics of diversity and inclusion. Dismissing these expectations not only risks losing future industry leaders and innovators but weakens maritime’s position compared to other sectors. Many industries such as technology and healthcare have already been seen to embrace inclusivity, recognising its crucial role in driving long-term success. Fostering an environment where individuals feel supported and valued is more than just the right thing to do. It is essential."

Seabed gas pipelines, power cables and fibre optic cables have all been attacked – likely by merchant ships dragging their anchors – in recent months across the Baltic, forcing NATO to establish Baltic Sentry, a naval protection operation. Baltic Sentry involves a range of assets, including frigates, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and drones. A joint statement from the heads of state or government of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden earlier this year noted: “Russia’s use of the so-called shadow fleet poses a particular threat to the maritime and environmental security in the Baltic Sea region and globally. This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.”"

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Joy Basu, CEO of Smart Ship Hub, on why shipping needs to think predictive and not scheduled when it comes to looking after vessels. The transition to predictive maintenance is not just an upgrade it is the future of shipping as companies in their droves adopt technical innovations to ensure the best possible standard of care and quality of life for vessels. Scheduled maintenance has long been the standard in the shipping industry, where equipment and vessel components are serviced based on predefined intervals. However, this approach is increasingly outdated in the face of modern predictive maintenance technologies, which use data-driven insights to optimise maintenance schedules. The industry is already seeing a shift toward predictive maintenance with advancements in digital twin technology, AI-driven analytics, and cloud-based fleet management. Companies that embrace these innovations will gain a competitive edge, reduce operational risks, and enhance profitability. By monitoring engine performance, fuel consumption, and other critical parameters, predictive maintenance helps optimise ship efficiency. This leads to better fuel management, lower emissions, and improved operational performance. Shipping companies that continue relying on scheduled maintenance will face higher costs, inefficiencies, and regulatory challenges. Predictive maintenance is not just an upgrade—it’s the future.Investing in data-driven, AI-powered maintenance strategies today will ensure long-term profitability, sustainability, and a competitive edge in the evolving maritime industry. Traditionally the maritime industry has worked on scheduled maintenance which operates on a predetermined timeline, not on actual equipment condition. This often leads to either: The primary difference between condition-based vs. predictive maintenance is that the latter combines sensor measurements with precise algorithmic formulas to predict the exact moment when maintenance actions should be taken. Timely and effective maintenance of seagoing vessels is fundamental to the maritime industry’s core business of transporting cargo from A to B as safely and efficiently as possible. Well-maintained ships experience fewer unexpected failures or breakdowns, reducing the potential for accidents, delays and disruptions, while safeguarding the lives of the crews serving onboard. While vessel maintenance necessarily incurs costs, careful asset management should ultimately lead to savings by preventing more expensive repairs or replacements that could result from neglect or deferred action. Effective maintenance can also help to improve fuel efficiency and reduce other operational expenses by allowing the ship to sail in condition as close to optimal as possible, creating benefits for both the shipping company and the environment. The evolution of condition-based maintenance (CBM) has helped to increase the effectiveness of vessel care processes, moving away from a reliance on averages and statistical assumptions to an approach tailored specifically to the equipment or asset being maintained. Scheduling maintenance activities based on the actual condition of the equipment, rather than following a fixed calendar-based timetable, allows for resources to be deployed more efficiently and for the impact of maintenance procedures on vessel operations to be minimised. Current maintenance practices within the shipping industry typically involve a range of common processes and requirements that present significant opportunities for optimisation. Multiple stakeholders, including ship owners, classification societies and equipment manufacturers, all have a role to play in managing maintenance, but processes suffer from a lack of direct integration between the parties. The philosophy behind predictive maintenance, however, is to only perform those tasks when they are actually needed to ensure optimal uptime on the equipment. This generally means condition-based monitoring to ensure that maintenance is triggered when assets meet certain predetermined conditions. The maritime sector undoubtedly faces a range of challenges, both technical and structural, in deploying efficient and effective condition-based maintenance systems. However, many of these challenges could be substantially alleviated by integrating data and analytics-driven methods into the maintenance workflow and creating a data-driven condition-based maintenance (DCBM) process. By integrating data analytics with traditional maintenance methods, the industry has the potential to significantly improve both the reliability and operational efficiency of marine vessels. This will require the development of analytics-based diagnostic systems, real-time monitoring solutions, and comprehensive digital platforms to remove errors and inefficiencies from traditional processes and optimise workflows. The industry is already seeing a shift toward predictive maintenance with advancements in digital twin technology, AI-driven analytics, and cloud-based fleet management. Companies that embrace these innovations will gain a competitive edge, reduce operational risks, and enhance profitability."

        "headline": "BP cuts renewables investments by $5bn, sets sights firmly on oil and gas",
        "publication_date": "2025-03-01T18:13:23+08:00",
        "author": "Bojan Lepic",
        "content": "UK-based energy giant BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead increase its investment in oil and gas production. The company buckled under pressure from investors who were unhappy over the company’s underperformance compared to its main rivals such as Shell and ExxonMobil. For example, BP shares have risen by 36% from the end of February 2020 until February 25, 2025. Shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively. As a result of the investor’s demands, BP stated that it would increase its investments in oil and gas from about $8.5bn a year to $10bn. At the same time, the company would decrease previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn. BP’s capex on low carbon will be around $2bn over the next two years, which is $10bn less than previous plans. In 2023, the company expected to spend $30bn during the decade. Now it sets a limit of spending $4bn by 2030. The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3m and 2.5m bopd by 2030, with hopes of major oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027. BP boss Murray Auchincloss said at the company’s capital markets day event that this was a “reset” of the UK firm and that BP misplaced its optimism for a fast transition. He added that the energy giant went “too far, too fast” in its efforts to cut its oil and gas business and shift to renewable energy. This shift has been the primary focus of the company since previous CEO Bernard Looney unveiled plans in 2020 to cut hydrocarbon production by 40% and increase spending on wind farms, solar, hydrogen, and other clean energy types. The company also announced plans to raise $20bn by selling assets. Its 125-year-old Castrol business will be reviewed ahead of a potential sale. BP will also seek a joint venture partner for its Lightsource solar business similar to the agreement it has with Jera for its offshore wind investments. BP’s EVP for regions, cities, and solutions William Lin stated that solar and offshore wind sectors have been affected by inflation while hydrogen investments ran into policy issues and higher costs combined with reduced customer willingness to pay. Another savings method from BP was a plan for a staff reduction of 5%. This includes 4,700 BP staff and 3,000 contractors. However, BP is not alone in this pivot as Shell and Equinor have also announced their plans to reduce green energy investments. The decision is partly political as US president Donald Trump announced it would be firmly behind fossil fuels with his “drill baby drill” policy. The moratorium on offshore wind in the US is also a firm sign of where Trump’s energy policies lie."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Splashturns 10 today, the site covering one of shipping’s most tumultuous decades on record. Chinese shipyards going under or restructuring and capes heading for the scrap heap dominated headlines on March 4, 2015 in what was by common consent a far easier time to be covering the shipping and offshore industries, a period where supply and demand statistics were easier to gauge and geopolitics did not weigh so heavily on the sector’s fortunes. Tim Wilkins, the managing director of INTERTANKO, recounted: “Back in 2015, the industry’s challenges seemed more clearly defined. Issues such as security threats and reducing greenhouse gas emissions were distinct focus areas with well-outlined solutions.” Wilkins went on to discuss how the “complexity” and sheer volume of challenges have grown significantly, most notably thanks to geopolitics. “The key change is in shipping’s risk profile: 10 years ago shipping risk was all about safety, oil spills, piracy and ISPS; shipping risk today is about ESG, geopolitics and sanctions,” said Mark Williams, the founder of UK consultancy Shipping Strategy, adding: “The costs of compliance have risen fast but the costs of non-compliance have risen enormously and can even be existential.” Michael Grey, one of the most famous editors of shipping titles over the past 50 years, commented onSplash’s anniversary: “It’s been 10 years of huge and increasing challenges to be faced, arising from the green agenda – right or wrong – peak globalisation now facing its own existential threats and growing political instability.” The news cycle – and by extension shipping cycles – have accelerated and shortened sinceSplashwas created, a viewpoint picked up by Andy Dacy, managing director of the global transportation group at JP Morgan Asset Management. “Geopolitics, wars, pandemics, financial crises, and regulation have all buffeted shipping over the past 10 years. We’ve seen more of these in a shorter time span than before,” Dacy toldSplash. Discussing the past decade’s “seismic shifts” for shipping, Bjorn Hojgaard, who heads up Anglo-Eastern, the world’s largest shipmanger, said decarbonisation, digitalisation, and geopolitical changes have rewritten the rulebook. “The industry has had to become more transparent, more accountable, and more technologically agile than ever before,” Hojgaard said. Nick Brown, the CEO of Lloyd’s Register, conceded that global trade has been tested by an extraordinary set of challenges over the past decade, listing the likes of the pandemic, sanctions, tariffs, and war, all of which, he said exposed vulnerabilities in the supply chain and highlighted the vital yet under-recognised role of seafarers. Fleet growth In the past 10 years, according to Dr Martin Stopford, the world’s most famous maritime economist, the shipping fleet in dwt terms has grown by a third, and earning are up by about 40%. After decades of slim margins, the big liner companies finally joined tankers and bulkers in what Stopford described as the “super-boom club”. “Tankers had theirs in 1973 and bulkers in 2008, so it was a long wait. But what a lot they made,” Stopford said of the liner boom recorded in the 2020s. Regionally, the epicentre of sea trade continued its move towards the Pacific. In 2015 Atlantic and Pacific seaborne trade – including imports and exports – were roughly the same – about 45% each. Now the Pacific is about 50%, and the Atlantic about 40%, according to data from Stopford. China’s share of shipbuilding has jumped from 36% to 51% in the period sinceSplashstarted, but sea trade growth has slowed to 1.8% per annum, half the long-term trend of 3-4% per year. Green transition? Dr Roar Adland, a protege of Stopford’s who now heads up research at broker SSY, said of the period sinceSplash’s debut: “It was the decade when Chinese demand growth finally decelerated, geopolitical drivers came back with a vengeance and the green transition in shipping turned out to be what we all suspected – all talk and no action.” Guy Platten, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping, hailed shipping’s “remarkable transformation” over the past decade, driving progress, resilience, and sustainability on a global scale. Platten took issue with Adland’s take on the industry’s decarbonisation, claiming shipping is now at the forefront of the energy transition and several steps ahead of regulators. Johannah Christensen, head of the not-for-profit Global Maritime Forum, agreed with Platten, maintaining that the industry had moved over the past 10 years from being a green laggard to a frontrunner among the hard-to-abate sector. The workforce Among other key changes experienced in the past 10 years has been the global sulphur cap, and the growing regulatory requirements on compliance. Also of importance, as highlighted by Mikael Skov, who heads up Hafnia, the world’s largest product tanker owner, has been the the entrance – and exit – of private equity in shipping. Among the greatest changes has been in the workforce – and attitudes to work. Lena Göthberg, whose Shipping Podcast will celebrate its own 10th anniversary this July, toldSplash: “10 years ago, we discussed autonomous ships and SOx. Over the last decade, we have learned about M2M, ESG, and DEI. The shipping industry is catching up with the rest of the world, we have become digitalised, greener, and are recognising the need for gender balance.” Heidi Heseltine, founder and CEO of the Diversity Study Group, said that in relation to people and workplace culture, the biggest change has been the industry increasingly moving towards a strategic, data-driven and inclusive approach in order to attract and retain the best possible talent who can meet the challenges and opportunities presented by issues like decarbonisation, emerging technologies, and an increasing demand for data to inform strategic decision making and harnessing the benefits of AI. Plus ça change So just how much has shipping changed in the 10 yearsSplashhas been covering the industry? “Volatility, excitement, drama, politics and plenty of great characters and stories are still in the industry,” said Ed Buttery, the CEO of British shipowner Taylor Maritime. While he conceded there is a greater focus on the environment, social and corporate governance, and corporate M&A, he said: “Thankfully we remain an industry that respects tradition and embraces innovation”. Brown, the head of LR, argued that during this time of complex challenges, the sector has reached a turning point in its energy transition, developing a broader shift towards multifuel solutions. “The next decade will determine the shape of the industry’s long-term sustainability, demanding not just technological advancements but also greater investment in seafarers and human capital, which remain fundamental to creating the long-term change we need,” Brown said. Concluding, Kuba Szymanski, the secretary-general of InterManager, commented: “It is difficult to believe how many of the issues that were around in 2015 are still with us andSplashhas always been there for us to report on them.” Today we celebrate ten years since Splash was launched!pic.twitter.com/KjI03r8aZk"

        "content": "US president Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs against his country’s top three trading partners has sparked retaliatory action, launching new trade conflicts. On Tuesday, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports, as well as a 20% duty on Chinese goods. China responded in kind, imposing extra 10%-15% tariffs on some US imports beginning in March, as well as a series of new export restrictions for certain US firms. Canada, which has had an almost tariff-free trade relationship with the US for about three decades, was ready to strike quickly against its long-time partner, while Mexico with similar trade ties with the US is expected to announce its response later today. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would respond with 25% tariffs on about $21bn worth of US imports and another $86bn if Trump’s tariffs were still in place in 21 days. “Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship,” Trudeau said, adding that they would violate the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement signed by Trump during his first term. Two of the biggest commodities coming out of Canada that are likely to be impacted by US tariffs are fuel and lumber. Canada is America’s largest foreign supplier of crude. The additional 10% duty on Chinese imports adds to the 10% tariff imposed by Trump in February. The cumulative 20% levy is in addition to tariffs of up to 25% imposed by Trump during his first term on about $370bn in US imports. As part of its retaliatory action against the US, China’s new tariffs target a wide range of US agricultural products, including certain meats, grains, cotton, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products. Trump’s first-term trade wars hit US farmers hard, costing them about $27bn in lost export sales. China’s commerce ministry said the US tariffs violated World Trade Organization rules and “undermine the basis for economic and trade cooperation between China and the US” Trump has maintained a blazing pace of tariff acts since taking office in January, including fully reinstated 25% duties on steel and aluminium imports, which go into force in March. “We argue that higher costs from fresh tariffs could hurt consumer demand, albeit this may lead to some front-loading in the near term until clarity emerges, followed by inventory drawdowns during 2H 2025. This would likely further pressure shipping rates,” analysts at HSBC Global Research said. “These new tariffs are compounding rapidly. Amid other hints at hitting hard on the EU and other allies as well, each HTS code of tariffs snowballs into a growing – and potentially crushing – burden on American businesses and hardworking American families,” remarked Steve Lamar, American Apparel & Footwear Association president and CEO. Tariffs have been a feature of Trump’s first administration as well as by his successor, Joe Biden and yet data from Linerlytica shows loaded container imports into the US outpaced exports by 2.4 times in 2024, a statistic that analysts at Linerlytica said in a weekly report provides “clear evidence that import tariffs imposed since 2018 have been completely ineffective” in reducing the US trade imbalance. Total laden imports grew by 24% between 2017 and 2024, the Linerlytica data shows, while laden exports shrunk by 8% over the same period, driving a 54% increase in the number of empty containers repositioned out of the US."

        "author": "Bojan Lepic",
        "content": "The global offshore wind industry is poised for a rebound in 2025, with capacity additions expected to reach 19GW and sector-wide expenditure projected to hit $80bn, a new Rystad Energy report suggests. This recovery follows a slowdown at the end of last year when new installations dropped to approximately 8GW which is 2GW lower than the year prior. A record wave of lease auctions is driving the resurgence, with the world’s largest offshore wind market, mainland China, accounting for 65% of new capacity. With this increase, Rystad believes that total additions will exceed the previous peak in 2021 by about 1GW, surpassing the 7.7GW added in 2024, 10.2GW in 2023, and 9.3GW in 2022. A record 55GW of offshore wind capacity was offered in lease auctions globally in 2024, excluding mainland China. However, not all this capacity has yet been awarded, as offered capacity does not always translate into awarded capacity. For instance, the US saw no bids for its 3GW floating wind auction in Oregon last year, while the Gulf of Maine auction awarded roughly 7GW of the approximately 13GW offered. Despite 2024’s record offerings, Rystad claims that the lease auction openings are projected to decline in 2025, with an expected 30-40GW available. While significantly lower than 2024, this projected offered capacity is aligned with levels seen in 2021 and 2022. The intelligence firm said in the report that the global offshore wind would have a robust year in 2025 but also sees signals that could affect its smooth upward trajectory. Most important of which is the US federal policy which is creating significant global ripple effects hindering offshore wind development, especially where a large portion of auctioned capacity lies. President Donald Trump’s executive order from January halting new leasing and approvals on the Outer Continental Shelf, citing environmental and safety concerns, could last throughout his term pausing new developments and creating continued uncertainty for ongoing projects, “Project delays significantly impacted final investment decisions for new offshore wind projects in 2024, leading to a decline in project approvals. Notably, 2024 saw only a few US projects reach FID, including Empire Wind 1, Sunrise Wind, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. We expect to see around the same level of FIDs this year as last in Europe and Asia, and some possible upside in the US with US Wind, Southcoast Wind, and New England Wind projects obtaining offtake agreements and construction and operation approvals. The latter two just postponed signing offtake contracts until March this year,” said Petra Manuel, senior offshore wind analyst at Rystad. Despite a slower 2024, the year saw developers advance projects like Red Rock Power and ESB’s 1.1GW Inch Cape in the UK, and Equinor’s 810MW Empire Wind 1 in the US. Other wind farms reaching FID in 2024 include Iberdrola’s 315MW Windanker in Germany, RWE and TotalEnergies’ 795MW OranjeWind in the Netherlands, and Orsted’s 924MW Sunrise Wind 1 in the US. Rystad believes that the UK, Poland, and Germany are set to lead a surge in European FIDs in 2025, reaching 9.5GW with several projects in these countries on track for final approval. Poland is expected to see multiple major wind farms reach FID including Polenergia and Equinor’s Baltyk II and III, following the recent FID for Orsted and PGE’s Baltica 2."

        "content": "The latest ship accused of damaging cables off Taiwan had a simple way of changing identity. Taiwan’s coast guard detained a cargo ship and its Chinese crew a week ago. The vessel is suspected of damaging the cable connecting Taiwan to its outlying Penghu Islands. The Togo-flaggedHongtai 68was able to change its name many times as the crews simply replaced three steel plates (pictured) at its stern and on its bow whereby it has also recently traded as theHongtai 58andShanmei 7. The captain of the vessel – dubbed in local media as the ‘thousand faces ship’ – had on an earlier occasion been caught entering Taiwan with false documents. While this Chinese-backed ship shuffled steel plates to create new names, over in Europe efforts to cover up shadow ship identities are often extremely slapdash. Russian-linked ships often get crews to crudely obscure vessel identities, contravening laws established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Yörük Işık, who describes himself on social media as an obsessive ship spotter along the Bosporus, has tracked “dozens” of vessels where original names – and even IMO numbers – have been painted over. Işık toldSplashlast year that Russians increasingly did not care about how the repainted ship names looked. “There are more and more homemade efforts to write names, ridiculously small, crooked, or written by people who are not familiar with Latin letters,” Işık said. Back in Taiwan, the island blacklisted 52 Chinese-owned ships in January that operate under flags of convenience in the wake of the severing of another subsea communications cable. Taiwan’s National Coast Guard Administration identified a Cameroon-registered cargo ship,Shunxin 39, as the suspect in the earlier incident. Taiwan’s National Security Bureau has said ships which have previously been found to misreport information will be put on a list of ships for priority inspection at ports. Moreover, if these ships enter within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan’s coast and are close to where undersea cables are, the coast guard will be dispatched to board them and investigate."

        "content": "Wily, shady entrepreneurs are scanning world maps to seek ever more distant outposts to establish ship registers to help grease the flows of the dark fleet. France and The Netherlands have submitted a paper to the International Maritime Organization’s legal committee about the emergence of two new shipping flags with questionable credentials, one in the Caribbean and the other, a disputed, uninhabited volcanic island in the South Pacific. The submission hits out at what is described as the “fraudulent” registers of Sint Maarten and Matthew Island. MSTA Registry – International Maritime Registries & Regulatory Inc is “posing” as the register of Sint Maarten, the paper warns. Sint Maarten, part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, is a country on the southern part of a Caribbean island shared with Saint Martin, a French overseas collectivity. More perverse is the new Maritime Administration of Matthew Island, a flag created on a 0.7 sq km rocky outcrop (pictured) where there are no inhabitants. Matthew Island is located in the South Pacific, 300 km east of New Caledonia and southeast of Vanuatu. The island is claimed by Vanuatu, and considered by the people of Aneityum as part of their custom ownership, but also claimed by France as part of New Caledonia. The IMO has had to contend with a raft of fraudulent registers emerging in step with the growth of the shadow fleet this decade. The UK has been leading a bid to stamp out falsely flagged ships at the IMO. In a January submission to the IMO’s legal committee, backed by 21 other countries, the UK counted that the number of falsely flagged vessels has more than doubled to 223 ships in the space of just 22 months. Tankers and general cargo ships are the worst offenders. “This is clear evidence that there is an adverse impact from fraudulent ship registration and fraudulent registries of ships in terms of maritime safety, security, environmental consequences and most importantly the human element, especially seafarers on board ships which are fraudulently registered,” the paper said. The investigation suggested that many flag states were under-resourced, while the decision by some states to outsource flag administration was also seen as a reason for the soaring number of falsely flagged ships. The UK said guidelines are needed to assist flags and developing states in improving registration quality and standards, thereby potentially preventing fraud."

        "content": "A study by Polish researchers claims that moving vessels on the Baltic Sea are responsible for an escalation in GPS disruptions in the region. The study observed GPS interruption at a ground level with a sensor installed at Gdynia Maritime University in the north of Poland, some 120 km from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The sensor monitored activity over a period of six months starting from June last year but could only cover the Gulf of Gdańsk, not the main east-west sea lanes of the central Baltic, where the vast majority of the region’s traffic occurs. The sensor picked up 84 hours of GPS interference, including 29 hours in October alone. Some disruptions lasted up to seven hours at a time, which is sometimes enough to affect navigation in confined waterways. “Given the system’s radio horizon, which primarily covers a portion of the Baltic Sea, and assuming that the interference source was not located within Poland’s borders, the most plausible explanation is that the jamming originated from a vessel in international waters,” the researchers concluded. There have been reports earlier of special equipment found on shadow fleet ships, including theEagle S(pictured), a tanker accused of severing a cable in December last year. “To mitigate these risks, there is an urgent need for a dedicated GNSS interference monitoring network along the Baltic Sea coast. Such a network would provide real-time, localized data to accurately assess threats, detect interference sources, and enhance infrastructure resilience against GNSS disruptions,” the authors of the new study compiled by GPSPATRON and Gdynia Maritime University, warning that failure to do so could potentially lead to “severe operational and security consequences”."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Helio Vicente, director of employment affair at the International Chamber of Shipping, has been appointed coordinator of a task force focusing on the database for seafarer abandonment. Here he shares ways to increase the visibility of this pressing issue. Seafarer abandonment is a growing concern that continues to undermine the rights and well-being of maritime workers worldwide. While there are nearly 2m seafarers worldwide, most of whom do not have these experiences, the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) is deeply concerned about the increasing number of these abandonment cases. This is why we are honoured to be coordinating a newly established international task force, which held its inaugural meeting on February 21. The task force will be dedicated to reviewing and updating the joint International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO) abandonment database, alongside national governments and other interested parties such as the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF). The scale of the problem According to ITF, the number of seafarers abandoned has nearly doubled in just one year, with 3,133 seafarers reportedly abandoned in 2024, compared to the 1,676 reported by ITF for 2023. Likewise, the most recent joint annual report by ILO and IMO, suggests that the 2024 abandonment figures excessively surpassed all the previous years’ records, highlighting the urgent need for coordinated action and better enforcement of existing regulations. The role of the task force The abandonment of seafarers is not just a statistic—it is a harmful reality for those affected. While various stakeholders have worked tirelessly to support abandoned crews, there is a consensus that gaps remain in the reporting, classification, and resolution of cases. The ILO and IMO first established a joint abandonment database in 2002 to provide transparency and monitor incidents. However, in 2016, concerns were raised about unreported cases and outdated information within the database, which underscored the need for improvements. The newly established task force, coordinated by ICS, aims to address these issues by ensuring the database is comprehensive, accurate, and regularly updated. This is a crucial step toward providing the reliable data needed to facilitate timely interventions and policy decisions. Our primary objectives include: Tackling seafarer abandonment requires a united front. The task force brings together governments, industry bodies, and labour representatives to ensure a comprehensive approach. So far, participants in the task force include China, Hong Kong (China), Ireland, Liberia, the Marshall Islands, the Philippines, Singapore, the United Kingdom, BIMCO, ICMA, ICS, ITF, and P&I Clubs (IGP&I). Their expertise and commitment will be instrumental; every country and NGO will have stepped up and will play their role in the task force in order to drive meaningful change. Why data matters Quality data is the foundation of effective policy and enforcement. Without a robust and reliable database, abandoned seafarers risk slipping through the cracks, and regulatory loopholes can persist. Accurate data enables stakeholders to track trends, identify problem areas, and ensure that responsible parties are held accountable. It also allows for better coordination between governments, international organisations, and industry representatives in responding to cases swiftly and effectively. Looking ahead Improving the abandonment database will help secure long-term solutions, with a dedicated ILO/IMO joint meeting set to take place in 2026 to consider the task force findings. I was very encouraged by the open discussions and active participation among task force members at the inaugural meeting. This set the tone for ensuring that we deliver a high standard outcome, which will strengthen and build on the foundation of existing frameworks established by ILO and IMO to address this crucial issue. Seafarers are the backbone of global trade, and ensuring their protection must be a priority for all industry stakeholders. The ICS is committed to driving this forward and working alongside our partners to create a more transparent and effective system to address abandonment cases. This task force represents a critical step in equipping governments and the industry with the tools needed to deal with abandonment and support affected seafarers. ICS will continue to advocate for stronger protections and better enforcement to safeguard those who keep global trade moving."

The company signed an agreement in principle to sell its accommodation semisubFloatel Reliancefor an undisclosed fee. The floatel will be sold for further use and the firm deal is expected to be signed shortly. The intention is to hand over the unit to the unnamed owner during the second quarter of 2025. The 2010-built vessel has been out of work for quite some time. It has been in lay-up in the Canary Islands since April 2016. The firm put up the vessel for sale in September last year claiming that it would be too costly to reactivate it for offshore operations. Also, reactivation of the floatel could last up to 10 months. Floatel hoped to sell the vessel before the end of 2024, however, it wasn’t to be. But it did not take long in 2025 to find an adequate customer. According to the company’s statement from last year, the vessel’s specifications do not align with the strategy to “serve tier 1 customers”. The Norwegian firm even considered selling it for recycling."

The tender for the project was opened last year by operator Vattenfall. The contract has a value of $3.85m. The DanTysk offshore wind farm is located west of Sylt Island at the most northern point of Germany and is part of the North Frisian Islands. The wind farm comprises 80 wind turbines of 3.6MW each. The total output of 288MW can power up to 400,000 households. The wind farm has been in operation since 2014. The offshore wind farm Sandbank is the second major wind power project in the German North Sea, the wind farm extends over an area of 60 sq km and is located 90 km off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein, and is neighbouring DanTysk. Sandbank will have the same capacity as DanTysk and was built using 72 wind turbines with a 4MW capacity each. It has been in operation since 2016. Recently, both wind farms participated in a testing campaign organised by Ampelmann, the Dutch Applied Scientific Research Institute, and Vattenfall. The test included the use of cargo AI-powered drones."

        "content": "Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison has reached a blockbuster mega deal with BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC) to sell 80% of its giant ports division for $22.8bn in a record-breaking ports transaction that covers 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House there had been pressure on Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison to sell its two port holdings in Panama, and with growing trade wars brewing, the conglomerate has decided the time has come to step back from an industry it was the original global pioneer in. The ports sale does not include any interest in the HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China. PSA International, the world’s largest terminal operator, retains a 20% stake in CK Hutchison, something it bought in 2006 for $4.4bn, a holding it has looked to sell in recent years. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is already a substantial investor in ports via its Global Infrastructure Partners division while MSC’s Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) was already on a par with Hutchison in terms of teu throughput following many acquisitions during the great container shipping boom of the 2020s. Diego Aponte, MSC’s president, said: “We have a very high regard toward the Hutchison Ports management team, and if this transaction closes, we look forward to welcoming them into our larger family. We are very focused on this industry, and we know that the investment in Hutchison Ports will be a very viable investment commercially.” CK Hutchison’s co-managing director Frank Sixt said: “This transaction is the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” He described the transaction valuation as “compelling” something shareholders agreed upon with the conglomerate’s share price leaping by as much as 25% on Wednesday. Hutchison Ports was the original global terminal operator, moving beyond its Hong Kong origins in the early 1990s to invest initially overseas in Felixstowe and Shenzhen, rapidly building up a portfolio that for many years was the largest network of container terminals in the world to go alongside the conglomerate’s other interests in property, telecoms, and retail. Over the past 20 years, CK Hutchison’s ports dominance has slipped from first to sixth spot among global terminal operators. MSC’s acquisition – and its new status as a standalone operator on the main east-west trades – will likely result in a rejigging of its global network to call at its newly acquired terminals."

        "author": "Adis Ajdin",
        "content": "CMB.TECH, the shipowning vehicle controlled by the Saverys family, has bought a 40.8% stake in Golden Ocean, one of Europe’s largest dry bulk owners, from John Fredriksen’s Hemen Holding for close to $1.2bn. CMB.TECH said there were no takeover plans yet, and that the acquisition is in line with the company’s strategic objective of diversification, and investing in a modern dry bulk fleet. “Minority shareholders are disappointed to hear that a mandatory bid is not going to be launched – and a small shift in focus is going to be likely,” said Eirik Haavaldsen, head of research at Pareto Securities. Trailing shareholders with a 5% stake and less include BlackRock and the Norwegian pension fund Folketrygdfondet. The price of $14.49 per share represents about 44% premium to US close. “We believe the price is stellar. On our numbers, it equates to around 1.29x NAV, and a share price not seen since May last year… A deal with cash upfront and no strings attached – at a massive premium to NAV and normal cashflow multiple valuation – is in our view easy to understand. In many ways, given the price here, we would not really read too much into it besides that,” Haavaldsen added. Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH, commented: “The acquisition of the Golden Ocean shares from Hemen represents a significant milestone in CMB.TECH’s diversification strategy. We look forward to engaging with the board, management and employees of Golden Ocean and to build on Golden Ocean’s and Mr. Fredriksen’s strong legacy to drive long-term growth and innovation.” The news comes after Fredriksen and the Saverys family fought a 15-month battle for control of Euronav earlier this decade, something that eventually resulted in the Norwegian taking many of the firm’s most modern tankers, and Euronav remaining with the Saverys family and being rebranded CMB.TECH. Nasdaq and Oslo-listed Golden Ocean was spun off from Frontline in 2004 and today counts 91 bulkers in its fleet. The company’s owned fleet comprises 51 capesize and 32 panamax vessels. Eight capsizes were also recently bought out of leases from Fredriksen’s shipowning company SFL Corp and are expected for delivery in the third quarter of this year. CMB.TECH dry bulk outfit Bocimar owns 12 newcastlemaxes, with 16 more delivering between 2025 and 2027, according to the fleet list. ”To us, a merger with their (CMB.TECH) drybulk arm would make sense, with Golden Ocean’s strong balance sheet then possibly helping finance the newbuild boom that is underway. This could imply further divestments of older ships in Golden Ocean – which not necessarily would be negative as older ship values are stubbornly high in light of current rates. However, lower dividends in order to preserve cash for newbuild payments would certainly be a negative for minority shareholders, Haavaldsen noted. For analysts at Arctic Securities the deal for CMB.TECH could potentially solve the free float and result in a more permanent solution to the equity covenant, but the fact that there is no mandatory offer following the purchase is likely reflecting some of the premium that CMB.TECH is willing to offer. “If the company continues as-is, it should not necessarily mean too much on valuation, although some might argue that the JF premium is gone. Should the company merge with CMB.TECH, the pure-play exposure is gone – but it still offers a very compelling asset mix with tankers and dry bulk as the main asset exposure,” Arctic said in its report."

        "content": "On Splash’s big birthday, lead columnist Andrew Craig-Bennett gives his take on the past decade. Ten years ago, the industry that we all love was getting over the 2012 crisis – the year when many of the ships ordered during the 2004-2008 boom caused by China’s accession to the World Trade Organization were delivered. Everything was looking set for return to normal. ThenSplashwas launched. Drumroll! Flourish of trumpets! Free shipping news, to a curated standard, on your PC or your smartphone. At once, the shipping industry embarked on the most volatile, and, take one consideration with another, the most profitable, years that it has ever known. The Panama Canal (sorry, the America Canal) was improved with wider and deeper locks, and the world did not come to an end. The Suez Canal was turned in part into a dual carriageway, and the world did not come to an end. The world came a bit nearer to ending when the covid pandemic broke out, and spread, and spread, and spread. Cruiseships, unable to operate, carried their crews and cabin staff home and laid up, as did lots of other ships – for a while. Then quite suddenly, things turned round, particularly for containerships, as money that could not be spent on holidays and meals out got spent on stuff – lots of stuff, carried in containers. The boxboat business, even down to my tiny part of it, found itself rolling in money. Shipowning enterprises even handed out bonuses to their sea staff. The dark side of the boom was that ports managed to treat seafarers as if they were all intent on spreading disease wherever they went, and indeed came very close to treating seafarers as if they were not really human at all. The Good Run Ashore had been gone for a while; now ever the minibus to the seamen’s mission building became impossible. Talking of non-humans at sea, Splash can claim, I think, some credit for the reduction in the horrible trade in live animals for slaughter. That’s one to think on – it’s not quite on the scale of the end of the trade in slaves by sea, but it is a step in the direction of a more humane, more decent, world. As the demand boom started to ease back to normal, the best friends of the container shipping industry, the Houthis, decided to, in effect, give everyone our favourite thing – a Suez Canal closure. Yippee! Meanwhile, back at the International Maritime Organization, and in a few other places, our industry started to creep, unwillingly, towards some sort of attempt to stop increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, along with sulphur dioxide and soot particles and other stuff. When I write ‘creep’, I mean it. We are creeping very slowly towards doing a very little about trying to limit anthropogenic global heating. And a lot of creeps think that if they can only apply a few coats of greenwash, in the form of joke sails, or claims that a ship is fitted to burn methane (itself a major cause of anthropogenic global heating) or methanol, because the footings for the tanks were included when the ship was launched, whilst in reality the ship burns HFO for most of the time, and when I say HFO I don’t even mean ULSFO, because a lot of creeps think that washing the sulphur oxides out of the funnel flue gas and dumping them into the sea is absolutely fine as well. But at leastSplashhas reported on what is going on. Our industry doubles in size roughly every fifteen years. Not in the number of ships, or the number of seafarers, but in the ton miles chalked up and thus in the environmental impacts of what we do. A few years ago I was standing with my now grown up children at the view point in Harwich Harbour when I noticed quite a nice looking little containership, as these things go, moving down the harbour and out to sea. A moment later I recognised her as one of the ships that I am involved with in the day job, in fact I know her well, and I reflected that this nice little ship had been, when she was new, one of my employers’ largest and fastest ships. The ships on the trade she was built for are now almost five times her size. What next? The United States hogs the headlines now. The US isn’t turning into1984or intoBrave New World 2; it’s turned intoLord of the Flies. A bunch of early adolescent boys are trying to run the place, and not doing it well. Merchant shipping moves 80% of world trade.In money terms, the United States accounts for a quarter of world trade, but the US only accounts for 11% of world imports. The gap between those numbers, which I took from Richard Baldwin of the IMD Business School in Lausanne, though I could have looked them up for myself, tells us that the US also exports quite a lot and we can also conclude that a good deal of US trade is in what we used to call invisibles – they are called that because they do not generate Customs forms and are thus invisible to governments, and of course they don’t bother us. We like stuff that we can walk up to and pat, in the words of the late Sir Adrian Swire, a former employer and no mean shipowner, when he was asked why he owned ships and an airline but not a bank. Still, 11% is quite a lot. Let’s assume that President Trump imposes tariffs in all directions – what happens to our business, the international carriage of goods by sea? Probably, not a lot, unless and until Mr. Trump manages to crash the US economy. Stuff moving by sea finds other routes. If those other routes are longer, that’s more ton miles. Good for us! Today we celebrate ten years since Splash was launched!pic.twitter.com/KjI03r8aZk"

        "content": "Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison has reached a blockbuster mega deal with BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC) to sell 80% of its giant ports division for $22.8bn in a record-breaking ports transaction that covers 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House there had been pressure on Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison to sell its two port holdings in Panama, and with growing trade wars brewing, the conglomerate has decided the time has come to step back from an industry it was the original global pioneer in. The ports sale does not include any interest in the HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China. PSA International, the world’s largest terminal operator, retains a 20% stake in CK Hutchison, something it bought in 2006 for $4.4bn, a holding it has looked to sell in recent years. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is already a substantial investor in ports via its Global Infrastructure Partners division while MSC’s Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) was already on a par with Hutchison in terms of teu throughput following many acquisitions during the great container shipping boom of the 2020s. Diego Aponte, MSC’s president, said: “We have a very high regard toward the Hutchison Ports management team, and if this transaction closes, we look forward to welcoming them into our larger family. We are very focused on this industry, and we know that the investment in Hutchison Ports will be a very viable investment commercially.” CK Hutchison’s co-managing director Frank Sixt said: “This transaction is the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” He described the transaction valuation as “compelling” something shareholders agreed upon with the conglomerate’s share price leaping by as much as 25% on Wednesday. Hutchison Ports was the original global terminal operator, moving beyond its Hong Kong origins in the early 1990s to invest initially overseas in Felixstowe and Shenzhen, rapidly building up a portfolio that for many years was the largest network of container terminals in the world to go alongside the conglomerate’s other interests in property, telecoms, and retail. Over the past 20 years, CK Hutchison’s ports dominance has slipped from first to sixth spot among global terminal operators. MSC’s acquisition – and its new status as a standalone operator on the main east-west trades – will likely result in a rejigging of its global network to call at its newly acquired terminals."

        "content": "The resurgence in LNG dual-fuel ship orders over methanol has been a strong theme in newbuild contracting over the past year. In no sector has this been more prominent than in container shipping where methanol and LNG have swapped positions over the past 14 months. In the first two months of 2025, a total of 46 containerships have been firmly ordered, not including options. All the orders for ships with a capacity of over 5,000 teu were for newbuildings with LNG-powered dual-fuel engines, according to data from Alphaliner. “LNG propulsion has re-asserted itself as carriers’ principal short-to-medium term choice on the path to decarbonisation,” analysts at Alphaliner reported earlier. Alphaliner is reporting that the owner behind one of the last big orders for methanol-fuelled boxships is now having a rethink. Taiwan’s Wan Hai Lines is reportedly renegotiating with yards in South Korea over contracts it placed last October for eight 16,000 teu ships, wishing to switch from methanol to LNG engines. According to the latest figures from DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform, 34 new orders for alternative-fuelled vessels were placed last month. This was almost entirely accounted for by LNG-fuelled vessels, with all orders placed for container vessels. The sole non-LNG order was for an ammonia-fuelled general cargo vessel. Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonisation director at DNV Maritime, commented: “LNG remains the headline story, with a clear continuation of the trend towards these vessels evident since mid-2024. Again, this is being driven by the container segment, highlighting the importance of the voluntary market in driving maritime decarbonisation.”"

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "US president Donald Trump will create a shipbuilding office within the White House and offer a number of new tax incentives for the sector. The American president revealed the new shipbuilding plans in a 100-minute address to Congress last night in Washington DC. There is strong speculation in US media that in the coming days, Trump will action many of the measures set out recently by the US Trade Representative (USTR) to attack China’s dominance in shipbuilding. TheWall Street Journalreported that an upcoming executive order includes 18 measures, including raising revenue from fees on Chinese-built ships and port cranes entering the US. The USTR has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements. Soren Toft, the CEO of Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC), the world’s largest liner, weighed in on the USTR report at TPM, a container conference in Long Beach, earlier this week, telling delegates: “I think if it comes out in the present form, it’s going to have significant consequences. These costs either we will have to revise our network and withdraw our coverage or we will have to add that that cost on top of and ultimately the consumer will pay.” “If the USTR’s proposal moves forward, it is likely to create significant disruptions in the global shipping market, particularly in the tanker and container vessel segments, by leading to higher freight rates, which could fuel inflation and raise logistical costs for US businesses,” Xclusiv Shipbrokers suggested in a recent report, adding: “Moreover, many shipowners may avoid US ports altogether to bypass the added costs, potentially leading to an imbalance in vessel supply and demand. This could strain global shipping capacity and result in higher costs for US trade, undermining the US government’s goals of boosting domestic production and strengthening exports.” The US has a global market share of barely 1% in the global shipbuilding market, while China has more than 50%, up 10-fold this century. In his long address to Congress last night, Trump continued his push to rename landmarks and vowed to rename the Panama Canal, repeating several false claims about its ownership. In related news out of Washington, a bipartisan group of senators has introduced legislation aimed at monitoring and countering China’s expanding control over strategic ports worldwide, addressing what lawmakers call a direct threat to American national security and economic interests. The Strategic Ports Reporting Act would require the secretary of state and secretary of defense to develop a comprehensive global mapping of ports considered vital to US military, diplomatic, economic, and resource exploration interests. One Hong Kong port operator has just bowed to pressure from the new Trump administration with news yesterday that CK Hutchison hadsold an 80% stake in its global ports networkto BlackRock and MSC for $22.8bn."

CMA CGM can trace its origins back to 1978 when Jacques Saadé founded Compagnie Maritime d’Affrètement (CMA) as an intra-Mediterranean operator. In 1996, Saadé merged CMA with Compagnie Générale Maritime (CGM) to create what was then the 12th largest liner in the world. Saadé, who was born in Beirut in 1937, then went on to buy many famous shipping brands including Australian National Line (ANL), American President Lines (APL), and Cheng Lie Navigation. His son, Rodolphe, took over the business following Saadé’s death in 2018, adding many logistics acquisitions alongside the ship purchases. Maersk, meanwhile, has been content to focus on operating a fleet within the 4m to 4.4m teu range, a policy originally conceived by former CEO Soren Skou, and carried on by his successor Vincent Clerc. This strategy saw MSC overhaul Maersk as the world’s largest carrier at the start of 2021. There are other notable ranking shifts taking place lower down the Alphaliner liner charts too. When including ships on order, Taiwan’s Evergreen has just overtaken Japan’s Ocean Network Express (ONE) into sixth spot while Wan Hai, also from Taiwan, enters the top 10 at the expense of compatriot Yang Ming."

        "content": "The editor (whom God preserve!) is of the opinion that CK Hutchison’s sale of their ports and terminals operation to a consortium of BlackRock and MSC marks the end of globalisation as an idea which rules our thinking on trade in general and trade by sea in particular, and that the tariffs just introduced by the United States mark the start of a very different set of ideas about trade between nation states. (Ed. Note: Yes, I do, albeit maybe for just another 1,200 days or so.) I am of the contrary opinion. I think free trade, or at any rate WTO trade, will beat tariffs. This matters. There are lot of containerships on order – some are replacements for hard worked old ladies, but many represent net additional teu slots. Will they have a market, or will their unfortunate owners lay them up in rafts in fjords, like tankers in the early Eighties? There are, I think, two sorts of tariffs. The whole of the rich world is moving in the direction of Hong Kong because of globalisation There are tariffs imposed on imports by nations which are building up manufacturing industry and who don’t want their small, new, manufacturers competed to death by giant corporations in other places. Ghandi’s promotion of cotton spinning in India might be one example, and another one might be the United States of America at the end of the 19th century. The other sort of tariffs are tariffs imposed on imports by nations which have a higher standard of living, higher costs, and who seek to protect their manufacturing industry by raising the costs of imports to their domestic level. An example might be Joseph Chamberlain’s Tariff Reform and Imperial Preference policy in Britain at the end of the 19th century. Sitting between these two we will find the nations with a low cost of manufacturing, who will want free trade. Examples are Britain from 1845 to 1900 and China today. The first sort of tariff is imposed in what we may think of as a ‘scientific’ manner by experts sitting on committees and examining evidence. “What level of tariff will make a kettle, or a PC, made in this country, competitive with the imported version?” These tariffs will try to exclude components not made in the country, and they will be as voluminous and as complex as a tax code or a liner conference rate book (if anyone can remember what one looked like!) The second sort of tariff is talked about by popular politicians and promoted as a means to keep their voters in the jobs that they are used to. They are simple broad-spectrum tariffs because they are what the voters understand. The elephant in the room is that the voters like to buy cheap stuff, but they want to have a good job so they can buy the cheap stuff. Is it possible to have no tariffs even of you don’t make all sorts of stuff? Yes, certainly – look at Hong Kong. But nobody ever does. Hong Kong lives on re-exports and on invisibles. Having said which – the whole of the rich world is moving in the direction of Hong Kong…because of globalisation. There is no doubt – even economists who never see the sea say this – that the chief instruments of globalisation are the internet and the ISO container.

        "content": "Italian offshore engineering and construction giant Saipem has teamed up with Divento, a partnership between Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and GreenIT, to apply its Star 1 floating wind technology on two projects offshore Italy. Saipem was selected after a competitive technical-economic feasibility procedure. Its Star 1 tech is developed for the construction of semi-submersible floating wind foundations. The two projects are the 7 Seas Med and Ichnusa Wind Power floaters offshore Sicily and Sardinia respectively. The 7 Seas Med is located in the Strait of Sicily some 35 km from the coast, with a capacity of 252MW and a yearly production of about 800GWh. It is the first of its kind in Italy to receive the environmental compatibility decree from the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security. Ichnusa Wind Power is a project that will be developed by the namesake company about 40 km from the southwest coast of Sardinia with a capacity of 504MW and a yearly production of about 1.6TWh of renewable energy. Both initiatives are in the development phase and awaiting the completion of the definition of the regulatory framework for the first auctions for Italian innovative renewables technologies, among which floating offshore wind. “Floating offshore wind can play an important role both for the Italian industry and for the production of safe and renewable energy. We, therefore, await clarifications on the CfD system for floating offshore wind, which is essential to allow this potential to materialize”, adds Kunal Patel, partner at CIP."

        "content": "The UK government has revealed that it would be investing $71m to create a major floating wind hub in the Port of Cromarty Firth in Scotland. Offshore wind projects have been deemed crucial to delivering the UK’s mission for clean power by 2030 and to become a clean energy superpower. The country is already home to the largest grid-connected floating offshore wind farm in the world, with a further 30GW in the pipeline, and, according to the UK government, wind generated more power than gas in 2024. The expansion of Port of Cromarty Firth will make it the first port able to make floating offshore wind turbines on-site and at scale in the UK. The expansion will be backed by a grant from the Floating Offshore Wind Manufacturing Investment Scheme. Apart from government backing, the port will look to secure match-funding from other investors, with the port expected to become operational by the start of 2028. Construction work on the port’s expansion is expected to create up to 320 jobs. When fully developed, the port is expected to support up to 1,000 skilled jobs in the construction, installation, and operational support of offshore and floating offshore wind – such as crane operators, marine engineers, and people working on the vessels towing the turbines out to sea. “Scotland is a key part of making the UK a global leader in clean energy and this investment is a significant vote of confidence in the Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport and the surrounding area,” Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, said. The Floating Offshore Wind Manufacturing Investment Scheme was launched in 2023, designed to provide grants to ports to support development of port infrastructure needed for the deployment of floating offshore wind at scale. The Port of Cromarty Firth is one of two ports selected for funding, with plans for the second shortlisted port, Port Talbot, under development. “This funding will transform the Port of Cromarty Firth into the UK’s first industrial hub for floating offshore wind, kickstarting a new industry making turbines over 250 meters tall on platforms the size of football pitches,” RenewableUK’s director of industrial development Luke Clark said in a separate announcement. He added that the country needs to upgrade eleven ports and build new supply chains around the UK to capitalise on the huge pipeline of projects. “Floating wind has enormous potential, as it enables us to build projects further out to sea where wind speeds are much stronger and even more consistent. By 2050, floating turbines could provide a third of the UK’s offshore wind capacity with 40 gigawatts fully operational – enough to power every home in the country,” he added."

The service is intended to provide emotional support, crisis assistance, and peer-to-peer connections. IMO and the Women’s International Shipping & Trading Association (WISTA) study shows that women seafarers make up about 2% of the crewing workforce and are predominately found in the cruise sector. “This is a big step forward in our care and support for female cadets and seafarers – a much-needed service in an industry where female seafarers are a striking minority,” said Sailors’ Society’s CEO, Sara Baade. “Being a seafarer is challenging. But there are unique challenges to being a female seafarer and we know some women may feel more comfortable speaking to another woman. This helpline, along with our female peer-to-peer support groups, allows them to lean on other women who understand what they are going through,” Baade added. The helpline is being funded by marine insurance provider, Skuld. “Our industry must work together to increase gender equality and attract a diverse workforce to ensure it stays competitive in an uncertain world where female seafarers remain a significant minority. Together, we can create a safer environment for all women at sea,” stated Ståle Hansen, president and CEO, of Skuld."

MSC’s stunning $22.8bn deal with BlackRock to take over Hutchison’s non-China terminals will see the carrier vault over the likes of PSA International, COSCO, APM Terminals and DP World on Drewry’s list to boast a combined volume of 78.3m teu. This feels like the end of an era The record-breaking deal will require a lengthy regulatory approval from across the world. The ports transaction covers 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. “This is a landmark deal for the sector which will skyrocket MSC to the top of our global terminal operator league tables, but we do expect that there will need to be some rationalisation of the portfolios to meet regulatory requirements,” commented Eleanor Hadland, Drewry’s senior associate for ports and terminals. “This feels like the end of an era,” Hadland toldSplash,adding: “Hutchison was one of the first global container terminal operators, and in the early 2000s it regularly topped our league tables. However, in the past two to three years MSC has made major strides to develop its terminal portfolio, and alongside the increase in terminal numbers we have also seen TiL’s corporate culture evolve – it has a well-deserved reputation for efficiency and is really driving the synergies between liner and terminal networks.” “Assuming that all 43 international terminals in the Hutchison portfolio will smoothly convert into MSC/TiL terminals is premature, especially as many of them may not line up with the operational strategies and tactics,” suggested Kris Kosmala, a ports consultant, in conversation withSplashtoday. In the short term, Kosmala expected it to be business as usual with each terminal observing its contractual obligations. “In the mid-term, we will see some of those terminals change hands again, as BlackRock will attempt to rationalise the portfolio based on their expectations of ROI,” Kosmala predicted. MSC’s acquisition – and its new status as a standalone operator on the main east-west trades – will likely result in a rejigging of its global network to call at its newly acquired terminals, while other rivals will likely look to shift business away. Lars Jensen, who heads up container shipping advisory Vespucci Maritime, suggested via LinkedIn that the acquisition provides MSC with the possibility to get a much larger level of operational control over many of the key gateway ports and transhipment hubs in its network. While details on the structure of the deal have not yet been released, the partnership between MSC and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which was acquired by BlackRock in 2024, dates back to 2013. “The synergies between TiL and MSC’s carrier business are clear – the ability to guarantee volumes from the liner gives TiL a clear edge when negotiating both concessions and acquisitions, and GIP provides a source of alternative funding that has undoubtedly been well utilised to build the portfolio,” Drewry commented in an update yesterday."

        "content": "The editor (whom God preserve!) is of the opinion that CK Hutchison’s sale of their ports and terminals operation to a consortium of BlackRock and MSC marks the end of globalisation as an idea which rules our thinking on trade in general and trade by sea in particular, and that the tariffs just introduced by the United States mark the start of a very different set of ideas about trade between nation states. (Ed. Note: Yes, I do, albeit maybe for just another 1,200 days or so.) I am of the contrary opinion. I think free trade, or at any rate WTO trade, will beat tariffs. This matters. There are lot of containerships on order – some are replacements for hard worked old ladies, but many represent net additional teu slots. Will they have a market, or will their unfortunate owners lay them up in rafts in fjords, like tankers in the early Eighties? There are, I think, two sorts of tariffs. The whole of the rich world is moving in the direction of Hong Kong because of globalisation There are tariffs imposed on imports by nations which are building up manufacturing industry and who don’t want their small, new, manufacturers competed to death by giant corporations in other places. Ghandi’s promotion of cotton spinning in India might be one example, and another one might be the United States of America at the end of the 19th century. The other sort of tariffs are tariffs imposed on imports by nations which have a higher standard of living, higher costs, and who seek to protect their manufacturing industry by raising the costs of imports to their domestic level. An example might be Joseph Chamberlain’s Tariff Reform and Imperial Preference policy in Britain at the end of the 19th century. Sitting between these two we will find the nations with a low cost of manufacturing, who will want free trade. Examples are Britain from 1845 to 1900 and China today. The first sort of tariff is imposed in what we may think of as a ‘scientific’ manner by experts sitting on committees and examining evidence. “What level of tariff will make a kettle, or a PC, made in this country, competitive with the imported version?” These tariffs will try to exclude components not made in the country, and they will be as voluminous and as complex as a tax code or a liner conference rate book (if anyone can remember what one looked like!) The second sort of tariff is talked about by popular politicians and promoted as a means to keep their voters in the jobs that they are used to. They are simple broad-spectrum tariffs because they are what the voters understand. The elephant in the room is that the voters like to buy cheap stuff, but they want to have a good job so they can buy the cheap stuff. Is it possible to have no tariffs even of you don’t make all sorts of stuff? Yes, certainly – look at Hong Kong. But nobody ever does. Hong Kong lives on re-exports and on invisibles. Having said which – the whole of the rich world is moving in the direction of Hong Kong…because of globalisation. There is no doubt – even economists who never see the sea say this – that the chief instruments of globalisation are the internet and the ISO container. These two things together mean that it is possible to take bids to make a component to a precise specification, select the lowest cost conforming bid, order and pay for the widget and have it sent to wherever it will be assembled into a bigger unit. We do this all the time. It is the basis of the modern automobile industry and the modern aircraft industry and most certainly the modern shipbuilding industry – and almost all manufacturing. Almost 30 years ago, the president of a big container line practically bounced into my office, grinned broadly, and said, “I’ve just discovered that more than half of our cargo moves on waybills!” He was extremely happy about that – and he was a highly intelligent man – because it told him that we had integrated ourselves into manufacturing processes around the world.

However, in the past two to three years MSC has made major strides to develop its terminal portfolio, and alongside the increase in terminal numbers we have also seen TiL’s corporate culture evolve – it has a well-deserved reputation for efficiency and is really driving the synergies between liner and terminal networks.” “Assuming that all 43 international terminals in the Hutchison portfolio will smoothly convert into MSC/TiL terminals is premature, especially as many of them may not line up with the operational strategies and tactics,” suggested Kris Kosmala, a ports consultant, in conversation withSplashtoday. In the short term, Kosmala expected it to be business as usual with each terminal observing its contractual obligations. “In the mid-term, we will see some of those terminals change hands again, as BlackRock will attempt to rationalise the portfolio based on their expectations of ROI,” Kosmala predicted. MSC’s acquisition – and its new status as a standalone operator on the main east-west trades – will likely result in a rejigging of its global network to call at its newly acquired terminals, while other rivals will likely look to shift business away. Lars Jensen, who heads up container shipping advisory Vespucci Maritime, suggested via LinkedIn that the acquisition provides MSC with the possibility to get a much larger level of operational control over many of the key gateway ports and transhipment hubs in its network. While details on the structure of the deal have not yet been released, the partnership between MSC and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which was acquired by BlackRock in 2024, dates back to 2013. “The synergies between TiL and MSC’s carrier business are clear – the ability to guarantee volumes from the liner gives TiL a clear edge when negotiating both concessions and acquisitions, and GIP provides a source of alternative funding that has undoubtedly been well utilised to build the portfolio,” Drewry commented in an update yesterday."

        "content": "Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) has claimed a world-first onshore supply of green hydrogen produced on a sailing ship. As part of its “Wind Hunter” project, the Japanese shipowner used a demonstration yacht, Winz Maru, to produce green hydrogen from offshore wind and deliver it to the central breakwater area of Tokyo. The successful delivery follows multiple previous tests in Omura Bay between 2021 and 2023 to produce, store, and use hydrogen onboard the yacht. The green hydrogen produced onboard the Winz Maru is converted tomethylcyclohexane(MCH) and supplied to onshore facilities. In the next stages, MOL said it plans to produce about 100 Nm³ of hydrogen (the equivalent of about 200 litres of MCH) this year and supply electricity to a trailer home and other facilities. The company is also working on supplying hydrogen and studying a large demonstration vessel for the Wind Hunter. The principle behind the Wind Hunter is that when the wind blows strongly, sails capture it to propel the vessel forward. In between those gusts, turbines in the water spin and generate electricity and produce hydrogen stored in a tank in the form of MCH. When the wind is weak, the ship uses that hydrogen as a fuel cell, delivering electricity to power electric propellers and drive the ship forward. “Assuming that the hydrogen value chain will be established domestically in the future, we aim to construct and commercialise a large demonstration vessel as early as the 2030s,” MOL said in a release."

        "content": "As the first generation of turbines reaches the end of their life, thousands of turbines worldwide will be decommissioned or replaced over the next few years and Swedish utility Vattenfall has found an ingenious way of reusing them. Large parts of these turbines can be recycled but the blades present a significant challenge due to their composite construction, making material separation difficult. Vattenfall, in its desire to recycle 100% of its wind turbine blades by 2030, has already initiated several projects aimed at discovering scalable solutions. One of them even converted a discarded nacelle into a tiny house. The company is now partnering with the Norwegian company Gjenkraft which specialises in extracting valuable materials such as fibreglass and carbon fibre from end-of-service blades. These materials can be repurposed in various industries, reducing waste and conserving natural resources. Blades from the decommissioned Dutch wind farm Irene Vorrink were sent to Norway for processing. Vattenfall and Gjenkraft then worked together with Norwegian ski company EVI, known for the use of recycled materials in ski production. EVI transforms broken and worn-out skis into new pairs and incorporates carbon fibres from decommissioned Vattenfall blades to reinforce their skis, enhancing durability and performance. “As a Norwegian company with team members who are enthusiastic about skiing, deciding to manufacture skis was a natural fit. We are very excited to see this concept come to fruition,” said Marcin Rusin, co-founder of Gjenkraft. Vattenfall has placed an order for 15 pairs of skis with EVI, including alpine skis, carving skis, and one pair of race skis. These will be reinforced with carbon extracted from discarded turbine blades and will allow skiers of all levels to experience the potential of sustainable manufacturing. Visitors of the World Cup Women’s slalom, which will be held over the upcoming weekend in Åre, will be able to test the skis. “By moving from a linear take-make-waste economy to a circular economy, we can close the loop and use materials again through recycling. This project perfectly illustrates how technology provides a sustainable alternative to traditional ski-making materials. We hope it will inspire others and foster new ideas for accelerating circularity,” said Gustav Frid, environment and sustainability specialist at Vattenfall."

        "content": "The editor (whom God preserve!) is of the opinion that CK Hutchison’s sale of their ports and terminals operation to a consortium of BlackRock and MSC marks the end of globalisation as an idea which rules our thinking on trade in general and trade by sea in particular, and that the tariffs just introduced by the United States mark the start of a very different set of ideas about trade between nation states. (Ed. Note: Yes, I do, albeit maybe for just another 1,200 days or so.) I am of the contrary opinion. I think free trade, or at any rate WTO trade, will beat tariffs. This matters. There are lot of containerships on order – some are replacements for hard worked old ladies, but many represent net additional teu slots. Will they have a market, or will their unfortunate owners lay them up in rafts in fjords, like tankers in the early Eighties? There are, I think, two sorts of tariffs. The whole of the rich world is moving in the direction of Hong Kong because of globalisation There are tariffs imposed on imports by nations which are building up manufacturing industry and who don’t want their small, new, manufacturers competed to death by giant corporations in other places. Ghandi’s promotion of cotton spinning in India might be one example, and another one might be the United States of America at the end of the 19th century. The other sort of tariffs are tariffs imposed on imports by nations which have a higher standard of living, higher costs, and who seek to protect their manufacturing industry by raising the costs of imports to their domestic level. An example might be Joseph Chamberlain’s Tariff Reform and Imperial Preference policy in Britain at the end of the 19th century. Sitting between these two we will find the nations with a low cost of manufacturing, who will want free trade. Examples are Britain from 1845 to 1900 and China today. The first sort of tariff is imposed in what we may think of as a ‘scientific’ manner by experts sitting on committees and examining evidence. “What level of tariff will make a kettle, or a PC, made in this country, competitive with the imported version?” These tariffs will try to exclude components not made in the country, and they will be as voluminous and as complex as a tax code or a liner conference rate book (if anyone can remember what one looked like!) The second sort of tariff is talked about by popular politicians and promoted as a means to keep their voters in the jobs that they are used to. They are simple broad-spectrum tariffs because they are what the voters understand. The elephant in the room is that the voters like to buy cheap stuff, but they want to have a good job so they can buy the cheap stuff. Is it possible to have no tariffs even of you don’t make all sorts of stuff? Yes, certainly – look at Hong Kong. But nobody ever does. Hong Kong lives on re-exports and on invisibles. Having said which – the whole of the rich world is moving in the direction of Hong Kong…because of globalisation. There is no doubt – even economists who never see the sea say this – that the chief instruments of globalisation are the internet and the ISO container. These two things together mean that it is possible to take bids to make a component to a precise specification, select the lowest cost conforming bid, order and pay for the widget and have it sent to wherever it will be assembled into a bigger unit. We do this all the time. It is the basis of the modern automobile industry and the modern aircraft industry and most certainly the modern shipbuilding industry – and almost all manufacturing. Almost 30 years ago, the president of a big container line practically bounced into my office, grinned broadly, and said, “I’ve just discovered that more than half of our cargo moves on waybills!” He was extremely happy about that – and he was a highly intelligent man – because it told him that we had integrated ourselves into manufacturing processes around the world. There was, he thought, no possibility of going back. He also thought – and he was quite right – that the container shipping business was going to expand faster than the growth in recorded trade, because components could move by sea more than once, as successive operations were performed on them. The Mini gearboxes which cross the English Channel three times would have delighted him. The presiding deity of globalisation is David Ricardo. Alas, his theory of comparative advantage is not at all self-evident. Even economists argue about it. Voters don’t understand it – we need only look at the food miles business to see how hard it is for people to understand it."

The huge investment over the next four years would create 10,000 jobs, CMA CGM said, and include expanding container terminals, building an air cargo hub in Chicago, buying five new Boeing 777 freighters, as well as tripling the number of US-flagged ships subsidiary American President Lines (APL) operates, while Saadé told president Donald Trump an announcement on building ships in the US would be made in the coming weeks, as the new American government gears up to revive domestic shipbuilding capabilities. Saadé, chairman and CEO of CMA CGM, said: “I am proud to build on our long-standing relationship with the United States through this commitment of $20bn to the country’s maritime future and logistics capabilities.” “It’s so important because it’s about shipping,” Trump said. “You know, we lost our way for many years. We haven’t done anything. We used to build a ship a day.” The president added that he planned to announce a new government program for shipbuilding next week, something that is likely to penalise Chinese-built tonnage and cause considerable supply chain headaches. “If the USTR’s proposal moves forward, it is likely to create significant disruptions in the global shipping market, particularly in the tanker and container vessel segments, by leading to higher freight rates, which could fuel inflation and raise logistical costs for US businesses,” Xclusiv Shipbrokers suggested in a recent report, adding: “Moreover, many shipowners may avoid US ports altogether to bypass the added costs, potentially leading to an imbalance in vessel supply and demand. This could strain global shipping capacity and result in higher costs for US trade, undermining the US government’s goals of boosting domestic production and strengthening exports.”"

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "The case of the Phoenician M and the 30 year sentences passed down to crewmembers has incensed Steven Jones, the founder of the Seafarers Happiness Index. Shipping just does not have the right system to deal with the criminalisation of seafarers, and this needs to change, he writes in an exclusive for Splash. You might have heard of Captain Bekavac and Chief Officer Ali Albokhari of thePhoenician-M, two innocent seafarers slapped with 30-year sentences on baseless drug charges in Turkey. Tragically, their case echoes countless others where seafarers are abandoned to rot, forgotten by a world that moves on as wrongful criminalisation tightens its grip. This is a call, not just for action, but for guidance too on how we can collectively recalibrate our moral compass and take the actions to push back. How can we better share the burden of criminalisation, and stem its rising tide? This cannot and should never be purely a seafarer’s problem; or a burden on the neck of partners and families left behind. This is a festering wound on the industry’s soul. It undermines trust—how can we recruit the best and brightest when the spectre of unjust imprisonment looms? In silence though, we are losing faith that actions are taken, and that there is ever a real plan to counter this insidious, creeping curse. Now there seems to be some mood music, but alas no conductor to ever build a crescendo. We need a focal point of action, and while every case and circumstance is different, a leadership gap leaves those who care wondering how best to act. Leadership does not mean having all the answers; it means rallying everyone to the cause, setting a direction, and fighting like hell. The human toll—families unravelling, seafarers dying in jail—is a slow-motion disaster that demands more than whispers of outrage. This is a gut-wrenching issue, a stain that leaves lives shattered and families broken. When the system fails—when courts, politics, and profit-driven stakeholders turn their backs—what’s left is a void of justice that swallows the innocent whole. The story of Capt Bekavac and Ali Albokhari is not an isolated tragedy; it is a symptom of a broader failure, festering for years. So, what then? What can be done when the safety net has holes so large that entire futures disappear through them? The industry isn’t blind to this. There’s outrage —social posts, podcasts, articles such as this, and whispered frustrations, but anger without structure is just noise. There is real concern that there is an absence of a clear path forward. It is never clear what is happening, and if there is ever a need for a diplomatic silence, than that needs to be explained. We need organisations with the reach and resources to counter systemic rot—tackling corrupt courts, indifferent governments, and owners who’d rather let a seafarer be sacrificed than risk their bottom line. The lack of a unified, actionable response is terrifying, not because no one cares; it’s because the problem’s a hydra—chop one head, and two more grow back. These terrible truths should not be a barrier to progress. What we need—what seafarers deserve—is a system that doesn’t just react case-by-case but prevents and protects proactively. We need to be grounded in pragmatism rather than platitudes. What could better look like? A centralised advocacy body with teeth, power, funding and the mechanisms to effect change. I have always called for seafarers to be pulled into the UN/ILO/IMO orbit formally, with seafarer numbers issued by these bodies pulling them formally into the sphere of influence and protection. We also need to get better at public campaigns to force accountability. If we harnessed even an ounce of the power and passion of the environmental lobby, to make life better for seafarers, then we may see progress. Coordinated campaigns can amplify individual cases into global causes. Name and shame: flag States that don’t care, port States that collude, owners who vanish, insurers who dodge. We need to be shifting public perception, pressuring governments and corporations to act. It’s not perfect, but it’s leverage. Where is our documentary maker? Why is thePhoenician-Mstory not on Netflix? It should, it is worthy, and the outrage would make a difference too. This should be our Blackfish moment, the power of the narrative leading to lasting change. There must be a proper system to offer immediate support—financial aid, counselling, and community networks to keep them afloat. Seafarers cannot be left to rot, and grassroots initiatives can step in where industry won’t/can’t, but they need funding and visibility to scale. We are always having to learn the lessons anew every time. When the #Chennai6 campaign was rolled out, it was the families and passionate friends who had to grasp the nettle, even as they were stung at every turn to try and get justice for their loved ones. Then when the dust settles, all that hard found victory is lost. Why aren’t people being trained and educated on how to fight back against distant injustice? Which leads us to a worrying point indeed. We are seemingly in a vacuum of leadership. Where are the leaders? Where are the organisations? Some are working quietly—but too quietly. Others are paralysed by lack of funds, or by the scale and global political, diplomatic dimensions of it all. We need voices willing to rise and rally against a problem which is every bit as bad as piracy, and as damaging as the Houthis taking pot shots. This is a constant threat, the fear that when things go wrong a seafarer will be thrown in jail and abandoned by the mechanisms which work when a ship is alongside the port, but which evaporate upon departure. So, who will rally the industry into a fist, not just pointed fingers? We need leadership that is visible and vocal, in boardrooms, at the UN, hammering the message: criminalisation isn’t a seafarer’s burden to bear alone; it isn’t for heartbroken partners to stare out of screens with tear-streaked faces, this is an industry shame we all fix together. Currently there seems some growing energy around this story, which is at least a small positive. Though it is very far from unclear as to what is happening on the ground, what the legal situation is, or indeed what we as individuals can do as a collective. We need corralling, galvanising and becoming that unified voice to clamour in all cases, in all places that seafarers are not easy scapegoats. What can we do right now? We seem to be starting small, but this can grow in volume. We must use our connections, push for roundtables at maritime conferences—force the topic onto agendas. We need to better understand the scope and scale of the issue, and we need a playbook of lessons learned which we can dig into. We need data and decision-making tools, and action-taking support. The system is broken, no question. But frustration does not fix —action does, even messy, imperfect steps. Criminalisation may be a curse, but it is not an inevitable one and so the industry needs to stop wringing and start swinging. So, this is a call. There are people wanting to act and waiting to support. What now?"

        "content": "Norwegian oil and gas player DNO has reached an agreement to acquire all of the shares of Sval Energi from private equity firm HitecVision for a cash consideration of $450m. DNO said in an Oslo Bors filing that the value of the firm is based on an enterprise value of $1.6bn. The acquisition will be financed from existing liquidity including available credit facilities. In yearend 2024, the company held $900m in cash and a further $100m liquidity under its reserve-based lending facility. Additional funding sources include new bonds and RBL debt as well as offtake-based financing. The effective date of the transaction is January 1, 2025, with expected completion mid-year 2025. Previous news reports showed that HitecVision was planning to sell Sval Energi since January last year. According to the Norwegian firm, Sval Energi’s assets are complementary to DNO’s North Sea portfolio and will boost the company’s global net production by two-thirds to around 140,000 boepd. Proven and probable (2P) reserves will also increase by 50% to 423m boe. North Sea production and reserves will also increase. The former will quadruple to around 80,000 boepd while the latter will skyrocket from 48m boe to 189m boe (2P) and from 144m boe to 246m boe (2C). “Given low unit production costs and limited near-term investment requirements, the Sval Energi portfolio is highly cash generative and will help underpin the development of the numerous discoveries we have made in Norway recently,” said DNO’s executive chairman Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani. This transaction will also strengthen DNO’s presence in core areas on the NCS where the company already has 14 discoveries. Sval Energi will bring with it non-operated interest in 16 producing fields offshore Norway, 141m boe in net 2P reserves and 102m boe of net 2C resources as well as a team of 93 employees to be integrated into the DNO organization. Its cash flow from operations totalled $565m in 2024 with a production cost of just $14 per boe. The MLK wind farm will be the only asset carved out before closing and is not considered part of the transaction."

        "content": "The announcement this week that CK Hutchison issellingits 80% stake in Hutchison Ports Holding to a Blackrock-TiL consortium is set to “rocket” Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC) to the top of Drewry’s Global Terminal Operator (GTO) league table, the UK shipping consultancy has said in an update. MSC’s stunning $22.8bn deal with BlackRock to take over Hutchison’s non-China terminals will see the carrier vault over the likes of PSA International, COSCO, APM Terminals and DP World on Drewry’s list to boast a combined volume of 78.3m teu. This feels like the end of an era The record-breaking deal will require a lengthy regulatory approval from across the world. The ports transaction covers 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. “This is a landmark deal for the sector which will skyrocket MSC to the top of our global terminal operator league tables, but we do expect that there will need to be some rationalisation of the portfolios to meet regulatory requirements,” commented Eleanor Hadland, Drewry’s senior associate for ports and terminals. “This feels like the end of an era,” Hadland toldSplash,adding: “Hutchison was one of the first global container terminal operators, and in the early 2000s it regularly topped our league tables. However, in the past two to three years MSC has made major strides to develop its terminal portfolio, and alongside the increase in terminal numbers we have also seen TiL’s corporate culture evolve – it has a well-deserved reputation for efficiency and is really driving the synergies between liner and terminal networks.” “Assuming that all 43 international terminals in the Hutchison portfolio will smoothly convert into MSC/TiL terminals is premature, especially as many of them may not line up with the operational strategies and tactics,” suggested Kris Kosmala, a ports consultant, in conversation withSplashtoday. In the short term, Kosmala expected it to be business as usual with each terminal observing its contractual obligations. “In the mid-term, we will see some of those terminals change hands again, as BlackRock will attempt to rationalise the portfolio based on their expectations of ROI,” Kosmala predicted. MSC’s acquisition – and its new status as a standalone operator on the main east-west trades – will likely result in a rejigging of its global network to call at its newly acquired terminals, while other rivals will likely look to shift business away. Lars Jensen, who heads up container shipping advisory Vespucci Maritime, suggested via LinkedIn that the acquisition provides MSC with the possibility to get a much larger level of operational control over many of the key gateway ports and transhipment hubs in its network. While details on the structure of the deal have not yet been released, the partnership between MSC and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which was acquired by BlackRock in 2024, dates back to 2013. “The synergies between TiL and MSC’s carrier business are clear – the ability to guarantee volumes from the liner gives TiL a clear edge when negotiating both concessions and acquisitions, and GIP provides a source of alternative funding that has undoubtedly been well utilised to build the portfolio,” Drewry commented in an update yesterday."

        "content": "Legislation to repeal a rule adding costs to offshore drilling imposed by the Biden administration has been repealed after a vote in Congress. Representatives from the Republican party used the Congressional Review Act to cancel out certain regulations which former US president Joe Biden was able to finalise near the end of his tenure. During the week, five votes in the House or Senate repealed several energy and financial-related regulations. The most recent one cleared the House of Representatives on Thursday. It repealed a requirement that new oil and gas leaseholders on the US outer continental shelf submit an archaeological report before they start offshore drilling production. The vote passed the Senate last week meaning that it will be soon heading to president Trump’s table for signing. “This is a major step towards unleashing American energy, lowering costs, and undoing the damage of the Biden-Harris administration,” said House Republican Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain. The vote was 221-202 to repeal the rule. Even nine representatives from the Democratic party joined the Republican majority with just one Republican voting against and one abstaining. This is the second vote that will help the oil and gas industry following the scrapping of an Environmental Protection Agency regulation charging oil and gas producers a fee on methane emission leaks. The vote passed both chambers of Congress last week."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "The case of the Phoenician M and the 30 year sentences passed down to crewmembers has incensed Steven Jones, the founder of the Seafarers Happiness Index. Shipping just does not have the right system to deal with the criminalisation of seafarers, and this needs to change, he writes in an exclusive for Splash. You might have heard of Captain Bekavac and Chief Officer Ali Albokhari of thePhoenician-M, two innocent seafarers slapped with 30-year sentences on baseless drug charges in Turkey. Tragically, their case echoes countless others where seafarers are abandoned to rot, forgotten by a world that moves on as wrongful criminalisation tightens its grip. This is a call, not just for action, but for guidance too on how we can collectively recalibrate our moral compass and take the actions to push back. How can we better share the burden of criminalisation, and stem its rising tide? This cannot and should never be purely a seafarer’s problem; or a burden on the neck of partners and families left behind. This is a festering wound on the industry’s soul. It undermines trust—how can we recruit the best and brightest when the spectre of unjust imprisonment looms? In silence though, we are losing faith that actions are taken, and that there is ever a real plan to counter this insidious, creeping curse. Now there seems to be some mood music, but alas no conductor to ever build a crescendo. We need a focal point of action, and while every case and circumstance is different, a leadership gap leaves those who care wondering how best to act. Leadership does not mean having all the answers; it means rallying everyone to the cause, setting a direction, and fighting like hell. The human toll—families unravelling, seafarers dying in jail—is a slow-motion disaster that demands more than whispers of outrage. This is a gut-wrenching issue, a stain that leaves lives shattered and families broken. When the system fails—when courts, politics, and profit-driven stakeholders turn their backs—what’s left is a void of justice that swallows the innocent whole. The story of Capt Bekavac and Ali Albokhari is not an isolated tragedy; it is a symptom of a broader failure, festering for years. So, what then? What can be done when the safety net has holes so large that entire futures disappear through them? The industry isn’t blind to this. There’s outrage —social posts, podcasts, articles such as this, and whispered frustrations, but anger without structure is just noise. There is real concern that there is an absence of a clear path forward. It is never clear what is happening, and if there is ever a need for a diplomatic silence, than that needs to be explained. We need organisations with the reach and resources to counter systemic rot—tackling corrupt courts, indifferent governments, and owners who’d rather let a seafarer be sacrificed than risk their bottom line. The lack of a unified, actionable response is terrifying, not because no one cares; it’s because the problem’s a hydra—chop one head, and two more grow back. These terrible truths should not be a barrier to progress. What we need—what seafarers deserve—is a system that doesn’t just react case-by-case but prevents and protects proactively. We need to be grounded in pragmatism rather than platitudes. What could better look like? A centralised advocacy body with teeth, power, funding and the mechanisms to effect change. I have always called for seafarers to be pulled into the UN/ILO/IMO orbit formally, with seafarer numbers issued by these bodies pulling them formally into the sphere of influence and protection. We also need to get better at public campaigns to force accountability. If we harnessed even an ounce of the power and passion of the environmental lobby, to make life better for seafarers, then we may see progress. Coordinated campaigns can amplify individual cases into global causes. Name and shame: flag States that don’t care, port States that collude, owners who vanish, insurers who dodge. We need to be shifting public perception, pressuring governments and corporations to act. It’s not perfect, but it’s leverage. Where is our documentary maker? Why is thePhoenician-Mstory not on Netflix? It should, it is worthy, and the outrage would make a difference too. This should be our Blackfish moment, the power of the narrative leading to lasting change. There must be a proper system to offer immediate support—financial aid, counselling, and community networks to keep them afloat. Seafarers cannot be left to rot, and grassroots initiatives can step in where industry won’t/can’t, but they need funding and visibility to scale. We are always having to learn the lessons anew every time. When the #Chennai6 campaign was rolled out, it was the families and passionate friends who had to grasp the nettle, even as they were stung at every turn to try and get justice for their loved ones. Then when the dust settles, all that hard found victory is lost. Why aren’t people being trained and educated on how to fight back against distant injustice? Which leads us to a worrying point indeed. We are seemingly in a vacuum of leadership. Where are the leaders? Where are the organisations? Some are working quietly—but too quietly. Others are paralysed by lack of funds, or by the scale and global political, diplomatic dimensions of it all. We need voices willing to rise and rally against a problem which is every bit as bad as piracy, and as damaging as the Houthis taking pot shots. This is a constant threat, the fear that when things go wrong a seafarer will be thrown in jail and abandoned by the mechanisms which work when a ship is alongside the port, but which evaporate upon departure. So, who will rally the industry into a fist, not just pointed fingers? We need leadership that is visible and vocal, in boardrooms, at the UN, hammering the message: criminalisation isn’t a seafarer’s burden to bear alone; it isn’t for heartbroken partners to stare out of screens with tear-streaked faces, this is an industry shame we all fix together. Currently there seems some growing energy around this story, which is at least a small positive. Though it is very far from unclear as to what is happening on the ground, what the legal situation is, or indeed what we as individuals can do as a collective. We need corralling, galvanising and becoming that unified voice to clamour in all cases, in all places that seafarers are not easy scapegoats. What can we do right now? We seem to be starting small, but this can grow in volume. We must use our connections, push for roundtables at maritime conferences—force the topic onto agendas. We need to better understand the scope and scale of the issue, and we need a playbook of lessons learned which we can dig into. We need data and decision-making tools, and action-taking support. The system is broken, no question. But frustration does not fix —action does, even messy, imperfect steps. Criminalisation may be a curse, but it is not an inevitable one and so the industry needs to stop wringing and start swinging. So, this is a call. There are people wanting to act and waiting to support. What now?"

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "At no point since tracking began on the subject have global trade policies been more uncertain than right now, according to one index developed in the US. The Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) Index (see chart below) developed by four employees at the Federal Reserve Board analyses the frequency of joint occurrences of trade policy and uncertainty terms in major newspapers, firms’ earnings conference calls, and aggregate data on tariff rates in a way that is similar to existing volatility indices in mainstream financial markets, spanning equities and derivatives. Since Donald Trump returned to the White House on January 20, the index, which goes back to 1960, has spiked to record levels, almost twice as high as previous peaks registered during Trump’s first term in office. Donald Trump’s first six weeks back in the White House have dominated shipping headlines for tariffs, a push for peace in Ukraine, a renewed ‘maximum pressure’ strategy on Iran, the creation of a National Energy Dominance Council, and a planned tax on Chinese-built tonnage calling US ports. A paper submitted by the creators of the TPU index documents that increases in trade policy uncertainty reduce investment and activity using both firm-level and aggregate data. We might as well suspend making credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance across shipping sectors Today’s uncertain trading and geopolitical conditions were discussed at length earlier this week asSplashcelebrated its 10th anniversary. The news cycle – and by extension shipping cycles – have accelerated and shortened in recent years, a viewpoint picked up by Andy Dacy, managing director of the global transportation group at JP Morgan Asset Management. “Geopolitics, wars, pandemics, financial crises, and regulation have all buffeted shipping over the past 10 years. We’ve seen more of these in a shorter time span than before,” Dacy toldSplash. Nick Brown, the CEO of Lloyd’s Register, conceded that global trade has been tested by an extraordinary set of challenges over the past decade, listing the likes of the pandemic, sanctions, tariffs, and war, all of which, he said exposed vulnerabilities in the supply chain. Writing earlier this week, Andrew Craig-Bennett,Splash’s lead columnist, noted that merchant shipping moves 80% of world trade. In money terms, the US accounts for a quarter of world trade, with the US accounting for 11% of world imports. “11% is quite a lot,” Craig-Bennett wrote, adding: “Let’s assume that President Trump imposes tariffs in all directions – what happens to our business, the international carriage of goods by sea? Probably, not a lot, unless and until Mr Trump manages to crash the US economy. Stuff moving by sea finds other routes. If those other routes are longer, that’s more ton-miles.” “As the Trump 2.0 reality show unfolds, as it does daily, often with singular market-moving tweets, we might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance across shipping sectors. Underwhelming spot earnings render shipping sentiment downbeat while we seek greater clarity on today’s geopolitical, trade and social threats,” noted a recent report from broker Hartland Shipping.

In January, NYK Bulkship Korea scrapped the 27-year-oldLady Cedros, beached at Alang, India. After Russia attacked Ukraine, buyers rescued a string of vintage ships from demolition, vessels sold at record prices, often to owners registering them to single-ship brass plaque firms, and many continued transporting coal from Russia. One such ship is the 172,571 dwtWinnie, formerlyWinning Integrity. Reports indicated that buyers had scrapped the vessel in August 2022, but it reappeared after Winning sold it to Lila Global, the shipowning arm of GMS, a cash buyer for recycled ships. Now, it is finally set for retirement. The ship is registered with Stark Maritime, a small two-ship operation, according to Equasis. Stark also has a second capesize under its name,Lila Dalian, a 2002-built vessel that belongs to the Lila Global fleet. Winnieis now waiting for scrapping outside a recycling yard in Chittagong, Bangladesh. It travelled from China and was in Murmansk as recently as November. Overall, the ship recycling sector has been very sluggish in the opening weeks of 2025. “Ship recycling sales have slowed to such an extent that most yards are now either concentrating on recycling their recent deliveries, all while tier-2 recyclers lie dormant in wait to snag a new low-priced deal, helping demand stay afloat even if prices remain slippery,” GMS noted in its most recent weekly report."

        "author": "Andrew Craig-Bennett",
        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett calls for new requirements before going to sea. The need to recruit cadets is constant and many, but certainly not all, ship managers and ship owners have cadet recruitment and training programmes. I hear rather often from friends at sea that they are concerned about the education that their cadets have received before they start their training. It would seem obvious that a good grasp of mathematics, physics and chemistry is needed, because seafaring in each of its specialisations is within the ‘STEM’ (science, engineering, technology, mathematics) group of subjects. Much of cadet training is built on a knowledge of these subjects, but in reality, many cadets are weak in maths, physics and chemistry. We have been much too lax about this. We have assumed that basic exam passes in English language, mathematics, physics and chemistry, mean what they say, and we have built cadet training in the classroom in shore establishments on these, without really checking that cadet recruits know their way around the ideas and are comfortable with them. Unfortunately, it is easy for a cadet to conceal a weakness in, say, physics, and multiple choice questions such as are commonly used tend to facilitate this. All is well until a junior officer actually has to know about the black art of ship stability in real-time. A cadet may be weak in chemistry, but again, the weakness does not disclose itself until he or she is confronted with, say, a fire in a container, or in a hold, or has to decide if an enclosed space is safe to enter. These are real dangers. Yes, the IMO model courses are good, but they assume a level of school knowledge that may not be there. The frequency with which this comes up in conversations makes me think that this isn’t confined to any particular nationality; it certainly isn’t universal but it is common. I don’t mean the sort of mistakes that cadets have always made because they are unfamiliar with ships and the sea. I used to share an office with a man who as a first trip cadet had been asked by the Mate, hydrometer in hand, in the Suez Canal, to bring him a bucket of water, and came back with a bucket of fresh water. He went on to have a perfectly good career. It’s probably some time since a cadet was sent to ask the boatswain for some green oil for the starboard lamp, or to ask the chief engineer for the key to the keelson. I mean dangerous blank spots in knowledge. As a young man, I handled a Lloyds Form salvage of a pocket containership that had sailed on a very inadequate GM and as she burned fuel. Some years after that I had to deal with a coal-carrying ship where before starting to weld on a hatch cover the mate had tested for gas in the wrong place. A man died. Much more recently on a big containership I wanted to enter an enclosed space and the mate came back with the wrong meter. We can all of us think of similar cases that have happened to us. These are all cases of people simply not understanding basic science – “school” science. I think we can take it that the teaching of sciences in the schools that our cadets go to is not going to get better in less than geological time. So we, as an industry, have to do something. Medical schools at universities sometimes offer a pre-med course to students who are promising but who lack a good enough grounding in basic science. Typically, this lasts a year, during which time the students’ weak spots are found and the blank spots filled in. Maybe our industry should do the same, with mathematics, physics, chemistry, and basic IT skills. Time for a new IMO model course and a new requirement before going to sea."

Average speeds across the deep sea cargo fleet in the first quarter this year are at a new low, according to data from Clarksons Research. Certain sectors that have been struggling commercially in the opening months of the year are going especially sedately across the world. In the LNG space, for instance, a sector that has suffered its worst rates in history this year, speeds have dropped 2% versus the 2024 average to 14.6 knots this year, while bulk carriers have slowed 1.7% compared to last year to move at just 10.7 knots, while product tankers are moving 1.7% slower at 11.2 knots – all record slow speeds. A 10% speed reduction can lower the emissions of an individual ship’s journey by almost 20% As well as cutting speed to soak up capacity in a tough rates environment, owners have been slowing down to meet green goals and comply with regulations such as the Carbon Intensity Indicator. “By far the most effective way to reduce ship climate impacts is to slow ships down. A 10% speed reduction can lower the emissions of an individual ship’s journey by almost 20%,” John Maggs from the Clean Shipping Coalition stated in an article forSplashlast month. “Vessel speeds have been on a long-term downwards trajectory, with speeds now down by ~20-30% since 2008 in most shipping sectors,” Clarksons pointed out in its most recent weekly report."

The Israeli government announced on March 2 that it had suspended all humanitarian aid to Gaza after Hamas rejected the ceasefire extension proposed by US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. After more than 100 ships were attacked from late 2023 and throughout last year, the Houthis have ceased its campaign against merchant shipping this year, in line with the tentative peace deal struck between Israel and Hamas.

With the license now secured, Hanbando Offshore Wind will launch the environmental impact assessment and other key permits, conduct site investigations, and initiate main engineering studies. Through this project, Ocean Winds will contribute to the South Korean government’s renewable energy deployment target of achieving 125.9GW by 2038. Additionally, the company plans to contribute to the goal of Incheon City, which aims to develop 6.2GW of offshore wind power capacity by 2030."

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is seen bySplashreaders as the technology having the most significant impact on maritime operations in the coming 10 years in an ongoing survey being carried out in association with Inmarsat. AI beat out other tech making plenty of shipping headlines such as blockchain, Big Data analytics and Internet of Things in the survey that seeks to identify how ships will operate 10 years from now. Research by British consultancy Thetius published last September estimated that the maritime AI market had nearly tripled in size in the space of just one year and was valued at $4.13bn as of six months ago, with a projected five-year compound annual growth rate of 23%. A recent McKinsey report suggested that AI implementation can reduce forecast errors by 50% and logistics costs by 15%, while companies leveraging AI have seen inventory levels decrease by 35% and service levels improve by 65%. “Seafarers today are faced with an overwhelming amount of information and documentation to manage,” commented Ali Demiral, chief technology officer, and AI lead at WiseStella, a digital solutions provider. “AI-powered technology can provide seafarers and shipmanagers with the tools they need to navigate these new requirements with confidence.” “While AI presents huge opportunities, the maritime industry must first address underlying challenges such as data standardisation, cybersecurity risks, and the need for skilled personnel to manage AI-driven systems,” urged Niall Jack, director of product development at software provider Shipnet. The industry must fully embrace digital transformation – not just AI solutions – by investing in high-quality data infrastructure and cultural shifts toward digitisation, Jack argued. “Overpromising AI’s capabilities without resolving these foundational challenges may lead to suboptimal implementations and rejection of further new developments because of this,” Jack said. John Ferguson, who heads up the New Globalisation department at Economist Impact, a business intelligence service, said: “In 2025 and the foreseeable future, global trade will be shaped by three forces: shifting geopolitics, climate change, and a new wave of AI and automation. Yet, businesses are not retreating from international trade but are stepping up to the challenge. Firms that stay agile and cost-efficient will have the edge. Firms that also combine risk management with AI experimentation and openness will be best placed to win in this new chapter of globalisation.” Results from the ongoingSplashsurvey will be published inShip Concept 2035, a magazine due for distribution at Nor-Shipping this June. Ship Concept 2035will give readers a glimpse of what is realistic for newbuilds coming out of yards 10 years from now. Taking into account regulations, fuels, information technology, seafaring skills, shipyards and charterers this unique magazine gives a big picture beyond the hype of what is practical for vessels delivering by the middle of the next decade. Bunker selection, reskilling, and automation are some of the other topics covered in the survey. To have your say takes as little as two minutes to vote, and there is no registration required.

        "content": "The case of the Phoenician M and the 30 year sentences passed down to crewmembers has incensed Steven Jones, the founder of the Seafarers Happiness Index. Shipping just does not have the right system to deal with the criminalisation of seafarers, and this needs to change, he writes in an exclusive for Splash. You might have heard of Captain Bekavac and Chief Officer Ali Albokhari of thePhoenician-M, two innocent seafarers slapped with 30-year sentences on baseless drug charges in Turkey. Tragically, their case echoes countless others where seafarers are abandoned to rot, forgotten by a world that moves on as wrongful criminalisation tightens its grip. This is a call, not just for action, but for guidance too on how we can collectively recalibrate our moral compass and take the actions to push back. How can we better share the burden of criminalisation, and stem its rising tide? This cannot and should never be purely a seafarer’s problem; or a burden on the neck of partners and families left behind. This is a festering wound on the industry’s soul. It undermines trust—how can we recruit the best and brightest when the spectre of unjust imprisonment looms? In silence though, we are losing faith that actions are taken, and that there is ever a real plan to counter this insidious, creeping curse. Now there seems to be some mood music, but alas no conductor to ever build a crescendo. We need a focal point of action, and while every case and circumstance is different, a leadership gap leaves those who care wondering how best to act. Leadership does not mean having all the answers; it means rallying everyone to the cause, setting a direction, and fighting like hell. The human toll—families unravelling, seafarers dying in jail—is a slow-motion disaster that demands more than whispers of outrage. This is a gut-wrenching issue, a stain that leaves lives shattered and families broken. When the system fails—when courts, politics, and profit-driven stakeholders turn their backs—what’s left is a void of justice that swallows the innocent whole. The story of Capt Bekavac and Ali Albokhari is not an isolated tragedy; it is a symptom of a broader failure, festering for years. So, what then? What can be done when the safety net has holes so large that entire futures disappear through them? The industry isn’t blind to this. There’s outrage —social posts, podcasts, articles such as this, and whispered frustrations, but anger without structure is just noise. There is real concern that there is an absence of a clear path forward. It is never clear what is happening, and if there is ever a need for a diplomatic silence, than that needs to be explained. We need organisations with the reach and resources to counter systemic rot—tackling corrupt courts, indifferent governments, and owners who’d rather let a seafarer be sacrificed than risk their bottom line. The lack of a unified, actionable response is terrifying, not because no one cares; it’s because the problem’s a hydra—chop one head, and two more grow back. These terrible truths should not be a barrier to progress. What we need—what seafarers deserve—is a system that doesn’t just react case-by-case but prevents and protects proactively. We need to be grounded in pragmatism rather than platitudes. What could better look like? A centralised advocacy body with teeth, power, funding and the mechanisms to effect change. I have always called for seafarers to be pulled into the UN/ILO/IMO orbit formally, with seafarer numbers issued by these bodies pulling them formally into the sphere of influence and protection. We also need to get better at public campaigns to force accountability. If we harnessed even an ounce of the power and passion of the environmental lobby, to make life better for seafarers, then we may see progress. Coordinated campaigns can amplify individual cases into global causes. Name and shame: flag States that don’t care, port States that collude, owners who vanish, insurers who dodge. We need to be shifting public perception, pressuring governments and corporations to act. It’s not perfect, but it’s leverage. Where is our documentary maker? Why is thePhoenician-Mstory not on Netflix? It should, it is worthy, and the outrage would make a difference too. This should be our Blackfish moment, the power of the narrative leading to lasting change. There must be a proper system to offer immediate support—financial aid, counselling, and community networks to keep them afloat. Seafarers cannot be left to rot, and grassroots initiatives can step in where industry won’t/can’t, but they need funding and visibility to scale. We are always having to learn the lessons anew every time. When the #Chennai6 campaign was rolled out, it was the families and passionate friends who had to grasp the nettle, even as they were stung at every turn to try and get justice for their loved ones. Then when the dust settles, all that hard found victory is lost. Why aren’t people being trained and educated on how to fight back against distant injustice? Which leads us to a worrying point indeed. We are seemingly in a vacuum of leadership. Where are the leaders? Where are the organisations? Some are working quietly—but too quietly. Others are paralysed by lack of funds, or by the scale and global political, diplomatic dimensions of it all. We need voices willing to rise and rally against a problem which is every bit as bad as piracy, and as damaging as the Houthis taking pot shots. This is a constant threat, the fear that when things go wrong a seafarer will be thrown in jail and abandoned by the mechanisms which work when a ship is alongside the port, but which evaporate upon departure. So, who will rally the industry into a fist, not just pointed fingers? We need leadership that is visible and vocal, in boardrooms, at the UN, hammering the message: criminalisation isn’t a seafarer’s burden to bear alone; it isn’t for heartbroken partners to stare out of screens with tear-streaked faces, this is an industry shame we all fix together. Currently there seems some growing energy around this story, which is at least a small positive. Though it is very far from unclear as to what is happening on the ground, what the legal situation is, or indeed what we as individuals can do as a collective. We need corralling, galvanising and becoming that unified voice to clamour in all cases, in all places that seafarers are not easy scapegoats. What can we do right now? We seem to be starting small, but this can grow in volume. We must use our connections, push for roundtables at maritime conferences—force the topic onto agendas. We need to better understand the scope and scale of the issue, and we need a playbook of lessons learned which we can dig into. We need data and decision-making tools, and action-taking support. The system is broken, no question. But frustration does not fix —action does, even messy, imperfect steps. Criminalisation may be a curse, but it is not an inevitable one and so the industry needs to stop wringing and start swinging. So, this is a call. There are people wanting to act and waiting to support. What now?"

        "content": "South Africa’s Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) is looking for an operator for a multipurpose terminal in Durban. The state-run ports and freight-rail operator has invited interested parties to submit proposals to design, develop, fund, build, operate, maintain, and transfer the terminal in the Maydon Wharf Precinct for a 25-year concession period. The precinct, extending about 145 hectares, with 15 berths and a capacity of over 7m tonnes of cargo annually, primarily serves as a mixed-use area hosting a cargo terminal for dry bulk, breakbulk, a limited amount of liquid bulk, and a small number of containerised units. The site consists of two leases with a total area of 25,125 sq m. One lease is a brownfield site that includes the main administration building, an office block, and a workshop. “The issuance of this RFP signifies our ongoing and intentional efforts to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the Port of Durban. By attracting capable terminal operators, we aim to modernise infrastructure, optimise cargo handling, and strengthen the port’s role as a key trade gateway for the region,” said Nkumbuzi Ben-Mazwi, acting port manager for the port of Durban. Meanwhile, decision on who gets to operate South Africa’s largest container port remains on hold. In 2023, Philippines-based International Container Terminal Services Inc (ICTSI) won the bid to operate the flagship Durban Container Terminal Pier 2 for 25 years, but that decision was challenged by losing bidderMaersk, which argued that the tender award was irregular. The matter is yet to be resolved in court."

Jersey Oil & Gas, NEO Energy’s partner in the Buchan Horst joint venture, said in a statement that the termination comes after the agreement reached its longstop date at the end of February 2025. It added that the joint venture’s ability to recommit to the acquisition of the FPSO was linked to the satisfactory conclusion of the ongoing fiscal and regulatory consultations and completion of the required pre-handover works on the vessel. The JV slowed down its progress on the project after the UK government revealed plans for a consultation on new environmental guidance for oil and gas firms. This became necessary after a UK Supreme Court ruling required regulators to consider the impact of Scope 3 emissions in environmental impact assessments for new projects. “The fiscal consultation was kicked off yesterday and encouragingly, while the details are yet to be fleshed out, it was apparent that the government has heard many of the concerns of the industry,” Andrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas The sale agreement for the FPSO wassignedback in 2023 when NEO Energy said it would be taking full control of the unit. At the time of the deal, the company owned a 23% stake in the FPSO. The rest is owned by Dana Petroleum. It was supposed to be deployed to the Greater Buchan Area where the start-up was initially expected for 2026. Following decommissioning from the Western Isles project, the FPSO arrived at Orkney Harbours in late July last year for wet storage."

Average speeds across the deep sea cargo fleet in the first quarter this year are at a new low, according to data from Clarksons Research. Certain sectors that have been struggling commercially in the opening months of the year are going especially sedately across the world. In the LNG space, for instance, a sector that has suffered its worst rates in history this year, speeds have dropped 2% versus the 2024 average to 14.6 knots this year, while bulk carriers have slowed 1.7% compared to last year to move at just 10.7 knots, while product tankers are moving 1.7% slower at 11.2 knots – all record slow speeds. A 10% speed reduction can lower the emissions of an individual ship’s journey by almost 20% As well as cutting speed to soak up capacity in a tough rates environment, owners have been slowing down to meet green goals and comply with regulations such as the Carbon Intensity Indicator. “By far the most effective way to reduce ship climate impacts is to slow ships down. A 10% speed reduction can lower the emissions of an individual ship’s journey by almost 20%,” John Maggs from the Clean Shipping Coalition stated in an article forSplashlast month. “Vessel speeds have been on a long-term downwards trajectory, with speeds now down by ~20-30% since 2008 in most shipping sectors,” Clarksons pointed out in its most recent weekly report."

The transaction, led by Keppel’s private investment vehicle will see 100% of GMG taken from J.F. Lehman & Company (JFLCO) for an undisclosed sum. JFLCO took over the business in 2020 for around $250m. GMG operates a fleet of six vessels providing maintenance and installation services for the global subsea fibre optic cable network. Describing the reasoning behind the acquisition, Keppel said that based on increasing worldwide demand for connectivity and the limited supply of specialised vessels, GMG would be well-positioned to continue its fleet utilisation of nearly 100% in the years to come. Christina Tan, CEO of fund management and chief investment officer at Keppel commented, “It is a rare and unique opportunity to acquire a world-leading provider of subsea cable maintenance and installation services. This investment builds on Keppel’s digital infrastructure strategy which includes the Bifrost Cable System, and now, GMG. With a substantial proportion of GMG’s business secured by long-term contracts with huge growth potential, especially in Asia, we are poised to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors.” Keppel added that its fund would “continue to evaluate quality deals and platforms beyond Asia, should such opportunities arise”."

I hear rather often from friends at sea that they are concerned about the education that their cadets have received before they start their training. It would seem obvious that a good grasp of mathematics, physics and chemistry is needed, because seafaring in each of its specialisations is within the ‘STEM’ (science, engineering, technology, mathematics) group of subjects. Much of cadet training is built on a knowledge of these subjects, but in reality, many cadets are weak in maths, physics and chemistry. We have been much too lax about this. We have assumed that basic exam passes in English language, mathematics, physics and chemistry, mean what they say, and we have built cadet training in the classroom in shore establishments on these, without really checking that cadet recruits know their way around the ideas and are comfortable with them. Unfortunately, it is easy for a cadet to conceal a weakness in, say, physics, and multiple choice questions such as are commonly used tend to facilitate this. All is well until a junior officer actually has to know about the black art of ship stability in real-time. A cadet may be weak in chemistry, but again, the weakness does not disclose itself until he or she is confronted with, say, a fire in a container, or in a hold, or has to decide if an enclosed space is safe to enter. These are real dangers. Yes, the IMO model courses are good, but they assume a level of school knowledge that may not be there. The frequency with which this comes up in conversations makes me think that this isn’t confined to any particular nationality; it certainly isn’t universal but it is common. I don’t mean the sort of mistakes that cadets have always made because they are unfamiliar with ships and the sea. I used to share an office with a man who as a first trip cadet had been asked by the Mate, hydrometer in hand, in the Suez Canal, to bring him a bucket of water, and came back with a bucket of fresh water. He went on to have a perfectly good career. It’s probably some time since a cadet was sent to ask the boatswain for some green oil for the starboard lamp, or to ask the chief engineer for the key to the keelson. I mean dangerous blank spots in knowledge. As a young man, I handled a Lloyds Form salvage of a pocket containership that had sailed on a very inadequate GM and as she burned fuel. Some years after that I had to deal with a coal-carrying ship where before starting to weld on a hatch cover the mate had tested for gas in the wrong place. A man died. Much more recently on a big containership I wanted to enter an enclosed space and the mate came back with the wrong meter. We can all of us think of similar cases that have happened to us. These are all cases of people simply not understanding basic science – “school” science. I think we can take it that the teaching of sciences in the schools that our cadets go to is not going to get better in less than geological time. So we, as an industry, have to do something. Medical schools at universities sometimes offer a pre-med course to students who are promising but who lack a good enough grounding in basic science. Typically, this lasts a year, during which time the students’ weak spots are found and the blank spots filled in. Maybe our industry should do the same, with mathematics, physics, chemistry, and basic IT skills. Time for a new IMO model course and a new requirement before going to sea."

Under the agreement, one of AET’s lightering support vessels (LSV) will be retrofitted with a plug-in hybrid-electric system. The vessel will operate primarily on battery power, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by around 82% when compared to conventional LSVs on a tank-to-wake basis. This is estimated to avoid 1,220 tonnes of greenhouse gases significantly reducing fuel consumption and maintenance costs while maintaining high safety standards. “By integrating plug-in hybrid electric solutions into our fleet, we are transforming ambition into action to deliver more energy with less emissions. This pilot project also allows us to evaluate the feasibility and operational performance of this technology, paving the way for potential deployment across AET’s and potentially MISC’s fleet,” said Zahid Osman, president and group CEO of MISC."

The company will deploy its specialist geotechnical vessel, theFugro Mariner, for this project to collect seabed soil samples, which will subsequently be analysed. The survey results will assist Blue Mackerel developer Parkwind, part of Jera Nex, in optimising its offshore wind farm project’s structural integrity and mitigating construction risks, while ensuring compliance with the latest sustainability standards. When complete, it will become one of Australia’s pioneering offshore wind energy projects and will be located off the coast of Brataualung and Tatungalung country in Gippsland, Victoria. With a projected capacity of 1 GW by 2032, the wind farm aims to generate renewable energy sufficient to power over 500,000 Victorian homes, significantly contributing to Australia’s target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050."

The Nasdaq-listed tanker owner and operator of seven ships on the water and four on order is selling its LNG-ready scrubber-fitted LR2/aframax product and crude oil carrier to an unnamed counterparty and chartering it back for eight years on a bareboat basis. The bareboat financing amount totals about $45m, or about 70% of the vessel’s shipbuilding price, and kicks in upon its delivery from CSSC-affiliatedShanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding. Aliki Paliou-led Performance will buy back the vessel for $25m, including the last 96th monthly installment, when the eight-year bareboat deal expires, but also has options for early repurchase after two years under the charter. The deal is the final sale and leaseback the company struck for the 114,000 dwt trio ordered in late December 2023 for delivery in August and September 2025, and January 2026. The aggregate bareboat financing amounts to $134.6m and covers nearly all of the $138.4m remaining installments due to the shipyard, the company said. All tankers have been fixed toClearlake Shipping, a subsidiary of commodity trading giant Gunvor, at $31,000 per day, while daily all in cashflow breakeven rate, including lease payments, is estimated at about $25,000 per vessel."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "The first signs of a two-tier market are emerging in anticipation of Donald Trump’s likely penalisation of Chinese-built tonnage. Broker BRS is reporting Chinese-linked ships are now becoming “far less attractive” for long time charters due to the likelihood that, at some point during their charters, these ships would be required to call at US ports. Law firm Hill Dickinson is also seeing revisions to charter-party wording, both bespoke terms and amendments to standard charter-party forms for voyage and period fixtures in relation to a likely impending clampdown on Chinese-built tonnage by the US. BRS anticipates ships on spot voyages with multiple load and / or discharge options including the US will soon face similar treatment. “Looking purely at spot voyages in or out of the US, it appears unlikely that charterers would opt to hire Chinese-linked ships,” BRS noted in a new market report. The forces of globalisation swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labour force “It appears likely that a two-tier tanker freight market will eventually form with one tier for non-Chinese ships (overwhelmingly Japanese and Korean) and a lower tier for Chinese-linked ships which would likely be hired at costs slightly below the first tier,” BRS has predicted. The American president will make a decision soon on whether to carry out suggestions made by the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR)following an investigation carried out over the past year into China’s growing dominance in maritime, especially in the realm of shipbuilding. The USTR report cited artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements with Trump strongly suggesting in recent days he will carry out these policies as part of a wider plan to revitalise American shipbuilding. “Initial industry reaction suggests that the market contemplates an increase in freight rates, a substantial diversion in traffic towards Mexican ports, and a cancellation of some newbuilding contracts at Chinese yards,” Hill Dickinson suggested in a note to clients. Clarksons Research has calculated nearly 37,000 US port calls last year by ships that would likely face the maximum $1.5m fee due to their connection to China, equivalent to 83% of containership calls but only around 30% of stops by tankers. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of just 1%. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans yesterday in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

        "content": "With scores of shipowners booking their flights for late April to Switzerland for the world’s top dry bulk event, Vasileios Gkikas will be on hand to answer some of the most pressing questions on the agenda. Gkikas, global lead for dry bulk at class society ABS, tellsSplashthe questions he tends to field the most concern the incoming emissions regulations and how to achieve compliance in a way that reduces the risk of incurring penalties. Owners are keen to understand the evolution in alternative and sustainable marine fuels, ranging from the technical challenges associated with their use to availability and price, he says. Clients also want to understand other commercial factors around fuels and energy efficiency, namely whether there are incentives from charterers for more efficient vessels. They are also greatly interested in knowing how to manage their risks in a wider global context, maintaining safe and secure vessel operations at a time when geopolitical factors are continuing to pose threats. “More companies are recognising that digitalisation through systematic use of operational data can help them understand how their ships run and identify margins for efficiency improvements that can directly translate into fuel savings, emissions reductions and regulatory compliance,” Gkikas says. The class executive is especially looking forward to two highly relevant sessions during the upcoming trade summit: the Digital Efficiency Drivers At Sea panel as well as the Dry Decarbonisation debate. The first session explores how digitalisation can enhance dry bulk shipping operations to the benefit of both shipowners and charterers, while the decarbonisation discussion will ask who will genuinely pay for shipping’s green transition while identifying some of the low-hanging fruit that delegates might not be aware of today in their bid to slash emissions. “For ABS, Geneva Dry represents an opportunity to hold pragmatic discussions around the challenges and opportunities facing the dry bulk market. With everything that is going on in the world economy right now, we feel sure there will be plenty to discuss,” says Gkikas, a returning delegate to the event scheduled for April 28 and 29 at the Hotel President Wilson on the shore of Lake Geneva. Geneva Dry brings together all elements of the commodities shipping sector to host the ultimate dry bulk shipping event. Split into sectors, panels will bring together analysts, financiers, miners, traders and shipowners to discuss where the markets are headed.

The throughput is expected to grow in the coming years, including in the reefer container business. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. “By acquiring a majority stake in the CNMP terminal in Le Havre, we are strengthening our position in one of our core European markets. At the same time, we are continuing to expand our global terminal portfolio while paving the way for targeted investments to enhance efficiency. The transaction will therefore directly contribute to the vigorous realisation of our Strategy 2030,” said Dheeraj Bhatia, chief executive officer of Hanseatic Global Terminals. Hanseatic Global Terminals manages 20 terminals in 11 countries and aims to increase this number to more than 30 by the end of this decade."

The assessment of HM Coastguard is, however, that it is unlikely the vessel will remain afloat,” Kane told parliament, adding also that the vessel’s missing crewmember was unlikely to be found and presumed deceased. The fire onboard the product tankerStena Immaculate, triggered by the collision, has greatly diminished, but theSolongis still alight, the UK coastguard said on Tuesday. The 140-m-longSolongseparated from theStena Immaculatelate last night and began drifting southwards from the scene of the collision. It is being monitored, with tugs on the scene to “make sure the vessel remains away from the coast.” “Safety vessels and other vessels with firefighting capabilities are still on scene with more arriving today,” the coastguard said in a statement. The 2005-built 800 teuSolongwas earlier reported to be carrying containers of sodium cyanide, but the vessel’s owner, Ernst Russ, has denied these claims. “We are able to confirm that there are no containers on board laden with sodium cyanide, as has been misreported. There are four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical, and these containers will continue to be monitored,” the company said in a statement. The UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency is developing a plan to salvage the vessels, with Dutch contractor Boskalis already appointed to work on the US-flaggedStena Immaculate, which was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel at the time of the incident.

The Houthis have said they stand by today’s deadline they gave Israel, pledging to resume naval attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden if the Gaza blockade is not lifted. Israel halted all aid supplies into Gaza on March 2 and, on Sunday, cut off electricity to the region, prompting a sharp response from Yemen’s Houthi movement. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has warned that the situation in Gaza is “deteriorating very, very quickly”, more than a week after Israel again halted all supplies from entering the Gaza Strip. “Whatever the intent is, it’s clearly a weaponisation of humanitarian aid into Gaza,” Lazzarini told reporters at UN offices in Geneva on Monday. After more than 100 ships were attacked from late 2023 and throughout last year, the Houthis have ceased its campaign against merchant shipping this year, in line with the tentative peace deal struck between Israel and Hamas. British maritime security specialist Ambrey is advising merchant shipping to check their affiliation with the Houthi target profile, and to reassess the risk to voyages through the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden."

The 140-m-long Solong, owned by Hamburg-based Ernst Russ, hit the 183-m-long Stena Immaculate while anchored near Hull, rupturing at least one of its cargo tanks containing jet fuel and triggering a fire with fuel “reported released.” The crews abandoned the ships minutes after the incident took place onMonday morning.

Ernst Russ said separately that 13 of the 14 Solong crew had been brought safely ashore. “After an extensive search for the missing crew member sadly they have not been found and the search has ended,” said Matthew Atkinson, divisional commander for HM Coastguard. A trawlerman who was among dozens of small boats that raced to answer to the mayday call described “very scary” scenes as they were faced with “plumes of smoke” and a “really strong smell of burning’”. “It’s a miracle they didn’t all die,” he told local media. “The fog was pretty horrendous,” he added. Meanwhile, both vessels remain on fire, raising concerns among experts and environmental groups about the impact on wildlife. The Solong was reportedly carrying 15 containers of sodium cyanide while on its way from Scotland to the Netherlands. At the time it was hit, the Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks. US-based Crowley said it is working closely with response agencies, including the HM Coastguard, to secure the vessel in a restricted safety area and initiate spill containment response."

        "content": "German utility RWE has laid off some of its offshore wind employees in the US following president Donald Trump starting his assault on the industry. RWE employs around 1,500 people in the US and its offshore wind section is headquartered at the company’s office in Boston. In a regulatory filing, RWE Offshore Wind Services, a US subsidiary of the company, stated that it would cut its Boston-area workforce by May 6. The filing revealed a plan to lay off 73 employees. The layoffs will mostly affect workers supporting the long-term development of offshore wind projects across the country. “Last year we announced that, due to market conditions and increased risk profile, we would delay certain expenditures related to our US offshore wind development projects. With the current regulatory and political environment, we have decided to reduce the scope of our development activities and the size of our US offshore team,” the company said in a statement. This, however, comes as no surprise as the company was already bracing for an eventual Trump election win. RWE said in November last year that the possibility of a new administration could jeopardize its operations and that it might have to delay its plan to spend €55bn ($60bn) on green technologies globally by 2030. Trump stopped the sale of new leases and project permitting on his first day in office. His administration is currently reviewing projects and has stated that it would differentiate between those under development versus those that are proposed. RWE currently has one offshore wind project in the US that is at an advanced stage of development, in a joint venture with National Grid, located off the coast of New York. The two submitted their 2.8GW Community Offshore Wind project into New York’s offshore wind Round 5 in October last year. The project should see its first offshore wind power delivered in 2030 and both phases are scheduled to be fully operational in 2032. It will use two proposed interconnection points, one in Brooklyn at the ConEd Clean Energy Hub while the other will interconnect at the E.F. Barrett Power Station in Island Park. The proposed project will open 700 jobs, deliver up to $300m in wages, and drive some $3bn in economic activity, including over $2bn in direct in-state spending. Community Offshore Wind is also looking to invest up to $250m in developing crucial New York manufacturing facilities, accelerating the growth of the local offshore wind supply chain."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "The first signs of a two-tier market are emerging in anticipation of Donald Trump’s likely penalisation of Chinese-built tonnage. Broker BRS is reporting Chinese-linked ships are now becoming “far less attractive” for long time charters due to the likelihood that, at some point during their charters, these ships would be required to call at US ports. Law firm Hill Dickinson is also seeing revisions to charter-party wording, both bespoke terms and amendments to standard charter-party forms for voyage and period fixtures in relation to a likely impending clampdown on Chinese-built tonnage by the US. BRS anticipates ships on spot voyages with multiple load and / or discharge options including the US will soon face similar treatment. “Looking purely at spot voyages in or out of the US, it appears unlikely that charterers would opt to hire Chinese-linked ships,” BRS noted in a new market report. The forces of globalisation swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labour force “It appears likely that a two-tier tanker freight market will eventually form with one tier for non-Chinese ships (overwhelmingly Japanese and Korean) and a lower tier for Chinese-linked ships which would likely be hired at costs slightly below the first tier,” BRS has predicted. The American president will make a decision soon on whether to carry out suggestions made by the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR)following an investigation carried out over the past year into China’s growing dominance in maritime, especially in the realm of shipbuilding. The USTR report cited artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements with Trump strongly suggesting in recent days he will carry out these policies as part of a wider plan to revitalise American shipbuilding. “Initial industry reaction suggests that the market contemplates an increase in freight rates, a substantial diversion in traffic towards Mexican ports, and a cancellation of some newbuilding contracts at Chinese yards,” Hill Dickinson suggested in a note to clients. Clarksons Research has calculated nearly 37,000 US port calls last year by ships that would likely face the maximum $1.5m fee due to their connection to China, equivalent to 83% of containership calls but only around 30% of stops by tankers. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of just 1%. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans yesterday in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

The 36 other crewmembers were brought ashore safely. UK police detained the 59-year-old captain, reportedly a Russian national, after the extensive search for the missing seafarer was called off on Monday evening. The ship’s owner, Ernst Russ from Germany, confirmed that “the master of the container ship Solong has been detained by Humberside police.” “The master and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations,” the company said. Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson of Humberside police said the force had “taken primacy for the investigation of any potential criminal offences which arise from the collision between the two vessels.” Initial fearsthatSolongcould sink have been reduced. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said later on Tuesday that “early indications suggest that both vessels are now expected to stay afloat.” The coastguard said it had attached a tow line to the Solong, which was now offshore “in a safer position”, and that a salvage plan for both ships was being developed. TheStena Immaculatewas carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel for the US Air Force when it was struck while anchored near Hull. At least one of its tanks is leaking into the North Sea. Specialist pollution-control vessels arrived at the scene on Tuesday to try to measure the scale of the spillage and contain any toxins. An initial review of the fuel released into the North Sea has suggested the impact has been limited. The tanker’s manager, Crowley, said in an update on Tuesday evening, “It remains unclear at this time what volume of fuel may have been released as a result of the incident, but initial review shows impacts have been limited due to exposure to the fire and evaporation of the Jet A1 fuel.” While the cause of the collision remains unclear, a spokesperson for the UK government said initial information did not contain “any suggestions of foul play at this time”. However, transport minister Mike Kane noted that something had clearly gone “terribly wrong.” Investigators were expected to speak to many of the 36 crewmembers rescued from both ships in the coming days to determine the cause of the accident. Industry experts suggested human error was likely to have played a significant role in the incident but that a technical issue or oversight could not be ruled out."

        "content": "Political and fiscal uncertainty has impacted investor confidence in the UK which is accelerating the decline of domestic production, as a result, $26bn could be spent on decommissioning in the next decade, with well plug and abandonment alone accounting for almost 50% of the cost. An analysis by consultancy firm Westwood reveals that timing uncertainty is driving financial and operational risks for operators, as the decommissioning workload increases but contract awards are lagging, particularly for rigs. Deferring work scopes could strain the supply chain’s limited capacity to execute the work. Westwood believes that if these delays persist and rig availability tightens, well P&A costs could climb by $5.5bn, due to higher offshore rig dayrates, increasing financial liabilities for both operators and the UK government, which provides tax relief on decommissioning costs. “As the UK North Sea enters a new phase where decommissioning becomes the dominant industry driver, the supply chain faces significant demand and major financial risk. Based on current investment plans, up to 40% of UK fields could cease production before 2030,” said Yvonne Telford, research director at Westwood."

TheStena Immaculatewas carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel for the US Air Force when it was struck while anchored near Hull. At least one of its tanks is leaking into the North Sea. Specialist pollution-control vessels arrived at the scene on Tuesday to try to measure the scale of the spillage and contain any toxins. An initial review of the fuel released into the North Sea has suggested the impact has been limited. The tanker’s manager, Crowley, said in an update on Tuesday evening, “It remains unclear at this time what volume of fuel may have been released as a result of the incident, but initial review shows impacts have been limited due to exposure to the fire and evaporation of the Jet A1 fuel.” While the cause of the collision remains unclear, a spokesperson for the UK government said initial information did not contain “any suggestions of foul play at this time”. However, transport minister Mike Kane noted that something had clearly gone “terribly wrong.” Investigators were expected to speak to many of the 36 crewmembers rescued from both ships in the coming days to determine the cause of the accident. Industry experts suggested human error was likely to have played a significant role in the incident but that a technical issue or oversight could not be ruled out."

The assessment of HM Coastguard is, however, that it is unlikely the vessel will remain afloat,” Kane told parliament, adding also that the vessel’s missing crewmember was unlikely to be found and presumed deceased. The fire onboard the product tankerStena Immaculate, triggered by the collision, has greatly diminished, but theSolongis still alight, the UK coastguard said on Tuesday. The 140-m-longSolongseparated from theStena Immaculatelate last night and began drifting southwards from the scene of the collision. It is being monitored, with tugs on the scene to “make sure the vessel remains away from the coast.” “Safety vessels and other vessels with firefighting capabilities are still on scene with more arriving today,” the coastguard said in a statement. The 2005-built 800 teuSolongwas earlier reported to be carrying containers of sodium cyanide, but the vessel’s owner, Ernst Russ, has denied these claims. “We are able to confirm that there are no containers on board laden with sodium cyanide, as has been misreported. There are four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical, and these containers will continue to be monitored,” the company said in a statement. The UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency is developing a plan to salvage the vessels, with Dutch contractor Boskalis already appointed to work on the US-flaggedStena Immaculate, which was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel at the time of the incident.

The company said in a Bursa Malaysia filing on Wednesday that the country’s Ministry of Finance had agreed to provide a financial injection to the company. The investment was done via Malaysia Development Holding which subscribed to an amount of just under $250m in nominal value of redeemable convertible loan stocks, subject to certain conditions. This investment marks another significant milestone in Sapura Energy’s financial restructuring efforts. Malaysia Development Holding, a special purpose vehicle of the Minister of Finance, specified that the proceeds of the subscription can only be used to settle or pay liabilities owed to Malaysian service providers operating and supporting the oil and gas sector. According to Sapura, this funding is a pivotal step in restoring the financial stability of Malaysian vendors within the oil and gas sector. Sapura Energy supports around 2,300 Malaysian vendors 1,800 of which are small and medium firms. The company has awarded RM7.3bn ($1.65bn) in contracts to Malaysian vendors in the last five years. In recent company news, Sapura Energy wonmultiple contractsworth RM3.2bn ($721m) for its drilling business at the end of February."

Ocean Installer’s addition to the alliance will drive down the costs of installation and its existing fleet of vessels and workforce can be transferred to the floating offshore wind sector without significant adaptation. The company will work in conjunction with fellow alliance member Haventus, owners of the Port of Ardersier, on dry storage of the structures, batched installation, and quick connect/disconnect systems to create a protocol for how future projects are installed. Ocean Installer will provide proven engineering expertise and installation services, post-FID, for the mooring system installation, inter-array cables system and marshalling of the floating units during the fabrication phase, tow-out and hook up. The Cerulean Winds-led alliance also consists of GoBe, NOV, Worley, Siemens Energy, and Bilfinger. The wind turbine supplier as well as the cable supplier and installer will be picked during the first quarter of 2025. “For floating wind to be successful in the North Sea we’ve got to use expertise and experience from the oil and gas sector to turbo-charge the speed of cost reduction – that is what Ocean Installer is bringing to the project. Using their capabilities, we believe we can develop a standardised process to cut installation costs and make floating wind levelized cost of energy comparable to fixed offshore wind,” said Dan Jackson, founding director of Cerulean Winds. Aspen, Beech, and Cedar wind farms will comprise over 300 turbines. The 1GW Aspen site will be developed first, providing new offshore wind capacity and helping the UK to meet its 50GW by 2030 target."

The 140-m-long Solong, owned by Hamburg-based Ernst Russ, hit the 183-m-long Stena Immaculate while anchored near Hull, rupturing at least one of its cargo tanks containing jet fuel and triggering a fire with fuel “reported released.” The crews abandoned the ships minutes after the incident took place onMonday morning. The UK coastguard rescued 36 crewmembers from both vessels, while one crewmember of the Portuguese-flagged boxship remained missing. The crew aboard the Stena Bulk-owned and Crowley-managed Stena Immaculate were confirmed safe and accounted for by both companies. Ernst Russ said separately that 13 of the 14 Solong crew had been brought safely ashore. “After an extensive search for the missing crew member sadly they have not been found and the search has ended,” said Matthew Atkinson, divisional commander for HM Coastguard. A trawlerman who was among dozens of small boats that raced to answer to the mayday call described “very scary” scenes as they were faced with “plumes of smoke” and a “really strong smell of burning’”. “It’s a miracle they didn’t all die,” he told local media. “The fog was pretty horrendous,” he added. Meanwhile, both vessels remain on fire, raising concerns among experts and environmental groups about the impact on wildlife. The Solong was reportedly carrying 15 containers of sodium cyanide while on its way from Scotland to the Netherlands. At the time it was hit, the Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks. US-based Crowley said it is working closely with response agencies, including the HM Coastguard, to secure the vessel in a restricted safety area and initiate spill containment response."

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett provides readers with an overview of what tariffs mean for seaborne trades. A problem with trying to write about the possible effects of tariffs on the merchant shipping business is that the people who want to stick tariffs on stuff keep changing their minds. However, there are some broad statements – not quite eternal truths, but close – that we can make. The most important one, for us, is that manufacturers will move their production – and therefore the endpoints of their supply chains – to places that are exempt from tariffs imposed by their target markets. That is what they did in the past, on a vast scale. Consider the statement from the British government that they are not retaliating against American tariffs, “Because we hope to negotiate a trade agreement with the USA”. What they actually mean, but cannot say out loud, is: “Because we hope to attract European manufacturing investment to the UK, which will be exempt from some of the US tariffs, and thus to kick start our stagnant economy.” You see how devious things become, as soon as tariffs enter the picture? Thinking further along these lines, tax officials, already worried by transfer pricing, will have to consider that tariffs make transfer pricing more attractive than ever, and that far more effort will go into it… which means that the number of government staff needed to control it will increase. Let’s make the reasonable assumption that the American people will not rise up against tyranny and “institute new Government”, as they claim to have done in 1776, so US tariffs, and counter-tariffs imposed in response to them, become, if not indeed permanently established, at least “a thing” for the next four years, or eight years, or anyway beyond the time horizon of anyone thinking about a new ship. If we are old enough, we started our working lives in the GATT world and then lived most of our lives in the WTO world. None of us have experienced a world of tariffs and counter-tariffs without a global tariff reduction organisation because that was the 1930s. Tariffs don’t necessarily stop cargo movements; tariffs can change the routes and we can say with some confidence that the changes will add distance and add complexity, because in a WTO world cargo will take the most economical route from A to B, whereas in a tariff world the same cargo, which may not take the same form (it may be components rather than finished items) will move in such a way as to avoid a tariff. We can also say with confidence that any tariff imposed on anything will be more than any freight rate that we could dream of charging. Now we must think about supply chains. Obviously, supply chain managers will reconstruct their supply chains to minimise the impact of tariffs; they may have to do so at very short notice, and the containerline salesperson who tries to insist on a pre-tariff contract when her or his customers are under extreme pressure is going to get remembered, and not in a good way. This is starting to look a bit like a world in which cargo flows are thinner and longer; a world in which the medium-sized longer haul ship is more useful than the largest ships, and in which transfer terminals are going to be very handy things to have. On the other hand, the Trumpery tariff against Chinese shipbuilding will encourage people to use the largest possible ships to call at US ports, so as to produce the lowest impact per stick of cargo. So ultramaxes, VLCCs, VLGCs and if only it were possible, (which it is not!) valemaxes, to call at US ports. Terminals with rail access to the US – and we can all think of a couple, in Canada and in Mexico – might be suitable places to berth Chinese built ships. And, of course, ships not built in China and not owned by owners who own ships built in China will not be subject to the penalty. How many of us sat down and worked out how to get round the Trumpery penalty, how long it would take and how much it would cost to do so? I certainly did and, gentle reader, I bet you did too. It is not hard, is it! One good law shipping law firm, a few phone calls, a spell of drafting, a signing, and away we go… think the dark fleet but in spades redoubled… on reflection, in No Trumps, redoubled. Cargo will continue to flow, but some cargo will flow in different and more complex channels. The tonnages may go down a bit, but the ton-mileages will go up. What we need to think about, and plan for, is, “Where will the cargo come from and where will it go, over the next few years?” This is a question of details, and details are not only where we find the devil, they are where information disparities occur, and, to quote Tim Huxley, information disparities are where the shipowner (and his broker) make their money."

The ACCC has outlined preliminary competition concerns, including that DP World’s ownership of a national container transport provider is likely to reduce competition and could lead to higher prices and reduced quality for Australian importers and exporters. ACCC commissioner Philip Williams said the regulator is also looking into the potential for DP World to gain access to commercially sensitive information about Silk’s rivals through the acquisition. The Dubai-based ports and logistics giant struck a deal to acquire Silk for about A$174.5m ($115.6m) or A$2.14 per share last November. The company’s board has unanimously recommended that its shareholders approve the acquisition. The ACCC has invited interested parties to submit their views by March 27 and is likely to announce its findings in early June."

        "content": "Malaysian offshore marine support services firm Perdana Petroleum has won a work order from energy supermajor Shell for the charter of two accommodation work barges. Perdana won the work order from Shell’s Malaysian subsidiary Sarawak Shell. Under the deal, the barges are chartered by Perdana’s wholly-owned unit Perdana Nautika for three years. Financial details were left undisclosed. The vessels, which can accommodate 300 people each, will start their contracts on March 15 and April 7 respectively, with an option to extend for one year. Perdana Nautika will also provide the accommodation work barges with crews and equipment to perform 24-hour services for assisting or servicing drilling rigs, offshore installation, derrick barges, towing and anchor jobs. This is Perdana’s first charter win this year. Last year, the company won eight work orders and four contract extensions for its vessels that work in the oil and gas sector. Last month, the company also revealed in its financial reports that it had achieved its highest annual profit in 18 years thanks mostly to improved vessel utilisation and charter rates. Due to these factors, the company is mulling fleet renewal as it believes that charter rates would remain high in the long term due to tight supply."

        "content": "Twelve partners from eight European countries have come together to drive forward a €10.2m ($11.1m) project that will demonstrate a full DC electrical grid concept on a real vessel. The ALL-DC- SHIPS project will advance the electrification of maritime transport with a fully DC-based architecture, including the secondary network supplying hotel loads. There will be developments on power converters with wide bandgap components, solid-state protection devices and energy management systems for better overall efficiency. Professor Pietro Tricoli from the University of Birmingham commented: “To support this [green] transition, shipboard power systems must integrate high-power components and protection devices more efficiently” While some vessels have already incorporated DC primary grids, their secondary grids have largely remained based on traditional AC solutions. By integrating advanced components with existing power converters and protection devices in primary and secondary grids, the ALL-DC-SHIPS project aims to reduce the risk of blackouts due to faults, improving the overall reliability of the power system. The ALL-DC-SHIPS project received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme."

The footage from theIonic Apisis from two cameras, with the day camera showing dense fog, with the accident itself captured on a thermal imaging camera. The Portuguese-registeredSolongwas sailing to Rotterdam at about 16 knots when it allided with the anchored US jet fuel-carrying tanker, according to AIS data. “This video footage clearly shows the context of the accident, that is, the fog conditions at the time, while the moment of impact is also shown clearly,” said Yarden Gross, CEO and co-founder of Orca AI. The video evidence has been handed over to UK authorities investigating the incident, which unfolded on Monday morning just before 10 am, leading to oneSolongcrewmember missing and presumed dead andthe arrestof the vessel’s Russian captain on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. Meanwhile, the fire onboard theStena Immaculatehas ceased with no visible signs of smoke or flame after reviews on Wednesday, and the vessel is stable and remains securely anchored, the ship’s manager, Crowley, said in the latest update. TheSolonghas been towed to a safe location with “small pockets of fire” on the top deck visible on Wednesday, chief coastguard Paddy O’Callaghan reported. It remains unclear what volume of jet fuel may have been released fromStena Immaculateas a result of the incident. Crowley said the initial third-party assessment of the vessel indicated “no ongoing release of jet fuel to the water and no sheen on the water”. “Salvors will conduct onboard assessments of the vessels as soon as they are safe to board,” O’Callaghan noted."

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett provides readers with an overview of what tariffs mean for seaborne trades. A problem with trying to write about the possible effects of tariffs on the merchant shipping business is that the people who want to stick tariffs on stuff keep changing their minds. However, there are some broad statements – not quite eternal truths, but close – that we can make. The most important one, for us, is that manufacturers will move their production – and therefore the endpoints of their supply chains – to places that are exempt from tariffs imposed by their target markets. That is what they did in the past, on a vast scale. Consider the statement from the British government that they are not retaliating against American tariffs, “Because we hope to negotiate a trade agreement with the USA”. What they actually mean, but cannot say out loud, is: “Because we hope to attract European manufacturing investment to the UK, which will be exempt from some of the US tariffs, and thus to kick start our stagnant economy.” You see how devious things become, as soon as tariffs enter the picture? Thinking further along these lines, tax officials, already worried by transfer pricing, will have to consider that tariffs make transfer pricing more attractive than ever, and that far more effort will go into it… which means that the number of government staff needed to control it will increase. Let’s make the reasonable assumption that the American people will not rise up against tyranny and “institute new Government”, as they claim to have done in 1776, so US tariffs, and counter-tariffs imposed in response to them, become, if not indeed permanently established, at least “a thing” for the next four years, or eight years, or anyway beyond the time horizon of anyone thinking about a new ship. If we are old enough, we started our working lives in the GATT world and then lived most of our lives in the WTO world. None of us have experienced a world of tariffs and counter-tariffs without a global tariff reduction organisation because that was the 1930s. Tariffs don’t necessarily stop cargo movements; tariffs can change the routes and we can say with some confidence that the changes will add distance and add complexity, because in a WTO world cargo will take the most economical route from A to B, whereas in a tariff world the same cargo, which may not take the same form (it may be components rather than finished items) will move in such a way as to avoid a tariff. We can also say with confidence that any tariff imposed on anything will be more than any freight rate that we could dream of charging. Now we must think about supply chains. Obviously, supply chain managers will reconstruct their supply chains to minimise the impact of tariffs; they may have to do so at very short notice, and the containerline salesperson who tries to insist on a pre-tariff contract when her or his customers are under extreme pressure is going to get remembered, and not in a good way. This is starting to look a bit like a world in which cargo flows are thinner and longer; a world in which the medium-sized longer haul ship is more useful than the largest ships, and in which transfer terminals are going to be very handy things to have. On the other hand, the Trumpery tariff against Chinese shipbuilding will encourage people to use the largest possible ships to call at US ports, so as to produce the lowest impact per stick of cargo. So ultramaxes, VLCCs, VLGCs and if only it were possible, (which it is not!) valemaxes, to call at US ports. Terminals with rail access to the US – and we can all think of a couple, in Canada and in Mexico – might be suitable places to berth Chinese built ships. And, of course, ships not built in China and not owned by owners who own ships built in China will not be subject to the penalty. How many of us sat down and worked out how to get round the Trumpery penalty, how long it would take and how much it would cost to do so? I certainly did and, gentle reader, I bet you did too. It is not hard, is it! One good law shipping law firm, a few phone calls, a spell of drafting, a signing, and away we go… think the dark fleet but in spades redoubled… on reflection, in No Trumps, redoubled. Cargo will continue to flow, but some cargo will flow in different and more complex channels. The tonnages may go down a bit, but the ton-mileages will go up. What we need to think about, and plan for, is, “Where will the cargo come from and where will it go, over the next few years?” This is a question of details, and details are not only where we find the devil, they are where information disparities occur, and, to quote Tim Huxley, information disparities are where the shipowner (and his broker) make their money."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "While there have been no attacks by the Houthis from Yemen on merchant shipping this year, shipowners are still giving the Red Sea a wide berth to the consternation of the Suez Canal Authority. Indeed, for shipping’s two largest sectors, the number of ships avoiding the Red Sea has actually increased this year. According to data from Jefferies, an investment bank, diversions have increased in the tanker and dry cargo segments. Dry bulk diversions are up to 56% of 2023 figures so far this year, up from 45% in 2024; crude tanker diversions have risen to 48% from 35% and product tankers are up to 52% from 45%. Containership traffic has continued to divert with transits in the region in 2025 down 90% relative to figures in 2023. This is steady with diversions seen in 2024, while LNG and LPG have continued to divert at the same pace as seen in 2024 with 80% and 74% of capacity, respectively, bypassing the region so far this year. Data from ABG Sundal Collier shows that overall Gulf of Aden arrivals are down 72% from the 2023 average, something that has badly affected the Egyptian economy with revenues at the Suez. Canal Authority plummeting. Ralph Leszczynski, head of research at Banchero Costa, toldSplashthat there are currently around 200 Red Sea crossings per week, based on AIS tracking data. This is still less than half of the number of crossings of two years ago, which were about 500 per week. The Houthis said on Tuesday that they are resuming a ban on the passage of all Israeli ships in the Red Sea, Arabian Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait after a four-day deadline they gave Israel to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip expired. The description of what constitutes Israeli in the statement was deemed ambiguous by Ambrey, a British maritime security specialist. Ambrey is advising merchant shipping to check their affiliation with the Houthi target profile and to reassess the risk to voyages through the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden. “The situation is arguably still dangerous in the Red Sea, given that the truce in Gaza is fragile, sectarian conflict in Syria has been heating up again, and the US government has been making incendiary comments on Gaza and Iran in recent weeks, so it is believed that there is a possibility Houthi attacks could well restart at short notice. Hence many owners still prefer to play safe and avoid risking their ships and their crews’ lives,” commented Leszczynski from Banchero Costa. Whilst no actual attacks have at this point been reported since the Houthi announcement on Tuesday, the office of the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) has reported electronic interference seen from multiple ships in the region disrupting navigational systems and requiring vessels to use backup methods. After more than 100 ships were attacked from late 2023 and throughout last year, the Houthis had ceased its campaign against merchant shipping this year, in line with the tentative peace deal struck between Israel and Hamas. There is little sign authorities believe the Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to an end anytime soon. The European Union announced last month it is extending the mandate of its maritime security operation, EUNAVFOR Aspides, for an additional year, reinforcing efforts to safeguard freedom of navigation in the Red Sea region. The operation will now continue until February 28, 2026, with a budget of over €17m ($17.8m) allocated for its extended period. As and when the Red Sea does open up for merchant ship traffic will drive profits and losses for many shipping companies this year. Top management at Maersk laid out last month how the Houthis could dictate the line between black or red ink for the coming year. Maersk’s EBIT forecast for 2025 ranges from zero to $3bn, depending on whether the Red Sea opens in the middle of the year or the end of the year."

The transaction strengthens our financial position and supports the execution of our long-term growth strategy of developing floating production infrastructure projects and energy transition solutions,” said Marco Beenen, the CEO of BW Offshore. The FPSO completed conversion at Keppel Shipyard in 2009. It has a storage capacity of about 600,000 barrels of oil and a processing capacity of 80,000 barrels per day. The unit’s current deal with Murphy Oil is a five-year extension signed in March 2020."

        "content": "An open letter signed by several NGOs has been sent to the European Commission and Commissioner for Health and Animal Welfare, Olivér Várhelyi about a “deeply concerning” situation on a livestock carrier. Livestock vesselExpress Mencountered several issues at sea that led to significant delays in its journey, resulting in “great suffering” to the nearly 3,000 animals onboard. The vessel departed from Romania for Haifa on February 22 and reached its destination on March 9, fifteen days after it set off when the crossing should have taken no longer than six, according to Eurogroup For Animals. At one point the vessel seemed to be going back to Romania but then it changed course again. After this had been going on for nine days Ethical Farming Ireland (EFI) contacted the Romanian authorities and found out that the vessel’s engine broke down due to some mechanical problems and that the captain was instructed to return the vessel to port. However, the transporter’s representative contacted the captain who confirmed that the necessary repairs were carried out and that sufficient feed was onboard, supplemented in Istanbul. “The necessary repairs clearly were not carried out – the vessel went to anchor on two more occasions after that,” EFI said. The 1983-builtExpress M, owned by UAE-based Naseem Al Bahar General and managed by Greece’s Hellas Shipping Management, has had a history of issues. In 2020 the vessel came to Ireland to collect cattle but was detained at Belview Port Waterford due to a number of deficiencies. The Irish authorities revoked the certificate of approval and it left empty. There have been four other detentions in recent years, the latest in December 2024. The letter to the EC Commissioner has called on him to look into the incident, with the Irish animal welfare campaigners and other NGOs stressing that the latest case demonstrated that live animal transport by sea is inherently unsafe and must be phased out as a matter of urgency in the ongoing revision of the transport regulation. “These sea journeys are too risky and should be banned. We cannot guarantee the safety of animals once they have left our shores and time and time again serious incidents occur, where thousands of animals are stranded at sea, suffering appallingly. The condition of the animals arriving at Haifa port was very poor – footage shows animals completely caked in manure, there is a lot of nasal discharge and ringworm,” EFI said, adding: “This particular case was made worse because the crew were not prepared for such a long journey as it took more than twice as long as was scheduled.”"

        "content": "Acute labour shortages see South Korea reach further and further afield to fill positions at its booming shipyards. Some 280 workers have been sourced from landlocked Uzbekistan to start work this summer at a number of yards around the industrial city of Ulsan. The workers will be paid South Korea’s minimum wage of 10,030 won ($7.60) per hour. While foreign workers have previously been employed in South Korea’s shipbuilding industry, officials said this is the first time a local government is directly involved in the recruitment process. Ulsan is supporting the initiative by setting up shipbuilding training facilities in Uzbekistan. The labour ministry and Ulsan city will evaluate the pilot program before considering further expansion. South Korea has had a significant manpower shortage in recent years, exacerbated by increased shipbuilding contracts. The national government has been trying to mitigate this by increasing the yearly limit for skilled worker visas and forming training and recruitment agreements with Asian nations. Seoul has gone further away to find labour sources, turning to landlocked Nepal a couple of years ago, with up to 3,000 Nepalis sought to come and work in South Korea alongside many workers coming from Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand."

        "content": "One in five shipping companies faced a cyber attack in the last 12 months, however, ransom costs are plummeting, according to results from a survey contained in a new 57-page cyber security report published by Thetius, CyberOwl and HFW. Key results from the shipowner survey show that 7% of survey participants admitted to paying a ransom following a cyber attack. In 2023, nearly 14% admitted to paying a ransom. The average cost of a ransom payment is now less than $100,000. In 2023 it was $3.2m. 93% of crew surveyed said they feel underprepared to navigate current cyber security challenges with 70%of crew respondents saying they felt that training could be improved with exercises and drills. According to analysis by CyberOwl, of the 1,200+ vessel cyber security cases that they addressed during 2024, 60% of incidents are caused by malware spreading onto vessel systems. 77% of these malware cases were spread through USB and removable media, such as engineers’ laptops. “With one in five shipping companies facing a cyberattack in the last 12 months, our landmark report could not be more relevant,” said Tom Walters, a partner at HFW. “The shipping industry is increasingly relying on technology for its operations, and with this comes greater exposure from external threat actors. It is vital that companies operating at every stage of the vessel lifecycle take action to protect themselves from the continuing threat. “The lack of harmonisation across maritime cybersecurity regulations, guidelines, and standards is biting us now. Every year, we add more requirements, but they’re not aligned in the details, and it’s becoming a nightmare for the industry and creating an unsustainable model for the future,” commented Scott Dickerson, director of the Global Maritime Cybersecurity Consortium."

        "content": "A new 49-page white paper from DNV shows the strong take-up of wind assist propulsion systems (WAPS) in the 2020s, and how this fuel-saving tech could develop in the coming years. Wind-assisted propulsion has already delivered annual fuel savings of between 5% and 20% for certain ships, the white paper claimed. There has been a rapid uptake of WAPS in the global fleet since 2021, with 52 seagoing ships now in operation and 97 newbuilds with WAPS in the orderbook as of January 2025, plus many more ships earmarked for retrofitting. Currently, 75% of the WAPS fleet are retrofits. For bulkers and tankers, today’s dominant WAPS technologies are rotor sails (54%), while for general cargo ships the dominant technology is suction sails (67%). In total, rotor sails make up almost 50% of the current overall uptake. A tenfold increase is expected by newbuilds between 2024 and 2025, with high numbers also in the current orderbook for 2026 and 2027, DNV data shows. In the longer term, DNV posits it is possible so-called “wind corridors” will emerge potentially operated by autonomous and unmanned ships. These future vessels could eliminate the ship’s bridge, decreasing wind resistance while having a smaller crew would reduce auxiliary energy demand, and with fewer onboard facilities required to support the crew, this would also save space and weight. “Transitioning towards 100% wind-powered vessels on promising routes would require significant change in the current practice of operating on direct routes at high speed and may not suit all cargo types, such as certain types of perishable goods,” the class society advised."

The collaboration will leverage TechnipFMC’s integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and installation (iEPCI) model. This alliance will rapidly advance Cairn’s deepwater exploration ambitions by using TechnipFMC’s extensive expertise and technologies. The agreement also incorporates the use of an integrated front-end engineering and design (iFEED) model which optimises project performance using TechnipFMC’s subsea production systems and subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines (SURF) work scopes. Cairn currently contributes around 25% of the nation’s domestic crude oil production and has revealed plans to double this figure. The company has a 4,500 sq km offshore deepwater block in the Krishna Godavari basin on the east coast. The block already has four gas discoveries, with almost half of it covered with 3D seismic. The four prospects hold a resource potential of 5 tcf, however, none of them are drilled."

The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) hit Iran’s Minister of Petroleum, Mohsen Paknejad, with sanctions yesterday as well as 10 more tankers and three tugs. Among the 10 tankers sanctioned, the one most likely to grab the headlines is the 1997-built Comoros-flaggedItaugua, a VLCC currently moored off Bangladesh awaiting demolition, something that is now unlikely to happen following Washington’s designation. TheSeaskyis also noteworthy in the latest American rulings for its flag. The LR2 is accused of transporting tens of thousands of metric tons of fuel oil on behalf of Iran to China. It flies the flag of San Marino, a shipping register founded in 2021. Landlocked San Marino’s growth will likely raise questions within European circles – its fleet growing by 663% last year to 1.1m gt. Three Southeast Asian tugs who have aided Iran’s ship-to-ship transfers to get oil to China are also part of this third wave of sanctions handed out by the Trump administration in less than two months since the new government came to power. “The Iranian regime continues to use the proceeds from the nation’s vast oil resources to advance its narrow, alarming self-interests at the expense of the Iranian people,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “Treasury will fight and disrupt any attempts by the regime to fund its destabilising activities and further its dangerous agenda.” Iran exports are estimated to have declined to 1.35m barrels per day on average during January and February, as compared to their 2024 average of 1.70m barrels per day. There are increasing reports of volumes lifting from Iran but facing extended storage time in Southeast Asia as the pool of buyers and ships available has tightened."

Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s company CK Hutchison should think twice about which side it wants to stand with, according to a scathing newspaper commentary posted last night by Beijing’s top office for the city’s affairs on its website. Citing criticisms calling the deal a “betrayal of all Chinese people”, the commentary was first published by pro-Beijing publicationTa Kung Paoand shared in full by Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on its official website yesterday. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House there had been pressure on Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison to sell its two port holdings in Panama, and with growing trade wars brewing, the conglomerate decided last week the time had come to step back from an industry it was the original global pioneer in. CK Hutchison’s co-managing director Frank Sixt claimed last week: “This transaction is the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” He described the transaction valuation as “compelling”. TheTa Kung Paoarticle, which is dominating headlines in Hong Kong today, described 96-year-old Li’s deal as a “hegemonic act” by the US using its national power to encroach on the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through “despicable means” such as coercion, pressure and inducement. “This is exactly why some internet users have generally questioned and criticised the deal by CK Hutchison Holdings,” the commentary read. “They believe it is kneeling down, a mercenary act which disregards national interests and national justice, betrays and sells out all Chinese people. These emotional expressions of internet users are completely understandable.” CK Hutchison has yet to comment on theTa Kung Paoarticle, and the conglomerate’s commitment to sell to US-controlled BlackRock. Since returning to power on January 20, Trump has focused considerable energies targeting China’s maritime dominance not just in ports, but also in shipbuilding with the new administration mulling a series of taxes for Chinese-built ships calling at US ports."

        "content": "While there have been no attacks by the Houthis from Yemen on merchant shipping this year, shipowners are still giving the Red Sea a wide berth to the consternation of the Suez Canal Authority. Indeed, for shipping’s two largest sectors, the number of ships avoiding the Red Sea has actually increased this year. According to data from Jefferies, an investment bank, diversions have increased in the tanker and dry cargo segments. Dry bulk diversions are up to 56% of 2023 figures so far this year, up from 45% in 2024; crude tanker diversions have risen to 48% from 35% and product tankers are up to 52% from 45%. Containership traffic has continued to divert with transits in the region in 2025 down 90% relative to figures in 2023. This is steady with diversions seen in 2024, while LNG and LPG have continued to divert at the same pace as seen in 2024 with 80% and 74% of capacity, respectively, bypassing the region so far this year. Data from ABG Sundal Collier shows that overall Gulf of Aden arrivals are down 72% from the 2023 average, something that has badly affected the Egyptian economy with revenues at the Suez. Canal Authority plummeting. Ralph Leszczynski, head of research at Banchero Costa, toldSplashthat there are currently around 200 Red Sea crossings per week, based on AIS tracking data. This is still less than half of the number of crossings of two years ago, which were about 500 per week. The Houthis said on Tuesday that they are resuming a ban on the passage of all Israeli ships in the Red Sea, Arabian Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait after a four-day deadline they gave Israel to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip expired. The description of what constitutes Israeli in the statement was deemed ambiguous by Ambrey, a British maritime security specialist. Ambrey is advising merchant shipping to check their affiliation with the Houthi target profile and to reassess the risk to voyages through the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden. “The situation is arguably still dangerous in the Red Sea, given that the truce in Gaza is fragile, sectarian conflict in Syria has been heating up again, and the US government has been making incendiary comments on Gaza and Iran in recent weeks, so it is believed that there is a possibility Houthi attacks could well restart at short notice. Hence many owners still prefer to play safe and avoid risking their ships and their crews’ lives,” commented Leszczynski from Banchero Costa. Whilst no actual attacks have at this point been reported since the Houthi announcement on Tuesday, the office of the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) has reported electronic interference seen from multiple ships in the region disrupting navigational systems and requiring vessels to use backup methods. After more than 100 ships were attacked from late 2023 and throughout last year, the Houthis had ceased its campaign against merchant shipping this year, in line with the tentative peace deal struck between Israel and Hamas. There is little sign authorities believe the Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to an end anytime soon. The European Union announced last month it is extending the mandate of its maritime security operation, EUNAVFOR Aspides, for an additional year, reinforcing efforts to safeguard freedom of navigation in the Red Sea region. The operation will now continue until February 28, 2026, with a budget of over €17m ($17.8m) allocated for its extended period. As and when the Red Sea does open up for merchant ship traffic will drive profits and losses for many shipping companies this year. Top management at Maersk laid out last month how the Houthis could dictate the line between black or red ink for the coming year. Maersk’s EBIT forecast for 2025 ranges from zero to $3bn, depending on whether the Red Sea opens in the middle of the year or the end of the year."

The American president will make a decision shortly on whether to carry out suggestions made by the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) following an investigation carried out over the past year into China’s growing dominance in maritime, especially in the realm of shipbuilding. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements In a comment filed on the USTR site, CSA called the agency’s proposed actions discriminatory and said they violate World Trade Organization rules as well as WTO dispute settlement rulings. The USTR’s move also violates the 2003 Sino-US Maritime Agreement, CSA said, adding that it violates US laws and rules. The proposals exceed the statutory authority of the USTR, infringe on the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission, violate the standards for agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act and violate the Export Clause of the US Constitution, the group said. The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry, in a separate comment, said it opposed the proposal. The first signs of a two-tier market are emerging in anticipation of Trump’s likely penalisation of Chinese-built tonnage. Broker BRS reported this week Chinese-linked ships are now becoming “far less attractive” for long-time charters due to the likelihood that, at some point during their charters, these ships would be required to call at US ports. Law firm Hill Dickinson is also seeing revisions to charter-party wording, both bespoke terms and amendments to standard charter-party forms for voyage and period fixtures in relation to a likely impending clampdown on Chinese-built tonnage by the US. China’s foreign ministry said this week the move would not revitalise the US shipbuilding industry and that China would take steps to uphold its rights and interests. Splashreaders meanwhile have called for a tax on Boeing airplanes calling at Chinese airports. Clarksons Research has calculated nearly 37,000 US port calls last year by ships that would likely face the maximum $1.5m fee due to their connection to China, equivalent to 83% of containership calls but only around 30% of stops by tankers. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of less than 1%. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans earlier this week in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

Namely, Brazilian state-owned giant Petrobras has launched a new tender for two anchor handling, tug, and supply vessels. Both anchor handlers will be hired on a four-year contract starting in December 2025. The vessels must be equipped with DP2 technology, have a bollard pull of at least 150 tonnes of bollard pull, and must not be older than 25 years. In Indonesia, UK supermajor BP is searching for a supply and accommodation vessel to assist with its wells intervention campaign on the Tangguh gas project. BP also requires the vessel to have DP2 dynamic positioning and it must provide accommodation for at least 39 people. Indonesian state-run company PNG Saka Energi is looking for another AHTS duo. The vessels will support drilling and well-completion operations on the Pangkah PSC. The two anchor handlers will supply materials, assist with rig moving, and supply fuel and water. The vessels will also act as standby boats for emergency evacuation as well as assisting with oil spills and firefighting. The 12-month deal has the requisite of having at least 85% of local content."

        "content": "In the latest maritime bombshell coming out of Washington DC, the Federal Maritime Commission, the country’s shipping regulator, has warned it might bar entry to ships from countries found to be causing choke points at key locations around the world. The FMC yesterday opened an investigation into transit constraints at international maritime chokepoints, particularly concerning the effects of the laws, regulations or practices of foreign governments, and the practices of owners or operators of foreign-flag vessels, on shipping conditions in these chokepoints. The shipping passages under investigation are the English Channel, the Malacca Strait, the Northern Sea Passage, the Singapore Strait, the Panama Canal, the Strait of Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal. “Remedial measures the Commission can take in issuing regulations to address conditions unfavourable to shipping in U.S. foreign trade include refusing entry to U.S. ports by vessels registered in countries responsible for creating unfavourable conditions,” the FMC warned yesterday. In the 53 days since Donald Trump returned to power in Washington DC, the global trading order has been torn up, with the new administration lashing out with tariffs, claims on the Panama Canal, and plans to charge Chinese-built ships calling in the US among a string of policies that have unsettled world trade. “As the Trump 2.0 reality show unfolds, as it does daily, often with singular market-moving tweets, we might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance across shipping sectors. Underwhelming spot earnings render shipping sentiment downbeat while we seek greater clarity on today’s geopolitical, trade and social threats,” noted a recent report from broker Hartland Shipping."

The footage from theIonic Apisis from two cameras, with the day camera showing dense fog, with the accident itself captured on a thermal imaging camera. The Portuguese-registeredSolongwas sailing to Rotterdam at about 16 knots when it allided with the anchored US jet fuel-carrying tanker, according to AIS data. “This video footage clearly shows the context of the accident, that is, the fog conditions at the time, while the moment of impact is also shown clearly,” said Yarden Gross, CEO and co-founder of Orca AI. The video evidence has been handed over to UK authorities investigating the incident, which unfolded on Monday morning just before 10 am, leading to oneSolongcrewmember missing and presumed dead andthe arrestof the vessel’s Russian captain on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. Meanwhile, the fire onboard theStena Immaculatehas ceased with no visible signs of smoke or flame after reviews on Wednesday, and the vessel is stable and remains securely anchored, the ship’s manager, Crowley, said in the latest update. TheSolonghas been towed to a safe location with “small pockets of fire” on the top deck visible on Wednesday, chief coastguard Paddy O’Callaghan reported. It remains unclear what volume of jet fuel may have been released fromStena Immaculateas a result of the incident. Crowley said the initial third-party assessment of the vessel indicated “no ongoing release of jet fuel to the water and no sheen on the water”. “Salvors will conduct onboard assessments of the vessels as soon as they are safe to board,” O’Callaghan noted."

        "content": "The captain of the containershipSolong, involved in a collision with theStena Immaculatetanker in the UK North Sea, has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. The incident, which took place onMondaywith both ships bursting into flames after the jet fuel-carrying tanker’s hull was ruptured, led to one crewmember from Solong missing and presumed dead. The 36 other crewmembers were brought ashore safely. UK police detained the 59-year-old captain, reportedly a Russian national, after the extensive search for the missing seafarer was called off on Monday evening. The ship’s owner, Ernst Russ from Germany, confirmed that “the master of the container ship Solong has been detained by Humberside police.” “The master and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations,” the company said. Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson of Humberside police said the force had “taken primacy for the investigation of any potential criminal offences which arise from the collision between the two vessels.” Initial fearsthatSolongcould sink have been reduced. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said later on Tuesday that “early indications suggest that both vessels are now expected to stay afloat.” The coastguard said it had attached a tow line to the Solong, which was now offshore “in a safer position”, and that a salvage plan for both ships was being developed. TheStena Immaculatewas carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel for the US Air Force when it was struck while anchored near Hull. At least one of its tanks is leaking into the North Sea. Specialist pollution-control vessels arrived at the scene on Tuesday to try to measure the scale of the spillage and contain any toxins. An initial review of the fuel released into the North Sea has suggested the impact has been limited. The tanker’s manager, Crowley, said in an update on Tuesday evening, “It remains unclear at this time what volume of fuel may have been released as a result of the incident, but initial review shows impacts have been limited due to exposure to the fire and evaporation of the Jet A1 fuel.” While the cause of the collision remains unclear, a spokesperson for the UK government said initial information did not contain “any suggestions of foul play at this time”. However, transport minister Mike Kane noted that something had clearly gone “terribly wrong.” Investigators were expected to speak to many of the 36 crewmembers rescued from both ships in the coming days to determine the cause of the accident. Industry experts suggested human error was likely to have played a significant role in the incident but that a technical issue or oversight could not be ruled out."

        "content": "Iron ore exports out of Africa are set to be one of the great growth drivers of global seaborne trades for the rest of the 2020s, new research from broker SSY shows. Guinea’s Simandou mine alone is set to deliver 60m tonnes of iron ore in its first full year, with production, due to start in 2025, expected to double to 120m tonnes the following year, according to Guinea’s Mines and Geology minister. The project is expected to contribute to 10% of China’s seaborne iron ore demand annually. The global trade map for iron ore is set for a redraw Just 200 km away, Ivanhoe Atlantic’s Kon Kweni project is expected to produce up to 5m tonnes of iron ore when its first phase opens next year, with second phase expansion expected to see this figure rise up to 30m tonnes a year. “Beyond these larger mines, Africa is bustling with smaller yet promising projects,” SSY noted in a monthly markets update, noting Genmin’s Baniaka project and Fortescue’s Belinga project, both in Gabon, as well as ArcelorMittal’s Western Range expansion in Liberia, and Jindal Africa’s project in Namibia. “As West Africa’s mines muscle out higher-cost producers elsewhere, particularly in Australia, the global trade map for iron ore is set for a redraw,” SSY suggested, something could see a “notable uptick” for capesize tonne-mile demand. “On the panamax front, Liberia’s newfound iron ore wealth could reshape Europe-bound trade flows, potentially displacing high-cost Canadian exports,” SSY added. Africa’s growing prominence will be a key plank of discussion during next month’s Iron Ore session atGeneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference. Arguably the greatest constraint facing exports out of Africa is in suitable infrastructure.Splashhas reported repeatedly on the soaring volumes of bauxite being shipped out of West Africa over the past couple of years. However, ports are struggling to meet demand as evidenced at the port of Boffa where ship traffic has built up dramatically in recent weeks (see map below) with one cape seen waiting in the queue since January 18 and another kicking its heels since January 24. The growing queues off West Africa have helped push cape rates above $20,000 a day recently."

Svelland Capital and B.O. Steen Shipping increased their respective shareholdings in Dolphin Drilling to 34% and 10%last week. On Thursday, the two proposed Ronny Bjørnådal as the new chairman of the board. The stakeholder tandem also proposed Bertel Steen, CEO of B.O. Steen Shipping, as a new board member. Bjørnådal is a veteran within the international finance community financing large global players in shipping, offshore, and oil service for decades while Steen was previously a partner at Clarksons Securities. “I have a strong belief in both Dolphin Drilling and the rig market going forward, and we are a long-term shareholder in the company. If elected, with Bjørnådal and Steen on the board, the company will gain valuable strategic expertise, as well as a solid network,” said Tor Svelland, investment director at Svelland Capital. He added that there is an increase in demand for “older and well-maintained workhorses” like the ones Dolphin Drilling owns. Svelland believes that the demand increase, along with increased rig scrapping, makes the market balance very attractive. The two investors said in a message to Dolphin Drilling that, although the last few years have been tough for the rig industry in general, they now see a clear trend towards improved market conditions on both the Norwegian and British continental shelves in the North Sea. “It is an extremely exciting time for the oil, gas and energy industry in general. Europe needs more energy to secure its energy supply going forward,” added Steen."

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett provides readers with an overview of what tariffs mean for seaborne trades. A problem with trying to write about the possible effects of tariffs on the merchant shipping business is that the people who want to stick tariffs on stuff keep changing their minds. However, there are some broad statements – not quite eternal truths, but close – that we can make. The most important one, for us, is that manufacturers will move their production – and therefore the endpoints of their supply chains – to places that are exempt from tariffs imposed by their target markets. That is what they did in the past, on a vast scale. Consider the statement from the British government that they are not retaliating against American tariffs, “Because we hope to negotiate a trade agreement with the USA”. What they actually mean, but cannot say out loud, is: “Because we hope to attract European manufacturing investment to the UK, which will be exempt from some of the US tariffs, and thus to kick start our stagnant economy.” You see how devious things become, as soon as tariffs enter the picture? Thinking further along these lines, tax officials, already worried by transfer pricing, will have to consider that tariffs make transfer pricing more attractive than ever, and that far more effort will go into it… which means that the number of government staff needed to control it will increase. Let’s make the reasonable assumption that the American people will not rise up against tyranny and “institute new Government”, as they claim to have done in 1776, so US tariffs, and counter-tariffs imposed in response to them, become, if not indeed permanently established, at least “a thing” for the next four years, or eight years, or anyway beyond the time horizon of anyone thinking about a new ship. If we are old enough, we started our working lives in the GATT world and then lived most of our lives in the WTO world. None of us have experienced a world of tariffs and counter-tariffs without a global tariff reduction organisation because that was the 1930s. Tariffs don’t necessarily stop cargo movements; tariffs can change the routes and we can say with some confidence that the changes will add distance and add complexity, because in a WTO world cargo will take the most economical route from A to B, whereas in a tariff world the same cargo, which may not take the same form (it may be components rather than finished items) will move in such a way as to avoid a tariff. We can also say with confidence that any tariff imposed on anything will be more than any freight rate that we could dream of charging. Now we must think about supply chains. Obviously, supply chain managers will reconstruct their supply chains to minimise the impact of tariffs; they may have to do so at very short notice, and the containerline salesperson who tries to insist on a pre-tariff contract when her or his customers are under extreme pressure is going to get remembered, and not in a good way. This is starting to look a bit like a world in which cargo flows are thinner and longer; a world in which the medium-sized longer haul ship is more useful than the largest ships, and in which transfer terminals are going to be very handy things to have. On the other hand, the Trumpery tariff against Chinese shipbuilding will encourage people to use the largest possible ships to call at US ports, so as to produce the lowest impact per stick of cargo. So ultramaxes, VLCCs, VLGCs and if only it were possible, (which it is not!) valemaxes, to call at US ports. Terminals with rail access to the US – and we can all think of a couple, in Canada and in Mexico – might be suitable places to berth Chinese built ships. And, of course, ships not built in China and not owned by owners who own ships built in China will not be subject to the penalty. How many of us sat down and worked out how to get round the Trumpery penalty, how long it would take and how much it would cost to do so? I certainly did and, gentle reader, I bet you did too. It is not hard, is it! One good law shipping law firm, a few phone calls, a spell of drafting, a signing, and away we go… think the dark fleet but in spades redoubled… on reflection, in No Trumps, redoubled. Cargo will continue to flow, but some cargo will flow in different and more complex channels. The tonnages may go down a bit, but the ton-mileages will go up. What we need to think about, and plan for, is, “Where will the cargo come from and where will it go, over the next few years?” This is a question of details, and details are not only where we find the devil, they are where information disparities occur, and, to quote Tim Huxley, information disparities are where the shipowner (and his broker) make their money."

        "content": "Canada has identified five suitable areas for the development of offshore wind farms in Nova Scotia. A regional assessment initially recommended eight potential wind energy areas, but that was cut down to five. Four of the five areas are south of Nova Scotia’s eastern shore – French Bank, Middle Bank, Sable Island Bank, and Emerald Bank. The fifth area, known as Sydney Bight, is northeast of Cape Breton. In all, these offshore areas cover more than 19,500 square kilometres. Canada will be looking to produce 5GW of electric offshore wind energy from the areas by 2030. A 25-kilometre buffer zone has been recommended from the Nova Scotia coastline and around Sable Island, a national park reserve. The government of Nova Scotia said that it will now seek input from citizens before official designations are granted. This process will end on April 14. After the areas receive official designation, expected later this year, the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator will manage a competitive licensing process. “The location and size of future call for bids areas within wind energy areas will be determined during the subsequent steps in the land tenure process,” the Nova Scotia government said. According to the government, Canada, with the world’s longest coastline, is well-positioned to enter the $1trn global offshore wind market with Nova Scotia being particularly promising with strong winds and favourable underwater conditions."

Founded in 2017 in Dubai, BPG Shipping is one of the many ship operators due to attend the world’s premier commodities shipping conference when Geneva Dry reconvenes at the end of April. BPG specialises in dry bulk, handling both major and minor bulks in the handysize, supramax, and panamax segments. Come the end of April, when Ivanov picks up his delegate pack in the foyer of the Hotel President Wilson on the shore of Lake Geneva, he’s expecting dry bulk prospects to be more healthy, in no small part down to the far higher-than-average number of dry bulk carriers bound for drydockings in 2025. He does concede that tariff uncertainties and a possible slowdown in the global economy cloud any projections this year, topics that will be discussed during the summit’s opening Commodities Shipping Outlook, a high-level scene-setter designed to give attendees an indication of what to expect in the coming 24 months.

The assessment of HM Coastguard is, however, that it is unlikely the vessel will remain afloat,” Kane told parliament, adding also that the vessel’s missing crewmember was unlikely to be found and presumed deceased. The fire onboard the product tankerStena Immaculate, triggered by the collision, has greatly diminished, but theSolongis still alight, the UK coastguard said on Tuesday. The 140-m-longSolongseparated from theStena Immaculatelate last night and began drifting southwards from the scene of the collision. It is being monitored, with tugs on the scene to “make sure the vessel remains away from the coast.” “Safety vessels and other vessels with firefighting capabilities are still on scene with more arriving today,” the coastguard said in a statement. The 2005-built 800 teuSolongwas earlier reported to be carrying containers of sodium cyanide, but the vessel’s owner, Ernst Russ, has denied these claims. “We are able to confirm that there are no containers on board laden with sodium cyanide, as has been misreported. There are four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical, and these containers will continue to be monitored,” the company said in a statement. The UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency is developing a plan to salvage the vessels, with Dutch contractor Boskalis already appointed to work on the US-flaggedStena Immaculate, which was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel at the time of the incident.

Despite there being no attacks on merchant shipping this year, the Donald Trump administration decided to unleash an enormous barrage of strikes on Houthi strongholds over the weekend, linked to Trump’s so-called ‘maximum pressure’ campaign on Iran. The missiles killed 53 people, with Yemeni media also claiming theGalaxy Leader, a car carrier seized by the Houthis in November 2023, was also hit. The US military has continued its campaign today. Earlier this month, the Houthis said they would restart targeting Israeli-linked ships over Israel’s failure to allow humanitarian aid into war-torn Gaza. Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World, grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of Freedom of Navigation upon which International Trade and Commerce depends.” US defence secretary Pete Hegseth toldFox Newsyesterday: “The minute the Houthis say we’ll stop shooting at your ships, we’ll stop shooting at your drones, this campaign will end, but until then it will be unrelenting.” “This is about stopping the shooting at assets … in that critical waterway, to reopen freedom of navigation, which is a core national interest of the United States, and Iran has been enabling the Houthis for far too long,” he said. “They better back off.” After more than 100 ships were attacked from late 2023 and throughout last year, the Houthis had ceased their campaign against merchant shipping this year, in line with the tentative peace deal struck between Israel and Hamas."

        "content": "Liner shipping profits are forecast to slide by more than 80% this year. Analysts at Sea-Intelligence have calculated that the container shipping industry made a combined EBIT last year of $60bn, the third-highest figure recorded in the history of the business, and the highest outside the covid era. One leading container markets analyst, John McCown, who runs New York-based Blue Alpha Capital, is expecting the liner sector to remain in the black this year, albeit with profits sliding to below $10bn. “With the downward trend seen in pricing that has continued this quarter, 1Q25 results will certainly be below 4Q24,” McCown wrote in his latest markets update. If tariffs are implemented then the negative demand shocks can become supply shocks and give rise to inflationary pressure He conceded that the tariff situation unleashed by the new Donald Trump administration in the US has “injected more uncertainty than usual”. The Bank of International Settlements has warned that the uncertainty generated by Trump’s promises to impose tariffs and embark on a massive job cull threatens the world economy’s soft landing after years of high inflation and elevated interest rates. It stated that “policy uncertainty on tariffs, US fiscal policy, immigration, and regulation … work like a negative demand shock. They would have negative effects on spending, investment and we see some signs of that. If tariffs are implemented – and some have been – then the negative demand shocks can become supply shocks and give rise to inflationary pressure.” Container spot rates have been on a constant slide in 2025. The overall Shanghai Containerized Freight Index is now down 47% since the start of the year. Prices on Asia to North Europe, Asia to the Mediterranean, and on the transpacific to the US west and east coasts are now all lower than at any point in time in 2024, according to data from Drewry. However, comparing spot rates now to the level seen in mid-December 2023 just before the Red Sea shipping crisis, Asia to North Europe remains up 74%, Asia to the Mediterranean remains up 96%, while voyages across the Pacific to both the west and east coasts are still up by more than 40% compared to the lows experienced towards the end of 2023. “Continued softening in the spot market comes against a backdrop of weaker than usual volumes post-Lunar New Year, increased competition between liner companies amid alliance restructuring, and widespread uncertainty brought about by an ongoing series of tariff announcements from the US and its trading partners,” commented Clarksons Research in a weekly report. As neatly surmised by Maersk in its annual report published in February, liner profits in 2025 are on a knife edge, largely out of the carriers’ control – what happens in the Middle East ought to dictate the difference between red and black ink. Maersk reported its third-best financial year ever in February with an EBIT for 2024 of $6.5bn. The Danish carrier forecasted global container volume growth in 2025 will be around 4%. However, the very big dividing line between profit and loss this year, according to Maersk, will centre around the Red Sea. The Houthis of Yemen have put their campaign against merchant shipping on hold, with no attacks reported in 2025 so far, as Israel and Hamas take steps toward peace. The situation remains tense however with very few liners returning to take the Suez route between Asia and Europe. Maersk’s EBIT forecast for 2025 ranges from zero to $3bn, depending on whether the Red Sea opens in the middle of the year or the end of the year."

        "content": "We have anew magazinelaunching today, designed to give the shipping industry an idea of how the markets might play out in the coming months. Today’s opening instalment looks at the trajectories of the world’s two largest economies. Economists have been left flabbergasted by the opening months of Donald Trump’s return to power in the US, the international rulebook torn up, policies raining in and often being rescinded by the hour. Making a call on how the global economy plays out in the coming months has rarely been more tricky, or down to the whims of one man. At no point since tracking began on the subject have global trade policies been more uncertain than right now, according to one index developed in the US. I’ve rarely seen a year start with more uncertainty The Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) Index developed by four employees at the Federal Reserve Board analyses the frequency of joint occurrences of trade policy and uncertainty terms in major newspapers, firms’ earnings conference calls, and aggregate data on tariff rates in a way that is similar to existing volatility indices in mainstream financial markets, spanning equities and derivatives. Since Donald Trump returned to the White House on January 20, the index, which goes back to 1960, has spiked to record levels, twice as high as previous peaks registered during Trump’s first term in office. A paper submitted by the creators of the TPU index documents that increases in trade policy uncertainty reduce investment and activity using both firm-level and aggregate data. Trump’s first months back in the White House have dominated shipping headlines for tariffs, a push for peace in Ukraine, a renewed ‘maximum pressure’ strategy on Iran, the creation of a National Energy Dominance Council, and a planned tax on Chinese-built tonnage calling US ports. The war of tariffs is beginning to make its way into the macroeconomic forecasts. As an example, Goldman Sachs just revised their US Q4 2025 GDP growth downwards from 2.2% to 1.7% whilst at the same time increasing their likelihood for a US recession within 12 months from 15% to 20%. “As the Trump 2.0 reality show unfolds, as it does daily, often with singular market-moving tweets, we might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance across shipping sectors. Underwhelming spot earnings render shipping sentiment downbeat while we seek greater clarity on today’s geopolitical, trade and social threats,” notes a recent report from broker Hartland Shipping. “I’ve rarely seen a year start with more uncertainty,” says Tim Huxley, the veteran head of Hong Kong shipowner Mandarin Shipping, adding: “Both the US and China want to see growth and they will do everything they can to achieve that. A stronger domestic economy in China will probably see the target of 5% growth met, in the USA, tariffs could lead to inflation and that could preocupy the new administration.” If shipping markets in the 2020s can be characterised by disruption, then the two decades prior could similarly be defined with one word – China. Without the growth in Chinese demand for commodities, manufactured exports and shipbuilding capacity witnessed since the start of the millennium, the shipping world would be an entirely different place. China’s demand has been a solid factor supporting shipping markets amid economic and political upheaval, pandemic and war. But this drive was, at least initially, itself a disruptive factor. Snakes like big ideas and understanding how things work The opening of China’s economy, often marked by the country’s accession to the WTO in the early 2000s, changed the shipping game. Since then, the industry has become in large part dependent on ever-expanding Chinese demand. For large oil tankers and dry bulk carriers, this is put in stark relief when we consider that Chinese imports of crude oil and iron ore do not just constitute the majority of global incremental import growth in these sectors over the period 2000-2024. Due in part to declines elsewhere, they exceed it. Could this era of expansion go into reverse? In Maritime Strategies International’s view, the answer is yes. There are structural shifts in China’s economy, MSI analysts point out, which will reduce demand for some of the major commodity types it will import. Perhaps the two of the most important of these trends are reduced rates of urbanisation and increased vehicle electrification. John Michael Radziwill, a high profile owner who chairs Monaco-based C Transport Maritime, concedes that China has domestic challenges to its economy that it must address or risk slowing growth and internal discontent. “We see the Chinese government as willing to drip feed support without really enacting enough policies that could turnaround the situation quickly,” Radziwill tellsSplash. The full ramifications for how relations between China and the US, the world’s two largest economies, will develop between Trump and his counterpart, Xi Jinping, still remain unclear. “While we are all kept guessing as to what Mr Trump has in mind for US-China relations, let’s consider the Chinese astrological Snake: it is wise, mysterious and thoughtful,” says Mark Williams, who heads up consultancy Shipping Strategy: “Snakes like big ideas and understanding how things work. In this Year of the Snake, we could all do with some of these characteristics if we are to come out the other side in better shape.” As well as markets coverage, this new magazine also covers pressing regulatory issues and likely tech breakthroughs.Click here to access the full magazine."

The FMC yesterday opened an investigation into transit constraints at international maritime chokepoints, particularly concerning the effects of the laws, regulations or practices of foreign governments, and the practices of owners or operators of foreign-flag vessels, on shipping conditions in these chokepoints. The shipping passages under investigation are the English Channel, the Malacca Strait, the Northern Sea Passage, the Singapore Strait, the Panama Canal, the Strait of Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal. “Remedial measures the Commission can take in issuing regulations to address conditions unfavourable to shipping in U.S. foreign trade include refusing entry to U.S. ports by vessels registered in countries responsible for creating unfavourable conditions,” the FMC warned yesterday. In the 53 days since Donald Trump returned to power in Washington DC, the global trading order has been torn up, with the new administration lashing out with tariffs, claims on the Panama Canal, and plans to charge Chinese-built ships calling in the US among a string of policies that have unsettled world trade. “As the Trump 2.0 reality show unfolds, as it does daily, often with singular market-moving tweets, we might as well suspend trying to make credible forecasts of future supply-demand balance across shipping sectors.

        "content": "Both the China Shipowners’ Association (CSA) and the China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry (CANSI) have left public comments criticising the US Trade Representative’s proposals to charge extra for fleets with Chinese-built tonnage calling at American ports, arguably the biggest shock policy to potentially hit shipping in the opening months of the return of Donald Trump to the White House. The American president will make a decision shortly on whether to carry out suggestions made by the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) following an investigation carried out over the past year into China’s growing dominance in maritime, especially in the realm of shipbuilding. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements In a comment filed on the USTR site, CSA called the agency’s proposed actions discriminatory and said they violate World Trade Organization rules as well as WTO dispute settlement rulings. The USTR’s move also violates the 2003 Sino-US Maritime Agreement, CSA said, adding that it violates US laws and rules. The proposals exceed the statutory authority of the USTR, infringe on the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission, violate the standards for agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act and violate the Export Clause of the US Constitution, the group said. The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry, in a separate comment, said it opposed the proposal. The first signs of a two-tier market are emerging in anticipation of Trump’s likely penalisation of Chinese-built tonnage. Broker BRS reported this week Chinese-linked ships are now becoming “far less attractive” for long-time charters due to the likelihood that, at some point during their charters, these ships would be required to call at US ports. Law firm Hill Dickinson is also seeing revisions to charter-party wording, both bespoke terms and amendments to standard charter-party forms for voyage and period fixtures in relation to a likely impending clampdown on Chinese-built tonnage by the US. China’s foreign ministry said this week the move would not revitalise the US shipbuilding industry and that China would take steps to uphold its rights and interests. Splashreaders meanwhile have called for a tax on Boeing airplanes calling at Chinese airports. Clarksons Research has calculated nearly 37,000 US port calls last year by ships that would likely face the maximum $1.5m fee due to their connection to China, equivalent to 83% of containership calls but only around 30% of stops by tankers. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of less than 1%. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans earlier this week in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

The New York-listed firm has agreed to offload the 2007-built Galway Spirit to an unnamed buyer for delivery in the first quarter of 2025. No price was revealed for the Hyundai Heavy-built unit, but the company has also confirmed the previously reported sale of the 2009-built suezmaxTianlong Spirit, with both ships bringing in a total of $59m. The suezmax sale relates to the four-ship package at $35m each with George Procopiou’s Dynacom Tankers, flagged by S&P sources earlier this year, with the company so far confirming three deals without naming the buyer. Meanwhile, a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission divulged an acquisition of an unnamed 2019-built aframax/LR2 for $63m. Some brokers have identified the vessel as the Daehan-built 115,643 dwtProstar, which had previously sailed for Teekey as part of its chartered-in fleet. Teekay, which last month completed the sale of another ageing LR2, said it expects delivery of its latest purchase during the second quarter of this year. The Kenneth Hvid-led company currently owns 23 suezmaxes, including those agreed for sale, and 15 aframax/LR2 tankers. The company also has five chartered-in ships, four of which aframax/LR2, and a 50% stake in the VLCC Hong Kong Spirit joint venture. “Approximately 60% of our fleet is currently aged 15 years and older, and we may continue the process of fleet renewal in the coming years,” the company said."

The company owns the Morgan’s Point ethylene export terminal in a 50-50 joint venture with Enterprise Products Partners. The operation was expanded in late December, with export capacity expected to increase by at least 550,000 tonnes to 1.55m tonnes per year starting in 2025, and potentially up to a total of 3.2m tons per year in the coming years. The world’s top player in the handysize LPG carrier segmentboughta German-built 17,000 cu m trio from an unnamed seller for $83.9m in January. According to S&P databases, the three ships are the 2009-builtGaschem Pacificand the 2010-builtGaschem AdriaticandGaschem Antarctic. TheGaschem Adriatic, now renamedNavigator Hyperion, was delivered on February 19. The remaining two vessels, now renamedNavigator TitanandNavigator Vesta, were delivered on February 24 and March 17 respectively. Of the three, only theNavigator Hyperionis currently on charter, while the other two are expected to soon be operating in the spot market."

        "content": "The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the Comité Maritime International (CMI), a body responsible for drafting many maritime law conventions, have launched an updated campaign to get governments to ratify urgent maritime treaties. “For a global industry, comprehensively regulated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other United Nations bodies, it is critical that the Conventions are widely ratified in order to ensure that the same regulations apply to all ships in international trade during all parts of their voyage,” the two organisations said today in a release. The renewed campaign comes at a time when the US under Donald Trump is increasingly being seen as tearing up the old international rulebook. The international maritime conventions strongly encouraged to be ratified by governments by ICS and CMI as an urgent priority are the IMO Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks (Nairobi WRC), 2007, IMO 2010 Protocol to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS), 1996, the IMO Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (Hong Kong), 2009, and the United Nations Convention on the International Effects of Judicial Sales of Ships, 2023, also known as the Beijing Convention. A global industry needs global regulations The purpose of the campaign is for ICS and CMI members, which represent national shipowner associations and national maritime law associations respectively, to engage with their governments to urge them to ratify these conventions where they are not currently in force. “Our industry is dependent on a global regulatory system to operate efficiently and safely. Global standards must be uniformly applied and enforced worldwide to prevent significant challenges arising, including a patchwork of unilateral regulations and inferior levels of safety and environmental protection. It is fundamental that the same regulations are equally applied to all ships engaged in international trade, and that the same rules apply during the entire voyage. A global industry needs global regulations,” commented Kiran Khosla, principal director covering legal at the ICS. Ann Fenech, president of the CMI, added: “Today’s challenging international scene and geopolitical developments in which shipowners, charterers, cargo owners, financiers, flag administrations, and maritime players generally are navigating, make it all the more important, now more than ever before, that the maritime law and regulations in different jurisdictions provide legal certainty and uniformity.”"

The liftboat, classified by the China Classification Society, is four-legged and self-elevating using cylindrical legs. The lifting device uses four 2,500-tonne hydraulic pin lifting systems. The liftboat will be fitted with a crane on each side of the main deck of the platform, with a lifting capacity of 50 and 30 tonnes respectively. The vessel has an accommodation building at the bow of the hull and can house 200 people. After the platform is completed, it will serve the Bohai oilfield and assist with production increase and mobile heat injection operations. Currently, the Bohai Oilfield is the largest crude oil production base in China. The production base is situated approximately 200 km east of Beijing and the development of the field began back in 1999. In recent years, WMMP has built more than 40 similar projects as a general contractor, however, most orders came from the Middle East with little demand from the domestic market."

        "content": "Both the China Shipowners’ Association (CSA) and the China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry (CANSI) have left public comments criticising the US Trade Representative’s proposals to charge extra for fleets with Chinese-built tonnage calling at American ports, arguably the biggest shock policy to potentially hit shipping in the opening months of the return of Donald Trump to the White House. The American president will make a decision shortly on whether to carry out suggestions made by the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) following an investigation carried out over the past year into China’s growing dominance in maritime, especially in the realm of shipbuilding. The USTR report cites artificially suppressed labour costs, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft among a raft of accusations levelled at Beijing. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements In a comment filed on the USTR site, CSA called the agency’s proposed actions discriminatory and said they violate World Trade Organization rules as well as WTO dispute settlement rulings. The USTR’s move also violates the 2003 Sino-US Maritime Agreement, CSA said, adding that it violates US laws and rules. The proposals exceed the statutory authority of the USTR, infringe on the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission, violate the standards for agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act and violate the Export Clause of the US Constitution, the group said. The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry, in a separate comment, said it opposed the proposal. The first signs of a two-tier market are emerging in anticipation of Trump’s likely penalisation of Chinese-built tonnage. Broker BRS reported this week Chinese-linked ships are now becoming “far less attractive” for long-time charters due to the likelihood that, at some point during their charters, these ships would be required to call at US ports. Law firm Hill Dickinson is also seeing revisions to charter-party wording, both bespoke terms and amendments to standard charter-party forms for voyage and period fixtures in relation to a likely impending clampdown on Chinese-built tonnage by the US. China’s foreign ministry said this week the move would not revitalise the US shipbuilding industry and that China would take steps to uphold its rights and interests. Splashreaders meanwhile have called for a tax on Boeing airplanes calling at Chinese airports. Clarksons Research has calculated nearly 37,000 US port calls last year by ships that would likely face the maximum $1.5m fee due to their connection to China, equivalent to 83% of containership calls but only around 30% of stops by tankers. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of less than 1%. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans earlier this week in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Liner shipping profits are forecast to slide by more than 80% this year. Analysts at Sea-Intelligence have calculated that the container shipping industry made a combined EBIT last year of $60bn, the third-highest figure recorded in the history of the business, and the highest outside the covid era. One leading container markets analyst, John McCown, who runs New York-based Blue Alpha Capital, is expecting the liner sector to remain in the black this year, albeit with profits sliding to below $10bn. “With the downward trend seen in pricing that has continued this quarter, 1Q25 results will certainly be below 4Q24,” McCown wrote in his latest markets update. If tariffs are implemented then the negative demand shocks can become supply shocks and give rise to inflationary pressure He conceded that the tariff situation unleashed by the new Donald Trump administration in the US has “injected more uncertainty than usual”. The Bank of International Settlements has warned that the uncertainty generated by Trump’s promises to impose tariffs and embark on a massive job cull threatens the world economy’s soft landing after years of high inflation and elevated interest rates. It stated that “policy uncertainty on tariffs, US fiscal policy, immigration, and regulation … work like a negative demand shock. They would have negative effects on spending, investment and we see some signs of that. If tariffs are implemented – and some have been – then the negative demand shocks can become supply shocks and give rise to inflationary pressure.” Container spot rates have been on a constant slide in 2025. The overall Shanghai Containerized Freight Index is now down 47% since the start of the year. Prices on Asia to North Europe, Asia to the Mediterranean, and on the transpacific to the US west and east coasts are now all lower than at any point in time in 2024, according to data from Drewry. However, comparing spot rates now to the level seen in mid-December 2023 just before the Red Sea shipping crisis, Asia to North Europe remains up 74%, Asia to the Mediterranean remains up 96%, while voyages across the Pacific to both the west and east coasts are still up by more than 40% compared to the lows experienced towards the end of 2023. “Continued softening in the spot market comes against a backdrop of weaker than usual volumes post-Lunar New Year, increased competition between liner companies amid alliance restructuring, and widespread uncertainty brought about by an ongoing series of tariff announcements from the US and its trading partners,” commented Clarksons Research in a weekly report. As neatly surmised by Maersk in its annual report published in February, liner profits in 2025 are on a knife edge, largely out of the carriers’ control – what happens in the Middle East ought to dictate the difference between red and black ink. Maersk reported its third-best financial year ever in February with an EBIT for 2024 of $6.5bn. The Danish carrier forecasted global container volume growth in 2025 will be around 4%. However, the very big dividing line between profit and loss this year, according to Maersk, will centre around the Red Sea. The Houthis of Yemen have put their campaign against merchant shipping on hold, with no attacks reported in 2025 so far, as Israel and Hamas take steps toward peace. The situation remains tense however with very few liners returning to take the Suez route between Asia and Europe. Maersk’s EBIT forecast for 2025 ranges from zero to $3bn, depending on whether the Red Sea opens in the middle of the year or the end of the year."

        "content": "The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has revoked a permit for New Jersey’s first offshore wind energy farm potentially stopping it in its tracks. An Environmental Appeals Court Judge remanded a Clean Air Act permit, issued in September last year, back to the EPA. This occurred less than two months after US president Donald Trump called for a review of the federal government’s leasing and permitting practices for wind projects and a temporary withdrawal of all areas on the outer continental shelf from offshore wind leasing. The presidential memorandum, sent in January, directs an immediate review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices and provides that the heads of various executive department agencies, including the administrator of the EPA, shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a comprehensive assessment and review of Federal wind. Following Trump’s move, officials submitted a motion requesting the court to send the permit back to the agency for a review of the environmental impacts of the wind energy project. In early March, Atlantic Shores argued that there was no “good cause” for the withdrawal of the permit and that it was not in the interest of administrative or judicial efficiency. However, the withdrawal went ahead and the EPA stated that it would confer with other executive branch agencies regarding further evaluation of various impacts that may result from the project, including impacts on birds, wildlife, fishing, and other relevant environmental concerns described in the presidential memorandum. According to industry experts, even those projects that have begun construction are vulnerable under this interpretation of Trump’s executive order. In cases of large industrial projects, companies often have to go back to the regulatory agencies to amend permits, so the agencies can simply block the projects mid-construction. Projects currently under construction include Vineyard Wind 1 and Sunrise Wind off the coast of Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Empire Wind 1 off New York, and Dominion’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. Project developer EDF alreadywrote down $940min the value of its stake in the Atlantic Shores project in late February. Its former partner in the project, Shell, did the same in January."

        "content": "Plastic pellets have washed up on shore followinglast week’s collisionbetween theStena Immaculatetanker and the containershipSolongin the North Sea, raising concern among conservationist groups. The UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said on Monday it was advised by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) of a sheen in the sea just off The Wash, which has been identified as “nurdles” – small pellets of plastic resin used in plastics production. The nurdles, sized between 1-5 mm and weighing less than a gram, are likely to have entered the water at the point of collision, the coastguard said, adding that they are not toxic but can present a risk to wildlife if ingested. Coastguard rescue teams and other counter-pollution specialists are conducting a retrieval operation along the shore between Old Hunstanton and Wells-next-the-Sea. “This is a developing situation and the transport secretary continues to be updated regularly,” said Chief coastguard Paddy O’Callaghan. Multiple wildlife and environmental organisations warned the nurdles can have a devastating effect on animals, including seals, puffins and fish. “We’re very concerned about the nurdles and burnt material that is adrift at sea as well as being washed up along the Wash and the Norfolk coast following the tanker collision last week, and we will continue to support the authorities in their efforts to clean up the pollution,” said Tammy Smalley, Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust’s head of conservation. “At this time of the year, there is also the risk that the birds return to their nests and feed the nurdles to their chicks. The plastic may also work its way up the food chain to larger marine mammals which feed on fish or smaller animals which have eaten nurdles,” she added. Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana UK, said the pellets can be trapped in the stomachs of wildlife and stop them eating real food, leading to starvation, warning that it’s nearly impossible to remove them from the ocean once they have entered it, and that they can become more and more toxic as they break down into smaller and smaller pieces.” Sophie Benbow, the director of marine at the conservation organisation Fauna & Flora, noted that plastic pellets were “one of the largest sources of microplastic pollution globally and pose a grave threat to nature and coastal communities”. “It is extremely concerning that the North Sea ship collision has resulted in a mass plastic pellets spill. Once lost into the ocean, these tiny pieces of plastic are almost impossible to contain,” she said. Meanwhile, the ships involved in the incident remain stable, and salvage operations are ongoing. Damage assessment of theStena Immaculateconfirmed that one tank containing jet fuel and one ballast tank containing seawater were affected by the impact, with about 17,500 out of 200,000 barrels onboard lost. The MCA said on Monday that there were “only small periodic pockets of fire” on theSolongwhich were “not causing undue concern”. Plastic pellets (nurdles) have begun to wash ashore on Brancaster Beach and elsewhere along the Norfolk coast, following the North Sea tanker collision last week.

With over 850GW of offshore wind capacity expected to be installed globally by 2050, there is a need for major growth in the production of SOVs to support this expansion. Analysis carried out by ORE Catapult shows that hundreds of these ships are likely to be in operation around the world in the years to come, with an associated global market of nearly £35bn ($45.4bn) between now and 2050. This study will help to develop knowledge of how the UK can provide vessel manufacturing to support offshore wind, delivering jobs and economic investment to communities around the country. “We know that for the UK to tap into the full potential offered by offshore wind, we’re going to need to dramatically increase the number of vessels that can maintain the turbines of the future. It’s vital, therefore, that we work to ensure as many of those vessels as possible can be manufactured in British shipyards,” said Lauren Hadnum, clean maritime manager at ORE Catapult. “As one of the UK’s largest and most established shipbuilders, we are committed to delivering a robust, evidence-based business case that will shape the future of sustainable shipbuilding and reinforce the UK’s role in the global offshore wind supply chain,” added Linton Roberts, APCL Group CTO. Will Apps, the offshore wind strategy director at The Crown Estate, pointed out that one particularly interesting output from the study would be the feasibility assessment of low or no-emission SOVs operating in the UK."

It was the largest wave of strikes to hit Gaza since the ceasefire began on 19 January. The Houthis from Yemen are expected to head back on to more of a war footing at sea following the Israeli attacks, and the renewed strikes hitting Yemen from the American military. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi has said his militants will target US ships in the Red Sea in the wake of massive American strikes on Yemen over the weekend, which continued on Monday. Houthi rebels announced today that they conducted another strike against a US aircraft carrier group, marking their third such assault within 48 hours. 63% of vessels targeted by the Houthi lack any clear affiliation to the US, UK or Israel Earlier this month, the Houthis said they would restart targeting Israeli-linked ships over Israel’s failure to allow humanitarian aid into war-torn Gaza. Jack Kennedy, head of MENA country risk at S&P Global Market Intelligence, warned: “The resumption of US airstrikes increases the likelihood of further Houthi attacks on US and allied naval assets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, with a severe risk to all vessels in transit due to uncertainties around Houthi targeting selection. Our data shows that 63% of vessels targeted by the Houthi lack any clear affiliation to the US, UK or Israel. While the stated US intent is to restore freedom of navigation, the Houthis’ decentralized missile capabilities and intent to assert regional influence complicate the situation, likely leading to increased threats to shipping and regional stability.” “The US strikes against Houthi targets over the weekend are likely to raise insurance rates in the region and keep merchant shipping traffic from transiting through the region,” suggested a shipping markets update from analysts at Jefferies, an investment bank. Moreover, the Trump administration’s determination to link any further Houthi attacks to Iran risks spreading the Red Sea shipping crisis to other important chokepoints. “Trump has warned that counter-attacks from the Houthis will de facto be seen as attacks performed by Iran and that Iran will be held responsible. For shipping this means an increased risk of escalation which could include the Strait of Hormuz,” commented Lars Jensen, the head of Vespucci Maritime, who has been providing a daily update on the situation in the Red Sea for the past 16 months. While there have been no attacks by the Houthis from Yemen on merchant shipping this year, shipowners are still giving the Red Sea a wide berth to the consternation of the Suez Canal Authority. Indeed, for shipping’s two largest sectors, the number of ships avoiding the Red Sea has actually increased this year. There’s an increased risk of escalation which could include the Strait of Hormuz According to data from Jefferies, diversions have increased in the tanker and dry cargo segments. Dry bulk diversions are up to 56% of 2023 figures so far this year, up from 45% in 2024; crude tanker diversions have risen to 48% from 35% and product tankers are up to 52% from 45%. Containership traffic has continued to divert with transits in the region in 2025 down 90% relative to figures in 2023. This is steady with diversions seen in 2024, while LNG and LPG have continued to divert at the same pace as seen in 2024 with 80% and 74% of capacity, respectively, bypassing the region so far this year. Data from ABG Sundal Collier shows that overall Gulf of Aden arrivals are down 72% from the 2023 average, something that has badly affected the Egyptian economy with revenues at the Suez. Canal Authority plummeting. There is little sign authorities believe the Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to an end anytime soon. The European Union announced last month it is extending the mandate of its maritime security operation, EUNAVFOR Aspides, for an additional year, reinforcing efforts to safeguard freedom of navigation in the Red Sea region. The operation will now continue until February 28, 2026, with a budget of over €17m ($17.8m) allocated for its extended period. As and when the Red Sea does open up for merchant ship traffic will drive profits and losses for many shipping companies this year. Top management at Maersk laid out last month how the Houthis could dictate the line between black or red ink for the coming year. Maersk’s EBIT forecast for 2025 ranges from zero to $3bn, depending on whether the Red Sea opens in the middle of the year or the end of the year."

        "content": "In the second instalment of our brand new magazine, Maritime CEO canvasses the industry on all things tech. For Mikael Skov, who heads up Hafnia, the world’s largest product tanker owner, artificial intelligence emissions reduction and autonomous vessels are likely going to be the biggest tech breakthroughs in general in the industry due to their direct impact on both operational costs and environmental sustainability. “These advancements are not only technologically disruptive but also essential in addressing global challenges like climate change and maritime safety,” Skov tellsSplash. AI is not just optimising routes or scheduling but actively driving carbon footprint reductions, he says. The potential to cut annual emissions through AI-powered navigation optimisation is a “game-changer”, aligning with global sustainability goals. By integrating with carbon-neutral initiatives, shipping companies can meet stringent environmental regulations while lowering costs, he maintains. “One of the significant trends in 2025 and beyond will likely be the integration of AI into the day-to-day operations of vessels,” says Tim Ponath, CEO of German owner NSB Group, a company that like Hafnia is carrying out various pilot projects in this area. “Most tech decisions and investments will focus on AI’s potential, including vessel hardware,” says Arthur English, CEO of Norwegian shipowner G2 Ocean. It’s not just owners interviewed for this magazine who see AI’s growing importance. AI is seen bySplashreaders as the technology having the most significant impact on maritime operations in the coming 10 years in an ongoing survey being carried out in association with Inmarsat. AI beat out other tech making plenty of shipping headlines such as blockchain, Big Data analytics and Internet of Things in the survey that seeks to identify how ships will operate 10 years from now. The maritime industry must first address underlying challenges such as data standardisation, cybersecurity risks, and the need for skilled personnel “While AI presents huge opportunities, the maritime industry must first address underlying challenges such as data standardisation, cybersecurity risks, and the need for skilled personnel to manage AI-driven systems,” urges Niall Jack, director of product development at software provider Shipnet. The industry must fully embrace digital transformation – not just AI solutions – by investing in high-quality data infrastructure and cultural shifts toward digitisation, Jack argues. “Overpromising AI’s capabilities without resolving these foundational challenges may lead to suboptimal implementations and rejection of further new developments because of this,” Jack says. Beyond all the AI hype, Christian Råe Holm, the CEO of software provider Coach Solutions, cautions: “There is still a lot of talk around AI and machine learning, but apart from optimising manual internal processes, I do not see it replacing expert human advisory yet. Rather, I see the need for human expert support as even more important with the advent of AI, as it takes deep knowledge to see through the sometimes doubtful results coming out of the black box.” Overpromising AI’s capabilities without resolving foundational challenges may lead to suboptimal implementations Proactive maintenance “In 2025, technological advancements will continue to shape the industry, with AI maintaining its prominence as market-ready solutions for predictive maintenance,” says Vikrant Gusain, CEO of Dockendale Ship Management, who points out that proactive maintenance technologies, such as drones, reduce the need for enclosed space entries, improving safety standards. Additionally, Gusain reckons sensor-based monitoring of emissions will gain traction, driven by the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS), as the industry intensifies efforts to ensure regulatory compliance. Blockchain adoption is something else Hafnia’s Skov reckons will accelerate this year, offering the promise of a tamper-proof, transparent, and decentralised system that can revolutionise how shipping contracts, payments, and cargo tracking are handled. If widely adopted, blockchain could eliminate inefficiencies, reduce fraud, and foster greater trust across the global supply chain. Internet of Things (IoT) is also evolving from basic tracking to real-time, end-to-end visibility of the supply chain, improving reliability and customer experience. With all the increased availability and flow of data brought about by the likes of Starlink over the past year, cyber security measures will call for much more attention in the year to come, says Morten Lind-Olsen, the CEO of Norwegian software firm Dualog, who also warns about the “huge gap” between management expectations to what can be done and what is in place on the IT integration side. “We believe that digitalisation remains a dominant trend in the maritime industry while areas relevant to cybersecurity are important to ensure operations are conducted under a safe environment,” says Niraj Nanda, chief commercial officer at shipmanager Anglo-Eastern. “New technologies will continue to evolve alongside increased connectivity to allow safer and more efficient operations.” Green tech Haakon Lenz, the new CEO at Wilhelmsen Ship Management, has been following the development of ammonia engines with great interest. A first ammonia dual-fuel engine may be delivered this year, something Lenz is eagerly looking out for. “If safety risks are addressed, this technology has the potential to revolutionise the maritime industry’s journey toward decarbonisation,” Lenz maintains. Mark Cameron, chief operating officer at Ardmore Shipping, thinks wind will start to put forward some better-qualified validation figures this year. Installations are now starting to provide some qualified data to help interpret specific routes, times of the year and vessel types. Cameron describes himself as a “net believer” in wind assist but reckons there are still too many variables. “Data will help to qualify reality versus beliefs,” Cameron says, suggesting the different types of wind assist technology will begin to delineate into different markets and price points as experience matures. Hull coatings are also back in vogue, Cameron reckons, while Andrew Airery, head of Thai manager Highland Maritime, believes we will see continued advances in carbon capture solutions for existing vessels as retrofitting carbon capture systems will, he says, become mandatory in the near future for most existing and new vessels still using fossil fuels. “The quicker government and private sector drive the incentive and investment in the necessary shore-based recycling plants the quicker we can all cut emissions by 80%, almost overnight,” Airey says. Crewing Proactive thinking appears to finally be taking momentum in the crewing industry, reckons Claire Georgeson, founder and CEO of analytics firm PsyFyi. “The value of software is being incorporated into strategies and with that we are seeing bold solutions being adopted without having obvious and immediate ROIs,” Georgeson says. Training applications, VR, crew-centric data solutions, AI and other software are being introduced as proactive measures to save money before it’s spent, she relays. Shipping spends a much smaller portion of its operating costs on training Pradeep Chawla, the CEO of online training specialist MarinePALS, is sure there will be a higher demand for e-learning and self-learning, driven by the challenges of training the estimated 800,000 people for the use of alternative fuels. “In comparison to other high hazard industries, unfortunately, the shipping industry spends a much smaller portion of its operating costs on training,” Chawla says, arguing that the regulatory framework will need to consider stricter training requirements in the upcoming STCW revisions.

        "content": "Containership utilisation has slipped below 90% on many of the sector’s biggest tradelanes, while the gap between box freight rates and charter rates has hit an all-time high. Data from Linerlytica shows boxship utilisation on three of the four main tradelanes has fallen below 90%.Splashestimates suggest that at today’s freight rates, liners can remain profitable with utilisation at 80%. However, rates have been falling all year long, with a huge volume of newbuilds entering service. “The unabated demand for ships is keeping the charter market high despite the freight market slump,” Linerlytica noted in its latest weekly report, noting how the charter to freight rate ratio has reached a record high of 289%. “If cargo demand fails to rebound to drive a freight rate rally, a charter market correction could be due soon,” Linerlytica warned. “If carriers fail to stabilise freight rates, we could see an increase in surplus tonnage being released into the market,” broker Braemar suggested in a container briefing published yesterday. Liner shipping profits are forecast to slide by more than 80% this year. Analysts at Sea-Intelligence have calculated that the container shipping industry made a combined EBIT last year of $60bn, the third-highest figure recorded in the history of the business, and the highest outside the covid era. One leading container markets analyst, John McCown, who runs New York-based Blue Alpha Capital, is expecting the liner sector to remain in the black this year, albeit with profits sliding to below $10bn. Container spot rates have been on a constant slide in 2025. The overall Shanghai Containerized Freight Index is now down 47% since the start of the year. Prices on Asia to North Europe, Asia to the Mediterranean, and on the transpacific to the US west and east coasts are now all lower than at any point in time in 2024, according to data from Drewry. However, comparing spot rates now to the level seen in mid-December 2023 just before the Red Sea shipping crisis, Asia to North Europe remains up 74%, Asia to the Mediterranean remains up 96%, while voyages across the Pacific to both the west and east coasts are still up by more than 40% compared to the lows experienced towards the end of 2023. “Continued softening in the spot market comes against a backdrop of weaker than usual volumes post-Lunar New Year, increased competition between liner companies amid alliance restructuring, and widespread uncertainty brought about by an ongoing series of tariff announcements from the US and its trading partners,” commented Clarksons Research in a weekly report."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "IT safety is evolving from a box-ticking exercise to an essential business tool, required by regulators and stakeholders, writes Nicolas Furge, president, Marlink Cyber. Cyber risk is a growing concern across the shipping industry, from vessel operators and charterers to ports and the broader supply chain. While the number of technology solutions are proliferating, the burgeoning weight of regulation will ask new questions about the process of compliance. These rules will increasingly move beyond deploying software, to a regular, detailed inspection process that requires collaboration between shipyards, owners, classification, OEMs, IT and network operators. Perhaps just as important for shipowners is the potential costs involved to achieve and maintain compliance – costs that will be recurring rather than one-time expenses. Regulators including the IMO and European Union, the US Coast Guard and other Flag States have previously introduced guidance or are planning to update regulation in response to growing cyber threats. Industry standards published by BIMCO, SIRE and TMSA are now being supplemented with regulations developed by the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS). IACS Unified Requirement E26 aims to provide a minimum set of requirements for cyber resilience of ships, intended for the design, construction, commissioning and operational life of the vessel. Its related requirement, UR E27 provides the minimum security capabilities for systems and equipment to be considered cyber resilient and is intended for third party equipment suppliers. UR E26 is based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which comprises five key areas of governance: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. Despite UR E26 being required only for newbuildings, Marlink believes that shipowners will increasingly seek to apply its principles and standards to existing ships, providing risk mitigation for highly valuable assets and cargoes. Conversations with shipowners indicate that they will progressively apply the regulation to their fleets, using UR26 as the baseline for cyber security on floating assets. The IACS URs will be applied by all member class societies who will act as auditor, with only minor differences in how each applies their methodology and definitions within the documentation. As a starting point for compliance with the incoming IACS UR26 regulations, Marlink has assembled five key aspects that owners should already have considered on how to proceed. Documentation UR 26 requires a much higher level of documentation than previously, including an detailed plan of onboard network setup, configuration and data flows. Inspectors will expect documentation on network protection measures including a test plan to verify the implemented controls. Inventory of onboard assets Owners will need to assemble and maintain an inventory of onboard assets and produce it on demand. The inventory includes the applicable hardware and software of computer-based systems (CBSs) and of the networks connecting such systems to each other and to other CBSs onboard or ashore. Procedures The regulation calls for creation of new procedures to defend against cyber attacks and increase risk mitigation. For example, owners need to understand how to create procedures and define roles and responsibilities for topics such as remote monitoring, control and maintenance on ships’ equipment. Developing these procedures is a process that needs to happen with a close relationship to training programmes and awareness raising. Training and Awareness Shipowners are very likely to require cyber security training for crews and follow this up with regular awareness training for all personal including crew, contractors and maintenance third parties. Training topics include how to identify risks, procedures for the recovery of a failed system, how to get external assistance and support from ashore and how to test and monitor onboard networks. From Reactive to Proactive Common cyber solutions can provide a line of reactive protection against attacks but they tell you little to nothing about vulnerability at a higher level. In future, cyber security will require not just asset and network protection but vulnerability assessments, penetration testing and other proactive tools that can provide insights into likely and probable threats – and how these change over time. Conclusion UR26 is a significant change for the maritime industry, not just as the first requirement to apply equally all newbuilding vessels. The extra administrative burden it creates will be considerable but even so, it is likely that similar standards will be extended to the existing fleet before long. However, UR26 only represents an agreed baseline for performance. Future regulations are likely to be much more demanding and Marlink believes that shipowners must take additional measures to protect themselves from cyber threats. The demands of charterers, insurers, class and other stakeholders will likely increase over time. Costs will come in administration of record-keeping necessary for compliance, monthly service costs and potentially hundreds of hours of consultancy work to create procedures and set-ups. It is likely that budgets spent by shipowners on IT will need to increase to take advantage of the possibilities offered by digital technology and to increase cyber defence. To achieve an improved level of compliance, the industry needs a new, high-level perspective on the steps required to remain safe at sea that goes beyond baseline defence. Our experience with the largest single share of the maritime merchant fleet tells us that compliance with UR E26 and other regulations is not enough by itself. Owners need to consider what further improvement needs to be made to ensure their fleets can continue to operate safely."

In recent years, we’ve seen digitalisation and decarbonisation shift from ideas to industry imperatives,” commented Shaun Hon, founder and general partner of Motion Ventures, who said this second fund goes beyond writing bigger cheques. “It’s about uniting the right founders, corporate leaders, and strategic allies to accelerate an industry-wide shift, ensuring that solutions can be tested, adopted, and scaled faster than ever before,” Hon said. Over the next 18 to 24 months, Fund II aims to deploy cheques of $250,000 to $10m into at least 25 companies, targeting solutions that digitise and decarbonise the global maritime supply chain. By design, the new fund can now back startups developing more asset-intensive hardware solutions, recognising that maritime innovation demands solutions beyond software alone—an evolution spurred by growing corporate demand for deeper, faster progress in sustainability, vessel operations, and port modernisation. The maritime digitisation market is projected to reach $423.4bn by 2031 According to Motion Ventures, the maritime digitisation market alone is projected to reach $423.4bn by 2031. “Fund II will harness that momentum, uniting startups and industry leaders to deliver cleaner, more efficient operations and, ultimately, shape the future of maritime commerce,” the company claimed in a release."

        "content": "Failure to scale up suitable quantities of well-priced green fuels has blunted a projected rush to retrofit ships with cleaner engines, a delay that will potentially bring a bottleneck at repair yards further down the line, according to a new study from Lloyd’s Register (LR). The British classification society has updated its engine retrofit market study, originally published in 2023. The original engine retrofit report published by LR identified a market of around 13,500 existing vessels that may need engine conversions to use alternative fuels. A key assumption of the original report’s modelling was that all vessels built beyond 2027-2030 would be capable of using zero- and near- zero emissions fuels. We need greater regulatory clarity and investment to bridge the gap between ambition and action “Without further effective drivers to take up these fuels or visibility on alternative fuel availability, that date could be pushed back – meaning that more vessels need to be retrofitted in a shorter timeframe [to meet the International Maritime Organisations green targets], exacerbating strains on retrofitting capacity,” LR warned in the new study. The early 2020s were dominated by conversions to LNG and a concentrated retrofit campaign in the LPG carrier segment following the introduction of new engine technology. In 2022, hydrogen retrofits began on small passenger, offshore and harbour vessels. Following the first projects in 2024, methanol conversions are set to become more prevalent over the next four years, driven primarily by confirmed orders from the container segment. While some ammonia conversions have already taken place – on two offshore vessels and one tugboat – these are pilot installations of fuel cell and small engine technology that is not transferable to the wider fleet of large merchant vessels. Further ammonia retrofits are likely once large engine technology has been introduced, LR suggested. LR now reckons there are 27 yards around the world, predominantly in China, identified as capable of carrying out engine retrofits. Combined these 27 yards could handle up to 465 vessels a year, enough to satisfy early demand, but still falling well below the required capacity in years of peak demand, when LR is predicting more than 1,000 conversions a year could be anticipated. “Engine builders will need to balance the demand for newbuild engines with the growing demand for engine retrofit packages, with a similar constraint on providers of engine subsystems such as injectors and fuel systems including supply and storage equipment,” LR stated, in listing further bottlenecks shipowners might face when opting for an engine swap. According to engine manufacturer MAN, lead times for retrofit project construction currently stand at over 18 months. MAN is aiming to reduce this to under 14 months. Claudene Sharp-Patel, LR’s global technical director, commented: “The technology and shipyard capacity to retrofit vessels is improving, but without decisive action to scale up alternative fuel supply chains, shipowners will face increasing compliance costs and operational uncertainty. We need greater regulatory clarity and investment to bridge the gap between ambition and action.”"

        "content": "The Monday deadline is fast approaching for public comments on the US Trade Representative’s investigation into China’s dominance in shipbuilding after which president Donald Trump will make a ruling. Submissions to the Washington body have been numerous, some full of praise, and plenty of others warning of the potential costly unintended consequences of any rules that penalise Chinese-built tonnage calling at American ports. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements. Most operators in the world have in their fleet one or more ships of Chinese origin meaning that when calling at a US port, they would be subject to a port fee. Louis Sola, Trump’s pick for chair of the nation’s shipping regulator, the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) voiced his support of the USTR’s measures, telling theFinancial Timesearlier this week: “We need to offset the subsidies that China has given their shipbuilding industry, fight fire with fire.” While Chinese-built ships account for just 23% of the merchant fleet, the orderbook is dominated by Chinese shipbuilders, with 53% of all newbuildings. “New orders have slowed, and it is likely, especially in container shipping, that operators will pause charter-in renewals on Chinese ships. An outright rush to sell Chinese-built ships has not happened, though this depends on how the proposal moves forward,” investment bank Jefferies suggested in a shipping update. Chinese-built ships account for nearly 50% of the global dry bulk fleet, 40% of containerships, 30% of tankers, 15% of LPG, and 10% of LNG. In terms of imports and exports, US port calls in 2024 accounted for 45% of global LPG volumes, 20% of LNG, 18% of tankers, 15% of containers, and 7.5% of dry bulk. Container freight rates from Asia to the US west coast could rise by around $150 per teu and VLCC spot rates could rise by $ 0.50 per barrel on shipments from the US Gulf to Asia, according to calculations from Jefferies. A submission to the USTR from BIMCO, the largest direct entry membership organisation in the shipping industry, noted that a fee of $1,000 per net tonnage on a 300,000 dwt VLCC is more than $100m per port call. “The proposed actions will impose much-increased transport costs on US imports and exports and have negative effects on the wider US economy; their impact on Chinese dominance is much less certain,” stated Lars Pedersen, BIMCO’s deputy secretary-general. Andrew Abbott, the CEO of New Jersey-headquartered Atlantic Container Line, warned in his submission to the trade body that if the proposed action is implemented as is, ACL, owned by the Grimaldi Group, would be forced to terminate its US service, close its American offices, lay off its American staff and redeploy its ships to non-US trades. “US export container rates to Europe for a carrier with a Chinese-built fleet – now averaging $500 per feu – would climb to around $2,500 per feu overnight – a 500% increase – simply to cover the new service fee,” Abbott warned, while US import rates from Europe would need to jump 80% to cover the new service fee. “As the chaotic period of redeployment of non-Chinese-built ships to US trades and Chinese-built ships to non-US trades takes place, and as carriers like ACL leave the trade entirely, both the supply and demand balance and operating costs of most carriers would be completely upended. This would cause a freight rate explosion that would dwarf the Covid-era rate increases and devastate the supply chains of American companies,” Abbott wrote, arguing that none of this “turmoil” inflicted on American exporters and importers would help the American shipbuilding industry. “It would only re-shuffle the cards, with Korea, Japan and Taiwan grabbing the new vessel orders instead of China,” Abbott wrote. Captain Scott Bravener, the CEO of McKeil Marine, an American-owned Canadian ship operator, in his submission, warned the US and other nations currently lack the requisite shipbuilding infrastructure to replace all Chinese-built vessels serving the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region. Cary Davis, president and CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities, urged the USTR to reconsider its approach to countering Chinese dominance in the global shipbuilding industry by narrowing the scope of the proposed fees or reversing course until a more comprehensive strategy can be developed. “As formulated, USTR’s proposal would raise prices for consumers and businesses, lead to chaos across the nation’s port and transportation industries, and would not reduce the international shipping industry’s reliance on Chinese shipyards,” Davis argued. The proposed fees would incentivise ocean carriers to consolidate traffic to the nation’s largest ports, while cutting out small and medium-sized ports from their routes, Davis suggested, something that would cause significant congestion at large ports and the collapse of business lines at small and medium-sized ports. “The results would be higher inflation, more unemployment, and higher trade deficits,” Davis predicted. AAPA contributed to a study conducted by Trade Partnership Worldwide to analyse the impacts of the proposed fees on the American port and logistics industry, as well as the broader economy. The preliminary results of this study suggest that if USTR’s proposed actions are implemented fully, US goods exports could decline by 11.97%. Agricultural exports will be especially hard hit, causing farm household income to fall by 15.76%, as their access to markets abroad closes. Prices for export of agricultural products will soar. The export of petroleum and coal products would also decline by 8.11%. The Andersons, an Ohio-based grains giant, also predicted the singling out of Chinese tonnage would ultimately have “substantial economic impacts” on American farmers. “The impact that the restriction will have on grain vessels is substantial, increasing the cost per bushel by between $0.50 and $1.25 depending on the port of call, a 10% – 30% price increase on already price-sensitive commodity,” the submission from the agribusiness firm stated. By assessing multimillion-dollar fees on each port call, Davis from the American ports body said cargo will be diverted to Mexican and Canadian ports to be shipped by truck and rail into the US, something that also worried Dan McKisson, president of the Washington state branch of trade union, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), who agreed that if there are no equivalent fees for cargo entering through Mexico or Canada, cargo diversion to these countries will increase significantly to bypass the proposed fees. “It is recommended to address the land border loophole and harmonize the US port fees across all ports of call. This would ensure that steamship lines do not favour larger load centres over smaller regional ports,” McKisson suggested. The first signs of a two-tier market are emerging in anticipation of Trump’s likely penalisation of Chinese-built tonnage. Broker BRS reported last week Chinese-linked ships are now becoming “far less attractive” for long-time charters due to the likelihood that, at some point during their charters, these ships would be required to call at US ports. Law firm Hill Dickinson is also seeing revisions to charter-party wording, both bespoke terms and amendments to standard charter-party forms for voyage and period fixtures in relation to a likely impending clampdown on Chinese-built tonnage by the US. Clarksons Research has calculated nearly 37,000 US port calls last year by ships that would likely face the maximum $1.5m fee due to their connection to China, equivalent to 83% of containership calls but only around 30% of stops by tankers. As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. The US, by contrast, has a market share of less than 1%. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans last week in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

        "content": "Lomarlabs, the innovation arm of Lomar Shipping, has announced a strategic collaboration with Newlight, a technology company specialising in hybrid hydrogen-diesel engine retrofits, to accelerate the adoption of cost-effective, lower-emission solutions for the shipping industry. The collaboration will focus on retrofitting conventional diesel engines to operate on a hydrogen-diesel mix, reducing fuel consumption by 20% on average and significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Savings of up to 30% have already been demonstrated in workshop trials and this new collaboration will seek to replicate this onboard vessels. Stylianos Papageorgiou, managing director of Lomarlabs, commented: “We believe in accelerating progress through energy efficiency improvements, emissions treatment and leveraging clean energy sources, always with a focus on maintaining costs at sensible levels. Newlight’s solution fits right into this approach. Decarbonisation isn’t about waiting for the perfect fuel; it’s about acting now with every viable tool at our disposal. Newlight’s dual-fuel retrofit technology promises an immediate, scalable and cost-effective way to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.” Through this collaboration, Lomarlabs and Newlight will conduct a pilot installation scheduled for summer 2025 on board a Lomar vessel to collect data and carry out harbour and sea trials. “Hydrogen has enormous potential as a maritime fuel, but transitioning entire fleets to pure hydrogen is a long-term challenge. We believe the industry cannot afford to wait. By taking immediate steps with the current fleet, we can decarbonise ship by ship—delivering real impact today,” said Haran Cohen Hillel, CEO of Newlight. “By retrofitting existing diesel engines to operate on a hydrogen blend, we provide an immediate, scalable solution that cuts emissions without requiring a complete overhaul of the propulsion systems.”"

        "content": "The Monday deadline is fast approaching for public comments on the US Trade Representative’s investigation into China’s dominance in shipbuilding after which president Donald Trump will make a ruling. Submissions to the Washington body have been numerous, some full of praise, and plenty of others warning of the potential costly unintended consequences of any rules that penalise Chinese-built tonnage calling at American ports. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements. Most operators in the world have in their fleet one or more ships of Chinese origin meaning that when calling at a US port, they would be subject to a port fee. Louis Sola, Trump’s pick for chair of the nation’s shipping regulator, the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) voiced his support of the USTR’s measures, telling theFinancial Timesearlier this week: “We need to offset the subsidies that China has given their shipbuilding industry, fight fire with fire.” While Chinese-built ships account for just 23% of the merchant fleet, the orderbook is dominated by Chinese shipbuilders, with 53% of all newbuildings. “New orders have slowed, and it is likely, especially in container shipping, that operators will pause charter-in renewals on Chinese ships. An outright rush to sell Chinese-built ships has not happened, though this depends on how the proposal moves forward,” investment bank Jefferies suggested in a shipping update. Chinese-built ships account for nearly 50% of the global dry bulk fleet, 40% of containerships, 30% of tankers, 15% of LPG, and 10% of LNG. In terms of imports and exports, US port calls in 2024 accounted for 45% of global LPG volumes, 20% of LNG, 18% of tankers, 15% of containers, and 7.5% of dry bulk.

        "content": "Seven mid-sized Asian carriers are launching a China-Mexico joint service, a tradelane that has boomed in the 2020s, but is now clouded with the return of Donald Trump to the White House. According to analysts at Alphaliner, Emirates Shipping Line (ESL), KMTC, Regional Container Lines (RCL), SeaLead, Sinokor, Sinotrans and TS Lines will launch the weekly service linking China and South Korea with Manzanillo on Mexico’s west coast at the end of next month, marking the first time these carriers have serviced the west coast of Latin America. Each partner is expected to contribute one vessel, with a first sailing due from Shanghai on 30 April. “This strategic move marks RCL’s entry into the growing Mexican market, positioning the company to serve an expanding customer base with reliable shipping solutions,” Thai carrier RCL stated in a release. Splashhas reported repeatedly on the remarkable growth in container calls from Asia to Mexico. In 2023, Mexico overtook China as America’s top trade partner. In recent years, direct investment from Chinese companies into Mexico has experienced significant growth. Chinese companies now represent the fastest-growing source of foreign investment in Mexico. However, with Donald Trump now back in charge of the US, tariffs are raining in on both Mexico and China."

        "content": "Gas ship owner and operator Seapeak has said it expects to sell three of its older LNG vessels that came off contracts and had been placed in layup earlier this year. The Stonepeak-controlled company said in its annual report it had made downward revisions to the outlook for its steam turbine LNG carriers due to oversupply and reduced charterer interest. Seapeak currently has seven such ships, with three in lay-up and four with contracts expiring between late 2026 and mid-2029. The values of these vessels were written down last December, and their projected use was cut from 35 years to 25 years, resulting in an impairment charge of about $387m, with Seapeak saying it had increased its “estimate of the likelihood that three of the vessels may be sold in 2025”. The three ships in this class that came off long-term charters in recent months are the 2002-built 137,814 cu mSeapeak Hispania, the 2003-built 135,423 cu mSeapeak Catalunyaand its sister unitSeapeak Madridbuilt in 2004. Seapeak controls about 50 LNG ships, including newbuildings, alongside a fleet of more than 40 LPG, ethane and multigas carriers. The company offloaded four multigas units for a total of $30m between February and August last year and added a 2021-built 174,000 cu m LNG carrier,Marvel Swan, for $213m. Four LNG ships recently completed their contracts, including the laid-up trio, with two more majority-owned units scheduled for redelivery in April and May. The company said that based on project delays and near-term oversupply, its results for 2025 may be negatively impacted to the extent that some of its ships may be uncontracted or rechartered out at rates lower than they earned on their prior fixtures. Most recently, BP Gas Marketing decided to terminate the hire of the Seapeak Glasgow effective December 2025, which could have potentially lasted up to December 2031."

A correspondence group will work over the coming year to identify existing and emerging technologies, standards and methodologies that can support maritime digitalisation, while ensuring alignment across IMO’s various committees with a report due next year, before a final submission is made to the assembly session scheduled for the end of 2027. IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez emphasised the transformative potential of cutting-edge technologies such as AI and autonomous navigation, while recognising related challenges, including cybersecurity risks and the global digital divide. Dominguez said the new strategy will help integrate vessels and ports, improve logistics and optimise routes, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

        "content": "DP World has signed a long-term strategic agreement with Maersk to expand maritime services at DP World’s terminal in the Port of Santos, Brazil. DP World operates one of the country’s largest private terminals at the Port of Santos. Under the terms of the eight-year agreement, Maersk will introduce additional long-term services and maintain a minimum service level. In the first year, Maersk will launch six new services with eight weekly calls, increasing to seven services and 10 weekly calls in 2026 following DP World’s capacity expansion. Currently, the terminal handles 1.4m teu annually. To accommodate growing demand, DP World is investing R$450m to expand its container-handling capacity to 1.7m teu by the end of 2026. The company also plans to invest an additional R$1.6bn to further increase capacity to 2.1m teu by the end of 2027. Paulo Ruy, regional head of terminal and port procurement for Latin America at Maersk, said: “This agreement with DP World secures service capacity for Maersk at the Port of Santos. It aligns with our strategy to ensure reliable and efficient operations for our customers in the region. By having this commercial agreement with DP World, we are able to meet the growing demand for container handling and enhance our service offerings, ensuring that we continue to provide end to end logistics solutions, in addition to our stand-alone products.”"

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Failure to scale up suitable quantities of well-priced green fuels has blunted a projected rush to retrofit ships with cleaner engines, a delay that will potentially bring a bottleneck at repair yards further down the line, according to a new study from Lloyd’s Register (LR). The British classification society has updated its engine retrofit market study, originally published in 2023. The original engine retrofit report published by LR identified a market of around 13,500 existing vessels that may need engine conversions to use alternative fuels. A key assumption of the original report’s modelling was that all vessels built beyond 2027-2030 would be capable of using zero- and near- zero emissions fuels. We need greater regulatory clarity and investment to bridge the gap between ambition and action “Without further effective drivers to take up these fuels or visibility on alternative fuel availability, that date could be pushed back – meaning that more vessels need to be retrofitted in a shorter timeframe [to meet the International Maritime Organisations green targets], exacerbating strains on retrofitting capacity,” LR warned in the new study. The early 2020s were dominated by conversions to LNG and a concentrated retrofit campaign in the LPG carrier segment following the introduction of new engine technology. In 2022, hydrogen retrofits began on small passenger, offshore and harbour vessels. Following the first projects in 2024, methanol conversions are set to become more prevalent over the next four years, driven primarily by confirmed orders from the container segment. While some ammonia conversions have already taken place – on two offshore vessels and one tugboat – these are pilot installations of fuel cell and small engine technology that is not transferable to the wider fleet of large merchant vessels. Further ammonia retrofits are likely once large engine technology has been introduced, LR suggested. LR now reckons there are 27 yards around the world, predominantly in China, identified as capable of carrying out engine retrofits. Combined these 27 yards could handle up to 465 vessels a year, enough to satisfy early demand, but still falling well below the required capacity in years of peak demand, when LR is predicting more than 1,000 conversions a year could be anticipated. “Engine builders will need to balance the demand for newbuild engines with the growing demand for engine retrofit packages, with a similar constraint on providers of engine subsystems such as injectors and fuel systems including supply and storage equipment,” LR stated, in listing further bottlenecks shipowners might face when opting for an engine swap. According to engine manufacturer MAN, lead times for retrofit project construction currently stand at over 18 months. MAN is aiming to reduce this to under 14 months. Claudene Sharp-Patel, LR’s global technical director, commented: “The technology and shipyard capacity to retrofit vessels is improving, but without decisive action to scale up alternative fuel supply chains, shipowners will face increasing compliance costs and operational uncertainty. We need greater regulatory clarity and investment to bridge the gap between ambition and action.”"

A filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that Fredriksen-affiliated companies own 11.8m shares in the Nasdaq-listed Star Bulk, corresponding to a 10.7% ownership stake. Earlier in March, Fredriksen sold his interests in the owner of more than 90 bulkers, Golden Ocean, to CMB.TECH, the shipowning vehicle controlled by the Saverys family, for close to $1.2bn, suggesting a retreat from the sector. The move on Star Bulk shares valued at close to $197m in today’s market has been divulged as a passive investment in the form of a 13G filing. Star Bulk is the largest US-listed dry bulk owner, controlling a fleet of over 150 bulkers from newcastlemax to supramax classes. The Petros Pappas-led company logged a fourth-quarter 2024 net profit of $42.4m, or $0.36 per share, and directed some of its cash towards a dividend of $0.09 per share payable on or about March 18 to all shareholders of record as of March 4, while the remaining portion has been used to repurchase shares."

        "content": "Plastic pellets have washed up on shore followinglast week’s collisionbetween theStena Immaculatetanker and the containershipSolongin the North Sea, raising concern among conservationist groups. The UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said on Monday it was advised by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) of a sheen in the sea just off The Wash, which has been identified as “nurdles” – small pellets of plastic resin used in plastics production. The nurdles, sized between 1-5 mm and weighing less than a gram, are likely to have entered the water at the point of collision, the coastguard said, adding that they are not toxic but can present a risk to wildlife if ingested. Coastguard rescue teams and other counter-pollution specialists are conducting a retrieval operation along the shore between Old Hunstanton and Wells-next-the-Sea. “This is a developing situation and the transport secretary continues to be updated regularly,” said Chief coastguard Paddy O’Callaghan. Multiple wildlife and environmental organisations warned the nurdles can have a devastating effect on animals, including seals, puffins and fish. “We’re very concerned about the nurdles and burnt material that is adrift at sea as well as being washed up along the Wash and the Norfolk coast following the tanker collision last week, and we will continue to support the authorities in their efforts to clean up the pollution,” said Tammy Smalley, Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust’s head of conservation. “At this time of the year, there is also the risk that the birds return to their nests and feed the nurdles to their chicks. The plastic may also work its way up the food chain to larger marine mammals which feed on fish or smaller animals which have eaten nurdles,” she added. Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana UK, said the pellets can be trapped in the stomachs of wildlife and stop them eating real food, leading to starvation, warning that it’s nearly impossible to remove them from the ocean once they have entered it, and that they can become more and more toxic as they break down into smaller and smaller pieces.” Sophie Benbow, the director of marine at the conservation organisation Fauna & Flora, noted that plastic pellets were “one of the largest sources of microplastic pollution globally and pose a grave threat to nature and coastal communities”. “It is extremely concerning that the North Sea ship collision has resulted in a mass plastic pellets spill. Once lost into the ocean, these tiny pieces of plastic are almost impossible to contain,” she said. Meanwhile, the ships involved in the incident remain stable, and salvage operations are ongoing. Damage assessment of theStena Immaculateconfirmed that one tank containing jet fuel and one ballast tank containing seawater were affected by the impact, with about 17,500 out of 200,000 barrels onboard lost. The MCA said on Monday that there were “only small periodic pockets of fire” on theSolongwhich were “not causing undue concern”. Plastic pellets (nurdles) have begun to wash ashore on Brancaster Beach and elsewhere along the Norfolk coast, following the North Sea tanker collision last week.

        "content": "Just over 53% of respondents in our ongoing future tech survey believe traditional bunker fuel will still be used for the majority of the global merchant fleet in 10 years’ time. The bunkering question is one of 14 topics posed in a survey launched bySplashin partnership with Inmarsat seeking reader input on how ship operations will change in the coming decade with results due to be published inShip Concept 2035, a magazine due for distribution at Nor-Shipping this June. Data from Clarksons Research shows that less than 8% of the global merchant fleet in gt terms today is alternative fuel capable, although more than half of all ships on order will be able to use alternative fuels. Uncertainty about the scale and nature of the International Maritime Organization’s proposed carbon levy is holding back green investment, Christopher Wiernicki, chairman and CEO of ABS, a class society, said during an appearance at the CERAWeek energy conference earlier this month. “A carbon levy is a wild card. It will all depend on how it is implemented and enforced. There’s a huge question mark over whether this will deliver for the industry and there is much still to be decided,” said Wiernicki. “Will the levy be set at $18, $100 or even $150 per ton? Today, we just don’t know but this clearly has a significant bearing on a host of factors: operational, investment and asset viability. With the lack of a clear global carbon pricing mechanism, it is no wonder owners are cautious and concerned given the high degree of uncertainty this introduces into the market,” said Wiernicki. Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonisation director at rival class society DNV, commented: “The success of the maritime fuel transition depends on the parallel development of key components like bunkering infrastructure and fuel supply. This can also be enhanced by the implementation of energy efficiency measures, which can both deliver short-term emissions reductions and support the long-term adoption of low- and zero-carbon fuels.” Claudene Sharp-Patel, global technical director at Lloyd’s Register, commented: “Without decisive action to scale up alternative fuel supply chains, shipowners will face increasing compliance costs and operational uncertainty. We need greater regulatory clarity and investment to bridge the gap between ambition and action.” Sharp-Patel’s colleague at LR, Nick Brown, the company’s CEO, toldSplash: “The next decade will determine the shape of the industry’s long-term sustainability, demanding not just technological advancements but also greater investment in seafarers and human capital, which remain fundamental to creating the long-term change we need.” The energy transition for international shipping will cost the equivalent of one NEOM per month for the next 20 years, according to statistics from Dr Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at the UCL Energy Institute. NEOM is a 26,500 km megacity the Saudis are embarking building in the far northwest of the kingdom on the Red Sea, one of the biggest engineering works ever conceived anywhere in the world. Ship Concept 2035will give readers a glimpse of what is realistic for newbuilds coming out of yards 10 years from now. Taking into account regulations, fuels, information technology, seafaring skills, shipyards and charterers this unique magazine gives a big picture beyond the hype of what is practical for vessels delivering by the middle of the next decade.

        "content": "Risk management is key to survival once the lunatics have taken over the market, writes Pierre Aury. Two ships for one cargo and freight is going through the floor. Two cargoes for one ship and freight is going through the roof. Spot shipping is simply supply and demand, stupid. The next implied step in the quest for the holy grail of predicting accurately the market in order to make a fortune, is to use all these fancy new AI-powered and/or big data toys. A case of crunch data, baby, crunch data! The theory is as well that the market is “naturally” balanced and moves away from its position only when disrupted. Once the disruption is gone it tends to go back to is “natural” equilibrium. Ever thought about the market being naturally unstable? Probably not, but not because it is not naturally unstable, but because if it was it would make it a lot harder to predict.And especially so because our brains and the tools at our disposal are for the vast majority hard-wired on the linear side of things. The problem with all the above is that shipping is not something that one can observe in an adiabatic vessel. Shipping is a derivative of world trade and world trade is a derivative of what politicians decide around the world. Crudely put the demand side of spot shipping is directly driven by the whims of the likes of Donald, Vladimir, Emmanuel, Keir, Benjamin, and Kim. It’s not easy to make a predictive linear model based on the observation of data, whatever they could be, which could have some, even modest, chances of being accurate then. Let us take the new US president as an example of why trying to be rational is irrational. Who could have thought that just days after moving into the office Donald would threaten to annex Canada, grab Greenland, invade Panama again and ask Ukraine to give its strategic mineral resources to Uncle Sam as a payback for the $110bn or so it has spent so far helping Ukraine since the invasion in February 2022? A clear case of being paid twice for the same thing? Indeed, the alleged $110bn has been used by Ukraine mainly to buy US-made military equipment and ammunition. Who would have thought that Donald would start a bromance with Vladimir so quickly, wrong-footing in the process all the other members of NATO who are all now looking like fish out of water? It will be interesting to see how European countries are going to justify mass arrests of tankers belonging to the so-called shadow fleet while at the same time, Donald is saying that Russian oligarchs will be welcome in the US under the new gold card immigration system soon to be implemented for wealthy foreigners. Now one thing was highly predictable – new tariffs. But who predicted that Canada and Mexico would be lumped together with China? The cherry on the cake is that there are now talks of imposing up to $1.5m fee per call in the US for Chinese-built ships. Trying to be rational predicting irrational decisions of other people is already irrational, but the prediction is only the beginning, not the end. What really matters is being able to gauge the multiple consequences of each and every prediction: bullish, bearish, or neutral? Maybe haruspicy (reading in entrails of dead animals) should be used again? But remember more than ever risk management is key to survival once the lunatics have taken over the market."

Its share in global trading is estimated at 35% for oil, 60% for metals, 50% for cereals, and 40% for sugar, ensuring shipowners have to visit the landlocked country regularly for business. Bahri Dry Bulk, Blue Astra Maritime, BPG Shipping Company, Cetus Maritime, Chinaland Shipping, CMA CGM, Cobelfret, CTM, d’Amico Dry, Devbulk, Diana Shipping, Drydel Shipping, DryLog, Eastern Mediterranean Maritime, Eastern Pacific Shipping, Eastmen Shipping, EBE, Enesel, Fednav, G2 Ocean, Grain Compass Shipping, Great Eastern Shipping, Hadley Shipping, Harren Group, Himalaya Shipping, H. Vogemann, IHB Shipping, Iskele Shipping, JJ Ugland, KC Maritime, KGJS/BTG, Klaveness, Lykiardopulo & Co, Mandarin Shipping, Marfin Management, Norden, Nova Marine Carriers, Oceanbulk Maritime, Orion Reederei, Paralos Shipping, Precious Shipping, Range Shipping, Safe Bulkers, S-Bulkers, Seanergy Maritime, Soki Kisen, Star Bulk, SwissMarine, Taylor Maritime Investments, TCC Group, Tsakos Shipping, United Maritime Corporation, Valiant Shipping, Wah Kwong Maritime Transport Holdings, Western Bulk, and 2020 Bulkers are the other confirmed shipowners due to be at the summit, with many more well known names also about to sign up as delegates. Designed to engage every rung of the dry bulk supply chain, the 2025 edition of Geneva Dry is delivering on its promise with some of the best known charterers from around the world due to take the stage as panellists next month. Senior executives from major charterers due to speak at the event work for the likes of Anglo American, Cargill, COFCO, Eramet, Heidelberg, Montfort, South32, Trafigura, and Vale, companies responsible for the shipping of hundreds of millions of tons of cargo every year. Geneva Dry brings together all elements of the commodities shipping sector to host the ultimate dry bulk shipping event. Split into sectors, panels will bring together analysts, financiers, miners, traders and shipowners to discuss where the markets are headed. Sessions include: The full Geneva Dry agenda can beaccessed here.Geneva Dry registration, at just $780, can beaccessed here.Special Geneva Dry hotel room rates can befound here."

With the maritime industries consuming an estimated 100m tonnes of steel annually, premature corrosion and subsequent steel renewal work is increasing carbon emissions dramatically, said Steelpaint’s managing director Klaus Müller. “Addressing this issue through effective steel protection is an economical and environmental imperative. Every premature steel asset failure triggers a replacement cycle that indirectly undermines the industry’s decarbonization efforts,” Müller said. Steel production remains one of the most carbon-intensive industrial processes. To produce a single 10 m by 10 m, 20 mm thick steel plate, for instance, emits about three tons of CO2. Factor in transportation costs and the need for additional coatings, and the carbon footprint looms large. This is underscored by joint research study carried out by Curtin University and Ohio State University, which estimated that 25% of global steel production is lost to corrosion, with replacement and renewal accounting for 4 to 9% of total emissions globally. Global demand for steel in 2024 was 1.8bn tonnes and is forecast to grow by 2.9% by 2030. The shipbuilding industry alone consumes 32.2m tonnes per year, of which China, South Korea, and Japan use 88.3%."

The Marseille-based carrier’s move follows the ruling by the business court of Walloon Brabant earlier this month to revoke Air One Belgium’s takeover of Air Belgium. Air One Belgium, a consortium comprising PESO Aviation Management and Air One Holding International, has appealed this decision, with the hearing scheduled for April 3. CMA CGM’s proposal, which will be examined by the court later this month, covers the acquisition of the company’s cargo operations, retaining the Air Belgium brand along with its four aircraft. The Rodolphe Saadé-led group launched its air cargo business in March 2021. It currently operates four freighters, with two more to join the fleet this year. From 2026, CMA CGM Air Cargo will bolster its capacity with eight new generation A350 freighters."

        "content": "Just over 53% of respondents in our ongoing future tech survey believe traditional bunker fuel will still be used for the majority of the global merchant fleet in 10 years’ time. The bunkering question is one of 14 topics posed in a survey launched bySplashin partnership with Inmarsat seeking reader input on how ship operations will change in the coming decade with results due to be published inShip Concept 2035, a magazine due for distribution at Nor-Shipping this June. Data from Clarksons Research shows that less than 8% of the global merchant fleet in gt terms today is alternative fuel capable, although more than half of all ships on order will be able to use alternative fuels. Uncertainty about the scale and nature of the International Maritime Organization’s proposed carbon levy is holding back green investment, Christopher Wiernicki, chairman and CEO of ABS, a class society, said during an appearance at the CERAWeek energy conference earlier this month. “A carbon levy is a wild card. It will all depend on how it is implemented and enforced. There’s a huge question mark over whether this will deliver for the industry and there is much still to be decided,” said Wiernicki. “Will the levy be set at $18, $100 or even $150 per ton? Today, we just don’t know but this clearly has a significant bearing on a host of factors: operational, investment and asset viability. With the lack of a clear global carbon pricing mechanism, it is no wonder owners are cautious and concerned given the high degree of uncertainty this introduces into the market,” said Wiernicki. Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonisation director at rival class society DNV, commented: “The success of the maritime fuel transition depends on the parallel development of key components like bunkering infrastructure and fuel supply. This can also be enhanced by the implementation of energy efficiency measures, which can both deliver short-term emissions reductions and support the long-term adoption of low- and zero-carbon fuels.” Claudene Sharp-Patel, global technical director at Lloyd’s Register, commented: “Without decisive action to scale up alternative fuel supply chains, shipowners will face increasing compliance costs and operational uncertainty. We need greater regulatory clarity and investment to bridge the gap between ambition and action.” Sharp-Patel’s colleague at LR, Nick Brown, the company’s CEO, toldSplash: “The next decade will determine the shape of the industry’s long-term sustainability, demanding not just technological advancements but also greater investment in seafarers and human capital, which remain fundamental to creating the long-term change we need.” The energy transition for international shipping will cost the equivalent of one NEOM per month for the next 20 years, according to statistics from Dr Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at the UCL Energy Institute. NEOM is a 26,500 km megacity the Saudis are embarking building in the far northwest of the kingdom on the Red Sea, one of the biggest engineering works ever conceived anywhere in the world. Ship Concept 2035will give readers a glimpse of what is realistic for newbuilds coming out of yards 10 years from now. Taking into account regulations, fuels, information technology, seafaring skills, shipyards and charterers this unique magazine gives a big picture beyond the hype of what is practical for vessels delivering by the middle of the next decade. Crew numbers, artificial intelligence, reskilling, and automation are some of the topics covered in the survey.

        "content": "Product tanker giant Hafnia is set to launch FuelSure – a digital platform aiming to bring greater transparency, accountability, and cost savings to the maritime bunker fuel market – in collaboration with Studio 30 50, a venture growth team in which Hafnia was an early investor. By integrating real-time vessel feedback, lab analyses, and financial loss data, FuelSure aims to quantify the value of trust for shipowners and traders navigating one of the shipping industry’s most opaque sectors. FuelSure collects critical data points each time a vessel takes on fuel, such as barge condition, delivery accuracy, and overall supplier performance—and blends them with lab-verified chemical analyses of the fuel itself. The platform also tracks the downstream financial impact of bad bunkers, from engine damage to operational delays, to provide a comprehensive performance score for every supplier. “Hidden costs in bunker supply have plagued the maritime world for decades, with unreliable fuel quality that can cause mechanical breakdowns or even vessel detentions and delivery discrepancies that can prove both costly and imply foul play somewhere in the delivery chain. While bunkers themselves remain costly, these additional factors create significant losses on both a short-term and industry-wide scale. FuelSure addresses these issues head-on by centralising supplier reviews and performance metrics, empowering our crews and trading teams to make data-driven decisions that reduce risks and ultimately benefit the entire global supply chain,” said Peter Martin Grünwaldt, head of bunkers at Hafnia. FuelSure is currently in beta testing with a select group of industry experts. The platform is set to debut at Singapore Maritime Week on March 24, where the team will demonstrate its features and gather additional feedback before its wider release. Last month, Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business and Hafnia joined forces to launch Seascale Energy, a joint venture, combining Cargill’s existing bunker business Pure Marine Fuels and Hafnia’s Bunker Alliance."

        "content": "Lab Dookhtegan, a hacker group, has claimed this week it has disrupted the communication networks of 116 ships belonging to Iran’s top two shipping firms. “In an unprecedented move, we successfully disrupted the communication network of two Iranian companies that, among various terrorist activities, are responsible for supplying munitions to Houthis,” the group wrote on Telegram. The attack, which the group says was timed to coincide with US military operations against the Iran-backed Yemeni Houthis, severed the ships’ connections to each other, their ports, and external communication channels. Fifty ships belonging to National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and 66 ships belonging to Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) were targeted. Lab Dookhtegan said full restoration of the affected systems could take weeks. The hackers said the attack was the “tip of the iceberg,” with further operations planned. “Communication devices are the bottleneck of maritime vessels,” commented Cydome, a maritime security specialist analysing this week’s fleet-wide attacks on Iranian ships. “This makes the ship’s communication device a single point of failure, and if a malicious actor hacks the communication device (VSAT or other), it can take complete control over all communications of the vessel and even spread out to the IT and OT systems.” Cydome said the fact that malware or malicious commands were delivered to 116 vessels simultaneously indicates a high degree of automation and coordination in the attack. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations centre reported many vessels experiencing GPS interference in the Strait of Hormuz last week, with disruptions lasting several hours, affecting navigation systems and requiring vessels to rely on backup methods. Yesterday saw a fourth round of sanctions announced in Washington DC targeting Iranian oil sales since Donald Trump returned to power, ordering a campaign of maximum pressure on Iran. Iran exports are estimated to have declined to 1.35m barrels per day on average during January and February, as compared to their 2024 average of 1.70m barrels per day. There are increasing reports of volumes lifting from Iran but facing extended storage time in Southeast Asia as the pool of buyers and ships available has tightened."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Public comments continue to fly into the US Trade Representative (USTR) ahead of Monday’s hearing into controversial plans to tax Chinese-built tonnage calling at US ports. In the more than 150 submissions sent in, a considerable number have hit out at the unfair, blanket nature of the penalties for container shipping in particular. The trade office has recommended potential fees of up to $1.5m per port call for Chinese-built vessels, $1m per port call for operators of Chinese-built ships, and mandatory US-flag shipping requirements. Most operators in the world have in their fleet one or more ships of Chinese origin meaning that when calling at a US port, they would be subject to a port fee. Captain Melwyn Noronha, the CEO of lobby group Shipping Australia, pointed out that the blanket charges will penalise smaller containerships far more, suggesting a per teu fee rather than the current plans for a charge per ship. A 15,000 teu ship calling the US might expect to pay $200 per teu under current plans proposed by the USTR, Noronha wrote in his submission, while a 1,000 teu vessel could be forced to fork out somewhere in the region of $3,000 per teu. “A higher penalty (i.e. a per ship penalty imposed on smaller ships) would likely have a detrimental effect on niche markets where the route and geographic scope does not allow shipping lines to consolidate freight movement across markets, unless the shipping companies would be able to significantly extend lead times,” Noronha argued, suggesting this could cut the flow of perishable goods because of those longer lead times. “Ultimately, there would be barriers for entry for goods from various smaller export markets compared to goods from other larger markets, such as Asian markets,” Noronha maintained, in his proposal to change any penalty from per ship to per teu. In his submission, John McCown, a container shipping veteran who now runs New York-based Blue Alpha Capital, outlined what fees would be for a Chinese COSCO ship in a transpacific service. A weekly service from Asia to the west coast can be accomplished with five ships on a 35-day voyage turn. McCown’s example used 10,000 teu ships as COSCO has many ships in that size range and that is similar to the average ship size in the typical transpacific service. Such a service would typically call at three different west coast ports. “The first prong of $1 million would clearly apply. With the majority of COSCO’s ships built in China, the second prong at the highest $1.5 million level would also generally apply. Similarly, with the large majority of COSCO’s order book with Chinese shipyards, the third prong would apply at the highest $1 million fee level,” McCown wrote. In total, that COSCO ship would be charged $3.5m per port call or $10.5m for each voyage involving three west coast ports. With ten 35-day voyages per year, that would translate into $105m in annual fees just for that one COSCO vessel. If that vessel were to operate at 100% utilisation inbound, generally not possible due to seasonality, it would move 100,000 teu which is the equivalent of $1,050 per teu. That is equivalent to $2,100 for the typical 40’ container moving in that lane. To put that fee into perspective, it is equal to 72% of the latest Drewry spot rate in the Shanghai to Los Angeles tradelane of $2,906 per feu. “Clearly that fee would make that COSCO ship non-competitive and trade involving such a ship would be constrained,” McCown wrote. The fee situation involving ships of other carriers may not be diametrically different even if the circumstances are dissimilar, McCown warned. For instance, CMA CGM, which operates in the Ocean Alliance with COSCO, could be on the hook for fees of $2.75m per call and $8.25m per voyage in transpacific deployments that are most relevant to the US. The latest available data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shows that there are 39,296 port calls by containerships in the US each year. Based on the proposed actions, McCown’s analysis is that the average fee per call would be at least $1.5m. If the number of calls were to remain unchanged, that translates into $58.9bn in total fees per year related to containerships. Various other submissions made to the USTR have pointed out that the penalty fees in their current form would potentially cause lines to rationalise the quantity of calls to the detriment of the smaller ports, and similarly drive more ships to call in Canada and Mexico. “It is clear that when you look at the proposals as they are on the table right now, that that would cause massive extra costs for all shipping lines,” Hapag-Lloyd chief executive Rolf Habben Jansen told reporters at the German carrier’s annual results press conference yesterday. There is also a chance that courts might try and bar the USTR and president Donald Trump from carrying out their plan to penalise Chinese-built tonnage. In 1998, the US Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a harbour maintenance fee was in fact a tax and not a user fee and that it was unconstitutional to apply it to exports. Splashwill be reporting on the deliberations from the USTR hearing and the Trump administration’s response next week."

        "content": "Over 5,000 vessels – equivalent to 14.5% of the global merchant fleet – operate under registries with less than 10% ratification of International Maritime Organization and the International Labour Organization conventions, increasing exposure to enforcement actions, according to new data from analytics firm Kpler. “Flag risks are increasingly shaping maritime due diligence, impacting regulatory scrutiny, financial exposure, and operational integrity. The strategic use of high-risk flags in evasive practices, such as flag-hopping and shadow fleet operations, underscores the complexities of compliance in global shipping,” wrote Dimitris Ampatzidis, a risk and compliance analyst at Kpler, in a new report. Sanctioned vessel operations have doubled since early 2023, according to Kpler with more than 600 sanctioned vessels operating under high-risk flags. The dark fleet cast its shadow over the International Chamber of Shipping’s (ICS) latest annual flag state performance table with four new countries – familiar homes to Russia’s fleet – added to the list. Cambodia, Eswatini, Gabon and Guinea-Bissau were added to the survey, published last month, which charts the best and worst performing major flag states, while the British Virgin Islands, Costa Rica and Uruguay have been removed due to their relatively small fleet sizes. “The new additions, Cambodia, Eswatini, Gabon and Guinea-Bissau are reportedly used by some shipping companies seeking to bypass US/EU/G7 sanctions, leading to concerns as to whether international maritime standards are being properly enforced on board ships flying the flags of these States,” the ICS stated in a release. Splashhas reported repeatedly about the growth of shipping registers fuelled by the shadow fleet and Russia’s determination to keep exports flowing despite sanctions. San Marino, Guyana, Sierra Leone, Comoro Islands, Guinea Bissau and most notably Guinea were the flag states that stood out for their extraordinary fleet growth in the data compiled in the late January issue of Clarksons Research’s World Fleet Monitor. Wily, shady entrepreneurs are scanning world maps to seek ever more distant outposts to establish ship registers to help grease the flows of the dark fleet. France and The Netherlands have recently submitted a paper to the International Maritime Organization’s legal committee about the emergence of two new shipping flags with questionable credentials, one in the Caribbean and the other, a disputed, uninhabited volcanic island in the South Pacific. The submission hits out at what is described as the “fraudulent” registers of Sint Maarten and Matthew Island (pictured). It’s not just flags in far off places that have seen business surge in line with the growth of the shadow fleet. Less established names in classification and insurance have emerged. For instance, 86% of the global merchant fleet is now insured with the 12 P&I clubs that form the International Group, down from 95% prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago. Similarly the amount of tonnage classed by the established members of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) has dropped two percentage points over the past three years to 92%."

        "content": "Oilfield services giant Baker Hughes has signed a deal with Brazilian oil and gas major Petrobras to provide fully integrated completion systems as well as an agreement for a definitive solution for stress corrosion cracking due to CO2 in flexible pipe systems. The multi-year contract award for completion systems follows an open tender and will involve the use of a range of technologies specifically tailored to meet the needs of Petrobras’ offshore developments. Delivery will begin in late 2025. The intelligent completions technologies, combined with conventional upper and lower completions solutions, will provide remote operations capabilities and multizone control, limiting water and gas breakthroughs and reducing the risk of any costly interventions. Through this agreement, Petrobras will utilise Baker Hughes’ new SureCONTROL Premium interval control valve which provides enhanced reliability in the high flow rates of Petrobras’ offshore fields. Petrobras will deploy several additional Baker Hughes completions technologies, such as SureSENS QPT Elite downhole gauges and the B-Annulus monitoring system, SureTREAT chemical injection system, Sur-Set flow control system, Orbit Premium barrier valves, a gas lift system, REACH subsurface safety valves, DeepShield subsurface safety valves, Premier packers, screens, and gravel pack system. Earlier this week, the two companies signed an agreement that encompasses development and testing including a purchase option of the resulting next-generation flexible pipes, which will have an extended service life of 30 years in high-CO2 environments. The collaborative effort between Baker Hughes and Petrobras will be primarily executed at Baker Hughes’ Rio de Janeiro Energy Technology Innovation Center and nearby flexible pipe systems manufacturing plant. Stress corrosion cracking due to CO2 was identified in 2016 and can affect flexible pipes in pre-salt fields which have high concentrations of naturally occurring CO2. This issue is particularly acute in Brazil’s pre-salt fields, where Petrobras is reinjecting CO2 from their production operations into wells to reduce flaring and enhance oil recovery. Operators in high-CO2 environments have relied on solutions that mitigate the impact of this issue while limiting the service life of risers and flowlines. Baker Hughes’ flexible pipe systems and advanced monitoring technologies have proven effective at minimizing this impact, and the company is a major supplier of flexible pipe systems to Petrobras."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Shipping and trading firms need to think differently to achieve robust risk governance, writes Thomas Zaidman, managing director of Sagitta Marine. The past decade has been a rollercoaster for commodity markets with extreme swings in freight rates to geopolitical shocks affecting supply global chains. Volatility is a fact of life in the shipping markets, in the tramp trades it creates risk and opportunity in almost equal measure. The key is the ability to take on the volatility that matches your risk appetite and to use the tools at your disposal to manage the exposure. It’s a process that cannot be managed on gut instinct alone, however much old hands might tell you this counts more than a properly implemented strategy. At the end of last year, I wrote an article suggesting that we had only just begun to experience the waves of disruption that would inevitably arrive with the second Trump presidency, sanctions, tariffs and ongoing conflicts. The volatility that flows from geopolitical dislocation is unpredictable as it comes, whipsawing between opportunity and potential catastrophe. These aren’t market conditions for the faint of heart or the unprepared. As someone who’s spent years navigating the cycles of the dry bulk market, I’ve learned that companies who integrate risk governance into their strategy consistently outperform those that rely on ’market intuition’. Lesson #1: The Best Time to Hedge Is Before You Need To Many firms avoid hedging their market risk until volatility hits, then scramble to lock in rates at unfavourable levels. In 2021, when freight rates surged to record highs, those who had structured time-charter hedges ahead of time avoided financial disaster. From a governance point of view, corporate boards must mandate proactive hedging policies rather than leaving them to commercial teams’ discretion. This requires developing a quarterly risk scenario analysis to adjust exposure accordingly. Lesson #2: Balance Sheet Strength Is The Best Risk Hedge Companies that have over-leveraged themselves making speculative trades or through aggressive fleet expansion are the ones that suffer the most in downturns. Liquidity buffers are a critical means of risk management — many firms don’t appreciate this until a crisis forces them into a fire sale of positions. The fix for this problem is to set a minimum liquidity ratio policy to prevent overexposure to market conditions. This requires a stress-testing framework to model cash flow under worst-case scenarios. Lesson #3: Geopolitical and Sanctions Risks Are No Longer Rare Events As we have seen over the past five years, supply chains can be subject to disruption almost overnight. In 2024 and 2025 politics has taken centre stage, from the Russia-Ukraine war to the Red Sea crisis. Today’s boards must treat sanctions risk and cargo security as core governance issues, not just compliance checkboxes. To manage the process, companies need to appoint a dedicated geopolitical risk officer or advisory role at the board level. This needs to be supplemented with a real-time monitoring system for sanctions and regulatory changes. Lesson #4: Not All Good Advice Has To Be New Don’t forget though that it pays to recognise your strengths and accept your vulnerabilities as a company. At Sagitta, we hedge every ton of fuel we take. Our view is that while we know the freight market well, we don’t claim to have an edge in the oil market. For us, bunker price volatility is an exposure we manage systematically rather than speculate on. Unlike some owners who avoid hedging because they believe they can time the market, we see it as a fundamental risk mitigation tool – just like a time charterer fixing forward cover for freight. Given the sharp swings in fuel prices over the years, not hedging is, in many ways, a directional bet on oil, and that’s not a risk we’re willing to take. What happens next? Knowing the answer to this question is what every shipowner asks themselves when they wake up in the morning. There is no one simple answer; it takes a co-ordinated approach and putting resources in place to understand, prepare for and manage risk. As to thriving in volatile markets, companies that treat risk governance as a strategic function, not an afterthought are the ones that will profit."

The new orders follow two similar newbuilds Toyofuji Shipping and Fukuju Shipping booked last June for delivery in 2027 and claimed to be Japan’s first methanol-fuelled ships in this class. The 168-m-long vessels will be fit to carry 2,300 passenger vehicles and achieve a maximum speed of 21 knots. The ships will be deployed domestically and feature a high-performance dual-fuel engine that can use both methanol and heavy fuel oil, with expected CO2 emissions reduction per transport unit by more than 20% compared to ships currently operated and owned by Toyofuji Shipping, the shipbuilder said."

Described as the most deployed FPSO in history, the 1986-built vessel’s last charter was with Enauta at the Atlanta field in Brazil’s Santos Basin. The 215-m-long unit was Altera’s very first FPSO and the industry’s first newbuild harsh environment FPSO. The Nippon Kokan-built unit has previously operated 11 offshore fields. The acquisition of the FPSO, which has a production capacity of 30,000 bopd, marks Amplus’ entry into the FPSO acquisition market after years of focus on delivering field development solutions, offering vessel design and leasing options over direct ownership. To ensure a safe and efficient transition into Amplus ownership, the company picked V. Group subsidiary V.Ships Offshore to attend to initial vessel management and crewing, shipyard work scope preparation and execution oversight as well as to provide support throughout the deployment and operational phases “The overwhelming industry interest in our acquisition ofPetrojarl Ireaffirms the demand for cost-efficient, lower-production solutions in the market,” said Amplus managing director, Steve Gardyne. “We have strategic plans for further vessel ownership, with the aim of being the redeployment vessel contractor of choice.”"

Yesterday’s action marks the fourth round of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales since Donald Trump returned to power, ordering a campaign of maximum pressure on Iran. Iran exports are estimated to have declined to 1.35m barrels per day on average during January and February, as compared to their 2024 average of 1.7m barrels per day. There are increasing reports of volumes lifting from Iran but facing extended storage time in Southeast Asia as the pool of buyers and ships available has tightened."

In the early hours of March 26 last year, theDalilost power after leaving the port of Baltimore and struck a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to collapse, killing six construction workers and leading to one of the biggest investigations ever carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB said this week that 68 bridges across the US, including some of the country’s most famous ones such as the Golden Gate, should be assessed to see if they are at risk of collapse if hit by a ship. Transportation safety officials have urged the bridges’ owners to undertake immediate vulnerability assessments. The Key Bridge, which at 2.6 km was Baltimore’s largest bridge, was almost 30 times greater than the risk threshold based on guidance established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, NTSB officials said. But the owner of the bridge never evaluated that risk. “A risk level above the acceptable threshold doesn’t mean a collapse from a vessel collision is an absolute certainty,” said NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy. “What we are telling bridge owners is that they need to know the risk and determine what actions they need to take to ensure safety.” The NTSB is also urging the Federal Highway Administration, the US Coast Guard and the US Army Corps of Engineers to establish a team to offer guidance and assistance to bridge owners on evaluating and reducing the risk of a collapse from a vessel collision. Other well-known bridges cited by the NTSB include New York’s iconic Brooklyn Bridge. Legal cases surrounding theDaliaccident are expected to run for many years costing hundreds of millions of dollars."

Drydocks World is no stranger to these projects as it has already completed over 50 similar projects, including over 30 FPSO upgrades. The FPSO has a production capacity of 70,000 bopd, 75m cubic feet of natural gas, and can store up to 2m barrels of crude oil. It was converted from a supertanker in 2003. The unit is currently operating in the Baobab oil field some 25 km off the Ivory Coast operated by CNR International. Vaalco Energy is a partner in the field. The unit will soon be transferred to the Drydocks World facility in Dubai for an eight-month refurbishment."

        "content": "Mark Charman, CEO and founder of Faststream Recruitment, on why human skills still matter. AI is reshaping the maritime industry at an unprecedented pace. From predictive maintenance and autonomous shipping to AI-driven recruitment and workforce optimisation, technology is making operations smarter, safer, and more efficient. But as AI takes on more tasks, one question remains: What does this mean for human talent in maritime? For C-suite leaders, the challenge isn’t whether to adopt AI, it is how to integrate it effectively while ensuring that human skills remain at the heart of the industry. AI enhances, but people lead AI is excellent at processing vast amounts of data, automating repetitive tasks, and optimising decision-making. However, the core of maritime leadership, things like strategic thinking, relationship management, and crisis navigation remains uniquely human. Adaptability and critical thinking: AI can generate insights, but leaders must interpret them, foresee risks, and adapt strategies in real-time. Maritime operations are unpredictable, requiring a level of human judgement that no algorithm can replicate, well certainly not yet… Emotional intelligence and relationship building: Whether negotiating contracts, managing diverse crews, or making high-stakes decisions, human intuition and empathy are irreplaceable. The maritime industry thrives on trust, collaboration, and leadership, all of which depend on strong interpersonal skills. Ethical and strategic decision-making: AI can suggest solutions, but it doesn’t understand company culture, values, or the wider economic and regulatory landscape. Leaders must balance AI-driven insights with ethical considerations, long-term vision, and business strategy. The future of maritime talent: a blended workforce As AI adoption accelerates, maritime C-suite executives and HR leaders must rethink their workforce strategies. The most successful maritime organisations will be those that: Using AI to handle data-heavy tasks while empowering people to focus on high-value leadership and decision-making. AI won’t replace people but it will reshape roles AI is a tool, not a replacement for human ingenuity. The leaders who thrive in this new era will be those who can leverage AI while championing the human skills that drive maritime success. The new skill set for maritime professionals As automation evolves, maritime professionals will need to adapt to hybrid roles. Digital literacy, data analysis, and AI-assisted decision-making will become essential, but so will leadership, resilience, and problem-solving. The most future-proof employees will be those who can seamlessly integrate technical expertise with human-centric skills. The shift towards more strategic and creative roles As AI takes over routine and data-heavy tasks, professionals will have more capacity to focus on high-value activities, such as strategic planning, innovation, and customer relationship management. The ability to problem-solve, think creatively, and lead with vision will be more valuable than ever. The rise of augmented decision-making AI can process vast amounts of data and present recommendations, but it is up to human professionals to make final decisions. In high-stakes situations, maritime professionals will need to use AI-driven insights to enhance their judgment rather than replace it. Overcoming workforce concerns about AI One of the biggest challenges maritime leaders face is managing concerns over AI adoption. Some employees fear job displacement, while others worry about AI’s impact on workplace culture. To successfully integrate AI while maintaining a motivated workforce, maritime leaders must prioritise clear and transparent communication. The best organisations will proactively address concerns by explaining how AI will support roles rather than replace them. Providing real-world examples of AI augmenting rather than eliminating jobs can go a long way in helping ease uncertainty. Transparent communication, clear career development pathways, and ongoing training will be critical in ensuring AI is viewed as an enabler, not a threat. How is your organisation preparing for the future of AI-driven maritime workforces?"

The Gato do Mato consortium includes operator Shell with a 50% stake and its partners Ecopetrol and TotalEnergies which hold 30% and 20% stakes respectively. Pré-Sal Petróleo is acting as the manager of the production sharing contract. The development plan includes the installation of an FPSO vessel designed to produce up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day. The current estimated recoverable resource volumes of the Gato do Mato development are approximately 370m bbl. The project covers two contiguous blocks – BM-S-54, a concession contract entered into in 2005, and Sul de Gato do Mato, a production sharing agreement obtained in 2017. Initial operations will involve the reinjection of natural gas for reservoir pressure support, with future optionality to export gas to onshore facilities. The consortium anticipates that the Gato do Mato field will begin operations in 2029. The FID for the development has already been postponed once. In May 2022, BW Offshore was given limited notice to proceed on the Gato do Mato FPSO. BW Offshore and Saipem were supposed to be jointly responsible for the EPCI work on the FPSO with expected delivery in 2026. This was not to be as Shellterminated the dealin November 2022 after putting off the final investment decision for the project by up to two years. Just over a year later, Shell announced that it would be making the final investment decision for Gato do Mato in the first quarter of 2025. In April 2024, Shell chose Japanese floater expertModecfor front-end engineering and design work on the unit."

        "content": "UK consulting and engineering firm Wood has extended the deadline for discussions over a possible takeover by Dubai-based company Sidara. Last month, Woodconfirmed reportsthat Dar Al-Handasah Consultants Shair and Partners, also known as Sidara, has made an approach for a possible offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the company. At the time, the company did not disclose any terms of a potential offer but Sidara had to make an offer for the company by March 24 or state that it would not be making any offer. Wood subsequently received a non-binding, conditional proposal from Sidara related to a possible cash offer for the company. Following this, the UK firm provided Sidara with access to due diligence information and entered into discussions with Sidara. Discussions are continuing and Wood has extended the date by which Sidara is required to announce a firm intention to make an offer for Wood. Such an announcement must now be made by April 17. Under certain conditions, the deadline can be extended further. Wood has informed its shareholders that they were not required to take any action regarding the possible offer. The company again repeated that there could be no certainty that an offer would be made, nor as to the terms on which it will be made. Sidara sent four takeover bids to Wood in 2024. Thefourth bid, which was at the time described as “final”, was sent to the UK firm in late May 2024. The cash offer of 230 pence per Wood share valued the company at around £1.58bn (just over $2bn). The first offer from the Dubai-based firm was for 205 per share and was sent on April 30, 2024. The following offer was a 3.4% improvement on the first while the third was a 3.8% improvement on the previous one. Wood believed that none of the offers were good enough and refused all four, stating that they significantly undervalued the company and its prospects. Before Sidara started making offers, US-listed private equity group Apollo offered to buy Wood five times, with the largest valuing the company at about $2.1bn. The US firm eventually withdrew from the acquisition in May 2023."

With US policy described by Clarksons as “fluid”, analysts at the world’s largest shipbroker concede there is potential for escalation, deepening of indirect impacts but also for new trade agreements to be made and for new trading patterns to evolve. This week the office of the United States Trade Representative will hold a public hearing on March 24 and March 26, 2025, regarding proposed actions in the Section 301 investigation on China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance. The remedies include potential port service fees for Chinese-built vessels that arrive in US ports and requirements for exporters to ship a percentage of their cargo on US-owned, operated and eventually built vessels.Judah Levine, head of research at box booking platform Freightos, admitted the tariff landscape remains extremely uncertain. “Federal agency findings that could lead to sharp tariff increases on China, reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries, the USTR’s proposed port fees on Chinese-made vessels, as well as the reinstatement of 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican imports are due in early April,” Levine said. Peter Sand, chief analyst at container freight rate platform Xeneta, said:” “Given the massive uncertainty surrounding the US trade policy towards tariffs and proposals for port fees targeted at Chinese ships and carriers, shippers will seize any opportunity to lower their overall import costs during freight rate negotiations.”"

The investment should be in the region of $100m with construction set to begin in late 2025 and completion targeted for 2027. PNOC and the Batangas provincial government have already signed a memorandum of understanding to assess the project’s feasibility, conduct technical studies, and coordinate regulatory requirements. “We originally considered repurposing PNOC’s existing property, but we are now looking at another site in Batangas that is larger and more suitable,” said Rowena Raymundo, PNOC senior vice president for energy investments. According to him, PNOC can develop the project independently, however, the company is open to partnering with private investors with expertise in offshore wind port development. The project is part of the Philippines’ push to expand renewable energy in the country. The Philippines has a development plan in place which aims for a clean energy generation target of 15.3GW by 2030, with 3 to 6GW expected to come from offshore wind sources. The Department of Energy of the Philippines awarded certificates of confirmation of commerciality tothree offshore wind projectsin October last year with a combined target capacity of 1.65GW. Ports were also in the government’s focus as the same department has partnered with the Philippine Ports Authority to speed up the development ofthree portscrucial for faster offshore wind development due to their proximity to high-potential offshore wind energy service contracts. The two chose the Port of Currimao in Ilocos Norte, the Port of Batangas in Batangas City, and the Port of Jose Panganiban in Camarines Norte."

Maritime minister, Mike Kane, said: “We’re committed to making the UK a green energy superpower and our maritime decarbonisation strategy will help us build a cleaner, more resilient maritime nation.” Rhett Hatcher, CEO of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said: “The government’s strategy must now be matched by delivering the regulatory framework, technology and infrastructure, including a shore power revolution, required to support the green transition for UK maritime, bringing benefits to maritime communities and the UK economy.” Under the new strategy operators of larger vessels such as tankers and cruises will pay more for their greenhouse gas emissions. The strategy also sets out plans to reduce emissions from shipping and increase the use of clean fuels and technologies, such as hydrogen, electric or ammonia vessels. Under the new strategy operators of larger vessels such as tankers and cruises will pay more for their greenhouse gas emissions. The strategy also sets out plans to reduce emissions from shipping and increase the use of clean fuels and technologies, such as hydrogen, electric or ammonia vessels. “With global shipping accounting for 2% of all emissions, the UK will push for high ambitions at the UN’s next meeting of the International Maritime Organization in April, as it develops important measures to reduce emissions from global shipping,” the government said in a statement. Since January 2024, the EU’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has been extended to cover CO2 emissions from all large ships of 5,000 GT and above entering EU ports, regardless of the flag they fly. The system covers: 50% of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside of the EU allowing the third country to decide on appropriate action for the remaining share of emissions; 100% of emissions that occur between two EU ports and when ships are within EU ports. The scheme covers CO2, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, but the two latter only as from 2026. Shipping companies must surrender their first ETS allowances by end-September 2025 for emissions reported in 2024. The share of emissions that must be covered by allowances gradually increases each year. For 2025, 40% of emissions reported for 2024 must be covered by emission allowances. Last year, Turkey advanced its own emissions trading scheme (ETS) for shipping, mirroring the European Union’s ETS. The Turkish policy, pending presidential ratification, is designed to align with EU regulations and reflects a broader trend where Turkish and North African ports have seen increased traffic as ships attempt to sidestep the EU’s stringent emission rules. The pilot phase is expected to start this year, while the first phase of implementation should last from 2027 to 2034."

        "content": "Nasdaq-listed Greek tanker owner and operator Performance Shipping has nearly doubled its money by selling one of its aframaxes. The Andreas Michalopoulos company has offloaded the 2011-builtP Yanbufor $39m after picking up the 105,400 dwt vessel in late 2020 for $22m. The Japanese-built unit has been delivered to its new undisclosed owner, delivering a profit to Performance Shipping of about $21.5m, excluding commissions and transaction-related costs. Following the sale, the company’s fleet counts six aframax tankers, and three LR2s as well as one LR1 under construction in China. The LR2 deliveries are expected to bring the fleet’s average age to 10 years in 2026. “The sale of this mid-aged vessel enables us to capture significant value amid appreciated tanker vessel values. With cash proceeds from this transaction, our cash balance is expected to increase in excess of $105m, representing more than twice our year-end debt balance of $47.7m,” noted Performance chief executive Michalopoulos."

        "publication_date": "2025-03-25T06:22:36+00:00",
        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Mette Frederiksen, head of research and insight at Tankers International, on the future of the VLCC trades. The VLCC market is changing significantly. While the global fleet continues to grow with the introduction of newbuilds, the ageing vessels in operation are losing efficiency, therefore slowing the actual growth of tonnage supply. Adding to this shift is the rise of the “dark fleet,” where older ships, formerly considered impractical, are now finding extended employment in less regulated markets, often transporting crude from sanctioned nations. These developments pose challenges for the tanker industry, requiring a nuanced understanding of market dynamics. Looking back: How VLCCs have traditionally operated Historically, VLCCs would exit active trading at around 18-20 years of age. These older vessels would typically be scrapped or converted for storage and FPSO use. Just five years ago, it was the norm for tankers within this age bracket to be gradually phased out of the fleet, ensuring a consistent refresh of the global VLCC supply market. This cycle maintained a balance between supply and demand, ensuring that fleet growth was controlled, and market stability was preserved. In the past, if vessels remained in the commercial space beyond the 20-year life span, this would often be for storage purposes or they would be ‘inactive’, if not directly scrapped. Nowadays, significant changes have taken place to impact this system. The main disruptor to this traditional cycle has been the emergence of new trading opportunities due to the current geopolitical shifts and sanctions. With a number of oil-producing nations facing export restrictions, older vessels have been given a second lease on life. These ships, which in previous years would have been scrapped, are now finding sustained employment in trades that are less concerned with vessel age, safety, and emissions standards. Today, around two thirds of vessels in this older age category are actively trading, and this is predominantly within the sanctioned routes. Out of the vessels in this age bracket that are still trading, close to 90% of them are trading in sanctioned business – loading Russian, Iranian or Venezuelan oil. If their current sanctioned business fades, these vessels are unlikely to ever return to the mainstream tanker markets due to their tainted past, poor maintenance, and opaque ownership structure. In addition to this, new vessel deliveries have slowed considerably, with only one new VLCC delivered last year and just five expected this year. The following year is set to see this number rise to around 30 deliveries. However, this remains below the historical annual average of 40. The underlying reason for this lag is uncertainty surrounding future and alternative fuel technologies. Shipowners have hesitated to commit to new orders as they await clarity on long-term fuel strategies, resulting in slower ordering. An ageing population While the average lifespan of a VLCC has extended beyond 20 years, a clear decline in efficiency is evident. Vessels under 13 years maintain consistent trade patterns, averaging just over five cargoes annually, as they remain acceptable to most charterers and terminals. However, beyond 13 years, increased restrictions shift older vessels towards shorter Middle East to Far East routes, paradoxically boosting voyage numbers to nearly six per year. Beyond 18 years, efficiency rapidly deteriorates, with trading capacity dropping by approximately 10% annually as vessels face stricter limitations and a reduced number of charterers can fix them. If we exclude sanctioned trading, utilisation in the VLCC fleet drops rapidly from the age of 18 to near zero by the time a vessel is 20 years old. The impact of this inefficiency and current landscape of the VLCC market is significant. While the total VLCC fleet has increased by over 100 ships in the last five years, the true operational growth in terms of usable capacity is closer to just 60 vessels. Looking ahead, an anticipated 70 new VLCCs will enter the market within the next three years, translating to an 8% nominal capacity increase. However, due to the declining utilisation of older ships, the effective supply growth is projected to be only 1%. This imbalance creates a market scenario where, despite an expanding fleet on paper, the effective number of vessels available for efficient trading remains tight, especially if we exclude sanctioned trade. This tightening supply has major implications for VLCC rates. As fewer vessels remain viable for mainstream crude transport, competition for available tonnage intensifies, leading to upward pressure on freight rates. The future of the VLCC market The current landscape presents a paradox: while the fleet is growing in number, the effective supply remains stagnant or in decline. With shipowner indecision and shipyard bottlenecks delaying the next wave of newbuilds, and older vessels struggling with efficiency losses, the VLCC market faces a prolonged period of supply tightness. To accurately understand the true state of the market, we need to look beyond just the nominal number of ships and consider factors like age, trading patterns, and operational efficiency."

The company said in its Quarterly Market Overview Report that the withdrawal of a major market like the US has significant implications globally, with developers and members of the supply chain forced to rethink investment strategies. Despite these challenges, floating offshore wind continues its upward trajectory, with new auction awards defying broader market uncertainty. The analysis from the report forecasts installations to grow from 0.5GW today to 26.5GW by 2035. TGS claimed that the technology remains resilient, benefiting from ongoing innovation and governmental support, particularly in Europe and the APAC region. However, leading developer ambition overall shows signs of weakening due to increasing financial pressures and regulatory uncertainties, raising questions about who will lead the future offshore wind industry. The report reveals that up to 70 developers will begin construction on their first project by 2030, showing a new wave of smaller, often more local, players is ready to drive the industry forward. “We enter the second half of the 2020s at a turbulent time, with political uncertainty becoming ever more consequential,” commented Patrick Owen, lead author of the report, “And we are seeing some market shifts. As major developers’ ambitions waver, smaller and newer players are taking on greater roles in meeting national targets.”"

        "content": "Japanese conglomerate Marubeni has acquired a 25.1% stake in offshore wind service vessel provider Windward Offshore. Windward Offshore, which has a fleet of four CSOVs under construction at VARD shipyards, entered a partnership with Marubeni several months after securing a senior loan facility of up to €182m ($196m). The company also launched its first vessel CSOV, Windward Athens, last month. It will be delivered in September this year. The sale of the stake to Marubeni raised new equity to fund the future growth of Windward. Marubeni already has a strong presence in the global energy sector and is the developer of offshore wind projects in Europe and Japan. “We believe that Marubeni is a perfect complement to our existing group of shareholders, and we appreciate the diverse opportunities they bring to Windward. Marubeni’s expertise, network and financial strength will be invaluable as we continue to develop our portfolio and expand our footprint in the offshore wind industry,” said Bastian Hagebeuker, managing director of Windward Offshore."

        "content": "Hong Kong conglomerate Caravel Group has raided the local stock market to acquire a significant stake in fellow dry bulk giant Pacific Basin Shipping. Caravel Maritime Ventures, part of the Banga family’s Caravel Group, has picked up 388.5m shares, corresponding to a 7.53% stake in the Martin Fruergaard-led handysize and supramax specialist. Pacific Basin boasts a fleet of more than 270 ships, of which 110 are currently listed as owned. Late last year, the company made a surprising newbuilding move after many years with four methanol dual-fuelultramaxesbooked at Japan’s Nihon Shipyard for delivery between 2028 and 2029. The company has since last May focused on its own buyback programme citing the continued share discount to the current market value of its assets, cancelling about 138m shares for $40m and has another $40m lined up for buybacks this year. The shares currently trade at about HK$1.74. “Repurchasing our own shares at a discount to the current market value of our assets is beneficial to our shareholders – more so than acquiring second-hand vessels at prevailing prices,” Pacific Basin chief executive Fruergaard said in the company’s annual report release earlier this month. The Caravel Group has one of the world’s largest third-party shipmanagers, Fleet Management, under its wing, but it also owns a dry bulk business focused on the supramax and kamsarmax segments. Earlier this month, the group bought India’sInternational Maritime Institute(IMI), which specialises in pre-sea training for cadets, for an undisclosed sum."

        "content": "Maritime executives in Hong Kong are putting a brave face on the exodus of ships from its shipping register as shipowners take fright over the growing rift between China and the Donald Trump-led US. Another 12 ships left the Hong Kong flag last month, the register now down by more than 200 vessels over the past four years with the majority of ships being reflagged to Singapore, Panama, Liberia and the Marshall Islands. Hong Kong’s shipping registry grew dramatically following the territory’s reunification with China in 1997 to become the fourth largest in the world, but in recent years the city has attracted plenty of criticism and sanctions from Washington DC for its role in aiding the so-called dark fleet. With Trump’s return to the White House and a perceived further downturn in relations between the US and China, prominent shipowning names have decided to relocate some of their ships to ensure they are not caught up in any trade war. The Hong Kong Shipowners Association (HKSOA) sought to play down the political nature of the reflagging decisions when contacted by Splash Extra. “While we recognise recent shifts in tonnage, it is important to distinguish between short-term market adjustments and long-term strategic positioning,” the HKSOA said in an emailed statement. The shipowners body pointed out that while there has been a net decrease of 273 ships from 2020 to 2024, the total gross tonnage has actually increased by 4.3m, signalling a shift toward larger vessels. “It is natural for ship registries to experience fluctuations, particularly in a highly competitive and geopolitically dynamic landscape,” the HKSOA said, arguing that to frame the tonnage shift as purely a result of political tensions would be oversimplifying the reality of commercial decision-making in a complex global industry. The HKSOA maintained many shipowners are diversifying their flagged fleets across multiple jurisdictions—not just in response to geopolitical risks but also for regulatory, tax, and operational efficiency reasons. “It is a shame that the Hong Kong Shipping Registry whose services are excellent when compared with those of various other registries – and I say this from experience – is being challenged by politics in this way,” commented Rosita Lau, a partner at Ince & Co Hong Kong, and long-term champion of the city’s maritime credentials"

He has said some nations or blocs might be excused but with only 10 days to go, no details are as yet available. Dry bulk commodity traders, with one eye on what buyers of containerised freight did in 2024, have sprung into action and have been securing supplies of iron ore, bauxite, agriproducts, steel and timber before the next phase of the Trump trade wars kicks off. Meanwhile, the Chinese leadership announced a 5% GDP growth target for 2025 and trailed measures to get the Chinese population consuming more. It is surely only a matter of time before we see helicopter cash falling onto Chinese high streets. This has been good news for dry bulk freight markets. The Baltic Dry Index improved by an eye-catching 67% in March, reaching 1,643 points. The last time it exceeded 1,600 points was in November 2024, on the way down. The Baltic Capesize Index spiked to a peak of 2,893 on March 13 and as of March 21 was at 2,676, a full 170% higher than on February 21. Amid rising excitement around capesizes shipping bauxite from West Africa to China, it was the old faithful Australia-China voyage which enjoyed the biggest uptick in activity and freight prices, with daily TCEs from Port Hedland to Qingdao trampolining from $2,159 per day on February 12 to $33,291 on March 13, only to fall back to $21,737 on March 21. Brazilian exports ramped up too, with daily TCEs rising from $7,400 per day on February 12 to $25,918 on March 13, and still holding up at $25,482 on March 21. We will see helicopter cash falling onto Chinese high streets Good news was around in the panamax freight markets. The daily TCE from Santos to Qingdao, a common agriproducts voyage, followed a firm February with a further 13% rise in March to reach $13,529, a level last seen in October 2024. The parallel voyage from Mississippi to Qingdao added 11% to reach $17,612. US farmers were used to selling up to $2bn of grain to USAID every year but the government has cancelled the business, forcing farmers to scramble to sell product to any buyer they can find. Chinese buyers have been happy to take US wheat at four year low prices, with analysts saying the bottom has fallen out of the market for US grains futures since February. Panamaxes were being attracted to the US from Northeast Asia, with the round voyage daily TCE improving by 14% to $13,913 over 30 days to March 21. Panamaxes sailing from Northeast Asia to Northwest Europe enjoyed a 31% uplift in earnings in the 30 days to March 21, with rates restored to a more usual $7,784 per day after a very weak first two months of the year. The Atlantic panamax markets also enjoyed the increase in activity in March, with the daily TCE for a kamsarmax sailing from Skaw-Passero to the US east coast and back laden, adding 37% over the month to March 21 to sit at $10,105 per day. Overall the P5 timecharter average is up 18% in a month to $12,379. A combination of seasonality and pre-tariff fixing helped supramax earnings to improve from an average of $7,746 per day in February to $9,541 in the first three weeks of March. The North China to Australia round voyage TCE went up by 15% to a tidy $14,250 per day. Voyages from South China to load coal in Indonesia and return saw a 21% TCE increase to $12,550 between February 21 and March 21. Ships fixed from the Indian Ocean to load coal in South Africa for China discharge enjoyed a 26% increase in daily TCEs between the same dates to $11,221. On the return voyage, leaving China to load coal in Indonesia for discharge on the east coast of India, rates added 31% to reach $14,694. In the west, the market was more muted. Trips out from the Black Sea to China lost 3%, hovering at $12,000 exactly on March 21. Trips out from the US Gulf via Panama rose 3% to $16,832. Rates on the Europe to US Gulf voyage rose 7% to a still mediocre $8,050 per day. It is perhaps counter intuitive then that the daily TCE for a 38,000 dwt handysize bulk carrier voyage from Northwest Europe to the US Gulf went up by 23% over 30 days to March 21, to a supramax-beating $9,057 per day. Perhaps this was in part due to the increase in tonnage heading from Northwest Europe to South America, leading to a 14% increase in daily TCEs to $6,850 per day. Rates on the reverse voyage lost 6% to land at $14,033 per day while rates from the US Gulf to Europe added 2% to hang around at $10,893 per day. In the east, the Southeast Asia round voyage added 14% to hit $10,850 per day on March 21, while the Northeast Asia round voyage TCE went up 21% to a daring $11,563 per day. Even the North China to Southeast Asia voyage added 20% to reach $11,325 per day. So far 2025 is shadowing 2023 – no bad thing, but will the market’s usual seasonal peak appear in April and May? Once again, unforecastable policy will have an outsized say in freight outcomes."

It’s zero slogan has been emblazoned on methanol dual-fuelled ships coming out of South Korea for the past couple of years, but the Danish carrier now looks to have bowed to economics, turning to a fuel that it had previously eschewed. Like the great scrubber debate six or seven years ago, Maersk, previously a vocal opponent of both LNG and exhaust gas cleaning tech, has had a change of heart, in step with much of the industry, with LNG now dominating the alternative fuel orderbook. Morten Bo Christiansen, senior vice president and head of energy transition at Maersk, said in a LinkedIn post: “The math applied in current fuel standard proposals has an unintentional consequence; it is not fuel-agnostic and financially it heavily favors LNG, a fossil fuel. The consequence of this could be that pay-to-pollute financially becomes the most attractive fuel strategy and that we materially delay the development of the much needed low-emission fuel supply chains.” Christiansen said the fuel standard maths make the principle of pay-to-pollute the financially most attractive strategy for most shipping companies for the next decades. According to the latest figures from DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform, 34 new orders for alternative-fuelled vessels were placed last month of which 33 were LNG. Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonisation director at DNV Maritime, commented: “LNG remains the headline story, with a clear continuation of the trend towards these vessels evident since mid-2024. Again, this is being driven by the container segment, highlighting the importance of the voluntary market in driving maritime decarbonization.” Based on vessels already in the orderbook, the number of LNG vessels in operation is set to almost double by the end of the decade, and the need for supporting LNG bunkering infrastructure is intensifying.

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Mette Frederiksen, head of research and insight at Tankers International, on the future of the VLCC trades. The VLCC market is changing significantly. While the global fleet continues to grow with the introduction of newbuilds, the ageing vessels in operation are losing efficiency, therefore slowing the actual growth of tonnage supply. Adding to this shift is the rise of the “dark fleet,” where older ships, formerly considered impractical, are now finding extended employment in less regulated markets, often transporting crude from sanctioned nations. These developments pose challenges for the tanker industry, requiring a nuanced understanding of market dynamics. Looking back: How VLCCs have traditionally operated Historically, VLCCs would exit active trading at around 18-20 years of age. These older vessels would typically be scrapped or converted for storage and FPSO use. Just five years ago, it was the norm for tankers within this age bracket to be gradually phased out of the fleet, ensuring a consistent refresh of the global VLCC supply market. This cycle maintained a balance between supply and demand, ensuring that fleet growth was controlled, and market stability was preserved. In the past, if vessels remained in the commercial space beyond the 20-year life span, this would often be for storage purposes or they would be ‘inactive’, if not directly scrapped. Nowadays, significant changes have taken place to impact this system. The main disruptor to this traditional cycle has been the emergence of new trading opportunities due to the current geopolitical shifts and sanctions. With a number of oil-producing nations facing export restrictions, older vessels have been given a second lease on life. These ships, which in previous years would have been scrapped, are now finding sustained employment in trades that are less concerned with vessel age, safety, and emissions standards. Today, around two thirds of vessels in this older age category are actively trading, and this is predominantly within the sanctioned routes. Out of the vessels in this age bracket that are still trading, close to 90% of them are trading in sanctioned business – loading Russian, Iranian or Venezuelan oil. If their current sanctioned business fades, these vessels are unlikely to ever return to the mainstream tanker markets due to their tainted past, poor maintenance, and opaque ownership structure. In addition to this, new vessel deliveries have slowed considerably, with only one new VLCC delivered last year and just five expected this year. The following year is set to see this number rise to around 30 deliveries. However, this remains below the historical annual average of 40. The underlying reason for this lag is uncertainty surrounding future and alternative fuel technologies. Shipowners have hesitated to commit to new orders as they await clarity on long-term fuel strategies, resulting in slower ordering. An ageing population While the average lifespan of a VLCC has extended beyond 20 years, a clear decline in efficiency is evident. Vessels under 13 years maintain consistent trade patterns, averaging just over five cargoes annually, as they remain acceptable to most charterers and terminals. However, beyond 13 years, increased restrictions shift older vessels towards shorter Middle East to Far East routes, paradoxically boosting voyage numbers to nearly six per year. Beyond 18 years, efficiency rapidly deteriorates, with trading capacity dropping by approximately 10% annually as vessels face stricter limitations and a reduced number of charterers can fix them. If we exclude sanctioned trading, utilisation in the VLCC fleet drops rapidly from the age of 18 to near zero by the time a vessel is 20 years old. The impact of this inefficiency and current landscape of the VLCC market is significant. While the total VLCC fleet has increased by over 100 ships in the last five years, the true operational growth in terms of usable capacity is closer to just 60 vessels. Looking ahead, an anticipated 70 new VLCCs will enter the market within the next three years, translating to an 8% nominal capacity increase. However, due to the declining utilisation of older ships, the effective supply growth is projected to be only 1%. This imbalance creates a market scenario where, despite an expanding fleet on paper, the effective number of vessels available for efficient trading remains tight, especially if we exclude sanctioned trade. This tightening supply has major implications for VLCC rates. As fewer vessels remain viable for mainstream crude transport, competition for available tonnage intensifies, leading to upward pressure on freight rates. The future of the VLCC market The current landscape presents a paradox: while the fleet is growing in number, the effective supply remains stagnant or in decline. With shipowner indecision and shipyard bottlenecks delaying the next wave of newbuilds, and older vessels struggling with efficiency losses, the VLCC market faces a prolonged period of supply tightness. To accurately understand the true state of the market, we need to look beyond just the nominal number of ships and consider factors like age, trading patterns, and operational efficiency."

        "content": "Tariffs on, tariffs off, tariffs on, tariffs off… the world’s traders are dancing the commodity hokey-cokey to the hurdy-gurdy daily churn of US trade and foreign policy. The one conclusion that everyone can agree on is that life is going to become more expensive in the coming few years as the cost of doing business with the US, or in US dollars, goes up. Tanker owners have caught up with the idea that they may be on the hook for the egregious port surcharges that the US may impose on operators calling at US ports with Chinese owned or built oil tankers. S&P brokers are salivating at the potential shuffling of the global tanker fleet as some owners with significant US business but significant Chinese content in their fleets may seek to substitute in ships built in, say, Japan or South Korea. Careful, lads: there is no guarantee that the Dept of Trade’s Tariff Eye of Sauron will not alight on vessels built in other countries in due course. After all, we are still not yet three months into this US presidency; there is plenty of time yet before the MAGA Republicans get destroyed in the mid-terms. As the US EIA publishes data showing that US shale oil production is peaking and will probably decline after 2026, we will let wiser heads answer the question, how quickly can the US build enough oil tankers to manage its future oil imports and exports? Elsewhere, the demand and supply balance of oil markets is pointing to oversupply and lower prices. In China, Sinopec has announced a 16% fall in profits blaming a nationwide fall in demand not just for transport fuel but also for petrochemicals, which were supposed to be the key future driver of Chinese oil demand. Sinopec’s chemicals unit operating loss widened by 66% to RMB10b ($1.38bn). CNOOC and PetroChina will report on March 27 and 30. OPEC+ has announced plans to rein in quota-busting overproduction particularly in Iraq, Kazakhstan and Russia (good luck with that guys). Trump is doing his part to help by tightening US sanctions on Iranian oil production and oil tankers and asking Russia for help in stopping Iran’s nuclear weapon programme. Good luck with the anti-proliferation scheme as Poland, German, South Korea and Japan are thinking seriously about acquiring their own ultimate deterrents. As oil prices bottomed out earlier in March with WTI going as slow as $66.03 before recovering to over $68.20, crude oil and refined products tanker markets lifted shipowners’ sentiment via higher day rates. Over 30 days to 21 March, the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index improved 9% to 990 points, while the Baltic Clean Tanker Index rose 18% to 848 points, its highest level since last July. Assessed time charter equivalents on the US-China VLCC route slipped from around $43,000 per day in late February to a low of $36,654 on March 12 before recovering to $43,446 on March 21. Brisker fixing on the Middle East to China voyage led to a 12% improvement in rates between February 21 and March 21, to $46,589, though the market peaked two days earlier at $52,126. Suezmaxes continue to be the darlings as rates on the shiny new Guyana to ARA route gained 19% to $39,922 over 30 days to March 21, via a peak of $42,913 four days earlier. The more mature cross Med route added 11% to a comfortable $42,923 while the Dangota-defying WAF to UKC voyage added 13% to reach a commendable $40,975. Aframaxes were more muted, as a range of regional differences cancelled each other out. Recent excitement on North Sea- Germany discharge dissipated in the Spring sunshine as rates lost 11% to land at $25,230, though afras loading from North Sea platforms to discharge in the UK added 30%, rising to a stonking $62,939. In the Middle East, ships loading in Kuwait for Singapore discharge enjoyed a 9% increase over the 30 days to March 21 when the TCE was assessed at $33,735. In defiance of tariffs, aframaxes loading in the US Gulf for ARA discharge enjoyed a steady improvement in earnings in March adding 11% by the 21st to an assessed $35,548 a day. The star performer however was the Singapore to Australia voyage which added 48% to recover from lows of around $21,000 a day in February to $31,045 on March 21, as Aussies booked their Easter holidays in Bali and airlines filled up on jetfuel. The MR tanker sector enjoyed that trend too, with rates from Singapore to the Aussie east coast up 14% at $23,034 and the TCE from South Korea to Australia up 10% to $20,334. Oil products tanker markets followed up a volatile February with a glamorous March. the benchmark LR2 voyage from the Middle East to Japan spiked by 69% over the month to March 21, reaching a tidy $38,714 via a peak of $40,100 on March 18. Daily TCEs for LR1s on the same voyage rose 68% to $29,844 on March 21 via a peak of $30,028 a day earlier. TCEs for LR2s on the voyage from the Mid East to UK/Cont added 61% over the same period to achieve a tasty $42,076, while LR1 earnings for that voyage rose 62% to $33,779. The MR Atlantic basket added 26% to reach $28,283 on March 21, while the Pacific basket rise faster, by 30% to $24,317. All in all, March has been a rewarding month for tanker owners."

These cases of harmful interference are in the form of jamming and spoofing that disrupt Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) operating in the frequency bands allocated to the Radio Navigation Satellite Service (RNSS). The joint statement has been signed by the secretaries-general of the three UN specialised agencies. IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez said: “The safety of seafarers and shipping relies on the resilience of systems to support safe navigation and communication. Interference with Global Navigation Satellite Systems poses a serious risk to shipping activities, which could cause collisions and grounding. I urge all member states to act to protect these critical systems.” ICAO secretary-general Juan Carlos Salazar said: “Radio Navigation Satellite Service interference can impact aircraft operations far beyond the immediate affected area, creating potential safety risks across multiple flight regions.”"

On a per-teu basis, it works out at $11,138 per slot. Newbuild prices have soared in the 2020s, one of the most profitable decades for shipping. As an example, Evergreen’s latest deal works out at more than $100m more per ship compared to the $164m price that Hapag-Lloyd agreed to pay for a series of six – later 12 – Hanwha-built LNG-powered megamaxes contracted in late 2020. Newbuild prices remain elevated, however, according to Clarksons Research they have eased recently across sectors. Clarksons’ newbuilding price index has ticked down by 1% since the start of the year."

The US, which has been brokering the deal, said yesterday it would also extend to a ban on strikes against energy infrastructure. The White House said agreements “to ensure safe navigation” in the Black Sea have been agreed as well as a deal to prevent the use of commercial shipping for military purposes. The US claimed it would help restore Russia’s access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions, something that Ukraine and its allies are likely to question. The Kremlin confirmed the agreement on safe navigation in the Black Sea in a statement late Tuesday but said it was dependent on sanction relief for banks and companies involved in agricultural exports. Deborah Layde, chief executive of The Seafarers’ Charity, commented yesterday: “From the beginning of the war in Ukraine, seafarers from all over the world have paid a heavy price, with many trapped on their ships in Black Sea ports. Just in the last few weeks, multiple seafarers have been killed by shelling. Today’s words must be accompanied by meaningful action to ensure that safe passage for seafarers is strictly maintained."

The ability to harness their experience and know-how, along with MIT’s technology reach creates real jet fuel to drive progress. As well as researching key barriers, bottlenecks and knowledge gaps in the emissions challenge, the consortium looks to enable development of the novel technology and policy innovation that will be key. Long term, the consortium hopes to provide the gravity we will need to bend the curve to reach emissions objectives.” “This is a timely collaboration with key stakeholders from the maritime industry with a very bold and interdisciplinary research agenda that will establish new technologies and evidence-based standards,” said Themis Sapsis, the William Koch Professor of Marine Technology and the director of MIT’s Center for Ocean Engineering. “It aims to bring the best from MIT in key areas for commercial shipping, such as nuclear technology for commercial settings, autonomous operation and AI methods, improved hydrodynamics and ship design, cybersecurity and manufacturing.” The consortium will launch multiple research projects designed to tackle challenges from a variety of angles, all united by cutting-edge data analysis and computation techniques. Collaborators will research new designs and methods that improve efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, explore the feasibility of alternative fuels, and advance data-driven decision making, manufacturing and materials, hydrodynamic performance, and cybersecurity."

With the advancement of digital transformation, an explosive increase in demand for data centers is expected, and large sites are required to accommodate this demand. Data centers also need to be located near major consumption areas and be able to be used in the event of a disaster. As a result, the consortium is looking to push the location of such centers offshore. The demonstration experiment, which will use a 25-metre by 80-metre mini-float moored at Yokohama Port’s Osanbashi Pier, is expected to commence in the fall of 2025. The project will look at the viability of a data centre system fully powered by renewable energy with high energy efficiency and environmental performance. A container-type data center, solar power generation equipment, and battery storage equipment will be installed on the mini-float while the salt damage resistance and operational stability of each piece will be observed. Based on the results of the experiment, further expansion will be considered in the waterfront and marine areas of Yokohama Port. In the future, offshore floating data centers could be located near offshore wind farms and use the electricity generated at the data centers to maximise the use of renewable energy without relying on or being restricted by onshore power grids. NYK also provided a conceptual image of how such an offshore floating green data center could look (pictured)."

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett provides readers with a history of hours of rest at sea. How much have things changed over the centuries? A few years ago, ships were being pulled up for hours of rest breaches by Port State Control (PSC) officers all the time, everywhere. This was brought on by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) revisions in 2019. Today, an hours of rest breach is seldom the subject of a PSC deficiency or observation. Same ships; same crews. It may be that seafarers have taken to heart the spirit and the letter of the hours of rest regulations and recommendations. When the new rules came in, they were not taken entirely seriously by what I want to call seafaring culture. For centuries, frankly, fighting the urge to sleep was just a part of being a mariner. There isn’t someone else to give the job to while you take a nap. Amphetamine usage is high on feeder boxships Most sailing ships had two watches, not three, and many routine evolutions needed all hands; even if these were done at the change of watch, they ate into time off watch. It was quite usual for officers to pride themselves on how little sleep they needed. Masters of clipper ships in the tea trade would sail from their loading ports having spent the last hours at anchor with the mate agreeing quantities and fiddling with stowage and the master occupied with the agent and actually signing bills of lading. They took a tug down a badly charted river and once clear of the bar they crammed on sail for the passage down a dangerous and poorly charted sea. If you look at any B.A.chart of the South China Sea you will be struck by how many reefs have names like “Fiery Cross Reef”, “Astrolabe Reef” and so on – named after the ships that discovered them the hard way. Masters commonly “kept the deck” for days on end. Early steamships, with their bridge deck bridging the paddle boxes to give the helmsman a view past the funnel, inherited this culture, and the open bridge persisted to the last century. My late friend Captain Ralf Rutkowsky, a salvage master with Bugsier, definitely thought that enclosed wheelhouses were sissified, and totally disapproved of ice class ships with enclosed bridge wings. It is possible that Ralf’s wartime experiences, which included being torpedoed and sunk twice by British submarines when he was on ore carriers making the Narvik run, had something to do with this; as we all know, an ore carrier sinks quickly.

And so we get the lowest form of seagoing vessel, the humble feeder containership, making high speeds in crowded waters with two mates and a master. The master has nothing to do in his oceans of spare time so he can easily stand a watch and let the mates, who can do cargo and navigation in a couple of minutes because they have disinformation technology to help them, catch up on their sleep.

        "content": "The US administration confirmed yesterday that it will go forward with the implementation of a 25% tariff on all foreign-built cars, something that is expected to add greater pressure to car carrier rates which have been coming off multi-year highs in recent months. US president Donald Trump said the latest tariffs would come into effect on April 2, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Charges on auto parts are set to start in May or later. Fredrik Dybwad, an equity researcher with Fearnleys Securities, toldSplash: “Car sales have already been struggling and have seen flattish sales growth the recent months, and the tariff will further add pressure to this. Near half of all cars sold in the US last year were imported, and it is quite clear for us that a 25% cost increase for importers will pressure car sales in the country further. All else equal, we expect car volumes going into the US to come down, negatively affecting seaborne volumes and thus also car carrier earnings.” According to data from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB), looking at the seaborne car trade last year, South Korea and Japan exported around 1.5m and 1.3m cars to the US, respectively. The EU exported around 0.9m cars, while others stood at around 0.2m to 0.3m cars, excluding Mexico and Canada. The total seaborne car trade reached around 24.5m cars last year, while the deepsea car trade reached around 15m cars. “This implies that US imports – excluding Mexico and Canada – accounted for around 16% of global seaborne car trade and around 26% of the global deepsea car trade,” Jon Nikolai Skåland, an equity researcher at SEB, toldSplash. “Though, with Korea and Japan accounting for the majority of US deepsea imports, the car-mile impact is higher.” By assuming a 25% reduction to these volumes following the 25% tariffs, the impact on global seaborne and deepsea trade would be a reduction of around 4-7%, respectively, according to Skåland. “We view this as a negative for roro operators, potentially weakening the market balance and hold risk to the companies’ contract backlogs,” Skåland said. “The car carriermarket has weakened after the extraordinarily strong period across 2022-24, with fleet growth accelerating and demand growth cooling,” Clarksons Research noted in an update published on Friday prior to Trump’s latest tariff bombshell. Following years of limited investment, cash-rich car carrier owners have embarked on a huge fleet renewal campaign with the sector now having one of the highest orderbook-to-extent ratios, a heavy delivery schedule coming this year and next."

        "content": "Greek owner Tsakos Energy Navigation (TEN) has confirmed market rumours about the sale of one of its oldest suezmax tankers with additional divestment of ageing tonnage potentially on the horizon as part of the company’s fleet renewal programme. The New York-listed company said in its quarterly earnings report that a 2009-built unit had been offloaded to undisclosed third-party interests. The only 2009-built suezmax in TEN’s fleet and the company’s third oldest in this segment was the 158,500 dwtPentathlon. Some S&P sources suggest the Samsung-built ship has been picked up by UAE-based Grace Energy Shipping for $40.5m. TEN said the deal would, after payment of outstanding debt, generate free cash of about $30m and capital gains nearing $2.5m, to be booked in the first quarter of this year. The company, which recently ordered nine shuttle tankers at Samsung Heavy Industries in South Korea backed by a $2bn bareboat charter deal with Petrobras’ logistics subsidiary Transpetro, said it is looking to offload more of its older tonnage to make room for new tankers both in the conventional and the specialised segments. TEN’s diversified fleet consists of a mix of 82 crude tankers, product tankers and LNG carriers, including 21 vessels under construction. The company has nearly 20 ships older than 15 years, with about two-thirds in the products segment, the oldest one being the 2003-built 68,400 dwt LR1Andes."

        "content": "In a move to improve seafarer well-being and tackle worsening labour shortages in the shipping industry, the Global Maritime Forum has launched new guidelines for improving life at sea. The international not-for-profit organisation said that it aimed to use its most recent Sustainable Crewing Guidelines to boost working conditions and alleviate the forecasted shortfall of 90,000 trained seafarers by 2026. The guidelines were created by the organisation’s All Aboard Alliance with a consortium of 12 major shipping companies based on feedback from over 400 seafarers. These will address critical improvements needed in areas such as abuse and harassment, work-life balance, and onboard facilities to boost workforce well-being and safety. The research carried out to inform the guidelines showed that 25% of seafarers experience harassment and bullying – rising to above 50% for female seafarers. 90% report having no weekly day off, and many are isolated with limited or no access to internet services at sea. Struggling with inexperience, fatigue, and insufficient resources, workers face an increased risk of accidents. Allianz estimates that 75% to 96% of accidents and incidents at sea involve human error, while Science Direct claims that 15% to 20% of all fatalities are linked to fatigue. Also, seafarer labour shortages have reached a 17-year high, and some major banks have indicated they could curb lending for shipowners who put seafarers’ welfare at risk. Following 115 interviews with female seafarers from 23 different nationalities, the All Aboard Alliance launched the Diversity@Sea pilot project in October 2023 to address the pain points identified in the conversations. Several co-designed solutions were tested in a ten-month pilot project on 12 pilot vessels providing daily feedback to assess the impact of these measures. Pilot leads from each of the involved companies worked closely together to translate the learnings from the seafarers into the nine Sustainable Crewing Guidelines: “These guidelines serve as a roadmap for shipping companies striving to improve employee well-being, and will also help seafarers and other stakeholders identify companies that take sustainability and social responsibility seriously,” said Mikael Skov, CEO at Hafnia and All Aboard Alliance co-chair. “We need a complete rethink of what good looks like when it comes to seafarer well-being. While existing measures like the Maritime Labour Convention provide minimum standards for working conditions at sea, we hope the Sustainable Crewing Guidelines can serve as inspiration to those companies that want to go beyond the bare minimum,” said Susanne Justesen, director of human sustainability at the Global Maritime Forum. The All Aboard Alliance will meet in April to explore the next steps for the guidelines, which aim to improve life at sea and drive mutual accountability."

Founded by technology entrepreneur Kingston Duffie, Laysoft, also known as Laytime2000, has gained more than 200 active users in the dry bulk market over the past two decades, notably in the grain and mining segments. B&V said the acquisition provides Laysoft users a natural migration path to its Demurrage AI Copilot platform, which automatically converts laytime calculations done in Laysoft into the B&V laytime format, preserving historical demurrage data while making the port intelligence available to them in the B&V platform. B&V software is used by industrial producers, commodity traders, bulk terminals and shipowners to calculate delay time and demurrage when a ship is loading and discharging in port. “The acquisition of a successful, niche application such as Laysoft further consolidates B&V’s position serving several hundred companies in the maritime industry. Our Laysoft customers now have a frictionless path to a powerful and intuitive laytime platform,” said Evangelos Efstathiou, CEO of Burmester & Vogel."

        "content": "The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) is launching a dedicated low-carbon transit slot designed to support and reward its clients’ green agenda. Starting October 5, a weekly transit slot will be reserved only for neopanamax vessels that meet specific low-carbon emission requirements. Unlike previous announcements, this slot will not be offered through an auction but through a competition held 30 days before the transit date. The first phase of the so-called NetZero Slot will accommodate ships equipped with dual-fuel engines that use fuel with a carbon intensity of less than 75 gCO2(e)/MJ from extraction to combustion. Specifications for a second phase, planned for 2026, will be announced on a later date, which will, in addition to phase one requirements, demand that vessels submit a technology screening report, which evaluates energy efficiency technologies applicable to the vessel. The ACP said laden vessels and those with a larger Panama Canal Universal Measurement System (PCUMS) capacity will be given priority in the competition. The winning vessel stands to benefit from being able to choose the transit date within the week offered, a guaranteed transit time of 24 hours, as well as just-in-time service. “By motivating investment in vessels capable of using low-carbon fuels and energy-efficient technologies, we are recognizing and rewarding our clients who are leading the transition toward a more sustainable future, while we await the development of regional infrastructure and logistics that will allow us to make steady progress toward global decarbonization goals,” stated Ilya Espino de Marotta, the Panama Canal’s deputy administrator and sustainability officer."

The projects have the potential to reach a total installed capacity of 2.45GW. The two offshore wind projects will be named Sicily South and Sardinia Northwest. The Sicily South offshore wind farm is located in the Sicily Channel, some 25 km from the nearest coast of Agrigento. It has up to 76 turbines and a planned installed capacity of 1,140MW. The Sardinia Northwest offshore wind farm is located northwest of Sardinia and extends for 364 sq km, with a potential capacity of around 1.35GW. The two projects, among five others, are in an early development stage and have been initiated by AvenHexicon, a joint venture between Avapa and Hexicon. Ingka and Oxan have acquired Hexicon’s 50% stake in the two projects for an upfront payment of €2.5m. Due to certain conditions, the total potential consideration could reach €20m. The projects will continue to be developed through a partnership between NexVenti, a joint venture between Ingka Investments and Oxan Energy, and Avapa. This is not the first partnership between Ingka Investments and Avapa Energy. They have been working together in Italy since 2023, when they developed solar PV projects in the regions of Veneto, Puglia, Molise, Sicily, and Sardinia. On the other hand, Ingka and Oxan have already partnered for the upcoming offshore wind tender in France."

The international not-for-profit organisation said that it aimed to use its most recent Sustainable Crewing Guidelines to boost working conditions and alleviate the forecasted shortfall of 90,000 trained seafarers by 2026. The guidelines were created by the organisation’s All Aboard Alliance with a consortium of 12 major shipping companies based on feedback from over 400 seafarers. These will address critical improvements needed in areas such as abuse and harassment, work-life balance, and onboard facilities to boost workforce well-being and safety. The research carried out to inform the guidelines showed that 25% of seafarers experience harassment and bullying – rising to above 50% for female seafarers. 90% report having no weekly day off, and many are isolated with limited or no access to internet services at sea. Struggling with inexperience, fatigue, and insufficient resources, workers face an increased risk of accidents. Allianz estimates that 75% to 96% of accidents and incidents at sea involve human error, while Science Direct claims that 15% to 20% of all fatalities are linked to fatigue.

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "While there remains potential for a new supercycle in the shipbuilding industry to replace the large number of vessels that were delivered between 2005 and 2010, broker BRS is predicting shipbuilding prices will stall this year with the company’s chairman and CEO, Gilbert Walter, suggesting: “Shipyards will suffer from a slowdown in ordering, even as additional shipbuilding capacity comes on stream.” Walter was writing in the introduction to BRS’s 173-page annual review, one of the best market reports in shipping, something he admitted delaying writing his editorial until the last moment before the review went to print, because predicting what lies ahead for the shipping markets, he wrote, has never been more difficult. “Much like the start of 2025, the remainder of the year is shaping up to be just as unpredictable – a landscape ripe for asset play. Older ship values will continue to weaken, and shipbuilding prices will stall,” Walter suggested. Regarding shipbuilding, BRS noted that in 2024, the average expected delivery time for available slots became more than four years. Main engine manufacturers have increasingly become a bottleneck concerning delivery slots Tight delivery slot supply saw previously inactive Chinese shipbuilding facilities ramp up production. “In 2024, China entered a new phase of shipbuilding expansion, almost 20 years after the boom that propelled it onto the international shipbuilding scene,” BRS noted, adding: “As China strengthens its grip on the global shipbuilding industry, several capacity expansions are planned or have recently taken place.” New Chinese shipyards that have opened or reopened include Hubei Jinyu New Energy Shipbuilding, Three Waters New Energy Technology, Yangzhou Guoyu Shipbuilding, Jiangsu New Rongsheng Heavy Industry, Nantong Xiangyu (XMXYG), Jiangsu Soho Innovation & Technology Group, Wuhu Shipyard and Shandong Xinfa Group, while existing yards Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, New Times Shipbuilding, Hengli Heavy Industry, Jiangsu New Hantong Ship Heavy Industry, Huanghai and Yamic all expanded facilities. Existing yards Zhoushan Ning Shing Shipbuilding and Hubei Hechuang moved into the international space. Once this new expansion is complete, BRS estimates it will add about 200 more ships per year to the current global shipbuilding capacity. This would increase the current capacity of about 1,500 ships to around 1,700 ships per year, and comes at a time when the US, which produced just five ocean-going merchant ships last year, is looking at penalising Chinese-built tonnage calling at American ports. Currently, there are about 348 operational shipyards worldwide, having either secured new contracts or completed deliveries in the past year, according to BRS data. This is roughly 50% of 2007’s peak of around 700 active yards. BRS argued that the shipbuilding industry entered a supercycle in 2021, equivalent to the 2003 to 2008 boom. “This theory, which we have defended for years, is based on the need to replace many of the units delivered as a consequence of the 2003-2008 boom, when annual global shipbuilding output went from 1,483 ships (2005) to 2,591 ships (2010). These vessels will reach 20-25 years of age this decade, and because they were designed and built before the eco-revolution of the 2010s, they need to be replaced with more efficient tonnage,” BRS explained. A future threat to the shipbuilding industry is uncontrolled expansion, BRS warned, which could lead to market instability. Another factor beyond the yards’ control is in the availability of suitable number of engines. “Main engine manufacturers have increasingly become a bottleneck concerning delivery slots. A shipyard can lease all the facilities it desires to offer early slots, but no ship will be delivered without a main engine,” BRS noted. BRS is predicting 100m dwt of ships will be ordered this year, down from last year’s 193m figure. “We expect that current worldwide uncertainties will prevail, with a renewed pressure on freight markets delaying investment decisions. The new wave of shipbuilding expansion will have a downward impact on newbuilding prices, which should weaken during 2025 by more than 10% depending on type and size of ships, despite the resistance that will remain given the considerable orderbooks,” BRS predicted. Newbuild prices remain elevated, however, according to data from rival Clarksons Research, they have eased recently across sectors. Clarksons’ newbuilding price index has ticked down by 1% since the start of the year."

        "content": "Tech firm ABB and French liner giant CMA CGM are collaborating on a new parametric roll algorithm to improve ship safety withSplashreporting on many container overboard incidents over the years. The solution integrates a theoretical framework developed by CMA CGM into the ABB Ability OCTOPUS Marine Advisory system. Parametric rolling has been a challenge to ship safety for decades. Particularly affecting containerships, ropax vessels, and car carriers, it means that a vessel experiences large rolling motions as it moves in waves. The phenomenon is hard to predict and poses a threat to vessel, cargo, and crew safety. By detecting and helping to prevent extreme parametric rolling, the new algorithm will help enhance operational safety by reducing the risk of accidents, vessel damage, and cargo loss at sea. CMA CGM will deploy the solution across its global fleet and offer comprehensive training services for the users. These trainings will also be available for the wider shipping industry. “This collaboration represents a major leap forward for the industry, enabling more efficient operations and safer voyages,” said Emmanuel Delran, vice president of group operations at CMA CGM."

        "content": "The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the Comité Maritime International (CMI) have recently launched an updated campaign to get governments to ratify urgent maritime treaties. CMI’s president, Ann Fenech, argues that today’s challenging international scene and geopolitical developments make it all the more important, now more than ever before, that the maritime law and regulations in different jurisdictions provide legal certainty and uniformity. The CMI was established in 1897 and is made up of 53 national maritime law associations and numerous industry players as consultative members. It has since its creation been responsible for drafting the vast majority of maritime law conventions. Fenech, a partner in Malta-based Fenech & Fenech Advocates, is a big believer in the primacy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as the industry’s global regulator, a position that has come under considerable pressure in recent years with Europe going its own way on green legislation and the return of Donald Trump to power in the US. “We are very strong supporters of the world maritime order needing a global regulator,” Fenech tellsMaritime CEO. “The maritime industry is by its very nature international and therefore my own personal view is that, notwithstanding the good and honourable intentions, one cannot expect regional regulators to be able to give effect to what is required to be adopted on an international level.” Regional regulations tend to result in the problem shifting from one region to the other, Fenech reckons. “For there to be a true level playing field, to achieve the highest possible standards on a worldwide basis, maritime regulation needs to be global and the IMO as well as other UN agencies tick the boxes,” she says. Getting maritime treaties ratified in 2025 is not easy, Fenech concedes. “The decision by any state to ratify a convention, meaning that what is in effect an international instrument becomes part and parcel of the law of the land, is to some extent dependent on how enthusiastic that particular state was during the deliberation of the convention prior to it being adopted,” she explains. The latest CMI draft, which went on to be adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations and signed in Beijing in September of 2023, the convention on the international effects of judicial sales of ships, was deliberated intently by dozens of state delegations, and in following 18 months CMI has achieved 32 signatories. “We are cautiously optimistic that the convention will be ratified during 2025,” Fenech says. “One of the reasons behind the success of this convention is that the convention does not attempt to disrupt the order of domestic law. It simply sets down the basic, most important principles, and that I believe has made it easier for most jurisdictions to adopt it.” Other international maritime conventions strongly encouraged to be ratified by governments by ICS and CMI as an urgent priority are the IMO Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks (Nairobi WRC), 2007, IMO 2010 Protocol to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS), 1996, the IMO Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (Hong Kong), 2009."

        "content": "US offshore wind projects are facing even more headwinds as the town of Nantucket and activist groups are challenging three offshore wind projects off the Massachusetts coast. Town officials filed an appeal in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the decision by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to allow the SouthCoast Wind project to move forward despite admitting it would “tarnish Nantucket’s world-renowned views”. Nantucket officials argue that BOEM’s approval violates both the National Historic Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, laws that ensure federal agencies mitigate harm to historic sites before clearing projects. The town has enlisted Cultural Heritage Partners as special legal counsel for the lawsuit. The town also cited concerns that the incident at Vineyard Wind, when one of its massive turbine blades disintegrated and filled the town’s beaches with debris, could be repeated with other projects. “Our economy depends on heritage tourism. If people stop coming to Nantucket, that hurts our small businesses, our workers, and our community,” added Matt Fee, vice chair of the select board. Furthermore, the Nantucket-based ACK for Whales is asking the US Environmental Protection Agency to rescind permits granted to Vineyard Wind and New England Wind to construct and operate their offshore wind farms. The group filed a petition against Vineyard Wind earlier this week, asking the EPA to revoke the permit. The permit was granted in 2021 and amended in 2022. Vineyard Wind is currently under construction. Previously, the group filed a similar petition against New England Wind."

        "content": "Spanish energy giant Repsol and Aberdeen-based NEO Energy have decided to merge their assets in the UK part of the North Sea. Under the terms of the transaction, the combined business will be jointly owned by NEO, which will hold 55% of a newly created joint venture company, while Repsol’s UK arm will hold the remaining 45%. The deal is set to be completed during the third quarter of 2025. The new company, called NEO NEXT Energy Limited, will have an output of around 130,000 boepd this year. Repsol said that it was aiming for financial benefits from the merger of more than $1b, improving cash generation and shareholder returns. “The benefits of synergies from consolidation will create much stronger value creation, profit and cash flow yield for shareholders and more options for capital allocation decisions well into the next decade. But this company will also be very well positioned to choose both organic and inorganic growth. We will certainly look to be making more value accretive acquisitions,” said John Knight, Chair of NEO Energy. Repsol will retain $1.8bn of the decommissioning liabilities related to its legacy assets, enhancing the cash flows of the combined business. Repsol used to own its North Sea assets through a joint venture with China’s Sinopec. In 2023, the Spanish firm ended years-long arbitration with Sinopec, which saw the Spanish company acquire the remaining 49% of the joint venture, giving it full control of the assets. This consolidation of assets by NEO Energy and Repsol is the latest in a series of such moves done by other operators in the North Sea. Some of those moves were done following the British government’s imposition of a windfall. Ithaca Energy and Italian major Eni merged their UK upstream assets in October 2024, while Shell and Equinor also announced they were combining their North Sea assets. Harbour Energy took over all upstream assets of Wintershall Dea, and there are talks of EnQuest taking over Serica Energy."

Keyfield International’s wholly owned subsidiary, Keyfield Offshore, sold the 2014-builtKeyfield Lestarifor a cash consideration of $12.5m. The company said the sale was expected to be completed in June 2025, coinciding with the completion of the vessel’s current charter to another customer in India. The sale of the accommodation workboat comes at an opportune time for the company, considering the vessel is already actively deployed in the region. “The disposal is intended to unlock Lestari’s value, bringing in a profit of approximately RM28m ($6.3m) to the group. The proceeds from the disposal will be utilised for working capital and to finance the acquisition of other vessels, which the group will continue to carefully assess and evaluate,” said Darren Kee Chit Huei, Keyfield Group CEO and executive director."

        "content": "The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the Comité Maritime International (CMI) have recently launched an updated campaign to get governments to ratify urgent maritime treaties. CMI’s president, Ann Fenech, argues that today’s challenging international scene and geopolitical developments make it all the more important, now more than ever before, that the maritime law and regulations in different jurisdictions provide legal certainty and uniformity. The CMI was established in 1897 and is made up of 53 national maritime law associations and numerous industry players as consultative members. It has since its creation been responsible for drafting the vast majority of maritime law conventions. Fenech, a partner in Malta-based Fenech & Fenech Advocates, is a big believer in the primacy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as the industry’s global regulator, a position that has come under considerable pressure in recent years with Europe going its own way on green legislation and the return of Donald Trump to power in the US. “We are very strong supporters of the world maritime order needing a global regulator,” Fenech tellsMaritime CEO. “The maritime industry is by its very nature international and therefore my own personal view is that, notwithstanding the good and honourable intentions, one cannot expect regional regulators to be able to give effect to what is required to be adopted on an international level.” Regional regulations tend to result in the problem shifting from one region to the other, Fenech reckons. “For there to be a true level playing field, to achieve the highest possible standards on a worldwide basis, maritime regulation needs to be global and the IMO as well as other UN agencies tick the boxes,” she says. Getting maritime treaties ratified in 2025 is not easy, Fenech concedes. “The decision by any state to ratify a convention, meaning that what is in effect an international instrument becomes part and parcel of the law of the land, is to some extent dependent on how enthusiastic that particular state was during the deliberation of the convention prior to it being adopted,” she explains. The latest CMI draft, which went on to be adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations and signed in Beijing in September of 2023, the convention on the international effects of judicial sales of ships, was deliberated intently by dozens of state delegations, and in following 18 months CMI has achieved 32 signatories. “We are cautiously optimistic that the convention will be ratified during 2025,” Fenech says. “One of the reasons behind the success of this convention is that the convention does not attempt to disrupt the order of domestic law. It simply sets down the basic, most important principles, and that I believe has made it easier for most jurisdictions to adopt it.” Other international maritime conventions strongly encouraged to be ratified by governments by ICS and CMI as an urgent priority are the IMO Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks (Nairobi WRC), 2007, IMO 2010 Protocol to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS), 1996, the IMO Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (Hong Kong), 2009."

        "content": "Bulgaria has proposed to establish and host a multinational maritime coordination centre aimed at ensuring the safety of shipping in the western part of the Black Sea . The proposal was made by the country’s prime minister, Rossen Zhelyazkov, after the Ukraine security summit in Paris on Thursday. The concept envisions the centre providing continuous marine monitoring and early warning of possible threats and hostile operations, as well as increasing the resilience of important undersea infrastructure in the Black Sea, the Bulgarian government press service said. “The goal is to establish guidelines for shipping and to carry out monitoring activities – by air and water, as well as critical infrastructure, as well as all potential hostile actions in the Black Sea territory,” said Zhelyazkov, stressing that the restoration of commercial shipping is extremely important because it affects not only the bordering countries but also the entire East-West trade. Zhelyazkov pointed out that the Black Sea mine action group is a good example of how coordination between coastal states can contribute to efforts to strengthen security of navigation in the Black Sea. The summit in Paris, hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, discussed the halt of hostilities in Ukraine as part of achieving a stable and long-term peace with all of the security assurances that Ukraine requires, including guarantees for Europe’s security. Earlier this week the US said it had brokered a deal between Russia and Ukraine to halt military activity over the Black Sea after its officials met separately with counterparts from Moscow and Kyiv in Saudi Arabia."

        "content": "In a move to improve seafarer well-being and tackle worsening labour shortages in the shipping industry, the Global Maritime Forum has launched new guidelines for improving life at sea. The international not-for-profit organisation said that it aimed to use its most recent Sustainable Crewing Guidelines to boost working conditions and alleviate the forecasted shortfall of 90,000 trained seafarers by 2026. The guidelines were created by the organisation’s All Aboard Alliance with a consortium of 12 major shipping companies based on feedback from over 400 seafarers. These will address critical improvements needed in areas such as abuse and harassment, work-life balance, and onboard facilities to boost workforce well-being and safety. The research carried out to inform the guidelines showed that 25% of seafarers experience harassment and bullying – rising to above 50% for female seafarers. 90% report having no weekly day off, and many are isolated with limited or no access to internet services at sea. Struggling with inexperience, fatigue, and insufficient resources, workers face an increased risk of accidents. Allianz estimates that 75% to 96% of accidents and incidents at sea involve human error, while Science Direct claims that 15% to 20% of all fatalities are linked to fatigue. Also, seafarer labour shortages have reached a 17-year high, and some major banks have indicated they could curb lending for shipowners who put seafarers’ welfare at risk. Following 115 interviews with female seafarers from 23 different nationalities, the All Aboard Alliance launched the Diversity@Sea pilot project in October 2023 to address the pain points identified in the conversations. Several co-designed solutions were tested in a ten-month pilot project on 12 pilot vessels providing daily feedback to assess the impact of these measures. Pilot leads from each of the involved companies worked closely together to translate the learnings from the seafarers into the nine Sustainable Crewing Guidelines: “These guidelines serve as a roadmap for shipping companies striving to improve employee well-being, and will also help seafarers and other stakeholders identify companies that take sustainability and social responsibility seriously,” said Mikael Skov, CEO at Hafnia and All Aboard Alliance co-chair. “We need a complete rethink of what good looks like when it comes to seafarer well-being. While existing measures like the Maritime Labour Convention provide minimum standards for working conditions at sea, we hope the Sustainable Crewing Guidelines can serve as inspiration to those companies that want to go beyond the bare minimum,” said Susanne Justesen, director of human sustainability at the Global Maritime Forum. The All Aboard Alliance will meet in April to explore the next steps for the guidelines, which aim to improve life at sea and drive mutual accountability."

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett provides readers with a history of hours of rest at sea. How much have things changed over the centuries? A few years ago, ships were being pulled up for hours of rest breaches by Port State Control (PSC) officers all the time, everywhere. This was brought on by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) revisions in 2019. Today, an hours of rest breach is seldom the subject of a PSC deficiency or observation. Same ships; same crews. It may be that seafarers have taken to heart the spirit and the letter of the hours of rest regulations and recommendations. When the new rules came in, they were not taken entirely seriously by what I want to call seafaring culture. For centuries, frankly, fighting the urge to sleep was just a part of being a mariner. There isn’t someone else to give the job to while you take a nap. Amphetamine usage is high on feeder boxships Most sailing ships had two watches, not three, and many routine evolutions needed all hands; even if these were done at the change of watch, they ate into time off watch. It was quite usual for officers to pride themselves on how little sleep they needed. Masters of clipper ships in the tea trade would sail from their loading ports having spent the last hours at anchor with the mate agreeing quantities and fiddling with stowage and the master occupied with the agent and actually signing bills of lading. They took a tug down a badly charted river and once clear of the bar they crammed on sail for the passage down a dangerous and poorly charted sea. If you look at any B.A.chart of the South China Sea you will be struck by how many reefs have names like “Fiery Cross Reef”, “Astrolabe Reef” and so on – named after the ships that discovered them the hard way. Masters commonly “kept the deck” for days on end. Early steamships, with their bridge deck bridging the paddle boxes to give the helmsman a view past the funnel, inherited this culture, and the open bridge persisted to the last century. My late friend Captain Ralf Rutkowsky, a salvage master with Bugsier, definitely thought that enclosed wheelhouses were sissified, and totally disapproved of ice class ships with enclosed bridge wings. It is possible that Ralf’s wartime experiences, which included being torpedoed and sunk twice by British submarines when he was on ore carriers making the Narvik run, had something to do with this; as we all know, an ore carrier sinks quickly. What he might have said about the aircraft cockpit style comfy chair with the chart display unit I can only imagine. I used to say that the typical British ship casualty – the nationally characteristic accident, took the form of: Ship takes first pilot. Master on bridge. Ship changes pilots. Master still on bridge. Ship arrives at berth. Master still on bridge. Completely cream crackered master takes over to put ship alongside. Ship hits berth. Now, it is all different… is it? I think it might not be. Chatting with friends onboard, I am told, not that fatigue is a thing of the past, but that people have got much better at filling the forms in. There is a reason why people prefer the deep, deep peace of the VLCC, the capesize and the long haul boxboat to the hurly burly of the handysize and the multipurpose ship. Right at the bottom of the pile is the feeder containership, the unglamorous workhorse with a silly number of port calls in crowded waters, a timetable, and a crew related to her tonnage. This is Titanic lifeboat syndrome. Unless I am very much mistaken, a ship’s minimum safe manning document, which is for most ships the lifetime maximum manning document, because the builders, in their admirable determination to get the tonnage on which dues are paid as small as possible, don’t include spare cabins, is built on the station list for berthing. And so we get the lowest form of seagoing vessel, the humble feeder containership, making high speeds in crowded waters with two mates and a master. The master has nothing to do in his oceans of spare time so he can easily stand a watch and let the mates, who can do cargo and navigation in a couple of minutes because they have disinformation technology to help them, catch up on their sleep. Word reaches me that amphetamine usage is high on these ships. I could not possibly comment. I can pass on the feelings of a friend who had got his ship all fast and everyone turned in after a long coastal passage when he had to wake them all up so that a nurse, who had been employed by his employers, could give then all drug and alcohol tests when they were not expecting them. Too right they weren’t."

Geneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference, is scheduled for April 28 and 29 at the Hotel President Wilson with close to 300 companies already signed up and organisers warning today to book now as special discount rates at six hotels across the city are fast disappearing. The global dry bulk event is on track to surpass last year’s 600 delegates figure and can report 58 brands have signed on as sponsors with 67 top names now confirmed as speakers spread across 13 sessions over two days. The agenda is now complete with an unparalleled roster of speakers set to take the stage. Delegates are excited Recently confirmed speakers include: Bas Van Steijnen, chief risk officer at Nova Marine Carriers, Maryana Yarmolenko Stober, associate general counsel EMEA at ADM, Robert Haggquist, charterer and decarbonisation lead at miner South32, Pierre-Francois Mahieu, Olam’s global wheat trader; Massimo Giovannini, managing partner of Monaco owner Trans Sea Transport; and Salvatore Castellano, freight decarbonisation manager at grains giant COFCO International. Geneva Dry brings together all elements of the commodities shipping sector to host the ultimate dry bulk shipping event. Split into sectors, panels will bring together analysts, financiers, miners, traders and shipowners to discuss where the markets are headed. Sessions include: Based on feedback from delegates to last year’s debut event, the organisers of Geneva Dry have added two specialist workshops to this year’s conference. On the morning of April 28, delegates will be able to attend both the Crewing In The Digital Age workshop as well as the Risk Management In Dry Bulk session prior to the main conference launching after lunch. The crewing workshop, sponsored by Inmarsat, is designed to give delegates ideas on how to harness and standardise the digital revolution sweeping through shipping, while the risk management hour, sponsored by Paratus, will offer important insights into fuel price risks, contract and counterparty risk, as well as geopolitical risk. “Delegates are excited,” commented V. Subramanian (Subra), a co-founder of Geneva Dry. “This event comes hot off the heels of the rising tide of EV-related shipping activities. Trump 2.0 adds to this with implications for shipping from pro-USA policies, tariffs and from peace and deals that could reshape the landscape for the global grains and minerals trade. Stakeholders across the commodity shipping industry are here to make this a must-attend event.” The full Geneva Dry agenda can beaccessed here.Geneva Dry registration, at just $780, can beaccessed here.Special Geneva Dry hotel room rates can befound here.

        "content": "The tide has turned for bunker sales and prices, an indication that global seaborne trade is on shakier ground this year. “Bunker prices tell the tale of a softening market,” broker BRS noted in a new report. As of yesterday, 0.5% very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) bunker prices had slid from $667 per ton to $524.50 year-on-year — a 20% drop. Meanwhile, 3.5% high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) bunker prices have held up relatively well, with the latest price at $469 a ton, a $30 decrease year-on-year. Accordingly, the HI-5 spread – VLSFO’s premium over HSFO – has narrowed to $55.50 a ton, driven by ample VLSFO supply East of Suez in the face of what BRS described as “lacklustre” demand. This is reflected in marine fuel sales, with data from Singapore and Fujairah showing an annual dip in VLSFO sales in February. The two port cities rank first and third in terms of bunker sales by volume, and combined saw a 9% drop year-on-year in sales last month. It’s understandable why some might feel inclined to hesitate for a while Looking at the gross tonnage of ships visiting Singapore, there’s been a clear year-on-year decline in January and February, led by the bulker and tanker segments. “I think it’s reasonable to say there’s been a slowdown in trade at the start of the year. And given the headaches associated with trying to get certainty around tariffs at the moment, it’s understandable why some might feel inclined to hesitate for a while,” Jack Jordan, managing editor ofShip&Bunker, a leading global bunkering title, toldSplashtoday. Seaborne trade volumes grew 2.1% to 12.6bn tonnes in 2024, according to Clarksons Research which is projecting a 1.2% growth in 2025 to 12.8bn tonnes. Tonne-mile growth grew at a 15-year high of 6% last year, but Clarksons suggests this could recalibrate to around 1% this year."

The contract, starting in the first quarter of 2026, is for a firm period of three years plus five one-year extension options. The firm deal, involving theIsland Innovatorsemisub rig, is worth about $330m and includes mobilisation, integrated services and modifications. Island Drilling said the new award would have positive implications for the region, including the employment of an additional 10 to 15 staff onshore in Bergen and Stavanger and between 80 and 100 new employees offshore. In related P&A contract awards, oilfield services player Archer revealed a deal with Equinor on Friday for the Snorre UPA and Heidrun B and C templates."

Bryce stepped up from chief strategy officer to take over from Bjørnar Iversen on an interim basis in January. Before joining Dolphin Drilling, he held senior and leadership roles at Awilco Drilling and Odfjell Drilling. Bryce is also the current chair of the British Rig Owners Association (BROA) and a supervisory board member of the UK Chamber of Shipping. “I see opportunity for Dolphin Drilling going forward. In the drilling rig sector that we currently operate, supply is at an all-time low following a prolonged period of downturn and scrapping. Rig demand, however, is now building due to a combination of macro and basin-specific reasons, creating an ever-tightening market segment,” said Bryce, noting that the Oslo-listed owner of three rigs is “uniquely positioned to capitalise on this emerging market imbalance and to create value”. Bryce added that under his leadership the company would initially center on “delivering an improved version of Dolphin Drilling”, with a high focus on cost control, organisational optimisation and maximising financial efficiency, but that it would also look to expand through mergers and acquisitions, “where synergies and economies of scale can further enhance our investment case”. The Aberdeen-headquartered company has also elected Ronny Bjørnådal as the new chairman, following the recent shift in ownership with Svelland Capital and B.O. Steen Shipping taking over shares from Øystein Stray Spetalen-controlled S.D. Standard ETC. Commenting on Bryce’s appointment, Bjørnådal said: “I am highly confident that Dolphin Drilling, under Bryce’s steady and experienced leadership, will foster a culture with strong customer focus embracing new business opportunities utilising our unique platform, supported by new strategic investors with a long-term view focusing on creating shareholder value.”"

He previously served as the CFO of Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers since 2013 and chairman of the general partner of the MLP KNOT Offshore Partners from 2015 to 2017. He was also the CFO of industrial investment company Umoe Group, managing director of Umoe Invest, partner of investment bank Clarksons Platou and business consultant at Accenture. “During the last seven and a half years, we have built from scratch a first-class LNG shipping company which is uniquely positioned with a substantial contract backlog and a fortress balance sheet. However, after a long stint as CEO, I do feel it’s about time for me to move on and pursue other opportunities,” Kalleklev said. The John Fredriksen-backed company has appointed its chief commercial officer Marius Foss as interim CEO. Kalleklev will remain in an advisory capacity until the end of the third quarter to ensure a smooth transition period. “I am very glad that the board has decided to appoint Marius Foss as interim CEO.

The fund bought stakes in the Nordseecluster and Thor offshore wind projects currently under construction. The agreed purchase price is approximately €1.4bn ($1.5bn). RWE remains in charge of construction and operations throughout the lifecycle of these offshore wind farms. The closing of the transaction is expected by the beginning of the third quarter of 2025. The Nordseecluster, located approximately 50 km north of the island of Juist, is being built in two phases. The first phase or Nordseecluster A has a 660MW capacity and will be fully commissioned in 2027. The second phase or Nordseecluster B has a 900MW capacity and will be operational in 2029. In total, Nordseecluster will generate enough green electricity to supply the equivalent of 1.6m German households. The Thor wind farm is Denmark’s largest offshore wind farm to date and is located approximately 22 km off the west coast of Jutland. Full commissioning is planned for 2027. With a total capacity of 1,080MW, it will be able to produce enough electricity to supply more than 1m Danish households. The projects will have long-term contracted revenues that provide stable cash flows and reduce risk to the projects. RWE currently operates 19 offshore wind farms and, in addition to Nordseecluster and Thor, it is constructing the Sofia offshore wind farm off the coast of England and OranjeWind off the coast of the Netherlands."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the Comité Maritime International (CMI) have recently launched an updated campaign to get governments to ratify urgent maritime treaties. CMI’s president, Ann Fenech, argues that today’s challenging international scene and geopolitical developments make it all the more important, now more than ever before, that the maritime law and regulations in different jurisdictions provide legal certainty and uniformity. The CMI was established in 1897 and is made up of 53 national maritime law associations and numerous industry players as consultative members. It has since its creation been responsible for drafting the vast majority of maritime law conventions. Fenech, a partner in Malta-based Fenech & Fenech Advocates, is a big believer in the primacy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as the industry’s global regulator, a position that has come under considerable pressure in recent years with Europe going its own way on green legislation and the return of Donald Trump to power in the US. “We are very strong supporters of the world maritime order needing a global regulator,” Fenech tellsMaritime CEO. “The maritime industry is by its very nature international and therefore my own personal view is that, notwithstanding the good and honourable intentions, one cannot expect regional regulators to be able to give effect to what is required to be adopted on an international level.” Regional regulations tend to result in the problem shifting from one region to the other, Fenech reckons. “For there to be a true level playing field, to achieve the highest possible standards on a worldwide basis, maritime regulation needs to be global and the IMO as well as other UN agencies tick the boxes,” she says. Getting maritime treaties ratified in 2025 is not easy, Fenech concedes. “The decision by any state to ratify a convention, meaning that what is in effect an international instrument becomes part and parcel of the law of the land, is to some extent dependent on how enthusiastic that particular state was during the deliberation of the convention prior to it being adopted,” she explains. The latest CMI draft, which went on to be adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations and signed in Beijing in September of 2023, the convention on the international effects of judicial sales of ships, was deliberated intently by dozens of state delegations, and in following 18 months CMI has achieved 32 signatories. “We are cautiously optimistic that the convention will be ratified during 2025,” Fenech says. “One of the reasons behind the success of this convention is that the convention does not attempt to disrupt the order of domestic law. It simply sets down the basic, most important principles, and that I believe has made it easier for most jurisdictions to adopt it.” Other international maritime conventions strongly encouraged to be ratified by governments by ICS and CMI as an urgent priority are the IMO Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks (Nairobi WRC), 2007, IMO 2010 Protocol to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS), 1996, the IMO Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (Hong Kong), 2009."

        "content": "Norway’s Knutsen Group has become the sole owner of offshore recruitment agency Level Offshore by buying out its partner DeepOcean for an undisclosed sum. Level Offshore was founded in 2018 as a 50/50 joint venture between DeepOcean and Knutsen to source temporary and permanent personnel for DeepOcean and has since broadened its customer and contractor base. “We have added many new customers and colleagues over the past years and believe that this ownership transition will enable us to further develop the business in the period to come,” said John Hauge, managing director of Level Offshore. As part of the deal, the outfit based in Haugesund, Norway, and Aberdeen, UK, will continue to provide personnel to DeepOcean, and there should be no impact on the company’s current operations. “Highly skilled and experienced offshore crew are essential to our operations, and we are certain that Level Offshore will continue to thrive under the stewardship of our long-term partner, Knutsen Group,” stated Ottar Mæland, DeepOcean’s chief operating officer. Commenting on taking full ownership of Level Offshore, Knutsen’s chief of finance, Geir Tore Henriksen, said: “The company has grown steadily every year and 2024 constituted another record-breaking year in terms of revenues, backlog and staffed personnel. We look forward to continuing to support the Level Offshore team in their future growth plans.”"

        "content": "Of the 50 largest container shipping lines in the world in the year 2000, only 24 are still in existence, according to new research from Denmark’s Sea-Intelligence. The capacity operated by these surviving carriers has grown dramatically. Overall, they have grown their collective capacity from 2.5m teu in 2000 to 26.7m teu in 2025, 983% capacity growth over 25 years, equalling 10% growth on average, every single year for 25 years. Sea-Intelligence also noted in its latest weekly report that apart from the 24 survivors, 26 carriers have entered into the top 50, some as new carriers and some that were outside the top 50 in the year 2000. These 26 newcomers in total operate 6% of the global fleet – versus the 84% operated by the survivors, Sea-Intelligence data shows. This is a market which has undergone extreme consolidation “Clearly, this is a market which has undergone extreme consolidation. But it has also been a 25-year journey, where the incumbents have clearly been better at adapting and growing in the market than the newcomers,” Sea-Intelligence noted. This week the global liner fleet will likely cross the 32m teu mark, according to data from Alphaliner. The container fleet has grown very fast this century. The 30m teu landmark was hit in June last year with a teu tsunami cascading out of yards in Asia delivering a record volume of newbuildings. It took the industry around 50 years to reach the 5m teu mark in 2001. By contrast, the leap from 20m teu to 30m teu was achieved in just seven years."

        "author": "Bojan Lepic",
        "content": "A federal judge has blocked an oil and gas lease sale in Gulf waters off the coast of Louisiana after finding that authorities did not take into account the impact of new offshore drilling on the highly endangered Rice’s whale. The ruling from a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will require the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM) to conduct additional environmental reviews before the lease sale proceeds. As it stands, the current lease sale is not canceled but will need more work before it goes ahead. The main issue is the habitat of the Rice’s whales, which live in Gulf waters and nowhere else and were discovered to be a distinct species only recently. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association estimates that there could be only 51 such whales left in the wild. This particular species of whale is particularly vulnerable to being struck by boats because it sleeps near the water’s surface, making it exceptionally hard to spot. Last month, BOEM said no to recommendations that ships slow down in areas where the whales are known to live and keep 500 meters away from any whale that might be a Rice’s whale. The court also ruled that BOEM did not adequately take into account the impact of greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the new oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. The lawsuit wasfiled in 2023by several environmental organisations – Healthy Gulf, Bayou City Waterkeeper, the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Sierra Club. The environmental groups have also challenged Gulf lease sale 261, which took place in December 2023, on the same grounds. So far, no decision has been made regarding that sale. Scott Lauermann, a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, said that the blocking of the lease sale was “yet another example of activists weaponizing the National Environmental Policy Act process in the courts to block critical access for exploration, underscoring how permitting reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy.” The Biden administration generally looked to limit offshore oil and gas drilling in federal waters, especially during his last month in office when an executive order was issued banning drilling in most federal waters. President Donald Trump, however, is doing everything in his power to reverse those decisions and is promising to “unleash American energy”, mostly through oil and gas. The Gulf of Mexico is the focus of those policies since around 97% of all offshore oil and gas production comes from there."

The world’s 10th and Taiwan’s second-largest liner operator is buying the trio currently under construction at Imabari Shipbuilding, with delivery set in 2028 and 2029. The transaction is valued between $339m and $360m, Yang Ming said in a stock exchange filing. The move follows late last year’s announcement that the company would bring in up to 13 newbuildings between 8,000 teu and 15,000 teu to replace its over-20-year-old 5,500 teu to 6,500 teu series. “The acquisition of the three 8,000 teu vessels, currently under construction, marks the first phase of the plan. The remaining portion will be carried out in accordance with internal procurement procedures to ensure mid- to long-term fleet stability and maintain service quality,” the company said. Prior to the latest deal, Yang Ming was listed with nearly 100 ships on the water, 59 of which are owned, and five 15,500 teu newbuilds delivering in 2026. The company has been gradually expanding its fleet with modern secondhand neo-panamax tonnage but had not signed for newbuildings since May 2023."

Town officials filed an appeal in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the decision by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to allow the SouthCoast Wind project to move forward despite admitting it would “tarnish Nantucket’s world-renowned views”. Nantucket officials argue that BOEM’s approval violates both the National Historic Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, laws that ensure federal agencies mitigate harm to historic sites before clearing projects. The town has enlisted Cultural Heritage Partners as special legal counsel for the lawsuit. The town also cited concerns that the incident at Vineyard Wind, when one of its massive turbine blades disintegrated and filled the town’s beaches with debris, could be repeated with other projects. “Our economy depends on heritage tourism. If people stop coming to Nantucket, that hurts our small businesses, our workers, and our community,” added Matt Fee, vice chair of the select board. Furthermore, the Nantucket-based ACK for Whales is asking the US Environmental Protection Agency to rescind permits granted to Vineyard Wind and New England Wind to construct and operate their offshore wind farms. The group filed a petition against Vineyard Wind earlier this week, asking the EPA to revoke the permit. The permit was granted in 2021 and amended in 2022. Vineyard Wind is currently under construction. Previously, the group filed a similar petition against New England Wind."

The first development phase of the project is completed and ready to receive CO2 from Norwegian and European industrial emitters. Operations are scheduled to start this summer, with the first CO2 transport and storage from Heidelberg Materials’ cement factory in Brevik, as part of the Longship project by the Norwegian government. The three companies recently reached a $717m investment decision to expand the project’s capacity following a commercial agreement with the Swedish energy provider, Stockholm Exergi, for cross-border transport and storage of up to 900,000 tonnes of biogenic CO2 annually. The second phase of Northern Lights will increase the transport and storage capacity from 1.5m to a minimum of 5m tonnes of CO2 per year. The new infrastructure will include additional onshore storage tanks, pumps, a new jetty and injection wells, and more CO2carriers. The expansion is expected to be completed and ready for operation in the second half of 2028."

Guo said Beijing “always firmly opposes using economic coercion and acts of hegemonic bullying that infringe upon and harm the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.” If the deal goes through, MSC, the world’s largest container line, would also top Drewry’s Global Terminal Operator (GTO) league table. MSC’s deal with BlackRock to take over Hutchison’s non-China terminals would see the carrier vault over the likes of PSA International, COSCO, APM Terminals and DP World on Drewry’s list to boast a combined volume of 78.3m teu. Hutchison Ports was the original global terminal operator, moving beyond its Hong Kong origins in the early 1990s to invest initially overseas in Felixstowe and Shenzhen, rapidly building up a portfolio that for many years was the largest network of container terminals in the world to go alongside the conglomerate’s other interests in property, telecoms, and retail. Over the past 20 years, CK Hutchison’s ports dominance has slipped from first to sixth spot among global terminal operators."

Costamare Bulkers, a separate entity set to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will be headed up by Costamare’s chief of finance, Gregory Zikos. Supporting Zikos at the outfit, which will own nearly 40 vessels in addition to the trading platform CBI consisting of around 50 chartered-in bulkers in the larger segments, will be Jens Jacobsen as chief commercial officer and Dimitris Pagratis as chief financial officer. Konstantinos Konstantakopoulos-led Costamare entered the dry sector by acquiring 16 vessels in 2021. The move to split up bulkers and containerships was revealed in February this year, aiming to deliver two separate, pure-play investment opportunities for different investors, a simplified structure, improved financial flexibility to pursue distinct operating priorities and enable the management of both companies to enhance focus on individualised opportunities. The Costamare brand will remain as a standalone boxship tonnage provider, with a fleet that currently counts nearly 70 vessels."

        "content": "Lower earnings and values for the dry bulk sector are on the way, with the biggest ships leading the way, writes Will Fray, a director at Maritime Strategies International. New analysis by Maritime Strategies International suggests a divergence between Fair Market Value (FMV) of dry bulk assets and their value on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) basis. Using its new market and vessel benchmarking tool SEASCAPE, MSI data indicates headwinds in the dry bulk sector, with the largest ships leading the charge. MSI’s view puts it somewhat at odds with the market which continues to place a premium on dry bulk assets. Despite much lower earnings toward the end of 2024 and into 2025, second-hand values have remained resilient. For comparison, monthly timecharter rates in January and February are 40% and 39% lower respectively when compared to 2024, whereas average 5-year-old prices are up by 7% and 1% by the same measure. This divergence between earnings and asset values reflects broader market dynamics, where very high newbuilding prices and long lead times for new vessel deliveries have inflated second-hand asset values as owners seeking to replenish fleets turn to the second-hand market instead of ordering new. MSI’s new ship SEASCAPE performance and asset value benchmarking platform can be used to easily generate current FMV and DCF values for single assets, fleets and entire sectors. The analysis illustrates the overall gap between current fleet-level FMV valuations and DCF values across the four main dry bulk segments, where both metrics represent the combined valuations of all vessels within each segment. All segments have higher fair market values in relation to their DCF, which suggests that vessels are overvalued when compared with MSI’s expectations for future earnings and values. The divergence between FMV and DCF is largest among the Capesize fleet, with vessel fair market valuations being 30% higher than MSI’s DCF value on average. This divergence suggests that market sentiment and forward-looking expectations are far more positive for this sector than for others, when compared to MSI’s Base Case. A key factor in explaining the divergence between FMV and DCF is MSI’s bearish forecast for newbuilding prices, for which MSI is unquestionably bearish. The SEASCAPE DCF calculations are based on a five-year investment over which period we expect a significant downturn in newbuilding prices which will place significant downward pressure on second-hand asset values. This is founded on several key factors that have been oft-repeated in the past. A strong orderbook (currently true) will be followed by rising shipyard capacity (true) and a rise in aggregate ship deliveries (true). This will ultimately undermine ship earnings, new contracting and newbuild prices and these are expected by MSI to unfold within the space of the current shipyard forward cover of three and a half years."

The news follows last week’s public hearing held by the US Trade Representative (USTR) looking into China’s dominance in shipbuilding, including a discussion on potential port call fees for Chinese-built vessels. “This could in effect create a two tier market for pricing, with perhaps Chinese vessels facing discounted prices versus Japanese and South Korean built vessels thereby obtaining premiums,” broker Gibson suggested recently. “It seems that USTR proposal has already started to affect the SnP market. This week, 13 bulk carriers changed ownership, with 10 built in Japan and only 3 in China,” Xclusiv Shipbrokers noted in its latest weekly report. One sale reported this week illustrates the trend towards buying non-Chinese-built tonnage. Hong Kong-based Cido Shipping is reportedly selling its Japanese-built Mitsui 56 design 55,650 dwtFortune Wing(built 2011) for around $16m, a substantial price compared to the sale of the one-year-olderCS Sonoma, built at Jiangsu Hantong, China, which was reported sold for $11.3m. This striking price gap raises the question of whether Chinese and non-Chinese asset values are set to diverge dramatically."

        "content": "In a move to improve seafarer well-being and tackle worsening labour shortages in the shipping industry, the Global Maritime Forum has launched new guidelines for improving life at sea. The international not-for-profit organisation said that it aimed to use its most recent Sustainable Crewing Guidelines to boost working conditions and alleviate the forecasted shortfall of 90,000 trained seafarers by 2026. The guidelines were created by the organisation’s All Aboard Alliance with a consortium of 12 major shipping companies based on feedback from over 400 seafarers. These will address critical improvements needed in areas such as abuse and harassment, work-life balance, and onboard facilities to boost workforce well-being and safety. The research carried out to inform the guidelines showed that 25% of seafarers experience harassment and bullying – rising to above 50% for female seafarers. 90% report having no weekly day off, and many are isolated with limited or no access to internet services at sea. Struggling with inexperience, fatigue, and insufficient resources, workers face an increased risk of accidents. Allianz estimates that 75% to 96% of accidents and incidents at sea involve human error, while Science Direct claims that 15% to 20% of all fatalities are linked to fatigue. Also, seafarer labour shortages have reached a 17-year high, and some major banks have indicated they could curb lending for shipowners who put seafarers’ welfare at risk. Following 115 interviews with female seafarers from 23 different nationalities, the All Aboard Alliance launched the Diversity@Sea pilot project in October 2023 to address the pain points identified in the conversations. Several co-designed solutions were tested in a ten-month pilot project on 12 pilot vessels providing daily feedback to assess the impact of these measures. Pilot leads from each of the involved companies worked closely together to translate the learnings from the seafarers into the nine Sustainable Crewing Guidelines: “These guidelines serve as a roadmap for shipping companies striving to improve employee well-being, and will also help seafarers and other stakeholders identify companies that take sustainability and social responsibility seriously,” said Mikael Skov, CEO at Hafnia and All Aboard Alliance co-chair. “We need a complete rethink of what good looks like when it comes to seafarer well-being. While existing measures like the Maritime Labour Convention provide minimum standards for working conditions at sea, we hope the Sustainable Crewing Guidelines can serve as inspiration to those companies that want to go beyond the bare minimum,” said Susanne Justesen, director of human sustainability at the Global Maritime Forum. The All Aboard Alliance will meet in April to explore the next steps for the guidelines, which aim to improve life at sea and drive mutual accountability."

        "content": "How can you plan for the future when the present is so uncertain, writes Pierre Aury? Scenario planning involves looking at different scenarios with associated assumptions and events. These scenarios are not forecasts but views of how the future could unfold. These scenarios only need to be plausible. The idea is that by analysing these scenarios, companies can better anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, helping them to react more effectively as real events happen, a bit like weekly fire drills onboard a ship help crew become better at fighting future fires. Scenario planning allows organisations to increase their preparedness for unexpected events. Scenario planning is especially useful in uncertain, complex and rapidly changing environments. Essentially, scenario planning is less about trying to predict the future and more about understanding the dynamics determining it. It is not really used in the shipping industry because, you know, shipping is only a matter of a simple supply and demand equation that crunching AIS big data will no doubt resolve. Sorry for not resisting that gentle bout of irony. Uncertain, complex, and a rapidly changing environment: this seems to describe perfectly our brave new world. On the geopolitical front, Donald seems to have problems getting Vladimir to bury the hatchet. Donald told us during the campaign that the war in Ukraine would be over within days of him moving into the Oval Office. An interesting case of scenario planning, especially as the EU is now clearly on a war path with Russia. Another geopolitical festering boil is to be found in the Middle East, with the situation getting even worse for the Palestinians and with now a more plausible scenario of massive US-Israel joint air strikes on Iran. What about the China-Taiwan situation? What about the plausibility of a US invasion of Canada and Greenland? On the economic front free trade has been heralded as the main reason for continuous world economic growth for many decades. The flip side of that coin is that free trade coming to a halt will translate into world GDP taking a big hit. With Donald threatening everybody with new tariffs, there is a plausible scenario of free trade coming to a halt. In fact, this scenario planning thing could soon turn into a very depressing exercise, an exercise in trying to fathom human stupidity. It seems that we humans collectively are throwing all manners of spanners in all the possible works. Maybe not all the works. Take the example of climate change. It seems that we have collectively grasped the severity of the problem and are all acting toward limiting the increase of temperature to a maximum of +1.5° C by 2100. Or so it seemed until governments made public their plan for being “resilient in a +4.0° C by 2100 world” like the French government did on March 10 this year. So at the same time laws are enacted to keep the world below +1.5°C by 2100 at huge costs to all, the governments behind these laws openly admit that the +1.5°C target will be missed by a country mile and that we should prepare ourselves for a world at +4.0°C in 2100. The French document sets the path to 2100 as follows: +1.7°C in 2024, +2.0°C in 2030, +2.7°C in 2050 and finally +4.0°C in 2100. Let us hope that the road toward a very hot 2100 will not see bigger waves with different shapes generated by more frequent and stronger storms otherwise, all the money spent to try to make shipping clean from an emission point of view will be lost with clean ships sinking for not being structurally strong enough."

Five steamers have been sold year to date: two for conversion and deployment in infrastructure projects and three for demolition. A record number of eight ageing steam turbine ships were sent to demo yards last year, and market sources suggest 2025 will see even more of the similar tonnage scrapped due to oversupply and reduced charterer interest."

        "content": "Donald Trump is expected to announce sweeping tariffs in a statement at the White House Rose Garden at 16:00 EST this afternoon, branding today as ‘Liberation Day’ in the latest economic shock to hit global seaborne trades in the opening months of his return to power. The scope and scale of the reciprocal country-based tariffs have yet to be divulged with the White House saying yesterday that they will take effect immediately. Despite their high profile, US trade tariffs – and retaliatory actions – are to date impacting directly only 1.5% of global seaborne trade volumes, according to the latest data from Clarksons Research, which notes that in the previous 2018-19 trade war tonne-miles were cut by only 0.5%. With US policy described by Clarksons as “fluid”, analysts at the world’s largest shipbroker concede there is potential for escalation, deepening of indirect impacts but also for new trade agreements to be made and for new trading patterns to evolve. “Projections of continued US ocean freight import strength to start Q2 may suggest that the prevailing uncertainty is leading many ocean shippers to continue to frontload until the tariff landscape becomes clear,” commented Judah Levine, head of research at box booking platform Freightos. China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index continued to rise in March, hitting a 12-month high, suggesting that the manufacturing sector has yet to be significantly impacted by tariffs in early 2025 Data from container analysts Linerlytica, however, paints a different picture of the situation. “Following a strong start in the first two months of the year, container cargo demand has fallen back in March with the volume rebound after the Chinese New Year failing to materialise. Current projections suggest full year container volumes will drop by 1.1% in 2025, as the muted cargo demand is expected to last through the summer peak season,” Linerlytica noted in its latest weekly report. How seriously tariffs alter trade flows has been brought into question. Tariffs have been a feature of Trump’s first administration as well as by his successor, Joe Biden and yet data from Linerlytica shows loaded container imports into the US outpaced exports by 2.4 times in 2024, a statistic that analysts at Linerlytica said in an earlier weekly report provides “clear evidence that import tariffs imposed since 2018 have been completely ineffective” in reducing the US trade imbalance. In the first Trump trade war seven years ago, the Chinese targeted US farmers and reduced imports of US grain. China is able to substitute this with more imports from Brazil, with minimal net tonne-mile impact. According to data from Clarksons Platou Securities, dry bulk, particularly grain and steel products, was the most impacted from the first Trump trade war with China, followed by LNG and LPG."

        "content": "A new report from the ITF Seafarers’ Trust (ITFST) and the World Maritime University (WMU) highlights the continuing absence of shore leave for the world’s seafarers. Analysing the data from 5,879 seafarers who responded to the ITFST’s Shore Leave Survey, WMU researchers concluded that more than a quarter of seafarers did not get any shore leave at all, and a third only got ashore once or twice during their entire contract, based on an average of 6.6 months onboard. The ITF Seafarers’ Trust opened the Shore Leave Survey in mid-2024 to test the concern that shore leave seemed to be progressively harder to access. Working with the team at the WMU to analyse the data, the resulting report seeks to give a true picture of the current levels of shore leave available to seafarers, how often it happened, how long it lasted, and to look at possible barriers. The report paints a sorry picture of access to shore leave and shore-based services. Officers were least likely to get shore leave, and seafarers on offshore vessels and tankers were the least likely to get ashore. Across all respondents, even when seafarers did get shore leave, 47% were able to spend less than three hours ashore and overall, 93.5% spent less than six hours ashore. The data shows that the barriers to shore leave are multiple and systemic: minimal crewing and high workloads, increasing inspections, port security and operational efficiencies leading to lack of time in port, lack of shore-based facilities and costs of transport. Katie Higginbottom, head of the ITF Seafarers’ Trust, said: “This survey confirms our fears. Seafarers are not getting shore leave because it hasn’t been prioritised as essential for crew wellbeing and the safety of the vessel. This is about setting the scene, and it is stark. We hope that the findings will promote discussion and acknowledgement that seafarers deserve a break from the vessel. Action must be taken to preserve the possibility of shore leave.” The report is clear that the problem is systemic and multifaceted. All stakeholders, from flag states to port states, agents to shipping companies and seafarers themselves, are urged by the report’s authors to collaborate to ensure that this vital component of life at sea is maintained and expanded. “All parties need to recognise that, unchecked, the current regime risks the extinction of shore leave as a viable concept reinforcing the strains on an already pressurised workforce,” stated a release from the trust."

        "content": "The phrase ‘the Beautiful Game’ is synonymous with football, but for American twin brothers Captain Grant Livingstone and Captain George Livingstone the words perfectly capture life at sea. Both brothers have spent decades working first as seafarers then as pilots, mastering the art of shiphandling, for which technical expertise meets instinct, experience and split-second decision making. To inspire other seafarers to view their profession as the Beautiful Game, the Livingstones have gathered insights from experienced mariners, asking them: ‘What were the most challenging elements to learn theoretically?’ and ‘What were the most challenging elements to execute practically?’. The result is a book –Shiphandling, the Beautiful Gamepublished by the Nautical Institute- that draws together a range of real-life scenarios and how they were handled, examining both successes and failures so that today’s mariners can learn from past events. Are we just slaves to debilitating emotions? Shiphandling, the Beautiful Gamehas been written to explain what differentiates a good shiphandler from a great one. The authors consider common challenges and how best to deal with the emotions that can affect the outcomes, sharing examples of how to master those emotions and avert disaster. The book explores the many ways the human brain assimilates experience and develops motor skills and cognitive deduction, turning shiphandling into an art form that can be enjoyed rather than a challenge to be endured. “In the last 20 years as a pilot, I witnessed a steep decline in fundamental ship handling skill among masters at sea,” Grant Livingstone toldSplash, something he reckons is partially down to the supersizing of many ship types. Livingstone began asking masters on every ship he piloted if they were experiencing ship handling challenges when handling their own vessel. The collective answer was a resounding affirmative, followed up with dozens of questions regarding fundamental ship handling, such as how and when to turn, how to slow and stop a vessel, how to anchor, and how to manage cross winds in narrow channels. “Collectively, they had very similar ship handling questions and challenges, and a review of accident reports at sea reflects that,” Livingstone recounted, helping explain many of the themes for the new book. However, there was another ship handling challenge that millions of mariners at sea have witnessed and experienced for generations: the debilitating effects that emotions like fear, anger, and anxiety have on critical thinking and decision making. “It was compelling to me. Are we just slaves to debilitating emotions? Surely not? So, I set out to become educated in managing emotions, resolving conflict, and managing pressure,” Livingstone said."

The first contract encompasses the engineering, procurement, construction, and installation activities for the repair of damaged subsea pipelines for an unnamed major client in the Middle East. The duration of the project is expected to last three years. The second contract is a limited notice to proceed by ExxonMobil’s Guyana arm, pending necessary government and regulatory approvals, and involves the EPCI of subsea structures, umbilicals, risers, and flowlines for the production facility and gas export system of the proposed Hammerhead project. The deal allows Saipem to start early work activities, namely detailed engineering and procurement, to ensure the earliest possible project startup in 2029, should the project receive the necessary government approvals. Hammerhead is located in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana at a water depth of around 1,000 m. Construction and installation work on the project is subject to government and regulatory approval as well as project sanction by ExxonMobil and its Stabroek block coventurers. Saipem will perform the operations by using a variety of construction and support vessels, includingSaipem FDS2. The logistics will be entirely executed and managed in Guyana through the Vreed-en-Hoop Shorebase yard. The project is expected to last four years."

The company completed the planning approval process for the offshore wind farm and received a positive decision from Germany’s Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) Construction of the €1.28bn ($1.38bn) wind farm is set to start this summer and is scheduled to end by 2026. The Windanker wind farm will have 21 monopiloletes and other foundation infrastructure installed by Spanish-based Windar. Upon completion of foundation installation, wind turbines, each operating at 15MW, will then be installed. Once operational, Windanker will supply green energy to more than 300,000 homes. Iberdrola also operates the 350MW Wikinger and the 476MW Baltic Eagle wind farms near Windanker. Together, these offshore wind farms form the so-called Baltic Hub. “With the approval of the BSH, we have come a big step closer to realising our Baltic Hub in the German Baltic Sea. In total, our three wind farms will have a total capacity of 1.1GW. We are continuing our growth course and clearly demonstrating Iberdrola’s commitment to the German renewable energy market,” said Felipe Montero, CEO of Iberdrola in Germany."

The offer, valued at about $1.3bn, comes at nearly a 32% premium to Tuesday’s closing share price in Copenhagen. APMH holds 47% of shares in Svitzer, which demerged from Maersk last April and started trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen. The bid by the parent company of the A.P. Moller Group, the owner of the Maersk brand, is backed by the belief that Svitzer’s listing had not resulted in the expected investor interest and that private ownership would better support the company’s continued growth and market position in a competitive and fragmented industry undergoing consolidation. “Since Svitzer was listed, the company has consistently delivered results above expectations. However, we have not seen this reflected in the valuation of the share, which means that the listing has not offered a foundation from which Svitzer can grow. We therefore believe that Svitzer is better supported through private ownership and that, with the financial support of A.P. Moller Holding, the company will be better positioned to strengthen its market position and capitalise on the opportunities in the market,” said Martin Larsen, CFO of APMH. The offer is subject to customary conditions and to APMH owning more than 90% of the total shares in Svitzer. The company said it has secured support for the offer from Svitzer’s board and shareholders, which, together with its existing shareholding represents 61% of Svitzer’s share capital. Tracing its roots back to 1833, Svitzer today has a fleet of about 450 vessels present in nearly 40 countries and over 140 ports and 40 terminals. The company would continue to operate independently with its current leadership and strategy, maintaining its name and brand."

        "content": "A new report from the ITF Seafarers’ Trust (ITFST) and the World Maritime University (WMU) highlights the continuing absence of shore leave for the world’s seafarers. Analysing the data from 5,879 seafarers who responded to the ITFST’s Shore Leave Survey, WMU researchers concluded that more than a quarter of seafarers did not get any shore leave at all, and a third only got ashore once or twice during their entire contract, based on an average of 6.6 months onboard. The ITF Seafarers’ Trust opened the Shore Leave Survey in mid-2024 to test the concern that shore leave seemed to be progressively harder to access. Working with the team at the WMU to analyse the data, the resulting report seeks to give a true picture of the current levels of shore leave available to seafarers, how often it happened, how long it lasted, and to look at possible barriers. The report paints a sorry picture of access to shore leave and shore-based services. Officers were least likely to get shore leave, and seafarers on offshore vessels and tankers were the least likely to get ashore. Across all respondents, even when seafarers did get shore leave, 47% were able to spend less than three hours ashore and overall, 93.5% spent less than six hours ashore. The data shows that the barriers to shore leave are multiple and systemic: minimal crewing and high workloads, increasing inspections, port security and operational efficiencies leading to lack of time in port, lack of shore-based facilities and costs of transport. Katie Higginbottom, head of the ITF Seafarers’ Trust, said: “This survey confirms our fears. Seafarers are not getting shore leave because it hasn’t been prioritised as essential for crew wellbeing and the safety of the vessel. This is about setting the scene, and it is stark. We hope that the findings will promote discussion and acknowledgement that seafarers deserve a break from the vessel. Action must be taken to preserve the possibility of shore leave.” The report is clear that the problem is systemic and multifaceted. All stakeholders, from flag states to port states, agents to shipping companies and seafarers themselves, are urged by the report’s authors to collaborate to ensure that this vital component of life at sea is maintained and expanded. “All parties need to recognise that, unchecked, the current regime risks the extinction of shore leave as a viable concept reinforcing the strains on an already pressurised workforce,” stated a release from the trust."

It’s a point evidenced by the fact that more than a third of the 58 sponsors of this year’s Geneva Dry – including Seaber – come from the maritime tech space. “Seaber differentiates itself by focusing on tangible ROI and quick, practical wins,” Sjöberg claims. The company offers a low-risk licensing structure, a four- to six-week go-live, and a focus on generating savings from day one. “Owners and operators don’t just like to understand ROI—they demand it,” Sjöberg says with his company regularly showcasing real-world case studies where Seaber has cut costs, improved utilisation, and streamlined scheduling to drive measurable financial impact. Geneva Dry is a unique space where tech meets commercial decision-makers Geneva Dry delegates can see for themselves the solutions Seaber has to offer with the company exhibiting as well as sponsoring. For those interested in a demo on April 28 or April 29 during the show,simply click here. “The dry bulk sector is increasingly demanding practical, results-driven solutions that seamlessly integrate into existing workflows,” Sjöberg says, adding: “Geneva Dry is a unique space where tech meets commercial decision-makers, and we’re eager to discuss the real pain points facing the industry.” Geneva Dry made its debut last year with around 600 delegates with organisers forced to issue a ‘Sold Out’ sign prior to the event. Working with the same hotel for the next edition, a new lay-out for the dry bulk showcase will allow for more delegates to attend later this month. Nevertheless, interested parties are urged to book today to ensure a pass as well as the discounted hotel rooms reserved across six hotels for attendees. As well as familiar sessions such as iron ore, coal, agri-commodities, minor bulks and dry decarbonisation, Geneva Dry 2025 features some new panels including a 50-minute special of forward freight agreements, a chartering spotlight, while digital efficiency drivers at port and then at sea will form the first two sessions on Day Two. Another highlight based on how much discussion there was on the topic at this year’s event will be a high-level discussion on electric vehicles and how they are supercharging dry bulk.

Overall, they have grown their collective capacity from 2.5m teu in 2000 to 26.7m teu in 2025, 983% capacity growth over 25 years, equalling 10% growth on average, every single year for 25 years. Sea-Intelligence also noted in its latest weekly report that apart from the 24 survivors, 26 carriers have entered into the top 50, some as new carriers and some that were outside the top 50 in the year 2000. These 26 newcomers in total operate 6% of the global fleet – versus the 84% operated by the survivors, Sea-Intelligence data shows. This is a market which has undergone extreme consolidation “Clearly, this is a market which has undergone extreme consolidation. But it has also been a 25-year journey, where the incumbents have clearly been better at adapting and growing in the market than the newcomers,” Sea-Intelligence noted. This week the global liner fleet will likely cross the 32m teu mark, according to data from Alphaliner. The container fleet has grown very fast this century. The 30m teu landmark was hit in June last year with a teu tsunami cascading out of yards in Asia delivering a record volume of newbuildings. It took the industry around 50 years to reach the 5m teu mark in 2001. By contrast, the leap from 20m teu to 30m teu was achieved in just seven years."

        "content": "Donald Trump is expected to announce sweeping tariffs in a statement at the White House Rose Garden at 16:00 EST this afternoon, branding today as ‘Liberation Day’ in the latest economic shock to hit global seaborne trades in the opening months of his return to power. The scope and scale of the reciprocal country-based tariffs have yet to be divulged with the White House saying yesterday that they will take effect immediately. Despite their high profile, US trade tariffs – and retaliatory actions – are to date impacting directly only 1.5% of global seaborne trade volumes, according to the latest data from Clarksons Research, which notes that in the previous 2018-19 trade war tonne-miles were cut by only 0.5%. With US policy described by Clarksons as “fluid”, analysts at the world’s largest shipbroker concede there is potential for escalation, deepening of indirect impacts but also for new trade agreements to be made and for new trading patterns to evolve. “Projections of continued US ocean freight import strength to start Q2 may suggest that the prevailing uncertainty is leading many ocean shippers to continue to frontload until the tariff landscape becomes clear,” commented Judah Levine, head of research at box booking platform Freightos. China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index continued to rise in March, hitting a 12-month high, suggesting that the manufacturing sector has yet to be significantly impacted by tariffs in early 2025 Data from container analysts Linerlytica, however, paints a different picture of the situation. “Following a strong start in the first two months of the year, container cargo demand has fallen back in March with the volume rebound after the Chinese New Year failing to materialise. Current projections suggest full year container volumes will drop by 1.1% in 2025, as the muted cargo demand is expected to last through the summer peak season,” Linerlytica noted in its latest weekly report. How seriously tariffs alter trade flows has been brought into question. Tariffs have been a feature of Trump’s first administration as well as by his successor, Joe Biden and yet data from Linerlytica shows loaded container imports into the US outpaced exports by 2.4 times in 2024, a statistic that analysts at Linerlytica said in an earlier weekly report provides “clear evidence that import tariffs imposed since 2018 have been completely ineffective” in reducing the US trade imbalance. In the first Trump trade war seven years ago, the Chinese targeted US farmers and reduced imports of US grain. China is able to substitute this with more imports from Brazil, with minimal net tonne-mile impact. According to data from Clarksons Platou Securities, dry bulk, particularly grain and steel products, was the most impacted from the first Trump trade war with China, followed by LNG and LPG."

        "content": "US president Donald Trump has slapped additional tariffs of 34% on imports from China, also hitting emerging manufacturing powerhouses like Vietnam and Cambodia hard, while targeting European Union imports with 20% tariffs, and adding a baseline of 10% on most goods imported to the US. As markets were sent into a tailspin, the EU and China vowed retaliation against the levies. US tariffs are a “major blow” to the world economy and the EU is preparing countermeasures that will apply if negotiations fail, EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. “The global economy will massively suffer, uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism,” she said. China’s commerce ministry called for Washington to “immediately cancel” the new tariffs, warning they “endanger global economic development” and would hurt US interests and international supply chains. It called for dialogue and added: “There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism.” There is no way out for protectionism Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said Trump’s tariffs were larger than anticipated, with the average US tariff rate now at just under 25%, levels not seen since the 1930s. “If they stay in place, US inflation likely to head well over 4%,” Shearing warned, adding that China and other Asian economies have been hit hardest with the tariff rate on China now north of 60%. The tariffs announced yesterday will not apply to crude oil, natural gas, or refined products. “While it can be argued that this outcome is better than feared for the energy commodity sectors, the tariffs raise concerns about GDP growth, as a slowdown in economic growth could signal weakening demand for shipping,” suggested a shipping markets update from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB), a Swedish bank. In the first Trump trade war seven years ago, the Chinese targeted US farmers and reduced imports of US grain. China is able to substitute this with more imports from Brazil, with minimal net tonne-mile impact. According to data from Clarksons Platou Securities, dry bulk, particularly grain and steel products, was the most impacted from the first Trump trade war with China, followed by LNG and LPG. “For dry bulk, we anticipate retaliatory tariffs against the US will affect cargo volumes more than the US’ own tariffs announced on 2 April,” broker Braemar suggested in a note to clients today."

        "content": "Floater specialist BW Offshore and Prio Comercializadora, previously known as Petro Rio, have settled an arbitration case dating back to 2021. In September 2021, Prio, then Petro Rio, filed a request for arbitration concerning the charter and services agreement for the FPSOPolvoagainst BW Offshore. At the time, the Brazilian firm claimed that it overpaid the hire and requested $31m as compensation, including arbitration costs and fees. In October 2021, BW Offshore responded by filing counterclaims primarily for unpaid invoices and demobilisation costs for approximately $30m. Back in 2023, the company claimed that it expected a resolution to this case either before the end of 2024 or in early 2025. In an Oslo Bors filing on Thursday, BW Offshore stated that the arbitration between the two was settled before the issuance of a final award. The two agreed to settle the case, led before the London International Court of Arbitration, via a confidential settlement agreement. As a result, BW Offshore will be awarded approximately $36m, which includes the costs of the arbitration."

        "content": "US president Donald Trump has slapped additional tariffs of 34% on imports from China, also hitting emerging manufacturing powerhouses like Vietnam and Cambodia hard, while targeting European Union imports with 20% tariffs, and adding a baseline of 10% on most goods imported to the US. As markets were sent into a tailspin, the EU and China vowed retaliation against the levies. US tariffs are a “major blow” to the world economy and the EU is preparing countermeasures that will apply if negotiations fail, EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. “The global economy will massively suffer, uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism,” she said. China’s commerce ministry called for Washington to “immediately cancel” the new tariffs, warning they “endanger global economic development” and would hurt US interests and international supply chains. It called for dialogue and added: “There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism.” There is no way out for protectionism Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said Trump’s tariffs were larger than anticipated, with the average US tariff rate now at just under 25%, levels not seen since the 1930s. “If they stay in place, US inflation likely to head well over 4%,” Shearing warned, adding that China and other Asian economies have been hit hardest with the tariff rate on China now north of 60%. The tariffs announced yesterday will not apply to crude oil, natural gas, or refined products. “While it can be argued that this outcome is better than feared for the energy commodity sectors, the tariffs raise concerns about GDP growth, as a slowdown in economic growth could signal weakening demand for shipping,” suggested a shipping markets update from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB), a Swedish bank. In the first Trump trade war seven years ago, the Chinese targeted US farmers and reduced imports of US grain. China is able to substitute this with more imports from Brazil, with minimal net tonne-mile impact. According to data from Clarksons Platou Securities, dry bulk, particularly grain and steel products, was the most impacted from the first Trump trade war with China, followed by LNG and LPG. “For dry bulk, we anticipate retaliatory tariffs against the US will affect cargo volumes more than the US’ own tariffs announced on 2 April,” broker Braemar suggested in a note to clients today."

        "content": "Stena Line has unveiled a new concept roro vessel design. Dubbed the Stena Futuro, the vessel’s designers claim the ship can slash energy usage by at least 20%. “The mission is to develop the most efficient and competitive vessel possible for a specific cargo capacity, using today’s available technology. The goal is for the vessel to have the lowest fuel consumption on the market,” said Nicolas Bathfield, project manager at Stena Teknik, who has been involved in developing the concept. The sleek 240 m long vessel will have hybrid propulsion, batteries and engines with low fuel consumption that can run on several different fuels. Solar panels will also contribute to the ship’s electricity needs. The hull of Stena Futuro will also be equipped with an air lubrication system, where small air bubbles are released beneath the waterline to reduce friction between the vessel and the water. A waste heat recovery system will make it possible to reuse the hot exhaust gases from the ship’s engines to meet other onboard heating needs as well as supporting electric power generation. The developed concept for Stena Futuro also includes four 40 m tall wing sails, which can be retracted when needed. “We aim to help lead our industry in achieving the global climate goals. We work toward this every day in our ongoing operations, but we also need to be at the forefront in developing tomorrow’s vessels. The Stena Futuro concept is an important step in that direction,” said Niclas Mårtensson, CEO of Stena Line."

Like in the Baltic, Taiwan has faced multiple attacks on its subsea infrastructure in recent months, largely from merchant ships dragging their anchors. The island blacklisted 52 Chinese-owned ships in January while Taiwan’s National Security Bureau has said ships which have previously been found to misreport information will be put on a list of ships for priority inspection at ports. Moreover, if these ships enter within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan’s coast and are close to where undersea cables are, the coast guard will be dispatched to board them and investigate. A ship accused at the end of February of damaging cables off Taiwan had a simple way of changing identity.

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Shipping stocks remain under severe pressure today as the world comes to terms with the immensity of Wednesday’s tariff announcements from US president Donald Trump. The average US tariff rate has now been set at just under 25%, levels not seen since the 1930s and the days of the Great Depression. The Trump tariffs resulted in the second biggest wipeout of US stock market values in history in dollar terms, $3.1trn, yesterday with stock markets in Asia-Pacific continuing to trade down today. The scale of the tariffs makes comparisons with Trump’s earlier tariff tactics eight years ago irrelevant, however, some in shipping are pinning their hopes to Trump admitting yesterday he is open to lowering tariffs if other countries can offer something “phenomenal”, signalling the White House is willing to negotiate despite the insistence of some top officials. The container sector will be affected the most “There is really no comparing Trump’s trade war this year with the steps he took starting in 2017,” analysis by container booking platform Freightos suggested, adding: “This time, the tariffs are so broad and so high that there are few duty-free alternatives.” Most economists are now predicting slower and modest US GDP growth, an increased likelihood of recessions in the US and beyond, and therefore a possible contraction of global trade as well. “Global shipping is expected to be stifled as a result of the broader tariffs,” argued US investment bank Jefferies in a note to clients yesterday. Jefferies said the container sector was likely to be the most “sensitive” to tariffs, a point of view shared by BIMCO’s chief shipping analyst, Niels Rasmussen. “From a shipping perspective, the container sector will be affected the most. Many tanker and dry bulk commodities have so far been exempted from the tariff increases but most goods shipped in containers will face import tariff increases,” Rasmussen said. In a scenario where the tariff increases would result in zero growth in US container imports, it would reduce global container volume growth by 0.5 percentage points, according to BIMCO estimates. In related container news, speculation is growing that French liner CMA CGM’s big plans for investment in the US might be put on hold. On March 6, CMA CGM’s chairman Rodolphe Saadé went to the White House (pictured), unveiling a $20bn planned investment into the US over the coming four years. Now, however, in the wake of Trump’s 20% tariffs on European Union nations, Saadé’s friend, Emanuel Macron, the French president, has hinted such investments should be reviewed. “Future investments, investments announced in the last weeks, should be suspended for a time for as long as the situation with the United States is not clarified,” Macron told a group of French politicians and business leaders yesterday. Wednesday’s tariffs are yet another example of the colossal, upending change brought about in the opening months of the second Trump administration, something broker BRS has neatly encapsulated below. Up next for global shipping, Trump will make a decision on whether to penalise Chinese-built tonnage calling at US ports."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "The trend towards high-frequencysensor data is increasing,but investment decisions require a truly rigorous approach, writes Christian Rae Holm, the CEO of Coach Solutions. Data continues to represent value in the pursuit of vessel energy efficiency, and as the value of actionable information increases, the focus is increasingly on using high-frequency sensors to drive decision-making. As always in shipping, the truth is not quite so simple. The welter of information that high frequency sensors can provide creates an opportunity for applications that can work at this cadence. For the majority of the fleet, however, the emphasis is still on the ability to capture high-quality, low-frequency data and blend the two into a robust combination. Low-frequency data is not just for simple analysis tasks. Used in conjunction with complex digital vessel models, it can provide high-quality insights that reflect the specifics of the ship being analysed. This core data can be combined with a sensor feed to generate deeper insights and deliver a smaller margin for error and a larger zone of confidence. The cases where high frequency data will be used by itself in voyage optimisation are few. High frequency data can increase the resolution of low frequency data and remove the suspicion of manipulation. In practice, however, data from the ship is less likely to drive more efficient route optimisation than, say, a really good weather forecast. Data gathered from the ship comes into play in informing the model of the ship’s fuel consumption. This will help the operator understand that the speed and consumption calculation is close to the actual and where savings can be achieved. The investment case Part of the challenge lies in being able to benchmark a fleet that has been assembled over a period of time from new and second-hand sources. Even ships delivered as ‘sisters’ can sail differently, and the performance of previously-loved tonnage can be hard to predict. Making a start in collecting performance data across a disparate fleet is a daunting prospect, requiring fleet managers to establish baselines from fragmented, sometimes chaotic data sets. Making once-in-a-lifecycle investment in retrofit energy efficiency technology is too big a project to base the business case on fuel consumption modelling alone. It will require a full-scale verification process and ideally a pilot, which can be used to verify the potential savings. Methodologies and joint industry projects designed to establish performance claims are emerging, but it can be hard to obtain any kind of standardised data on the efficiency of energy saving devices such as wind assistance or air lubrication. This is due to the complexity of the systems, the effectiveness of the installation, and the actual conditions the vessel will subsequently encounter. When considering installation of fuel-saving devices, the need to ‘prove’ the anticipated savings requires measurements that have a smaller degree of uncertainty than the potential targeted savings. Since many vendors claim a spread of three to five per cent potential fuel savings, a higher level of accuracy is needed to achieve modelling for any claim approaching the upper band. We cannot rely on low frequency data alone in these cases, but need to combine the results with high frequency data to prevent the savings being lost in the inaccuracy band. But high frequency data on its own is not enough, unless the aim is only to establish hull performance. The ‘global’ picture requires analysis of emissions and voyage data for the voyage management system, so a combination with low-frequency data is required. To make savings that can actually reduce fuel consumption in a demonstrable way requires a baseline of reliable, low-frequency data, ideally with a layer of high-speed sensor data to provide additional context. Combining the two can reduce the level of uncertainty and increase the reliability of results for an investment case, but this is an analysis the owner needs to have in place before the installation decision is taken – and afterwards for verification purposes. Long or short? The ability to handle both high and low frequency data is what will set a long-term partner apart from a short-term provider in the vessel performance space. The need for high-quality results still applies, and that goes for the choice of vendor as much as the types of data you are collecting. Since we founded Coach, we have consistently shown that low-frequency data can return high quality results, but the next frontier is clearly combining this with high frequency inputs, such as that provided by our parent Kongsberg. Despite the attention focused on improving energy efficiency, gathering the data required to perform the necessary analysis is something most companies do not have the resources to do by themselves. But vessel owners and managers – not to mention solutions vendors – can take steps to validate claims of fuel saving and power reduction and move the industry forward together. All they need is access to expertise in data of all frequencies and an open mind."

        "content": "How can you plan for the future when the present is so uncertain, writes Pierre Aury? Scenario planning involves looking at different scenarios with associated assumptions and events. These scenarios are not forecasts but views of how the future could unfold. These scenarios only need to be plausible. The idea is that by analysing these scenarios, companies can better anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, helping them to react more effectively as real events happen, a bit like weekly fire drills onboard a ship help crew become better at fighting future fires. Scenario planning allows organisations to increase their preparedness for unexpected events. Scenario planning is especially useful in uncertain, complex and rapidly changing environments. Essentially, scenario planning is less about trying to predict the future and more about understanding the dynamics determining it. It is not really used in the shipping industry because, you know, shipping is only a matter of a simple supply and demand equation that crunching AIS big data will no doubt resolve. Sorry for not resisting that gentle bout of irony. Uncertain, complex, and a rapidly changing environment: this seems to describe perfectly our brave new world. On the geopolitical front, Donald seems to have problems getting Vladimir to bury the hatchet. Donald told us during the campaign that the war in Ukraine would be over within days of him moving into the Oval Office. An interesting case of scenario planning, especially as the EU is now clearly on a war path with Russia. Another geopolitical festering boil is to be found in the Middle East, with the situation getting even worse for the Palestinians and with now a more plausible scenario of massive US-Israel joint air strikes on Iran. What about the China-Taiwan situation? What about the plausibility of a US invasion of Canada and Greenland? On the economic front free trade has been heralded as the main reason for continuous world economic growth for many decades. The flip side of that coin is that free trade coming to a halt will translate into world GDP taking a big hit. With Donald threatening everybody with new tariffs, there is a plausible scenario of free trade coming to a halt. In fact, this scenario planning thing could soon turn into a very depressing exercise, an exercise in trying to fathom human stupidity. It seems that we humans collectively are throwing all manners of spanners in all the possible works. Maybe not all the works. Take the example of climate change. It seems that we have collectively grasped the severity of the problem and are all acting toward limiting the increase of temperature to a maximum of +1.5° C by 2100. Or so it seemed until governments made public their plan for being “resilient in a +4.0° C by 2100 world” like the French government did on March 10 this year. So at the same time laws are enacted to keep the world below +1.5°C by 2100 at huge costs to all, the governments behind these laws openly admit that the +1.5°C target will be missed by a country mile and that we should prepare ourselves for a world at +4.0°C in 2100. The French document sets the path to 2100 as follows: +1.7°C in 2024, +2.0°C in 2030, +2.7°C in 2050 and finally +4.0°C in 2100. Let us hope that the road toward a very hot 2100 will not see bigger waves with different shapes generated by more frequent and stronger storms otherwise, all the money spent to try to make shipping clean from an emission point of view will be lost with clean ships sinking for not being structurally strong enough."

Shell made a final investment decision for the Sparta project in December 2023. Shell operates the project with a 51% stake, while its partner Equinor holds 49%. At peak production, the project will produce approximately 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It holds an estimated discovered recoverable resource volume of 244 million boe. The project will be Shell’s 15th deepwater host in the Gulf of Mexico and is currently scheduled to begin production in 2028. Sparta will use previously used designs and replicate about 95% of Whale FPU’s hull and 85% of its topsides."

        "content": "After US president Donald Trump imposed tariffs on countries across the world earlier this week, it did not take much time for Beijing to return the favour. The Chinese authorities said on Friday that the country would impose 34% tariffs on all imports from the US starting from April 10. This is on top of the tariffs already in effect. All cargo loaded on ships before April 10 are not subject to the new tariff if the cargo arrives before May 13. The tariffs are identical to the ones the US imposed on China on Wednesday. Before that Trump added two tranches of 10% additional duties on all Chinese imports, effectively subjecting Chinese goods entering the US to 54% tariffs. China’s State Council Tariff Commission explained that the recent moves made by the US were not “in line with international trade rules” and that they “seriously undermine China’s legitimate rights and interests “. The Commission described Trump’s tariff policies as “a typical unilateral bullying practice”. The new tariffs by China was accompanied by adding 11 US companies to an “unreliable entity list” such as drone manufacturers. Beijing also put export controls on an additional 16 US firms to prohibit the export of Chinese dual-use items. “We expect that these will negatively impact trade between both economies and hurt their economic growth,” said Niels Rasmussen, chief analyst at shipping association BIMCO, adding that the US agricultural sector is expected to be significantly impacted, as it accounted for 23% of exports worth $18.2bn. For the dry bulk side, China’s tariffs are primarily expected to impact panamax and supramax segments. Rasmussen noted that as the largest exported commodities, grains, coal and petcoke become comparatively more expensive, China will likely turn to other markets such as Brazil, Ukraine, Indonesia, Russia, Australia and Mongolia. Tanker trades, however, may not see as great of an impact as China can turn to OPEC and Brazil to replace US volumes, which should also be able to find other willing buyers, he explained. Rasmussen also warned that there is a risk that the compound effect of all recent tariff increases will cause economic activity to slow and “we may therefore see negative impacts that stretch beyond those caused directly by the tariff increases”."

The 714MW wind farm is located 43 km off the coast of Suffolk in the East of England and has been powering Britain with green energy since 2021. With 102 turbines, it is among the top 10 biggest operational wind farms in the world, generating enough clean power to electrify around 700,000 homes a year. This stake in East Anglia One was bought from Macquarie Asset Management on behalf of Vector, Octopus’ offshore wind fund, which invests in fixed and floating offshore wind and pioneering tech to reduce costs. The other owner of the wind farm is an Iberdrola subsidiary, ScottishPower Renewables. This marks Octopus Energy’s fourth investment in a British offshore wind farm and its seventh in Europe. It builds on its stakes in Hornsea One, Lincs and Walney Extension in Britain, Butendiek in Germany, and Borssele V and Borssele III & IV in the Netherlands. Octopus is also looking to enter France’s offshore wind tender and develop a brand-new offshore wind farm in partnership with Skyborn Renewables. “The sector has become a vital pillar of our energy system over the past years, and this investment will help to turbocharge this clean technology further, bringing cheaper, greener power to people across the country,” said Zoisa North-Bond, CEO of Octopus Energy Generation."

Court records indicate thatSolong‘s owner, Ernst Russ from Germany, filed a legal claim at the Admiralty Court on Thursday against “the owners and demise charterers” of theStena Immaculate. The case is the latest to be filed at the court in London after a separate legal claim was lodged at the same court on Monday by the tanker’s owner and manager, Stena Bulk and Crowley, against Ernst Russ’s shipowning entity, MS Solong Schiffahrtsgesellschaft. Details about either claim have yet to emerge, but a spokesperson for Ernst Russ said the move represents a “usual process for large maritime casualties and another step in working towards the conclusion of this tragic incident”. On Monday, Ernst Russ also confirmed that it had set up a fund ahead of any verified legal claims against the company following the incident, which saw the 140-m-long, 800 teu boxship hit the 183-m-long tanker while anchored near Hull on March 10. Meanwhile, an interim report by the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) showed that neither vessel had a dedicated lookout on the bridge at the time of the collision. The report confirmed thatStena Immaculatewas at anchor as directed by ABP Vessel Traffic Service Humber and was struck at 09.47 hrs local time bySolongwhile travelling at 16 knots in patchy conditions with visibility varying between 0.25 and 2.0 nm. The incident resulted in one crewmember on theSolong, Mark Pernia, missing and presumed dead. He was reported to be in the forward area of the ship at the time of impact. The remaining crew on both ships evacuated to lifeboats and were subsequently recovered by local boats and emergency responders. Vladimir Motin, theSolong‘s captain, has been charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. The MAIB report said the captain remained on watch until shortly before 23.00 hrs before handing over to the second officer and going to bed. He returned the bridge at 07.00 hrs and “took over the watch as the lone watchkeeper”, the report added."

        "content": "Donald Trump’s 10% tariffs across all countries came into effect Saturday, with stock markets in Asia taking another battering today. Wednesday will see the much higher so-called reciprocal US tariffs come into effect with listed shipping companies facing up to the realities of an impending global trade war. Shipping equities came under intense pressure last week, with the average stock covered by Jefferies, an American investment bank, dropping 15.5%. No sector was spared as tankers, containers, dry bulk, LNG and LPG were sold off. “No shipping segment can escape the negative impacts of a global recession. So long as the equity markets grapple with the risk of an economic slowdown, shipping equities are likely to remain pressured,” Jefferies said in a note to clients today. Globalisation is facing one of its toughest stress tests Discussing last Wednesday’s tariff announcements at the White House, broker Braemar suggested: “The date April 2, 2025, may well go down in the history books, as globalization faces one of its toughest stress tests in the months ahead.” On Friday, China announced a retaliatory tariff increase of 34% on all US imports. These are in addition to tariffs implemented in February and March, focusing on goods such as grains, coal, LNG and crude oil. Data from Clarksons Research shows volumes freshly tariffed this year have increased to 3.7% of all seaborne trade, now tracking at 460m tonnes out of a total of 12.6bn tonnes. “Direct exposure is increasingly material in some shipping segments (e.g. cars) and the indirect negative impacts on the world economy are gathering pace,” Clarksons noted in its most recent weekly report. No shipping segment can escape the negative impacts of a global recession The US accounts for 5% of all seaborne imports and 7% of seaborne exports. Most analysts believe that the container sector will be among the worst hit from the trade tit-for-tat that Trump has unleashed. Container volumes are very exposed with Clarksons tracking 11% of global container trade volumes as now tariffed. In the 2018-19 US-China trade war, container-tariffed trade reached 5% of global volumes and led to a 0.5% drag on global box trade. “From a scenario planning perspective, stakeholders should read up on the financial crisis impact in 2009, where we saw a -9% drop in global container volumes and a full-on collapse in freight rates. In the face of such a scenario, the Red Sea crisis’ absorption of capacity will not do much to stem such a crash,” Sea-Intelligence, a Danish container shipping consultancy, advised in a new report issued yesterday. The car trade where 26% of seaborne volumes are now tariffed, according to data from Clarksons, is also highly exposed. Around 14% of LPG and 55% of ethane trade have become highly exposed from China’s retaliatory action. In other major sectors, direct impacts look more limited according to Clarksons with only 2% of the dry bulk trade tariffed, 1% of LNG, and less than 1% of oil. In 2024, China was the third-largest importer of US exports measured by value, accounting for 7% of US exports. Chemicals, computer and electronic products, agricultural products, transportation equipment and oil and gas made up 18%, 14%, 13%, 13% and 9% of the value of US exports to China, according to data from BIMCO. “We expect that these will negatively impact trade between both economies and hurt their economic growth. The US agricultural sector is expected to be significantly impacted, as it exported $18.2bn worth of goods to China, or equivalent to 23% of US exports,” commented BIMCO’s chief shipping analyst, Niels Rasmussen."

In late 2023, Greek shipping tycoon George Economou took about a 5.4% stake in Genco and instigated a boardroom battle from which he ultimately withdrew while offloading the company’s stock at a profit. Genco’s market cap stands at about $578.5m. The company logged a profit of $76.4m or $1.77 and $1.75 basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively, in 2024."

        "content": "Norwegian chemical tanker owner and operator Odfjell is forging ahead with fleet transition plans that could likely see up to a dozen additional newbuildings join the fleet in the future. The Oslo-listed company revealed in its annual report it is considering a potential construction of between six and 12 large stainless steel units to replace part of its ageing vessels. “While these vessels are not yet committed or ordered, we anticipate commencing construction in 2027, contingent on shipyard capacity and market conditions,” Odfjell said. The company estimated the initiative could potentially cost between $500m and $900m over the next three to eight years, subject to vessel configurations, shipyard availability, pricing and market considerations. Odfjell noted, however, that the investment on its part may also be lower if some of the newbuilds are brought in via long-term time charters. “We recognise that the replacement of our supersegregators will need to form part of our owned and controlled fleet,” the company said, adding that these vessels, which feature multiple segregations and stainless steel tanks, will incorporate the latest in energy efficiency and fuel technology, but that their cost remains difficult to estimate due to their configurations. At the end of 2024, Odfjell’s chemical tanker fleet counted 71 vessels, including 46 owned or leased, four on bareboat charters, 14 on time charters, and three pool vessels. The company has 18 newbuildings on order, of which 16 are contracted under long-term time charters with purchase options, and two will be owned. Of these vessels, one is under construction in China, and the remaining 17 are being built in Japan for delivery between the second quarter of 2024 and 2028. In March this year, the group also sealed a deal to bring in two 35,000 dwt stainless steel vessels on time charter for eight years each. These should join the fleet during the fourth quarter of 2027 and the second quarter of 2028. Odfjell has committed to reduce its carbon intensity by 57% by 2030, compared to 2008 levels, and to have a climate-neutral fleet from 2050. In line with these targets, the company said it would only order net-zero-capable ships."

        "author": "Bojan Lepic",
        "content": "France is currently on course to miss its offshore wind installation target unless permitting and a more favourable investment climate is created, a new research claims. The Institute for Energy Economics for Financial Analysis (IEEFA) claimed in its new paper that France has a very low share (11%) of its electricity demand covered by wind power, while offshore wind is just 1%. Since 2011, France has carried out numerous tenders to develop offshore wind, but projects from only one tender round have started operations. Currently, only 1.5GW of the 8.65GW of capacity awarded or due to be awarded in tenders is operational. It took the winning bidders 10 years to install the first 500MW and a further two years for the next gigawatt. This delay, however, is not due to construction issues but rather administrative delays, legal challenges, and opposition from fishing and tourism industries, as well as local communities. Capex for offshore wind farms is typically €3-€5m/MW ($1.68m-$2.8m/MW), depending on factors including site-specific conditions, technology and market dynamics. The study found that unless it accelerates deployment, France might only have 3GW of operational offshore wind by 2032, leaving it far off track to achieve the government’s target of 18GW by 2035. The 2.4 GW of capacity awarded in tenders between 2019 and 2022 is not expected to be commissioned until 2028-2032, as projects are still at the feasibility study stage. France’s first three offshore wind parks have capex costs at the high end of the range despite being based on the more advanced seabed technology, highlighting the need to reduce supply chain logistics costs and achieve economies of scale. One of the primary reasons for the slow development of offshore wind in France is the complex and lengthy regulatory and administrative processes. The French permit system for offshore wind is long and bureaucratic, involving multiple layers of approval from various government agencies. France launched its first offshore wind tender in 2011, but as of 2021, not a single turbine was operational. Local communities, environmental groups and the fishing industry have raised concerns about the visual impact of wind turbines, potential harm to marine ecosystems and disruptions to fishing activities. Simultaneously, France’s energy policy has historically been dominated by nuclear power, which accounts for about 75-80% of the country’s electricity generation. To compare, under an optimistic scenario, France could have 3GW of operational offshore wind by 2027, which is equivalent to two European pressurised nuclear reactors. France has 58 such reactors in operation. To catch up with its neighbours, IEEFA claims that France must address these issues by streamlining regulatory processes, improving stakeholder engagement, diversifying its energy policy, investing in infrastructure and creating a more favourable investment climate. By doing so, France can unlock the full potential of its offshore wind resources and contribute more effectively to the global renewable energy transition. For France to succeed in its transition from a nuclear-dominated power mix to a more balanced system with significant renewable baseload, it will require a steep acceleration in solar and wind capacities. Of these, IEEFA sees offshore wind as the key technology that can be deployed at a gigawatt scale in the next decade. Encouraging progress has been made since 2022. To maintain this momentum, French energy authorities must now provide stronger support to help fast-track offshore wind development."

The wind farm is a proposed extension to the 400MW Rampion offshore wind farm that has been online since 2018. The development consent order was issued by the UK energy secretary, Ed Miliband, last Friday. The Rampion 2 developer estimates that this project alone will create 4,000 jobs during the construction of the 90 offshore turbines. Construction is slated to begin in 2027-28, ahead of full commercial operations by 2030. The project will produce enough clean energy to power over one million homes. The permit will allow the developer, RWE, to mount a bid for a contract for difference in the upcoming Allocation Round 7. Other partners of the project include a Macquarie-led consortium and a subsidiary of North American energy infrastructure company Enbridge. The approval moves the government a step closer to delivering clean power by 2030, putting the UK within 4GW of the offshore wind range of 43-50 GW set out in the Clean Power Action Plan."

The vessel can use methanol as fuel in addition to conventional fuel oil and is equipped with a shaft generator that generates electricity by utilising the rotation of the main propeller shaft that significantly reduces ship-derived carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions. “With its excellent energy efficiency and decarbonisation advancement, the ship will play a leading role in the future decarbonisation of crude oil transport,” NYK said. Last October,Iino Linesbecame the first Japanese shipowner to order a supertanker that can run on methanol. The ship is set to deliver in 2027 and go on a charter contract with Idemitsu Tanker. NYK’s newbuild is delivering in 2028 and has also been fixed to Idemitsu. China Merchants Energy Shipping(CMES), the Shanghai-listed energy transport unit of China Merchants Group, was the first to order methanol dual-fuel VLCCs.

        "content": "Stillstrom and the Panama Canal Authority have signed a memorandum of understanding to implement an offshore charging technology to reduce emissions from vessels idling in and around the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal is a critical artery of global commerce and handles around 14,000 vessels per year. In recent years, has taken significant steps toward decarbonisation. This partnership with Stillstrom represents another significant move in its ongoing journey to transform maritime logistics into a cleaner, more sustainable industry. For ships awaiting transit or at anchor near landfall, coastal areas, and cities, traditional idling means running diesel or heavy fuel oil generators, releasing CO2, NOx, and particulates into the air. Stillstrom’s offshore charging technology will allow vessels to silently draw power, which eliminates the need to burn fossil fuels while waiting in line. With this, the Panama Canal aims to set a precedent for other major trade routes, proving that sustainable shipping is a practical and achievable goal. Stillstrom and the Panama Canal Authority will assess the potential for offshore charging solutions in the region and assess how these systems could reduce emissions, improve air quality, and support the Panama Canal’s broader decarbonisation strategy. “Offshore charging has the potential to transform how vessels operate while waiting to transit, aligning with our vision for a cleaner, more resilient, and more efficient future for world trade,” said Ilya Espino de Marotta, deputy administrator and chief sustainability officer of the Panama Canal Authority. “By implementing offshore power and charging solutions, we’re not only reducing CO2 emissions but also creating a pathway to cleaner air, cleaner seas, and a more sustainable future for global shipping,” added Kristian Borum Jørgensen, CEO of Stillstrom."

The session has been designed to shine a light on the financial impact of decarbonisation on dry bulk shipping, a specialist topic of Lawrence’s when he travels the world meeting clients. “Owners will need to balance compliance with commercial viability, driving the industry toward efficiency solutions and alternative fuel strategies,” Lawrence says, something he concedes will only be possible with the help of charterers and financiers. “Right now, dry bulk owners are focused on compliance, operational cost reduction, and maintaining vessel competitiveness. Many are seeking data-driven performance insights, flexible business models, and proven efficiency solutions that align with long-term sustainability goals,” Lawrence says. Coatings are a strategic tool for compliance, competitiveness, and sustainability “A premium hull coating still remains the lowest hanging fruit, with low up-front costs and a short return on investment,” Lawrence insists, adding: “With increasing regulatory and financial pressure, coatings are no longer just about fouling control, they are a strategic tool for compliance, competitiveness, and sustainability.” Track Nick and five of his colleagues down at the Hotel President Wilson when Geneva Dry reconvenes on April 28 to find out more about coatings and savings with Hempel a Gold Sponsor of the event.

        "content": "Global container growth is set to head into a hard reverse this year on the back of the tariff war initiated by Donald Trump, the American president, which is already seeing noticeable cargo booking cancellations in Asia. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday, Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China, following China’s implementation of a 34% counter tariff on American goods last Friday. Trump stated that if China’s latest retaliation is not withdrawn by today, the extra 50% tariff will take effect tomorrow, bringing the total tariffs to 104%. He added in his post that “all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated,” and that “negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.” Blanket US imports tariffs announced six days ago have already resulted in what container analysts at Linerlytica described yesterday as “significant” cargo booking cancellations in Asia, thwarting carriers’ efforts to raise transpacific freight rates and placing the May contract negotiations “in limbo”. US importers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude “Increasingly, it is becoming clear that US importers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. To the degree their supply chain, and inventories allow them to halt and postpone shipments, this is what is happening now,” commented Lars Jensen, the head of liner consultancy Vespucci Maritime. The next “domino” to fall would be additional last-minute blank sailings to the US from the carriers in case the drop in bookings becomes too severe, Jensen suggested in a post on LinkedIn, with other liner experts advising some ships could head into hot layup. “The effective US tariff rate, on a container volume weighted basis, will rise substantially to 36% setting the stage for a full blown trade war with our global container demand growth projections already cut to -1.1% in 2025,” Linerlytica stated yesterday, while not yet factoring in the potential extra 50% hike in tariffs aimed China’s way by Trump. China and Vietnam, another country heavily targeted by the Trump administration, together accounted for 51% of total US container imports in 2024, according to Linerlyica data (see chart below). The trade-weighted tariff rate is more than 36% based on Linerlytica’s calculations derived from each country’s share of total US container imports. Linerlytica warned of a significant stagflation risk in the US if the current tariffs are implemented without exemptions and exclusions. Clarksons Research tracked 11% of global container trade volumes as now tariffed as of last Friday. In the 2018-19 US-China trade war, container-tariffed trade reached 5% of global volumes and led to a 0.5% drag on global box trade, according to Clarksons."

The company renewed the contract for the yet undisclosed rig for a firm duration of ten years, which adds significant long-term revenue visibility and backlog sustainability. The deal is estimated to be worth around $290m. The rig in question is currently fulfilling a medium-term contract in Egypt. In the country, ADES has seven jackup rigs in operation –Admarine VIII,Admarine V,Admarine IV,Admarine III,Admarine VI,Admarine 88, andAdmarine 260– so one of these will be moving back to Saudi Arabia upon completing its deal. Last year, ADES mutually agreed to temporarily suspend operations on six of its 33 offshore jackups operating in the country for up to 12 months. Although the company did not immediately reveal the customer, it came to light that it was Saudi giant Aramco. Currently, the offshore driller has 30 rigs on hire with the Saudi firm. “We are very pleased to have secured this renewal for our unit in Saudi Arabia, particularly as it was among the six previously suspended rigs in the Kingdom. The new award validates the Group’s optimism regarding the outlook of our business in the Kingdom. The group also plans to continue focusing on securing further renewals and backlog additions in our key markets to boost long-term revenue visibility and to capitalize on the prevailing tightness in the global offshore jack-up market,” said Mohamed Farouk, CEO of ADES"

African nations suffer disproportionately from the devastating impacts of climate change yet have historically contributed very little to the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming our planet. International shipping is responsible for 3% of those emissions. The UN body which regulates the sector, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and its member states have a once-in-a-generation opportunity this week to agree a meaningful emissions levy which can shift the sector away from heavy fuel oil to cleaner alternatives in line with its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. If the IMO takes brave decisions at its April meeting, ships will soon start using green fuels made with renewable electricity in countries such as Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Mauritania, Namibia, and South Africa. If the IMO and its members fail to demonstrate leadership, we are likely to see continued use of fossil fuels for international shipping even though significantly cleaner alternatives exist. Africa has the opportunity to become the renewable energy breadbasket of the world Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is being used by some ships and can cut emissions by 10-19%. Biofuels can also be used, processing agricultural produce, but this requires a lot of land, which could be used for food production. By far the cleanest option is to use renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, then use the hydrogen to produce ammonia, which can be used to propel our ships. At the moment, green ammonia and other so-called e-fuels like green methanol are more expensive than heavy fuel oil. As we build large renewable energy facilities across our continent, the price of green fuels will fall. To help scale these green fuels, there is growing agreement that the IMO should introduce a levy on emissions. It is essential that this levy is high enough to incentivise the uptake of green fuels and provide funding to lower-income countries for their own just and equitable energy transition. Kenya’s Climate Envoy Ali Mohamed has backed a levy of between $150 to $300 per tonne of emissions. As he said this week: “Anything less risks stalling progress.” Another option on the table, combining a low levy and a carbon trading system, would not generate the green fuel uptake or funding needed. This was made clear at the recent Africa Strategic Summit on Shipping Decarbonisation in Nigeria where energy expert Dr Dola O concluded: “The global shipping industry is at a critical turning point. As the IMO prepares to finalise the emissions reduction strategy, it must step up and take the helm of its maritime future.” Africa has the opportunity to become the renewable energy breadbasket of the world. The Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance and the Green Hydrogen Organisation, have estimated that 4m jobs could be created and 60m tonnes of green hydrogen produced annually on the continent. Our countries can supply the green fuels, we just need the IMO to ensure the demand is there."

The most eye-catching scene from the ongoing 83rd gathering of the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) are the three empty seats reserved for the US delegation, with the Trump administration not only avoiding the meeting, but, like its tariff tactics, letting it be known that it would look to add reciprocal charges if any US-flagged ships face higher fuel bills. This week’s MEPC is deciding on whether to implement a universal greenhouse gas (GHG) levy or contribution and/or a GHG fuel standard, both of which are aimed at meeting IMO’s green targets that push shipping to become a net-zero industry by 2050. The Trump administration, however, has made clear it will have nothing to do with the discussions. On Trump’s first day back in office, he pulled the US out of the United Nations-brokered Paris Climate Agreement, and now he has acted in a similar fashion at another UN body. In its rebuttal of this week’s talks, the US claimed that by pursuing a net-zero industry shipping would need to rely on “hypothetical expensive and unproven fuels”. Splashhad already reported on Monday that the chances of a universal carbon levy being agreed by member states this week looked slim. A compromised text proposed during last week’s greenhouse gas (GHG) working group meeting excluded a universal levy and included tiered GHG fuel intensity requirements instead. “I have real concerns that the package being shaped may not be one that truly protects the most vulnerable or ensures no one is left behind,” commented Albon Ishoda, the Marshall Islands’ special envoy for maritime decarbonisation.

Signal currently lists close to 1,000 ships as sanctioned with tankers accounting for two-thirds of the total. In 2022, when sanctions first started to expand, only 18 aframaxes were under sanctions according to Signal, accounting for 9% of the total sanctioned tanker population. By 2025, this has grown to over 200 aframaxes, making up 34% of the sanctioned tanker population. “This growing targeting of Aframaxes is due to them being best suited to transporting oil products from ports and regions under wider economic sanctions, such as the Black Sea, a key region for Russian oil exports,” Signal explained in new research published yesterday. In addition to this, aframaxes are also used in short-haul deliveries to larger vessels in neutral waters to obscure the origin of the cargo. Dry bulk vessels make up 26% of the total sanctioned population, the new data shows. “Geopolitical tensions and the changing nature of relations between countries will continue to drive sanctions, which have far-reaching effects on freight rates and commodity prices,” Signal advised. The number of vessels hit by sanctions surpassed 1,000 by the end of last year, according to a different data provider, S&P Global Market Intelligence, who maintain that more 800 of these ships do not have confirmed insurance. Moreover, the average age of sanctioned ships – 21 years – is some eight years older than the global average, adding to growing concern that the sprawling so-called shadow fleet could lead to multiple costly environmental catastrophes."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "As news emerges that the US haspulled out of this week’s big green talks at the IMO, Matt Kenney, the head of Laureate Communications, warns readers on how Trump’s economic policies could sideswipe the most ambitious maritime transformation in a generation. Let’s begin with a truth so plain it should not require reiteration: President Trump’s tariff agenda is not a tantrum, nor a theatrical act of economic populism. This cycle of underestimation has repeated often enough to become a caricature. But caricatures, like clichés, conceal as much as they reveal. Beneath the chaos lies a long game, one that is vital to US interests. Trump has pulled the trigger on a plan to restructure the global trading order. (1) To reverse US de-industrialisation. (2) To defend the dollar’s supremacy, and (3) redraw the postwar map of economic and security dependencies around a renewed American centre of gravity. First, unleash tariff disruption on a scale sufficient to unnerve the whole world. Second, establish a permanent framework of reciprocal tariffs to pressure key industries and sort countries in to buckets – green, yellow, and red. Third, and most ambitious, use this leverage to broker a new Bretton Woods-style agreement. A “Mar-a-Lago Accord” in which countries in the green bucket agree to align their currencies with the dollar, pay for American security guarantees, and re-enter a formalised hierarchy of global economic access. If this sounds implausible, consider that the architects of this vision are not amateurs. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a hedge fund veteran who once helped “break the Bank of England”, and senior advisor Stephen Miran, a Harvard economist and author of A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, have spent years preparing the intellectual scaffolding for precisely this kind of realignment. They do not see the current tariff chaos as policy failure, but as step one. Trump is just the kind of trash-can banger needed to hammer it home decisively. What the administration is attempting is nothing less than a replacement of the neoliberal order that took shape in the 1980s (one that prioritised capital flows, cheap imports, and strong-dollar finance) with a new order built around controlled access, managed exchange rates, and an industrial base sturdy enough to withstand a war. The geopolitical implications are enormous. But so too are the consequences for sectors caught between the tectonic plates. Global shipping, in particular, faces the risk of being crushed not through negligence, but through omission. The maritime sector is not the object of the trade war, but it may well be its first major casualty. The hidden cost of strategic disruption In recent years, the shipping industry has made a credible attempt to invest in decarbonisation. New orders for dual-fuel vessels capable of running on LNG, methanol, and ammonia are at record highs. European regulators have introduced carbon pricing, lifecycle emissions accounting, and mandatory port infrastructure requirements. Large carriers have begun investing in zero-emission corridors, fuel certification schemes, and alternative bunker networks. For the first time in its history, shipping has the contours of a climate strategy. But it is also a strategy on a knife’s edge. The costs are high. The incentives are fragile. The investment horizon is long and uncertain. Green fuels are vastly more expensive than conventional ones. Port infrastructure is patchy and unevenly distributed. Regulatory convergence is partial at best. The entire project depends on policy stability and economic coherence. This is what tariffs now threaten to unravel. When the United States raises import duties on low-cost machinery from Asia, the price of retrofitting green vessels increases. When reciprocal tariffs lead to reduced trade flows, the container volumes that fund operational upgrades decline. When a Chinese-built ship is penalised at an American port, regardless of its flag, registry, or operator, the global shipbuilding market is turned into a proxy battlefield. The separation scheme For China, the signal is unmistakable. Tariffs are not a disciplinary tool, they are an exclusion mechanism. China dominates global shipbuilding, exporting vessels at a scale unmatched by any other nation. If its shipyards are now treated as liabilities, it will not wait for inclusion. It will build a parallel system. Already, Beijing is expanding its capacity for alternative fuels, investing in methanol supply, and hardwiring its Belt and Road network with maritime bunkering infrastructure. But could we be about to witness the splintering of maritime trade into two hemispheres? One system aligned with European and American regulatory frameworks. Another with Chinese capital, standards, and political guarantees? Is that still so crazy to consider? If this bifurcation occurs, decarbonisation will become a collateral narrative. Each bloc could pursue its own methods, standards, and reporting protocols. Mutual recognition could wither, certification regimes could fracture, and the already fragile consensus on global climate action could dissolve altogether. Between currency and carbon The irony is rich. A strategy designed to protect American industry may end up undercutting the very industries poised to deliver the next wave of industrial reinvention. Clean fuels, advanced engines, port electrification, carbon sequestration, digital transformation — these are not niche interests. They are growth sectors, bursting with jobs, capital, and competitiveness. The fact that Homo Sapiens might also be able to cleave to our spinning rock a while longer comes some way down the list of benefits. In disrupting this, Washington is not asserting control. It is bleeding leverage. The Mar-a-Lago Accord, if it ever materialises, will need more than nationalist posturing. It will require trust, consistency, and a willingness to listen to sectors that operate in the real economy, not just the imaginary scorecards of think tank white papers. Global shipping does not need political sympathy. It needs a coherent policy. And if Washington now wishes to rebuild its industrial base while preserving dollar dominance, it must first acknowledge that global economic leadership cannot be willed into being by fiat. It must be earned through reliability. In the end, the tariff war may not bring the collapse of the global trading system. But it may unravel the most ambitious maritime transformation in a generation — not by opposition, but by indifference. That, history should not forgive."

        "content": "Belgian marine services and dredging group DEME is expanding its footprint in the offshore wind sector with the acquisition of Norway-based contractor Havfram. The deal, worth around €900m ($995m), involves stakes held by private investment firm Sandbrook Capital and Canadian pension fund PSP Investments, as well as, among others, the cost needed to complete two wind turbine installation vessels (WTIVs) under construction in China. The transaction is expected to close by the end of April this year. Havfram, formerly Ocean Installer, is currently building a fleet that is described as one of the world’s most advanced WTIVs at CIMC Raffles in China. The first vessel is scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the second newbuild joining the fleet in early 2026. The Oslo-based company counts around 50 employees and has an orderbook of about €600m. “DEME’s investment in Havfram underscores our unwavering belief in the immense potential of offshore wind infrastructure as a key element in the global energy transition. This acquisition complements our fleet and will bolster our competitive edge in both turbine and foundation installations, enhancing our operational flexibility and interchangeability and strengthening DEME’s leadership position in the industry,” said Luc Vandenbulcke, CEO of DEME."

The award covers a firm scope of three wells, with an anticipated duration of 75 days, and is expected to begin in April 2025. As a result, the rig’s previously announced program, originally set to begin in May with an undisclosed client, will now begin in July, in direct continuation of this Vietsovpetro program. With these adjustments, the rig is now expected to remain under contract through September 2025. In West Africa, theGerdjackup won a deal with Foxtrot in the Ivory Coast for a one-year firm program, scheduled to begin in the late fourth quarter of 2025. The rig already has an agreement in place in the same region from June 2025 until September 2025. Another West African deal was awarded to theNorverig. The jackup received a contract from an undisclosed operator for a campaign with an expected duration of 11 months, set to begin in the second half of 2026. The deal remains subject to the customer’s final investment decision, anticipated in the second half of 2025. Norvestarted work for Marathon Oil last month in Equatorial Guinea and is expected to finish work relating to that deal in June 2025. The rig will then start work in Gabon for Vaalco Energy in July of this year. That contract is set to end in April 2026. The three deals won an expected combined duration of 774 days and estimated contract revenues of around $120m, excluding mobilization and demobilization fees. In Mexico, Borr Drilling received a re-mobilization request from Pemex for theGalar,Grid, andGersemirigs, with mobilisation set for mid-April. Operations on these units are anticipated to resume shortly thereafter, within the second quarter of 2025. The rigs will continue operations on Pemex assets under the same contractual terms.

Also on the list are 60 of what the American president described as the “worst offending” countries, who will face tariffs ranging from 11% to 50%. These are all on top of the 10% blanket tariffs that Trump announced a week ago. The additional tariffs on China kicked in after Beijing refused to meet Trump’s deadline to withdraw its own retaliatory levies on the US. Data from Vizion’s TradeView Global Trade Intelligence Platform shows that container bookings into the US have dropped 67% in the past seven days compared to the week prior. They also indicate export bookings being down 40%. “If these numbers are anywhere near correct, this is an extremely large disruption to the trade flows we are seeing,” commented Lars Jensen, the CEO of container consultancy Vespucci Maritime, in a LinkedIn post. Container carriers are responding to the uncertain trading environment by blanking some sailings. The Premier Alliance’s PN4 Pacific service, which should have begun in May, is suspended until further notice, with other carriers and alliances expected to do similar in the coming days, mirroring how container shipping handled the early days of the covid epidemic five years ago."

The Nordic Association of Marine Insurers (Cefor) has released its latest annual edition of hull trends, which looks at the impact of the global merchant fleet getting older and older, dubbed the “silver tsunami” in a presentation yesterday, as well as the noticeable rise in fire incidents. “Machinery damage showed a substantial increase in recent years, which should be seen in the context of an ageing fleet. Among the largest losses, fires and collisions dominate, with 2023 and 2024 being the first years after a benign 10-year period,” said Cefor analyst Astrid Seltmann. The global merchant fleet is getting older and older, as owners hold off renewing their vessels while waiting for greater clarity on future fuels. As of the end of January, 13% of the total bulk carrier fleet was aged 21 years old or older, a 12% increase compared to the similar period of 2024, according to data from Xclusiv Shipbrokers. The 16 to 20-year-old age dry bulk group accounted for 16% of the total bulk carrier fleet by late January, a huge 29% increase compared to January 2024. The vintage state of the tanker market is even more severe with Xclusiv data showing 18% of the total tanker fleet is now aged 21 years old or older, also a 12% increase compared to the same period in 2024. The 16 to 20-year-old tanker age group constitutes 29% of the total tanker fleet, reflecting a 13% increase from January 2024."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "As news emerges that the US haspulled out of this week’s big green talks at the IMO, Matt Kenney, the head of Laureate Communications, warns readers on how Trump’s economic policies could sideswipe the most ambitious maritime transformation in a generation. Let’s begin with a truth so plain it should not require reiteration: President Trump’s tariff agenda is not a tantrum, nor a theatrical act of economic populism. This cycle of underestimation has repeated often enough to become a caricature. But caricatures, like clichés, conceal as much as they reveal. Beneath the chaos lies a long game, one that is vital to US interests. Trump has pulled the trigger on a plan to restructure the global trading order. (1) To reverse US de-industrialisation. (2) To defend the dollar’s supremacy, and (3) redraw the postwar map of economic and security dependencies around a renewed American centre of gravity. First, unleash tariff disruption on a scale sufficient to unnerve the whole world. Second, establish a permanent framework of reciprocal tariffs to pressure key industries and sort countries in to buckets – green, yellow, and red. Third, and most ambitious, use this leverage to broker a new Bretton Woods-style agreement. A “Mar-a-Lago Accord” in which countries in the green bucket agree to align their currencies with the dollar, pay for American security guarantees, and re-enter a formalised hierarchy of global economic access. If this sounds implausible, consider that the architects of this vision are not amateurs. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a hedge fund veteran who once helped “break the Bank of England”, and senior advisor Stephen Miran, a Harvard economist and author of A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, have spent years preparing the intellectual scaffolding for precisely this kind of realignment. They do not see the current tariff chaos as policy failure, but as step one. Trump is just the kind of trash-can banger needed to hammer it home decisively. What the administration is attempting is nothing less than a replacement of the neoliberal order that took shape in the 1980s (one that prioritised capital flows, cheap imports, and strong-dollar finance) with a new order built around controlled access, managed exchange rates, and an industrial base sturdy enough to withstand a war. The geopolitical implications are enormous. But so too are the consequences for sectors caught between the tectonic plates. Global shipping, in particular, faces the risk of being crushed not through negligence, but through omission. The maritime sector is not the object of the trade war, but it may well be its first major casualty. The hidden cost of strategic disruption In recent years, the shipping industry has made a credible attempt to invest in decarbonisation. New orders for dual-fuel vessels capable of running on LNG, methanol, and ammonia are at record highs. European regulators have introduced carbon pricing, lifecycle emissions accounting, and mandatory port infrastructure requirements. Large carriers have begun investing in zero-emission corridors, fuel certification schemes, and alternative bunker networks. For the first time in its history, shipping has the contours of a climate strategy. But it is also a strategy on a knife’s edge. The costs are high. The incentives are fragile. The investment horizon is long and uncertain. Green fuels are vastly more expensive than conventional ones. Port infrastructure is patchy and unevenly distributed. Regulatory convergence is partial at best. The entire project depends on policy stability and economic coherence. This is what tariffs now threaten to unravel. When the United States raises import duties on low-cost machinery from Asia, the price of retrofitting green vessels increases. When reciprocal tariffs lead to reduced trade flows, the container volumes that fund operational upgrades decline. When a Chinese-built ship is penalised at an American port, regardless of its flag, registry, or operator, the global shipbuilding market is turned into a proxy battlefield. The separation scheme For China, the signal is unmistakable. Tariffs are not a disciplinary tool, they are an exclusion mechanism. China dominates global shipbuilding, exporting vessels at a scale unmatched by any other nation. If its shipyards are now treated as liabilities, it will not wait for inclusion. It will build a parallel system. Already, Beijing is expanding its capacity for alternative fuels, investing in methanol supply, and hardwiring its Belt and Road network with maritime bunkering infrastructure. But could we be about to witness the splintering of maritime trade into two hemispheres? One system aligned with European and American regulatory frameworks. Another with Chinese capital, standards, and political guarantees? Is that still so crazy to consider? If this bifurcation occurs, decarbonisation will become a collateral narrative. Each bloc could pursue its own methods, standards, and reporting protocols. Mutual recognition could wither, certification regimes could fracture, and the already fragile consensus on global climate action could dissolve altogether. Between currency and carbon The irony is rich. A strategy designed to protect American industry may end up undercutting the very industries poised to deliver the next wave of industrial reinvention. Clean fuels, advanced engines, port electrification, carbon sequestration, digital transformation — these are not niche interests. They are growth sectors, bursting with jobs, capital, and competitiveness. The fact that Homo Sapiens might also be able to cleave to our spinning rock a while longer comes some way down the list of benefits. In disrupting this, Washington is not asserting control. It is bleeding leverage. The Mar-a-Lago Accord, if it ever materialises, will need more than nationalist posturing. It will require trust, consistency, and a willingness to listen to sectors that operate in the real economy, not just the imaginary scorecards of think tank white papers. Global shipping does not need political sympathy. It needs a coherent policy. And if Washington now wishes to rebuild its industrial base while preserving dollar dominance, it must first acknowledge that global economic leadership cannot be willed into being by fiat. It must be earned through reliability. In the end, the tariff war may not bring the collapse of the global trading system. But it may unravel the most ambitious maritime transformation in a generation — not by opposition, but by indifference. That, history should not forgive."

        "content": "Donald Trump has done to the International Maritime Organization what he did to the Paris Agreement, in choosing to distance the US this week from ongoing talks over a global carbon levy on shipping. The most eye-catching scene from the ongoing 83rd gathering of the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) are the three empty seats reserved for the US delegation, with the Trump administration not only avoiding the meeting, but, like its tariff tactics, letting it be known that it would look to add reciprocal charges if any US-flagged ships face higher fuel bills. This week’s MEPC is deciding on whether to implement a universal greenhouse gas (GHG) levy or contribution and/or a GHG fuel standard, both of which are aimed at meeting IMO’s green targets that push shipping to become a net-zero industry by 2050. The Trump administration, however, has made clear it will have nothing to do with the discussions. On Trump’s first day back in office, he pulled the US out of the United Nations-brokered Paris Climate Agreement, and now he has acted in a similar fashion at another UN body. In its rebuttal of this week’s talks, the US claimed that by pursuing a net-zero industry shipping would need to rely on “hypothetical expensive and unproven fuels”. Splashhad already reported on Monday that the chances of a universal carbon levy being agreed by member states this week looked slim. A compromised text proposed during last week’s greenhouse gas (GHG) working group meeting excluded a universal levy and included tiered GHG fuel intensity requirements instead. “I have real concerns that the package being shaped may not be one that truly protects the most vulnerable or ensures no one is left behind,” commented Albon Ishoda, the Marshall Islands’ special envoy for maritime decarbonisation. MEPC runs through to Friday evening withSplashset to report on the key takeaways from what had been billed in the run-up as one of shipping’s most important green gatherings ever."

        "content": "Shipping has had a peek at what charges from the US it faces for links to Chinese tonnage. Appearing in front of a Senate Finance Committee yesterday, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said his organisation had taken onboard the huge volume of complaints registered during a public hearing into proposals to charge companies with Chinese tonnage on their books extra for port calls in the US. Following an investigation into Chinese shipbuilding practices, and with the aim of rescucistiating American shipyards, the trade body had recommended a triple-pronged set of potential fees for Chinese-linked vessels that could have amounted to as much as $3.5m per US port call, something that drew nearly 400 responses, mostly negative, when a public hearing was held last month. They’re not all going to be implemented. They’re not all going to be stacked “They’re not all going to be implemented. They’re not all going to be stacked,” Greer said yesterday, likely to the relief of many in shipping who are still having to come to terms with the many other bombshells being unleashed by the second instalment of the Donald Trump administration which include tariffs, walking away from the International Maritime Organization, and laying down claims to the Panama Canal. Full details of the US port fees on China-linked tonnage are likely to be revealed later this month. American deliberations on charging more for Chinese-linked tonnage has already seen a shift in ship buying preferences over the past month, both for newbuilds andin the secondhand market. In related news, Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), America’s top military shipyard, and South Korean giant HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) have signed a memorandum of understanding this week to explore opportunities to collaborate on accelerating ship production in support of defence and commercial shipbuilding projects. HHI’s Korean rival, Hanwha Ocean, acquired Philly Shipyard last year, while also buying a 9.9% stake in Austal last month, an Australian yard with assets in the US. South Korea’s trade and industry minister Ahn Duk-geun said today that potential cooperation with Washington in the shipbuilding sector is a “very important card” in negotiating with the US over its tariffs."

        "content": "As news emerges that the US haspulled out of this week’s big green talks at the IMO, Matt Kenney, the head of Laureate Communications, warns readers on how Trump’s economic policies could sideswipe the most ambitious maritime transformation in a generation. Let’s begin with a truth so plain it should not require reiteration: President Trump’s tariff agenda is not a tantrum, nor a theatrical act of economic populism. This cycle of underestimation has repeated often enough to become a caricature. But caricatures, like clichés, conceal as much as they reveal. Beneath the chaos lies a long game, one that is vital to US interests. Trump has pulled the trigger on a plan to restructure the global trading order. (1) To reverse US de-industrialisation. (2) To defend the dollar’s supremacy, and (3) redraw the postwar map of economic and security dependencies around a renewed American centre of gravity. First, unleash tariff disruption on a scale sufficient to unnerve the whole world. Second, establish a permanent framework of reciprocal tariffs to pressure key industries and sort countries in to buckets – green, yellow, and red. Third, and most ambitious, use this leverage to broker a new Bretton Woods-style agreement. A “Mar-a-Lago Accord” in which countries in the green bucket agree to align their currencies with the dollar, pay for American security guarantees, and re-enter a formalised hierarchy of global economic access. If this sounds implausible, consider that the architects of this vision are not amateurs. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a hedge fund veteran who once helped “break the Bank of England”, and senior advisor Stephen Miran, a Harvard economist and author of A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, have spent years preparing the intellectual scaffolding for precisely this kind of realignment. They do not see the current tariff chaos as policy failure, but as step one. Trump is just the kind of trash-can banger needed to hammer it home decisively. What the administration is attempting is nothing less than a replacement of the neoliberal order that took shape in the 1980s (one that prioritised capital flows, cheap imports, and strong-dollar finance) with a new order built around controlled access, managed exchange rates, and an industrial base sturdy enough to withstand a war. The geopolitical implications are enormous. But so too are the consequences for sectors caught between the tectonic plates. Global shipping, in particular, faces the risk of being crushed not through negligence, but through omission. The maritime sector is not the object of the trade war, but it may well be its first major casualty. The hidden cost of strategic disruption In recent years, the shipping industry has made a credible attempt to invest in decarbonisation. New orders for dual-fuel vessels capable of running on LNG, methanol, and ammonia are at record highs. European regulators have introduced carbon pricing, lifecycle emissions accounting, and mandatory port infrastructure requirements. Large carriers have begun investing in zero-emission corridors, fuel certification schemes, and alternative bunker networks. For the first time in its history, shipping has the contours of a climate strategy. But it is also a strategy on a knife’s edge. The costs are high. The incentives are fragile. The investment horizon is long and uncertain. Green fuels are vastly more expensive than conventional ones. Port infrastructure is patchy and unevenly distributed. Regulatory convergence is partial at best. The entire project depends on policy stability and economic coherence. This is what tariffs now threaten to unravel. When the United States raises import duties on low-cost machinery from Asia, the price of retrofitting green vessels increases. When reciprocal tariffs lead to reduced trade flows, the container volumes that fund operational upgrades decline. When a Chinese-built ship is penalised at an American port, regardless of its flag, registry, or operator, the global shipbuilding market is turned into a proxy battlefield. The separation scheme For China, the signal is unmistakable. Tariffs are not a disciplinary tool, they are an exclusion mechanism. China dominates global shipbuilding, exporting vessels at a scale unmatched by any other nation. If its shipyards are now treated as liabilities, it will not wait for inclusion. It will build a parallel system. Already, Beijing is expanding its capacity for alternative fuels, investing in methanol supply, and hardwiring its Belt and Road network with maritime bunkering infrastructure. But could we be about to witness the splintering of maritime trade into two hemispheres? One system aligned with European and American regulatory frameworks. Another with Chinese capital, standards, and political guarantees? Is that still so crazy to consider? If this bifurcation occurs, decarbonisation will become a collateral narrative. Each bloc could pursue its own methods, standards, and reporting protocols. Mutual recognition could wither, certification regimes could fracture, and the already fragile consensus on global climate action could dissolve altogether. Between currency and carbon The irony is rich. A strategy designed to protect American industry may end up undercutting the very industries poised to deliver the next wave of industrial reinvention. Clean fuels, advanced engines, port electrification, carbon sequestration, digital transformation — these are not niche interests. They are growth sectors, bursting with jobs, capital, and competitiveness. The fact that Homo Sapiens might also be able to cleave to our spinning rock a while longer comes some way down the list of benefits. In disrupting this, Washington is not asserting control. It is bleeding leverage. The Mar-a-Lago Accord, if it ever materialises, will need more than nationalist posturing. It will require trust, consistency, and a willingness to listen to sectors that operate in the real economy, not just the imaginary scorecards of think tank white papers. Global shipping does not need political sympathy. It needs a coherent policy. And if Washington now wishes to rebuild its industrial base while preserving dollar dominance, it must first acknowledge that global economic leadership cannot be willed into being by fiat. It must be earned through reliability. In the end, the tariff war may not bring the collapse of the global trading system. But it may unravel the most ambitious maritime transformation in a generation — not by opposition, but by indifference. That, history should not forgive."

Acknowledging the US’s less than 1% global shipbuilding market share yesterday, Trump said: “Rectifying these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes securing consistent, predictable, and durable federal funding, making United States-flagged and built vessels commercially competitive in international commerce, rebuilding America’s maritime manufacturing capabilities, and expanding and strengthening the recruitment, training, and retention of the relevant workforce.” Trump has given multiple parts of government – including the secretaries of state, defence, commerce, labour, transport and homeland security – a timeline to deliver ways to strengthen American shipbuilding. Trump officials yesterday skirted around the specifics of contentious plans to charge Chinese tonnage extra for calling at US ports, something that has roiled the international shipping community in recent months, with the exact methodology of the fees to be laid out later. In addition, yesterday’s executive order directs the US Trade Representative to consider imposing tariffs on ship cranes and other cargo handling equipment if they are manufactured, assembled, or contain components of Chinese origin, or if they are created by companies controlled by Chinese citizens. The Department of Homeland Security is also tasked with imposing port maintenance fees and preventing carriers from circumventing these fees by using ports in Mexico and Canada and then transporting them overland to the US. The order calls for the creation of a Maritime Security Trust Fund to provide sustainable funding for initiatives that strengthen US maritime capabilities. This includes using funds from tariffs, fines, fees, or tax revenues. Lobby group, the Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA), lauded yesterday’s announcement from the White House, noting: “A strong US shipyard industry is essential not only for our economic security but also for our homeland and national security.” As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans last month in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

The deal, due to be phased in over the coming three years, has a clear zero pellet loss objective and introduces a hierarchy of action with prevention as the top priority, followed by spill containment and, as a last resort, clean-up of pellet spills and losses. This, combined with mandatory measures to use appropriate packaging, equipment, training and infrastructure, marks a significant improvement over existing voluntary initiatives and reflects growing recognition that only proactive spill prevention can effectively reduce microplastic pollution. Plastic production pellets, around 5 mm in size, also known as nurdles, are the building blocks of all larger plastics and constitute the third largest source of microplastic pollution in the EU withSplashregularly reporting on tons of these minute items washing up on shores across the continent. “Microplastics, including plastic pellets are now found everywhere — in our oceans, seas and even in the food we eat. Each year, the equivalent of up to 7,300 truckloads of plastic pellets are lost to the environment. The EU has taken a landmark step toward reducing pellet pollution by adopting measures to tackle losses and ensure correct handling, including in maritime transport,” commented Paulina Hennig-Kloska, Polish minister for climate and environment."

The premium payment is the additional premium payable for entering into a high-risk area such as the Rea Sea at times when the Houthis have targeted commercial ships in the area. The intention of the revision is to ensure clarity and balance in the additional premiums charged by shipowners. Also, the subcommittee has introduced a new calculation method for additional freight addressed in the war risks clause for voyage charter parties. The aim is to improve its commercial viability and make the calculation suitable also for situations requiring re-routing due to unsafe passage and not only due to unsafe load or unsafe discharge ports. “In revising our war risk clauses, our focus has been on the constant challenges and threats to the way our industry operates.

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett with financial advice for shipowners amid the Trump market gyrations. Donald Trump has just backed away from the abyss – denying, of course, that he is doing any such thing – and, while adding yet more tariffs to imports from China to the US, he has announced a 90-day moratorium on tariffs over 10% imposed on US imports from most other nations. The US stock markets rose on the social media post, or as Trump would have it, the “truth”, and everyone relaxed a little. But not much, and with good reason. The insane gyrations in US trade policy, dictated as it is by one vain old man, who is prone to speaking in word salad, make it impossible for anyone to carry on international business – the business that we all rely on – in a normal way, and the China- USA trading relationship has become – at least until Trump changes his mind again – effectively impossible. Freight rate collapses start with financial collapses Meanwhile, 10% tariffs – with, by the way, little evidence of a fully staffed, trained, capable and reliable US government department for collecting them – are spread all around. So, how worried should the shipping industry be? Are we headed for a crash? Are we intimidated yet? James Carville, president Clinton’s election strategist, is famous for two remarks. One is “The economy, stupid!”, which carried Bill Clinton into the White House and George Bush out of it, and the other is, “I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the Pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” The bond market just intimidated president Trump. We know how freight rate collapses start. I don’t mean mild corrections in the charter market; I mean collapses, like 1997 and 2008. They start with financial collapses – in the case of 1997, the Asian financial crisis and in the case of 2008 the sub-prime crisis. They start with financial collapses, because, if an importer cannot open a letter of credit – and trade finance is surely the simplest and most routine of all commercial banking activities – he isn’t going to buy whatever he wanted to buy, because he cannot open the letter of credit. The seller isn’t going to be able to negotiate his bill of lading, so he will not bring the cargo forward for loading. The cargo isn’t going to move. Freight rate collapses happen overnight, when ordinary banks decide that they cannot afford to extend trade credit as they normally would do. These crashes are not the same thing as gentle increases in the supply of tonnage; they are sudden events. Of course, we are all wondering if we are about to see another freight rate collapse, brought on by all this tariff malarkey in the White House. Is there a simple way in which ordinary shipping people, with no knowledge of finance, can look at the financial markets, and say to themselves, “This looks as if there might be a financial collapse, which is dangerous for my industry. Maybe I should ask my bosses to not order that new ship?” I think there may be. Try this. As we all know, when economic conditions become more difficult, professional investors move some of their holdings out of equities and into government bonds. Bond prices rise; bond yields fall. Bonds are the safe haven. As long as this goes on, there is no risk of a financial collapse that might affect our market – freight rates. This is just the financial world doing what it does. When economic conditions look more cheerful, the professional investors sell bonds, they buy equities, and bond yields rise. All simple. Let’s suppose this doesn’t happen. Let’s suppose that equity prices fall and bond prices fall at the same time. This is an unusual event and it means one of two things, both of them extremely serious, one of which affects us. One situation – the one that caused Carville to “want to come back as the bond market” – is the “bond vigilante” situation, in which big holders of government bonds express their dislike of a government’s financial policies by selling its bonds. We may consider for a moment that the three biggest holders of US government bonds are China, Japan and, more surprisingly, Britain. There is no sign of any of these holders selling their US treasuries. Yet. Britain was on the receiving end of a bond crash when Liz Truss was, briefly, prime minister. This sort of action is rare; it affects one country, or two allied countries, at a time, and because it is so drastic, it doesn’t last long. We don’t need to bother our heads with that one; it affects governments, but it doesn’t affect freights. The other case occurs when professional investors are selling bonds at a time when they ought to be buying them. They will only be doing that if they urgently need liquidity in order to cover their positions. That’s a financial crisis. Banks are going to be affected; they will cut back, and trade credit will dry up. This is the rising bond yield situation combined with falling share prices that ought to scare us all silly. We are not there yet, but we are close enough to it for financial people to be taking action, and for alarming headlines in financial reporting, including headlines suggesting that US treasury bonds might no longer be a safe haven. So, if you are wondering what to do about that newbuilding order, I suggest that you look at the stock market and the bond market, together. Things could go over the edge. Or they might not. Keep watching the bond curve and the stock graph. Good luck!"

Lobby group, the Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA), lauded yesterday’s announcement from the White House, noting: “A strong US shipyard industry is essential not only for our economic security but also for our homeland and national security.” As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans last month in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

        "content": "Supply chain planners are busy booking shipments from non-Chinese destinations into the US today following last night’s tariff surrender by Donald Trump, the American president. Trump announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs amid financial turmoil and a weakening dollar in the week since he had first made his tariff announcements. However, the trade war between Beijing and Washington has worsened, as the US president increased tariffs on goods from China to 125%. China’s retaliatory tariffs of 84% on all US imports took effect yesterday, with the government reiterating it will not back down to Trump. Shippers from non-China origins might want to start the peak season now Trump’s universal 10% levy for all countries, except China, remains in place, but there are signs the US is exploring trade deals with alternative manufacturing bases to China. For instance, the Vietnamese government said today it is in talks for a trade agreement with the US, hours after Trump lifted onerous 46% tariffs on the Southeast Asian nation. The two countries will consider removing as many non-tariff barriers as possible, Hanoi said in a statement released after a meeting between Vietnam’s deputy prime minister Ho Duc Phoc and US trade representative Jamieson Greer in Washington. Following Trump’s tariff backtracking, Lars Jensen, who heads up container advisory Vespucci Maritime, suggested via LinkedIn: “For the supply chains this means that the large amount of bookings which were suspended/put on pause for the past week are all prone to be shipped as soon as possible for non-China origins. Shippers will want to get this cargo moving whilst they have the opportunity to avoid the large tariffs.” The week of tariff turmoil saw container bookings into the US slide by 67%, and the sudden July deadline for lower tariffs is likely to lead to some bottleneck issues as shippers rush to get their goods into the US. “We should expect that shippers from non-China origins might want to start the peak season essentially already now – or as fast as possible – in order to get their peak season loads moved prior to July 9 when the suspension expires,” Jensen advised. China is not holding back as the trade war between the two world’s largest economies escalated, something that is seeing a shift in grain and gas buying patterns. VLGC rates continued to plummet yesterday following the announcement in Beijing of an 84% total tariff on US goods. Yesterday, the LPG1 route fell by $12,200 a day to $13,600 a day, while the LPG3 route dropped by $12,800 a day, settling at $14,300 a day. “Trade wars produce no winners, and protectionism leads up a blind alley. The economic success of both China and the US presents shared opportunities rather than mutual threats,” the Chinese government stated in an 18,300-word white paper just published in response to the latest US tariffs."

The three turbine foundations, all with passive ballast systems, are named the YFloat, CONFloat-Omega, and CONFloat-7C. The YFloat is designed to provide a stable platform for wind turbines. Its symmetrical design facilitates efficient pre-fabrication with the option of local assembly, reducing material usage and simplifying the manufacturing process. It also offers scalability that facilitates higher power generation and reduced levelized cost of energy. The CONFloat-Omega is a circular concrete floater concept featuring a moon pool at its center and an offset turbine and tower. It is designed for harsh environmental conditions, while its concrete material and robust construction ensure high resistance to fatigue and minimal maintenance requirements. The final design, the CONFloat-7C, has a seven-cell configuration featuring a centralised turbine and tower. This design reduces integration and completion draught, enabling a wider range of execution locations and ports."

        "content": "US president Donald Trump has signed a well-telegraphed executive order aimed at resuscitating American shipyards while also limiting China’s dominant influence on the sector. Acknowledging the US’s less than 1% global shipbuilding market share yesterday, Trump said: “Rectifying these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes securing consistent, predictable, and durable federal funding, making United States-flagged and built vessels commercially competitive in international commerce, rebuilding America’s maritime manufacturing capabilities, and expanding and strengthening the recruitment, training, and retention of the relevant workforce.” Trump has given multiple parts of government – including the secretaries of state, defence, commerce, labour, transport and homeland security – a timeline to deliver ways to strengthen American shipbuilding. Trump officials yesterday skirted around the specifics of contentious plans to charge Chinese tonnage extra for calling at US ports, something that has roiled the international shipping community in recent months, with the exact methodology of the fees to be laid out later. In addition, yesterday’s executive order directs the US Trade Representative to consider imposing tariffs on ship cranes and other cargo handling equipment if they are manufactured, assembled, or contain components of Chinese origin, or if they are created by companies controlled by Chinese citizens. The Department of Homeland Security is also tasked with imposing port maintenance fees and preventing carriers from circumventing these fees by using ports in Mexico and Canada and then transporting them overland to the US. The order calls for the creation of a Maritime Security Trust Fund to provide sustainable funding for initiatives that strengthen US maritime capabilities.

        "content": "Donald Trump has done to the International Maritime Organization what he did to the Paris Agreement, in choosing to distance the US this week from ongoing talks over a global carbon levy on shipping. The most eye-catching scene from the ongoing 83rd gathering of the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) are the three empty seats reserved for the US delegation, with the Trump administration not only avoiding the meeting, but, like its tariff tactics, letting it be known that it would look to add reciprocal charges if any US-flagged ships face higher fuel bills. This week’s MEPC is deciding on whether to implement a universal greenhouse gas (GHG) levy or contribution and/or a GHG fuel standard, both of which are aimed at meeting IMO’s green targets that push shipping to become a net-zero industry by 2050. The Trump administration, however, has made clear it will have nothing to do with the discussions. On Trump’s first day back in office, he pulled the US out of the United Nations-brokered Paris Climate Agreement, and now he has acted in a similar fashion at another UN body. In its rebuttal of this week’s talks, the US claimed that by pursuing a net-zero industry shipping would need to rely on “hypothetical expensive and unproven fuels”. Splashhad already reported on Monday that the chances of a universal carbon levy being agreed by member states this week looked slim. A compromised text proposed during last week’s greenhouse gas (GHG) working group meeting excluded a universal levy and included tiered GHG fuel intensity requirements instead. “I have real concerns that the package being shaped may not be one that truly protects the most vulnerable or ensures no one is left behind,” commented Albon Ishoda, the Marshall Islands’ special envoy for maritime decarbonisation. MEPC runs through to Friday evening withSplashset to report on the key takeaways from what had been billed in the run-up as one of shipping’s most important green gatherings ever."

Sanctions were also imposed on two Chinese nationals, Sun Zhengzhe and Sun Feng, who operated the ship and Russian company LLC Consul DV, which was the cosignee of the cargo. The unilateral sanctions will take effect within a week. The vessel,Sunrise 1, currently under detention in South Korean territorial waters, has been ordered to leave the country. It has been detained by authorities for over nine months. The ship is a stateless vessel operated by Hong Kong-based Xiangrui Shipping. Its name was changed from Gain Star in May last year, about a month before picking up 5,020 tonnes of ore from North Korea’s Chongjin Port. Name changes are a frequent tactic to evade sanctions. A joint press release by the South Korean Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Financial Services Commission, and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries stated that an investigation found that the vessel was implicated in violating UN Security Council Resolution 2371, which prohibits the transfer of North Korean iron ore. The South Korean government stated that the sanctions were used as a deterrent for committing similar illicit actions and as a way to disrupt North Korea’s “illicit financing and procurement networks”."

Deep Wind Offshore secured the exclusivity rights to install a wind farm within a 250 sq km area west of Saaremaa Island in the Baltic Sea. According to the company, the specific area combines the Saare 2.1 and Saare 2.2 development areas into a single development. The project is progressing with superficies license proceedings while environmental impact assessments (EIA) are underway. The construction of the bottom-fixed wind farm will push Estonia towards its target to produce 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. “Securing exclusivity for a major offshore wind area in Estonia was a big win for Deep Wind Offshore.

The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned Brar, saying he owns a fleet of nearly 30 vessels, mainly handysize product tankers, many of which operate as part of Iran’s shadow fleet. OFAC also designated two UAE- and two India-based entities that own and operate Brar’s vessels that have transported Iranian oil on behalf of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and the Iranian military. “The Iranian regime relies on its network of unscrupulous shippers and brokers like Brar and his companies to enable its oil sales and finance its destabilising activities,” said secretary of the treasury Scott Bessent. “The United States remains focused on disrupting all elements of Iran’s oil exports, particularly those who seek to profit from this trade.” In his first term, Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed a full embargo on Iran’s crude oil exports in 2019. As a result, Iran’s crude oil shipments collapsed from 2.5m barrels per day in the first half of 2018 to 250,000 barrels per day. During the Biden administration, sanctions were not as strictly enforced, and Iranian exports gradually recovered. In the opening months of Trump’s return to power, there have been many new sanctions packages aimed at Iran’s shadow fleet as well as Iran’s ties to the Houthis in Yemen."

        "author": "Andrew Craig-Bennett",
        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett reflects on Signalgate and the sale of Hutchison Ports, two events that highlight how ignorant most people are about all things maritime. There is a thing called sea blindness. It is not a disease of seafarers, like scurvy once was. It is not even a mental condition of seafarers, like channel fever still is. It is a mental condition of non-seafarers, and I have just realised that it is sometimes dangerous. As ships grew larger, after World War II, ports and industries that depended on cargoes arriving by sea, such as oil refineries and steelworks, moved out of the cities that had grown up around them, and sprang up on green field sites handy for deep water, on the coast. As this went on, the non-seafaring bulk of the population became less and less familiar with ships and the sea. That’s what created sea blindness, the unawareness of things maritime amongst populations at large. This gives us odd moments of amusement such as when a containership, with a deck stack of containers, is called a tanker, and so on, but until very recently I did not think that it was dangerous. Two things changed my mind. The first was the kerfuffle over CK Hutchison selling its container terminals. From a shipping industry perspective, there may indeed be an anti-trust element, in that, very roughly, Hutchison has about 5% of the world’s container terminals by volume and MSC, who are associated with BlackRock in the buying consortium, also has around 5% of the world’s container terminals, but it is very difficult for anyone in shipping to see a container terminal as any sort of a facility that might have a military use. A container terminal is a reasonably deepwater quay, one or more gantry container cranes, some flat land concreted over, some container handling and stacking equipment, a customs facility, some offices, and road and sometimes rail and river or canal access. We all know that. It has no military application at all. You cannot fly aircraft into or out of a container terminal, you cannot house troops and their equipment in a container terminal, you cannot berth warships in a container terminal because the quayside is in constant use, you cannot maintain anything except the terminal’s own equipment in a container terminal, and that equipment is large, delicate and easily damaged. Maybe the problem is that container terminals like to call themselves ports? Ports are different; ports do have a military value – a remarkably high one, if military logistics are in the picture, but a port is a different thing. A container terminal is a part of a real port or harbour; it is not the port or harbour. And nobody checks. Nations make belligerent noises – about nothing. It would be silly if it were not so dangerous. The second thing was Signalgate – the ludicrous business of half of the Trump cabinet inviting the editor in chief of The Atlantic into an online chat between themselves about bombing Houthi-controlled Yemen, during which both the vice president of the US and the secretary of defence of that nation wondered why they were about to drop bombs on the Houthis when this was only going to benefit Europe. If Vance and Hegseth knew anything about our industry, they would know that the Houthis by effectively quasi-closing the Suez Canal have not affected the arrival and departure of goods travelling by sea to and from Europe, what they have done is to put up freight rates everywhere. Since the Suez Canal, as we all know, and it seems nobody else does, prices its transits by reference to what it would cost a ship to go round Africa, so as to be just a bit cheaper, the difference in voyage cost is present, but it’s not huge. What makes the difference in charter rates is the time factor, which reduces the supply of ships and, because freight demand is not price sensitive, puts the time charter rates and the time charter equivalent rates up. And because a ship can travel anywhere on the high seas where there is water for her, those higher charter rates are just as present in the American trades as in the European trades. The professionals in the US Department of Defence know that, of course. It seems their political masters do not."

Acknowledging the US’s less than 1% global shipbuilding market share yesterday, Trump said: “Rectifying these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes securing consistent, predictable, and durable federal funding, making United States-flagged and built vessels commercially competitive in international commerce, rebuilding America’s maritime manufacturing capabilities, and expanding and strengthening the recruitment, training, and retention of the relevant workforce.” Trump has given multiple parts of government – including the secretaries of state, defence, commerce, labour, transport and homeland security – a timeline to deliver ways to strengthen American shipbuilding. Trump officials yesterday skirted around the specifics of contentious plans to charge Chinese tonnage extra for calling at US ports, something that has roiled the international shipping community in recent months, with the exact methodology of the fees to be laid out later. In addition, yesterday’s executive order directs the US Trade Representative to consider imposing tariffs on ship cranes and other cargo handling equipment if they are manufactured, assembled, or contain components of Chinese origin, or if they are created by companies controlled by Chinese citizens. The Department of Homeland Security is also tasked with imposing port maintenance fees and preventing carriers from circumventing these fees by using ports in Mexico and Canada and then transporting them overland to the US. The order calls for the creation of a Maritime Security Trust Fund to provide sustainable funding for initiatives that strengthen US maritime capabilities. This includes using funds from tariffs, fines, fees, or tax revenues. Lobby group, the Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA), lauded yesterday’s announcement from the White House, noting: “A strong US shipyard industry is essential not only for our economic security but also for our homeland and national security.” As with many industries, China has come to dominate shipbuilding this century, moving from a global market share of less than 10% of the global orderbook to a commanding two-thirds stranglehold by the end of last year. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans last month in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett with financial advice for shipowners amid the Trump market gyrations. Donald Trump has just backed away from the abyss – denying, of course, that he is doing any such thing – and, while adding yet more tariffs to imports from China to the US, he has announced a 90-day moratorium on tariffs over 10% imposed on US imports from most other nations. The US stock markets rose on the social media post, or as Trump would have it, the “truth”, and everyone relaxed a little. But not much, and with good reason. The insane gyrations in US trade policy, dictated as it is by one vain old man, who is prone to speaking in word salad, make it impossible for anyone to carry on international business – the business that we all rely on – in a normal way, and the China- USA trading relationship has become – at least until Trump changes his mind again – effectively impossible. Freight rate collapses start with financial collapses Meanwhile, 10% tariffs – with, by the way, little evidence of a fully staffed, trained, capable and reliable US government department for collecting them – are spread all around. So, how worried should the shipping industry be? Are we headed for a crash? Are we intimidated yet? James Carville, president Clinton’s election strategist, is famous for two remarks. One is “The economy, stupid!”, which carried Bill Clinton into the White House and George Bush out of it, and the other is, “I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the Pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” The bond market just intimidated president Trump. We know how freight rate collapses start. I don’t mean mild corrections in the charter market; I mean collapses, like 1997 and 2008. They start with financial collapses – in the case of 1997, the Asian financial crisis and in the case of 2008 the sub-prime crisis. They start with financial collapses, because, if an importer cannot open a letter of credit – and trade finance is surely the simplest and most routine of all commercial banking activities – he isn’t going to buy whatever he wanted to buy, because he cannot open the letter of credit. The seller isn’t going to be able to negotiate his bill of lading, so he will not bring the cargo forward for loading. The cargo isn’t going to move. Freight rate collapses happen overnight, when ordinary banks decide that they cannot afford to extend trade credit as they normally would do. These crashes are not the same thing as gentle increases in the supply of tonnage; they are sudden events. Of course, we are all wondering if we are about to see another freight rate collapse, brought on by all this tariff malarkey in the White House. Is there a simple way in which ordinary shipping people, with no knowledge of finance, can look at the financial markets, and say to themselves, “This looks as if there might be a financial collapse, which is dangerous for my industry. Maybe I should ask my bosses to not order that new ship?” I think there may be. Try this. As we all know, when economic conditions become more difficult, professional investors move some of their holdings out of equities and into government bonds. Bond prices rise; bond yields fall. Bonds are the safe haven. As long as this goes on, there is no risk of a financial collapse that might affect our market – freight rates. This is just the financial world doing what it does. When economic conditions look more cheerful, the professional investors sell bonds, they buy equities, and bond yields rise. All simple. Let’s suppose this doesn’t happen. Let’s suppose that equity prices fall and bond prices fall at the same time. This is an unusual event and it means one of two things, both of them extremely serious, one of which affects us. One situation – the one that caused Carville to “want to come back as the bond market” – is the “bond vigilante” situation, in which big holders of government bonds express their dislike of a government’s financial policies by selling its bonds. We may consider for a moment that the three biggest holders of US government bonds are China, Japan and, more surprisingly, Britain. There is no sign of any of these holders selling their US treasuries. Yet. Britain was on the receiving end of a bond crash when Liz Truss was, briefly, prime minister. This sort of action is rare; it affects one country, or two allied countries, at a time, and because it is so drastic, it doesn’t last long. We don’t need to bother our heads with that one; it affects governments, but it doesn’t affect freights. The other case occurs when professional investors are selling bonds at a time when they ought to be buying them. They will only be doing that if they urgently need liquidity in order to cover their positions. That’s a financial crisis. Banks are going to be affected; they will cut back, and trade credit will dry up. This is the rising bond yield situation combined with falling share prices that ought to scare us all silly. We are not there yet, but we are close enough to it for financial people to be taking action, and for alarming headlines in financial reporting, including headlines suggesting that US treasury bonds might no longer be a safe haven. So, if you are wondering what to do about that newbuilding order, I suggest that you look at the stock market and the bond market, together. Things could go over the edge. Or they might not. Keep watching the bond curve and the stock graph. Good luck!"

China responded today to US president Donald Trump’s cumulative 145% tariffs, placing 125% tariffs on US products, effectively foregoing business between the two countries. Chinese president Xi Jinping called on the European Union to join Beijing in opposing “bullying” from the US, saying “there are no winners in a tariff war”. Shippers looking to get goods in from other manufacturing powerhouses, such as Southeast Asia, are now scrambling as the Trump administration has given them until July 9 before possibly raising tariffs around the world once again. Liner shipping is watching the situation carefully, calibrating accordingly. “We have seen an uptick in blanks announced in the last couple of weeks and spread out over the coming months,” said Simon Sundboell, CEO and founder of eeSea, a Danish liner analysis platform. Sundboell said the decision to blank sailings was down to general market uncertainty and weakening fundamentals. “Carriers have started to blank out of China in particular again, as bookings dropped sharply,” commented Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta, a Norwegian container rates platform. “There is a straightforward effect of the trade war: lower demand. Carriers will act on this by blanking more sailings in the coming weeks and months,” Sand predicted."

        "content": "At this week’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting held at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the world’s biggest emission control area (ECA) has been agreed upon. The new Northeast Atlantic ECA, due by 2027, stretches along coastlines from Portugal to Greenland (see map below), joining existing nearby ECAs in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean. “Almost all European waters will be emission control areas soon. This harmonised regulation not only benefits people and nature but also facilitates a level playing field for the maritime industry in Europe,” said Sönke Diesener, a shipping expert at Naturschutzbund Deutschland, a German NGO. “Coming just days after the record lowest maximum Arctic sea ice extent maximum in the 47-year satellite record, creation of the Northeast Atlantic emission control area will significantly reduce ships’ emissions, improve air quality, and contribute to improving public health and environmental protection in the northeast Atlantic region, including the Arctic waters around Greenland and Iceland,” said Dr Sian Prior, lead advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance. Attention now turns to what the final text coming out of MEPC this evening will be."

        "content": "Splashhas obtained the contentious draft text regarding how shipping will pay for its green transition, with news that a flat levy is very much off the agenda at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). A draft legal text on a package of regulations for the implementation of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework failed to achieve consensus in a working group deliberating late into the night at the UN agency’s headquarters in London yesterday. They concern so-called mid-term technical and economic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next 25 years. However, it gained sufficient majority support for the group to recommend it to the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) for formal approval today. Fifteen countries, led by Saudi Arabia, objected to the package saying it was too ambitious. They are expected to insist on a committee vote, which is rarely resorted to by an organisation with a long-standing commitment to multilateralism and a spirit of compromise. Six Pacific small island developing states, led by the Marshall Islands, also expressed deep disappointment and stated in unison that they could not accept the package. Nonetheless, a large number of delegations, many of whom have participated in the group’s work for years, are expected to urge the committee’s approval. Approval would automatically lead to the new regulations being circulated as draft amendments to Annex VI of the Marine Pollution (MARPOL) Convention, covering air pollution, for formal adoption at an extraordinary session of the committee in October, when the date of international entry into force would also be decided. The Net Zero Framework is meant to apply to international shipping for vessels of 5,000 gt or above. Addressing the group last night, IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez reminded delegates that the package was “only one step on our journey to 2050”. Much more work was needed, he said. The new MARPOL regulations do not include a universal levy, even though this had gained very substantive support by over 60 countries prior to the consolidation of the current draft legal text. They stipulate a two-tier approach to achieving the reduction of global greenhouse gas fuel intensity (GFI) and set indicative base and direct compliance targets, expressed in percentages to be gradually met on a progressive time scale (see table below). On the initiative of Egypt, the group agreed to include a regulation requiring the committee to address the “disproportionately negative Impacts on food security,” particularly on countries exposed to food insecurity, and to keep the potential impacts “under continuous review”. Splashwill be bringing readers an update on Monday on what was agreed in the final hours of the 83rd MEPC, a meeting that also made headlines for theno-show from the US delegation, as well as the creation of the world’s largest emissions control area."

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett reflects on Signalgate and the sale of Hutchison Ports, two events that highlight how ignorant most people are about all things maritime. There is a thing called sea blindness. It is not a disease of seafarers, like scurvy once was. It is not even a mental condition of seafarers, like channel fever still is. It is a mental condition of non-seafarers, and I have just realised that it is sometimes dangerous. As ships grew larger, after World War II, ports and industries that depended on cargoes arriving by sea, such as oil refineries and steelworks, moved out of the cities that had grown up around them, and sprang up on green field sites handy for deep water, on the coast. As this went on, the non-seafaring bulk of the population became less and less familiar with ships and the sea. That’s what created sea blindness, the unawareness of things maritime amongst populations at large. This gives us odd moments of amusement such as when a containership, with a deck stack of containers, is called a tanker, and so on, but until very recently I did not think that it was dangerous. Two things changed my mind. The first was the kerfuffle over CK Hutchison selling its container terminals. From a shipping industry perspective, there may indeed be an anti-trust element, in that, very roughly, Hutchison has about 5% of the world’s container terminals by volume and MSC, who are associated with BlackRock in the buying consortium, also has around 5% of the world’s container terminals, but it is very difficult for anyone in shipping to see a container terminal as any sort of a facility that might have a military use. A container terminal is a reasonably deepwater quay, one or more gantry container cranes, some flat land concreted over, some container handling and stacking equipment, a customs facility, some offices, and road and sometimes rail and river or canal access. We all know that. It has no military application at all. You cannot fly aircraft into or out of a container terminal, you cannot house troops and their equipment in a container terminal, you cannot berth warships in a container terminal because the quayside is in constant use, you cannot maintain anything except the terminal’s own equipment in a container terminal, and that equipment is large, delicate and easily damaged. Maybe the problem is that container terminals like to call themselves ports? Ports are different; ports do have a military value – a remarkably high one, if military logistics are in the picture, but a port is a different thing. A container terminal is a part of a real port or harbour; it is not the port or harbour. And nobody checks. Nations make belligerent noises – about nothing. It would be silly if it were not so dangerous. The second thing was Signalgate – the ludicrous business of half of the Trump cabinet inviting the editor in chief of The Atlantic into an online chat between themselves about bombing Houthi-controlled Yemen, during which both the vice president of the US and the secretary of defence of that nation wondered why they were about to drop bombs on the Houthis when this was only going to benefit Europe. If Vance and Hegseth knew anything about our industry, they would know that the Houthis by effectively quasi-closing the Suez Canal have not affected the arrival and departure of goods travelling by sea to and from Europe, what they have done is to put up freight rates everywhere. Since the Suez Canal, as we all know, and it seems nobody else does, prices its transits by reference to what it would cost a ship to go round Africa, so as to be just a bit cheaper, the difference in voyage cost is present, but it’s not huge. What makes the difference in charter rates is the time factor, which reduces the supply of ships and, because freight demand is not price sensitive, puts the time charter rates and the time charter equivalent rates up. And because a ship can travel anywhere on the high seas where there is water for her, those higher charter rates are just as present in the American trades as in the European trades. The professionals in the US Department of Defence know that, of course. It seems their political masters do not."

The vessel will be built in Poland and transferred to the Netherlands in the fourth quarter of 2025 for fitting and commissioning in the second quarter of 2026. The unit, named Altera, will be equipped with a 25t offshore knuckle boom crane, a mooring system, a 4,500t carousel, a 15t tensioner, and be fit to accommodate up to 99 people. The move to further expand the fleet follows a recent seven-year framework agreement for subsea cable maintenance and repairs with Italy’s Prysmian. The newbuild will be able to operate year-round in both very shallow and deep water conditions on interconnector, export and inter-array cable projects, N-Sea said. Late last year, the company signed up for a hybrid survey and ROV support newbuild in a long-term charter deal with Mainport Shipping. The vessel will also be built by Neptune, with delivery scheduled in the first quarter of 2026."

Hede, Matson, SeaLead, TS Lines, and COSCO are most at risk from the immediate fallout, according to research by Linerlytica, who suggest between 30% and 40% of transpacific container imports are still effectively halted by the tariffs. “The US-China standoff continues to keep container market sentiment poor with US tariff concessions far from sufficient to restore Transpacific volumes with cargo bookings in the next 3 weeks reported to be down by 30-60% in China and by 10-20% in the rest of Asia,” Linerlytica noted in its most recent weekly report. Upcoming Labour Day holidays are likely to further dampen cargo demand in May, possibly forcing carriers to cancel additional sailings over the coming weeks in order to stop further freight rate erosion, Linerlytica suggested. Clarksons Research data suggests that 6% of global container trade in teu is accounted for by US imports from China – the world’s two superpowers – which will now be charged at elevated tariff levels of at least 145%. A further 8% is at the 10% baseline level. “For the smaller niche carriers, the trade war is particularly destructive,” analysts at Sea-Intelligence warned on Sunday. “Most of them rely on large volumes from China on their services and are not well equipped to suddenly switch to alternate non-Chinese origin cargo. For some of these, we can potentially expect full-service closures for the duration of the trade war.” Global carriers are tipped to concentrate port calls at fewer American ports in the coming months while switching some China calls to other Asian manufacturing centres. The trade war is beginning to show up in port numbers with China’s transport ministry reporting today that for the week April 7 to 13, container throughput at China’s ports dropped 6.1%."

        "content": "Shipowners left scratching their heads about the potential financial penalties they face from the new net-zero framework agreement penned at the International Maritime Organization last week have been given a solution. Employees at Singapore’s Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) worked overtime this past weekend to develop a free cost and compliance calculator to help contextualise the penalties. Shipping is set to become the only sector in the world with the first-ever global price on carbon emissions following last week’s 83rd gathering of the Marine Environment Protection Committee at the IMO’s London headquarters. Simply put, from 2028, shipowners who do not meet certain emission targets will have to pay a penalty, buy carbon credits or use credits purchased earlier. While it won’t fully close the current price gap between green and fossil fuels, this first-of-its-kind regulatory framework will bring them closer in an effort to accelerate a transition to cleaner fuels. Ships missing the IMO emission tougher target would initially have to pay $100 annually for every tonne of CO₂ emissions that exceeds this goal. Those falling below the weaker target would have to pay up to $380 for every tonne of emissions above this level. Ships could pay that money to the IMO or buy credits from vessels that meet both targets by running on lower-carbon fuels. The IMO can use these revenues to compensate ships using low-carbon fuels, while investing in decarbonising the maritime sector, and addressing any negative impacts of the measures on food security. GCMD’s new calculator is available for trial byclicking here."

The possible offer is for 35 pence per Wood share in cash to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Wood. Dar Al-Handasah Consultants Shair and Partners, otherwise known as Sidara, would also inject $450m into the UK company. A tranche of $250m would be given upon approval of the offer by Wood, while the remaining $200m would be granted upon completion. In late February, Sidararestarted talkswith would regarding a takeover of the company followingfour failed attempts. At the time, the final offer was 230 pence per Wood share, valuing the company at around £1.58bn ($2bn). This new offer is worth around £242m ($320m) and includes taking on Wood’s outstanding debt of approximately $1.1bn, which the company is looking to refinance. Wood stated that, even though it is looking at a range of alternative refinancing options to provide the company with an appropriate and sustainable long-term capital structure, the possible offer represents “the better option for Wood’s shareholders, creditors, and other stakeholders”. With that in mind, the Wood board has informed Sidara that it would recommend such an offer to shareholders if a firm offer were to come in. Sidara has confirmed that it has made “significant progress” with its due diligence on Wood and that it will “take all required, necessary or advisable steps to satisfy all antitrust and regulatory conditions to the offer”. The conditions for the offer are the publishing of its financial results for 2024, which are currently being audited by Deloitte, legally binding agreements regarding debt modifications, final approvals and approvals from both companies’ boards. According to Wood, the combination with Sidara would create “a leading global engineering consulting company with enhanced scale, capability, and diversification”, and for the company’s employees, this would offer opportunities across a global network of brands."

Under ILO’s Special Tripartite Committee on the MLC, governments, shipowners, and unions met last week to review and adopt crucial updates that reflect the evolving needs of seafarers and the maritime industry. Among the suite of amendments agreed to improve the working and living conditions of seafarers onboard ships were provisions for seafarers to be designated as key workers; strengthened requirements to support seafarer repatriation; new mandatory measures to ensure that they have access to shore leave without needing a visa or special permit; and enhanced protections against bullying and harassment. Helio Vicente, director of employment affairs at the International Chamber of Shipping, a shipowner lobby group, said the amendments were “potentially transformational”. Corinne Vargha, director of the International Labour Standards Department of the ILO, commented: “At a time when the spirit of multilateralism and the added value of tripartism are called into question, the STC demonstrated that tripartite dialogue and multilateralism work can deliver effective solutions to global challenges.” The new measures adopted are expected to be rubberstamped in Geneva, during the 113th Session of ILO’s International Labour Conference at the start of June, coming into force in December 2027."

The master of the Chinese-crewed, Togo-flagged Hong Tai 68 maintains his innocence in one of many cable cutting incidents around the island in recent months. The rest of the crew have been allowed to head home. The ship was able to change its name many times as the crews simply replaced three steel plates (pictured) at its stern and on its bow whereby it has also recently traded as theHong Tai 58andShanmei 7. The captain of the vessel – dubbed in local media as the ‘thousand faces ship’ – had on an earlier occasion been caught entering Taiwan with false documents. Ships from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau are now required to go through longer port visit application processes to the island with the paperwork expected to take up to a month per vessel visit. Ships also flying the flags of Cameroon, Tanzania, Mongolia, Togo and Sierra Leone are also required to fill in the extra filings, many of which will be screened by Taiwanese security officials before being passed on to Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Administration. Like in the Baltic, Taiwan has faced multiple attacks on its subsea infrastructure in recent months, largely from merchant ships dragging their anchors. The island blacklisted 52 Chinese-owned ships in January while Taiwan’s National Security Bureau has said ships which have previously been found to misreport information will be put on a list of ships for priority inspection at ports. Moreover, if these ships enter within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan’s coast and are close to where undersea cables are, the coast guard will be dispatched to board them and investigate."

The duo has revealed the delivery of the 7,000 ceuElectric Starto Noatum Maritime for an undisclosed price tag. S&P sources list the transaction at $115m for the vessel ordered at CIMC Raffles for $85m back in 2022, with another unit named Green Star also sold to the maritime and shipping arm of ports and logistics giant AD Ports Group delivering later in the year. Noatum, which has already renamed the LNG-fuelled ship as UGR Al Samha, will deploy it for trades under a recently formed joint venture with Erkport in Turkey, called United Global Ro-Ro. Atlas booked four car carriers at CIMC Raffles during the low point of the PCTC market amid covid 19 for delivery between 2025 and 2026. The second newduild, entering the market in about three months time, is also expected to go to Noatum at the same price. If confirmed, the resale deal should bring the duo about $60m from both ships. Atlas also has suezmax and aframax/LR2 tankers as well as very large ammonia carriers booked for construction at South Korean yards DH Shipbuilding and Hyundai Heavy Industries, respectively. The Leon Patitsas-led company and EMF made a similar move with two aframax newbuilds ordered at $44m and sold for $77.5m each. “We analysed the fundamentals, fleet demographics, and anticipated that demand for cars would rebound after covid, noted Atlas CEO Patitsas, adding: “Our thesis proved correct, as we witnessed a significant increase in the export of electric cars from China–rising from 1m to nearly 6m cars per annum – a phenomenal growth. Consequently, the demand for car carriers increased, driving up asset values.”"

The vessel is designed as a Group B (A option) UK emergency response and rescue vessel (ERRV), with a fast rescue craft and hybrid daughter craft, and will also meet design criteria for Dutch and Danish ERRV regulations. In addition, the design covers an optional work-to-work gangway, under-deck supplies warehouse and battery hybrid propulsion, making the vessel fit for multiple markets, including offshore wind and transitional energy support, government services, carbon capture, and maritime security. “This new multi-role energy support vessel and the future sister ships mark an exciting step forward in our strategic vision to deliver ‘Blue to Green’ operations,” said Rory Deans, CEO of Sentinel Marine, adding: “The new vessel will be a cornerstone in our journey towards cleaner, multi-sector marine services that remain robust and reliable.” Earlier this year, Singapore-based offshore wind vessel pure-play Cyan Renewables acquired a controlling stake in Sentinel Marine to expand its footprint in the UK market. Commenting on the newbuilding initiative, Keng Lin Lee, CEO of Cyan Renewables, said: “The investment aligns with Sentinel Marine and Cyan Renewables’ shared commitment to sustainable innovation in marine operations, strengthening the group’s capabilities across multiple offshore sectors.”"

Officially launched in November 2023, ODP is Egypt’s first dry port and the first public-private partnership project in the Egyptian transport sector under the EBRD Green Cities program. It was developed, built, and operated by Elsewedy Electric in partnership with the General Authority for Land and Dry Ports (GALDP). A strategic partnership, sealed following French President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit to Egypt, includes a management agreement under which CMA CGM will become involved in the activities and development of the logistics and rail platform of the inland port. ODP is directly connected to all of Egypt’s seaports and serves as a logistics hub, facilitating faster cargo clearance, reducing seaport congestion. CMA CGM, which operates the Tahya Misr container terminal at the Port of Alexandria and the new terminal of Sokhna set to open early next year, said the ODP deal would bolster its operations across Greater Cairo and Upper Egypt as well as in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. “This is a unique opportunity to foster the development of low emission intermodal solutions in Egypt through efficient rail connections,” said Christine Cabau Woehrel, executive vice president of assets and operations at the CMA CGM, adding that the new investment confirms the Group’s long-term commitment to Egyptian supply chain growth. “It combines beautifully our worldwide maritime network to and from Egypt, our investment in the terminals of Alexandria and Sokhna, with the capacity to offer door to door efficient and competitive solutions to our Egyptian customers, opening a new more sophisticated vision of Egyptian supply chain development,” she added. The closure of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals."

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett with financial advice for shipowners amid the Trump market gyrations. Donald Trump has just backed away from the abyss – denying, of course, that he is doing any such thing – and, while adding yet more tariffs to imports from China to the US, he has announced a 90-day moratorium on tariffs over 10% imposed on US imports from most other nations. The US stock markets rose on the social media post, or as Trump would have it, the “truth”, and everyone relaxed a little. But not much, and with good reason. The insane gyrations in US trade policy, dictated as it is by one vain old man, who is prone to speaking in word salad, make it impossible for anyone to carry on international business – the business that we all rely on – in a normal way, and the China- USA trading relationship has become – at least until Trump changes his mind again – effectively impossible. Freight rate collapses start with financial collapses Meanwhile, 10% tariffs – with, by the way, little evidence of a fully staffed, trained, capable and reliable US government department for collecting them – are spread all around. So, how worried should the shipping industry be? Are we headed for a crash? Are we intimidated yet? James Carville, president Clinton’s election strategist, is famous for two remarks. One is “The economy, stupid!”, which carried Bill Clinton into the White House and George Bush out of it, and the other is, “I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the Pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” The bond market just intimidated president Trump. We know how freight rate collapses start. I don’t mean mild corrections in the charter market; I mean collapses, like 1997 and 2008. They start with financial collapses – in the case of 1997, the Asian financial crisis and in the case of 2008 the sub-prime crisis. They start with financial collapses, because, if an importer cannot open a letter of credit – and trade finance is surely the simplest and most routine of all commercial banking activities – he isn’t going to buy whatever he wanted to buy, because he cannot open the letter of credit. The seller isn’t going to be able to negotiate his bill of lading, so he will not bring the cargo forward for loading. The cargo isn’t going to move. Freight rate collapses happen overnight, when ordinary banks decide that they cannot afford to extend trade credit as they normally would do. These crashes are not the same thing as gentle increases in the supply of tonnage; they are sudden events. Of course, we are all wondering if we are about to see another freight rate collapse, brought on by all this tariff malarkey in the White House. Is there a simple way in which ordinary shipping people, with no knowledge of finance, can look at the financial markets, and say to themselves, “This looks as if there might be a financial collapse, which is dangerous for my industry. Maybe I should ask my bosses to not order that new ship?” I think there may be. Try this. As we all know, when economic conditions become more difficult, professional investors move some of their holdings out of equities and into government bonds. Bond prices rise; bond yields fall. Bonds are the safe haven. As long as this goes on, there is no risk of a financial collapse that might affect our market – freight rates. This is just the financial world doing what it does. When economic conditions look more cheerful, the professional investors sell bonds, they buy equities, and bond yields rise. All simple. Let’s suppose this doesn’t happen. Let’s suppose that equity prices fall and bond prices fall at the same time. This is an unusual event and it means one of two things, both of them extremely serious, one of which affects us. One situation – the one that caused Carville to “want to come back as the bond market” – is the “bond vigilante” situation, in which big holders of government bonds express their dislike of a government’s financial policies by selling its bonds. We may consider for a moment that the three biggest holders of US government bonds are China, Japan and, more surprisingly, Britain. There is no sign of any of these holders selling their US treasuries. Yet. Britain was on the receiving end of a bond crash when Liz Truss was, briefly, prime minister. This sort of action is rare; it affects one country, or two allied countries, at a time, and because it is so drastic, it doesn’t last long. We don’t need to bother our heads with that one; it affects governments, but it doesn’t affect freights. The other case occurs when professional investors are selling bonds at a time when they ought to be buying them. They will only be doing that if they urgently need liquidity in order to cover their positions. That’s a financial crisis. Banks are going to be affected; they will cut back, and trade credit will dry up. This is the rising bond yield situation combined with falling share prices that ought to scare us all silly. We are not there yet, but we are close enough to it for financial people to be taking action, and for alarming headlines in financial reporting, including headlines suggesting that US treasury bonds might no longer be a safe haven. So, if you are wondering what to do about that newbuilding order, I suggest that you look at the stock market and the bond market, together. Things could go over the edge. Or they might not. Keep watching the bond curve and the stock graph. Good luck!"

        "content": "CMB.TECH, the shipowning vehicle controlled by the Saverys family, has signed an agreement with Australian miner Fortescue to charter an ammonia-powered vessel ordered in China. The 210,000-dwt ammonia-powered newcastlemax will feature a dual fuel engine and is expected to be delivered by the end of 2026. The Saverys family-controlled bulker arm, Bocimar, and Fortescue have signed an agreement for the vessel. It is part of CMB.TECH’s series of large dry bulk carriers, which is currently on order at Qingdao Beihai Shipyard and is expected to be delivered to Fortescue by the end of next year. It will deliver iron ore from Pilbara in Australia to customers in China and around the world. Fortescue has set a target of eliminating scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian iron ore operations by 2030 and net-zero scope 3 emissions by 2040. Fortescue has been advocating for the early adoption of zero-emission fuels, such as green ammonia, and bypassing transitional fuels like biofuels and LNG. “Our landmark agreement with Bocimar sends a clear signal to the market – now is the time for shipowners to invest in green ammonia-powered ships. The days of ships operating on dirty bunker fuel, which is responsible for 3% of global carbon emissions, are numbered. We will continue to work with like-minded companies like Bocimar to transition our fleet to low and zero-emission vessels and help accelerate the widespread adoption of green ammonia as a marine fuel,” said Dino Otranto, CEO of Fortescue Metals. “Based on our common belief that green ammonia is the fuel of the future, we were able to conclude this important agreement on the road to zero-emission shipping. This is the beginning of an exciting journey to build more ammonia-powered ships that will stimulate more green ammonia production projects. We need to decarbonise today to navigate tomorrow,” added Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. This comes less than a month after Japan’s Mitsui OSK Lines and CMB.TECH partnered up to jointly own and charter nine newbuildings that can run on ammonia fuel. The Tokyo-based firm said the deal covers three ammonia dual-fuel capesize bulkers and six chemical tankers, two of which will be ammonia dual-fuel, while the remaining four will be ammonia-ready. The capes are touted as the world’s first such vessels."

The owner of 13 vessels spread across capesize and newcastlemax segments is selling an unnamed unit to Ever Prosperity Shipping in Singapore for $17.65m. The company’s fleet list and VesselsValue pricing data suggest the 2006-built capesizeChina Progressis set to exit the fleet. The 174,300 dwt unit, estimated as worth around $18.2m, is the oldest in CMT’s fleet, followed by the 177,900 dwt 2009-built capeChina Pride, priced at about $25m. The move indicates CMT, which owns and operates its bulker fleet through Singapore and Hong Kong subsidiaries, is making room for newbuildings booked for construction at fellow yard CSBC Corporation for delivery in 2026 and 2027. The latest sale follows the exit of the 2005-built capesizeChina Peacefor $20.3m last October, CMT’s oldest ship at the time."

Under the contract, the 2023-builtSeaway Ventusjackup installation vessel will begin turbine transport and installation work of GE Vernova Haliade-X offshore wind turbines at the offshore wind farm in mid-2026. This contract represents additional work for Seaway 7 at the Dogger Bank development, where the company already has contracts for transport and installation of the monopile foundations and transition pieces on all three phases of the project, with the works on Dogger Bank A complete and the works on Dogger Bank B substantially complete. Turbine installation and commissioning work is continuing at Dogger Bank A, with completion of the first phase of the offshore wind farm expected in the second half of calendar year 2025. When fully complete, Dogger Bank will be the world’s largest offshore wind farm, capable of powering around 6 million UK homes annually. SSE Renewables is leading the construction of the project on behalf of the joint venture while Equinor will be the lead operator of the wind farm on completion for its expected operational life of around 35 years."

DHT said in a statement that it sold the 2011-builtDHT Lotusand theDHT Peonyfor a combined price of $103m. Splash has previously cited broking sources that claimed that the company sold the 320,000 dwt sister vessels built at Bohai Shipbuilding Heavy Industry in China. After repayment of existing debt on the vessels, amounting to $15.9m in aggregate, the transaction is expected to generate net cash proceeds of approximately $85m. The vessels are expected to be delivered to the new owner in April and July, respectively. According to DHT, the company expects to record gains of $17.5m and $15.5m in the second and third quarters, respectively. The vessels were acquired in 2017 as part of the acquisition of BW Group’s VLCC fleet for an aggregate price of $115.8m. “These two vessels have served us well over the past eight years. We have taken this opportunity to fine-tune our fleet profile, aligning our service offering with customer needs and market trends,” said Svein Moxnes Harfjeld, president and CEO of DHT. With the sale of the duo, DHT became the first VLCC owner known to have sold off all Chinese-built ships following US signals that Chinese-built tonnage could face pricey penalties when calling at American ports. The deal leaves the outfit with 21 Korean-built supertankers in the water and four VLCCs on order."

Under ILO’s Special Tripartite Committee on the MLC, governments, shipowners, and unions met last week to review and adopt crucial updates that reflect the evolving needs of seafarers and the maritime industry. Among the suite of amendments agreed to improve the working and living conditions of seafarers onboard ships were provisions for seafarers to be designated as key workers; strengthened requirements to support seafarer repatriation; new mandatory measures to ensure that they have access to shore leave without needing a visa or special permit; and enhanced protections against bullying and harassment. Helio Vicente, director of employment affairs at the International Chamber of Shipping, a shipowner lobby group, said the amendments were “potentially transformational”. Corinne Vargha, director of the International Labour Standards Department of the ILO, commented: “At a time when the spirit of multilateralism and the added value of tripartism are called into question, the STC demonstrated that tripartite dialogue and multilateralism work can deliver effective solutions to global challenges.” The new measures adopted are expected to be rubberstamped in Geneva, during the 113th Session of ILO’s International Labour Conference at the start of June, coming into force in December 2027."

Using micro modular reactor (MMR) technology, two to five MMRs of 1MWe capacity each will power a 73 m amphibious vessel, designed for emergency response and disaster relief duties in remote areas. This will enable the vessel to operate for eight to 10 years without refuelling, and it can feed power into the shore grid of affected areas and whenever docked at port. Last month, LR along with insurer NorthStandard and London nuclear specialist CORE POWER issued a report calling for UK action on maritime nuclear power. “As nuclear technology advances toward maritime applications including Floating Nuclear Power Plants, global regulatory alignment is crucial. Existing frameworks must be updated to reflect modern reactor designs and operational needs.

These will all need to be fixed before the vessel can carry on its journey to the Russian port of Ust-Luga. The ship had claimed to be flying the flag of Djibouti, but the East African country quickly responded by saying it had de-registered the tanker. Shipping databases show that the vessel was de-registered on January 1 this year. The vessel, sanctioned by many nations, is currently anchored in Muuga Bay and remains under surveillance by the Estonian Navy.

During the shipping boom of 2003 to 2008, Korean yards expanded belatedly massively at home and overseas, only to be hit by more than a decade’s slump in the wake of global financial crisis. Now, with their orderbooks pushing into the late 2020s, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE), Hanwha Ocean and Samsung Heavy Industries are all looking at foreign facilities to fuel expansion. Officials from HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, who run the Hyundai chain of yards, have been in the US recently signing agreements to help develop American yards while also expanding its Vietnam subsidiary. Most interestingly, however, has been its moves at Subic Bay in the Philippines, where the conglomerate has leased a dock from what was the old Hanjin Heavy yard there – a Korean shipbuilder that ran into difficulty a decade ago. Cido Shipping, a Hong Kong-based, Korean owner, has just signed for four aframaxes which will be built at HD KSOE’s Philippine facility with delivery scheduled for 2028. Four bulk carriers, ordered by Japan’s Nissen Kaiun, have also begun construction at the Subic Shipyard. Hanwha Ocean, formerly Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME), is also looking at overseas acquisitions, recently buying a 9.9% stake in Australia’s Austal, to go alongside the acquisition last year of Philly Shipyard in the US, as well as the take over of Singapore offshore yard Dyna-Mac Holdings. Samsung Heavy Industries, meanwhile, is syphoning off more and more work to China, both to its own block manufacturer as well as to PaxOcean, a shipyard in Zhejiang province.

        "content": "The stats surrounding the steep learning curve the US faces if it wants to claw back any market share in shipbuilding are astonishing. Donald Trump, the American president, is taking steps to try and build back the country’s shipyards, creating a shipbuilding office in the White House, and last week signing an executive order creating a Maritime Security Trust Fund to provide sustainable funding for initiatives that strengthen US maritime capabilities. This includes using funds from tariffs, fines, fees, or tax revenues with Trump also expected to rule on penalising Chinese-built tonnage calling at US ports soon. “We’re way, way, way behind,” Trump said last week, speaking in the Oval Office. “We used to build a ship a day, and now we don’t do a ship a year, practically, and we have the capacity to do it.” Overseas shipbuilding firms, notably from South Korea, are busy investing in American infrastructure in recent months. The US accounts for less than 1% of global ship output. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. Labour force-wise, Americans long ago ditched shipyards as a career, as data from Greek broker Ursa shows (see chart below). During the 1950s and 1960s, roughly 1 in every 400 non-farm workers in the US was employed in shipbuilding. Today, it is around one in every 1,000. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans last month in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

        "content": "Amidst all the tariff bombast coming out of the White House last week, liner fortunes actually improved. Global spot indices were up marginally, with Drewry, the British architects of the World Container Index, suggesting that rates will increase in the coming weeks due to tariffs and reduced capacity. “A boom and an early peak season into the US will start right now,” predicted analysts at Danish consultancy Sea-Intelligence in a weekly report, published yesterday. Last week, Trump announced a 90-day pause on a host of global tariffs he had planned, but increased levies on Chinese imports to 145%, while then announcing that some electronic products – including those produced in China – would be exempt.. “All US importers getting cargo from anywhere but China, are sure to fast-track volume in the next three months, to get their peak season goods through customs, before the July 9th deadline,” Sea-Intelligence explained. Clarksons Research data suggests that 6% of global container trade in teu is accounted for by US imports from China – the world’s two superpowers -which will now be charged at elevated tariff levels of at least 145%. A further 8% is at the 10% baseline level. Booking collapsed in the opening days of April as the world grappled with the specifics of the Trump administration’s tariffs. However, with the 90-day tariff ceasefire, container bookings are now picking up fast outside of China. “With tariffs from other trade partners currently on a 90-day pause, shippers are navigating a highly uncertain and fast-changing trade environment. The rest of 2025 is likely to bring continued volatility marked by demand swings, accelerated ordering patterns, and a re-evaluation of sourcing strategies the global response to these trade actions continues to unfold,” stated an update from TradeView a platform powered by Vizion in partnership with Dun & Bradstreet’s Shipping Insights dataset. Global carriers are tipped to concentrate port calls at fewer American ports in the coming months, while switching some China calls to other Asian manufacturing centres. “For the smaller niche carriers, the trade war is particularly destructive,” Sea-Intelligence warned yesterday. “Most of them rely on large volumes from China on their services and are not well equipped to suddenly switch to alternate non-Chinese origin cargo. For some of these we can potentially expect full-service closures, for the duration of the trade war.”"

        "content": "The need for a vote and the number of abstentions spoke volumes about Friday’s conclusion of the 83rd gathering of the Marine Environmental Protection Committee at the London headquarters of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The final agreement on mid-terms measures was branded “weak” by Dr Nishatabbas Rehmatulla, principal research fellow at London’s UCL Energy Institute as it does not reduce the sector’s emissions in line with targets in the IMO’s revised greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy. However, it does send a signal on the phase out of fossil fuels. The agreement constitutes a fuel standard, as such a mandate on the GHG intensity of energy used, coupled with a pricing and trading mechanism. Ships that do not reduce their intensity of GHG emissions – including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — in line with two reduction trajectories outlined in the new regulations, which still need to be promulgated at the next MEPC in October, are deemed to have an emissions deficit. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies blocked progress at every turn This must then be addressed by buying so-called remedial units. For compliance with a so-called base target trajectory, the units will cost $380 per ton of CO2-equivalent emissions. For what is called a direct compliance target, they’ll cost $100. Both prices are only for 2028-2030, with future figures to be decided at a later date. The IMO, for its part, hailed the new net-zero framework, due to come into force in 2027, as the first in the world to combine mandatory emissions limits and GHG pricing across an entire industry sector. “The approval of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI mandating the IMO net-zero framework represents another significant step in our collective efforts to combat climate change, to modernise shipping and demonstrates that IMO delivers on its commitments,” commented IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez. Many states had been pushing for a universal carbon levy at last week’s MEPC, something that was quashed. The controversy surrounding the green summit saw the US delegation not even show up at the IMO, while the compromise deal was submitted to a vote. Formal votes at the IMO are extremely rare. The outcome of the vote was 25 countries abstained, 63 member states were in favour, and 16 opposed. The levels of revenues expected from the current policy specifications of approximately $11 to $12bn per annum were deemed insufficient by UCL Energy Institute relative to the scale required to both support early adoption of zero near zero fuels, and to fund a just and equitable transition. “Consequently, this revenue shortfall may create a competitive tension between these two objectives, thus, increasing the likelihood that neither objectives can be achieved at a level sufficient for climate and equitability,” UCL Energy Institute stated in a readout following the end of the environmental gathering. A disgruntled Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s minister of climate change adaptation, meteorology, geo-hazards, environment, energy, and disaster management, said: “Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5°C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn. These countries – and others – failed to support a set of measures that would have gotten the shipping industry onto a 1.5°C pathway. And they turned away a proposal for a reliable source of revenue for those of us in dire need of finance to help with climate impacts.” Wilfried Lemmens, managing director of the Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association, expressed frustration at the lack of a universal carbon levy. “The Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association regrets that the IMO member states have not succeeded in agreeing on a global levy, as this would have been the simplest and most efficient way for the maritime sector to achieve the climate objectives,” he said. More upbeat, Guy Platten, the outgoing secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping, said: “Today will hopefully be remembered as a historic moment for our industry. If formally adopted, shipping will be the first sector to have a globally agreed carbon price.” While conceding Friday’s agreement was not perfect, Platten said he hoped it would provide the certainty which energy producers urgently need to de-risk their huge investment decisions. “The compromise reached by IMO member states is clearly not up to the challenge that awaits the shipping sector,” said Bastien Bonnet-Cantalloube, an expert on transport decarbonisation oat Carbon Market Watch., commented: ”Not enough emission reductions, not enough emissions priced, not priced high enough, not enough revenues. By ignoring the problem, the IMO will not make it go away. This marks a missed opportunity to set an example for other sectors to agree on ambitious global measures for their decarbonisation. Governments in the IMO clearly have work left to set the course for a just and ambitious decarbonisation pathway for international shipping. More ambitious regional and industry actions are needed to make up for this blatantly weak deal.”"

        "content": "The government of Lithuania is undertaking preparatory work to relaunch a tender for the development of a 700MW offshore wind project in the Baltic Sea. The tender was suspended in January to ensure that the impact on final electricity prices was minimised. The tender was launched for the second time in November 2024 after its first iteration failed to attract enough proposals. Now, the Baltic country has revealed that it would be relaunching the tender. The decision to go ahead came after the country’s government approved amendments to the terms of the tender that include indexing the transaction price for eight years from the date of confirmation of the tender winner, rather than the 23 years in the previous tender conditions. This is expected to help reduce the need for support by around €500m ($570m). The tender will be considered valid if at least two participants take part. The changes will now be considered by the parliament. The final decision is expected to be made during April or at the beginning of May after parliament gives its thumbs up. If everything goes as planned, the relaunch could be expected at the beginning of June. Lithuanian energy minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas invited developers to actively bid in this upcoming contract for difference auction with a ceiling of €125 ($138.5) per MWh. The country’s first offshore wind tender was won by Lithuanian utility Ignitis in partnership with Ocean Winds."

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett reflects on Signalgate and the sale of Hutchison Ports, two events that highlight how ignorant most people are about all things maritime. There is a thing called sea blindness. It is not a disease of seafarers, like scurvy once was. It is not even a mental condition of seafarers, like channel fever still is. It is a mental condition of non-seafarers, and I have just realised that it is sometimes dangerous. As ships grew larger, after World War II, ports and industries that depended on cargoes arriving by sea, such as oil refineries and steelworks, moved out of the cities that had grown up around them, and sprang up on green field sites handy for deep water, on the coast. As this went on, the non-seafaring bulk of the population became less and less familiar with ships and the sea. That’s what created sea blindness, the unawareness of things maritime amongst populations at large. This gives us odd moments of amusement such as when a containership, with a deck stack of containers, is called a tanker, and so on, but until very recently I did not think that it was dangerous. Two things changed my mind. The first was the kerfuffle over CK Hutchison selling its container terminals. From a shipping industry perspective, there may indeed be an anti-trust element, in that, very roughly, Hutchison has about 5% of the world’s container terminals by volume and MSC, who are associated with BlackRock in the buying consortium, also has around 5% of the world’s container terminals, but it is very difficult for anyone in shipping to see a container terminal as any sort of a facility that might have a military use. A container terminal is a reasonably deepwater quay, one or more gantry container cranes, some flat land concreted over, some container handling and stacking equipment, a customs facility, some offices, and road and sometimes rail and river or canal access. We all know that. It has no military application at all. You cannot fly aircraft into or out of a container terminal, you cannot house troops and their equipment in a container terminal, you cannot berth warships in a container terminal because the quayside is in constant use, you cannot maintain anything except the terminal’s own equipment in a container terminal, and that equipment is large, delicate and easily damaged. Maybe the problem is that container terminals like to call themselves ports? Ports are different; ports do have a military value – a remarkably high one, if military logistics are in the picture, but a port is a different thing. A container terminal is a part of a real port or harbour; it is not the port or harbour. And nobody checks. Nations make belligerent noises – about nothing. It would be silly if it were not so dangerous. The second thing was Signalgate – the ludicrous business of half of the Trump cabinet inviting the editor in chief of The Atlantic into an online chat between themselves about bombing Houthi-controlled Yemen, during which both the vice president of the US and the secretary of defence of that nation wondered why they were about to drop bombs on the Houthis when this was only going to benefit Europe. If Vance and Hegseth knew anything about our industry, they would know that the Houthis by effectively quasi-closing the Suez Canal have not affected the arrival and departure of goods travelling by sea to and from Europe, what they have done is to put up freight rates everywhere. Since the Suez Canal, as we all know, and it seems nobody else does, prices its transits by reference to what it would cost a ship to go round Africa, so as to be just a bit cheaper, the difference in voyage cost is present, but it’s not huge. What makes the difference in charter rates is the time factor, which reduces the supply of ships and, because freight demand is not price sensitive, puts the time charter rates and the time charter equivalent rates up. And because a ship can travel anywhere on the high seas where there is water for her, those higher charter rates are just as present in the American trades as in the European trades. The professionals in the US Department of Defence know that, of course. It seems their political masters do not."

A total of 45 cases of piracy and armed robbery against ships were recorded in the first three months of 2025 – an almost 35% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Of the incidents reported, 37 vessels were boarded, four were hijacked, and four had attempted attacks. The threat to crew safety remains high, with 37 crew members taken hostage, 13 kidnapped, two threatened, and one injured. The Q1 report highlights a spike in recorded incidents in the Singapore Strait as 27 incidents were reported from vessels transiting these waters compared to seven for the same period in 2024 withSplashreporting regularly on attacks in the Southeast Asia region in recent months. While most incidents were considered low-level opportunistic crimes, crewmembers were at great risk with guns reported in 14 incidents. In 2024, guns were reported in 26 incidents globally. Ten crewmembers were taken hostage in six separate incidents, two were threatened, and one was reported injured. 92% of all vessels targeted in the Singapore Strait were successfully boarded, including nine bulk carriers and tankers over 100,000 dwt in size. IMB director Michael Howlett said: “The reported rise of incidents in the Singapore Straits is concerning, highlighting the urgent need to protect the safety of seafarers navigating these waters. Ensuring the security of these vital routes is essential, and all necessary measures must be taken to safeguard crewmembers.”"

The vessels that will be deployed for the import of raw materials have been designed to reduce the environmental footprint of Skretting’s supply chain. The newly designed units feature energy-efficient hulls and multi-fuel propulsion systems expected to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by about 30% compared to conventional vessels, Vertom said. The Rhoon-based outfit, which operates over 100 vessels ranging from 1,500 to 12,000 dwt, will own the newbuilds and oversee their construction, most of which are scheduled for completion in 2026. Strand Shipping will manage the vessels, which will be capable of running on biofuels and fitted with shore-power connections. Where feasible, wind-assisted propulsion will also be integrated in addition to several other decarbonisation measures aimed at enhancing overall environmental performance, Vertom noted. Last November, Vertom ordered four geared tweendeckers atChowgule Shipyardsin India for delivery in 2027 and 2028.

        "content": "With Donald Trump widely tipped to pass judgement on extra fees for Chinese-linked tonnage calling at US ports in the next couple of days, another wrinkle has emerged that has not been widely discussed in Washington to date. Trump’s tariff war against China late last week backtracked as his administration took on advice from the tech sector, who pointed out that global supply chains for the manufacturing of much tech, such as smartphones, inevitably involves some Chinese produced items. Consequently, Trump exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from reciprocal tariffs last weekend. Similarly, the Trump administration might have to make concessions when it passes judgement on Chinese tonnage calling at US ports, as many Japanese and Korean yards subcontract much of their construction to China these days. Following an investigation into Chinese shipbuilding practices, and with the aim of resuscitating American shipyards, the US Trade Representative has recommended a triple-pronged set of potential fees for Chinese-linked vessels that could have amounted to as much as $3.5m per US port call, something that drew nearly 400 responses, mostly negative, when a public hearing was held last month. Trump is expected to make his ruling on the investigation before the end of this week. Appearing in front of a Senate Finance Committee last week, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said his organisation had taken onboard the huge volume of complaints registered during a public hearing into proposals to charge companies with Chinese tonnage on their books extra for port calls in the US. “They’re not all going to be implemented. They’re not all going to be stacked,” Greer said last week.

The shipping arm of India’s Bothra Group has contracted Asakawa Shipbuilding for two 26,000 dwt stainless steel chemical carriers and one 20,000 dwt unit at Fukuoka Shipbuilding. The vessels delivering in 2027 and 2028 are estimated by shipbuilding sources at more than $48m and about $40m each, respectively. The company, which currently operates three stainless steel units built between 2000 and 2006, will also be adding a trio of 40,000 dwt newbuildings from Nantong Xiangyu Offshore & Marine Engineering, with delivery set for 2028. Established in 2004, Jaldhi has in recent years booked multiple newbuilds in addition to the latest chemical tanker series. The company currently sits on a diversified orderbook of post-panamax and ultramax bulkers, MR tankers, as well as LPG and very large ammonia carriers."

        "content": "With Donald Trump widely tipped to pass judgement on extra fees for Chinese-linked tonnage calling at US ports in the next couple of days, another wrinkle has emerged that has not been widely discussed in Washington to date. Trump’s tariff war against China late last week backtracked as his administration took on advice from the tech sector, who pointed out that global supply chains for the manufacturing of much tech, such as smartphones, inevitably involves some Chinese produced items. Consequently, Trump exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from reciprocal tariffs last weekend. Similarly, the Trump administration might have to make concessions when it passes judgement on Chinese tonnage calling at US ports, as many Japanese and Korean yards subcontract much of their construction to China these days. Following an investigation into Chinese shipbuilding practices, and with the aim of resuscitating American shipyards, the US Trade Representative has recommended a triple-pronged set of potential fees for Chinese-linked vessels that could have amounted to as much as $3.5m per US port call, something that drew nearly 400 responses, mostly negative, when a public hearing was held last month. Trump is expected to make his ruling on the investigation before the end of this week. Appearing in front of a Senate Finance Committee last week, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said his organisation had taken onboard the huge volume of complaints registered during a public hearing into proposals to charge companies with Chinese tonnage on their books extra for port calls in the US. “They’re not all going to be implemented. They’re not all going to be stacked,” Greer said last week. Like the tech pullback, Washington might be forced to make concessions as so many shipyard alternatives – such as Tsuneishi and Kawasaki Heavy in Japan and Samsung Heavy Industries in South Korea – have extensive production facilities in China.

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett reflects on Signalgate and the sale of Hutchison Ports, two events that highlight how ignorant most people are about all things maritime. There is a thing called sea blindness. It is not a disease of seafarers, like scurvy once was. It is not even a mental condition of seafarers, like channel fever still is. It is a mental condition of non-seafarers, and I have just realised that it is sometimes dangerous. As ships grew larger, after World War II, ports and industries that depended on cargoes arriving by sea, such as oil refineries and steelworks, moved out of the cities that had grown up around them, and sprang up on green field sites handy for deep water, on the coast. As this went on, the non-seafaring bulk of the population became less and less familiar with ships and the sea. That’s what created sea blindness, the unawareness of things maritime amongst populations at large. This gives us odd moments of amusement such as when a containership, with a deck stack of containers, is called a tanker, and so on, but until very recently I did not think that it was dangerous. Two things changed my mind. The first was the kerfuffle over CK Hutchison selling its container terminals. From a shipping industry perspective, there may indeed be an anti-trust element, in that, very roughly, Hutchison has about 5% of the world’s container terminals by volume and MSC, who are associated with BlackRock in the buying consortium, also has around 5% of the world’s container terminals, but it is very difficult for anyone in shipping to see a container terminal as any sort of a facility that might have a military use. A container terminal is a reasonably deepwater quay, one or more gantry container cranes, some flat land concreted over, some container handling and stacking equipment, a customs facility, some offices, and road and sometimes rail and river or canal access. We all know that. It has no military application at all. You cannot fly aircraft into or out of a container terminal, you cannot house troops and their equipment in a container terminal, you cannot berth warships in a container terminal because the quayside is in constant use, you cannot maintain anything except the terminal’s own equipment in a container terminal, and that equipment is large, delicate and easily damaged. Maybe the problem is that container terminals like to call themselves ports? Ports are different; ports do have a military value – a remarkably high one, if military logistics are in the picture, but a port is a different thing. A container terminal is a part of a real port or harbour; it is not the port or harbour. And nobody checks. Nations make belligerent noises – about nothing. It would be silly if it were not so dangerous. The second thing was Signalgate – the ludicrous business of half of the Trump cabinet inviting the editor in chief of The Atlantic into an online chat between themselves about bombing Houthi-controlled Yemen, during which both the vice president of the US and the secretary of defence of that nation wondered why they were about to drop bombs on the Houthis when this was only going to benefit Europe. If Vance and Hegseth knew anything about our industry, they would know that the Houthis by effectively quasi-closing the Suez Canal have not affected the arrival and departure of goods travelling by sea to and from Europe, what they have done is to put up freight rates everywhere. Since the Suez Canal, as we all know, and it seems nobody else does, prices its transits by reference to what it would cost a ship to go round Africa, so as to be just a bit cheaper, the difference in voyage cost is present, but it’s not huge. What makes the difference in charter rates is the time factor, which reduces the supply of ships and, because freight demand is not price sensitive, puts the time charter rates and the time charter equivalent rates up. And because a ship can travel anywhere on the high seas where there is water for her, those higher charter rates are just as present in the American trades as in the European trades. The professionals in the US Department of Defence know that, of course. It seems their political masters do not."

        "content": "The scourge of crew abandonment is proving very hard for global administrators to rein in. A total of 54 ships and their crews have been abandoned so far this year, according to data carried by the International Labour Organization (ILO), putting 2025 potentially on track to be the second-highest toll for ships being ditched by their owners. Cases of crew abandonment more than doubled last year from 2023’s record levels to set an alarming new high with experts linking the rise to the ongoing growth of the so-called shadow fleet. According to data from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) there were 310 cases of crew abandonment registered last year, up 118% over 2023’s record total of 142. Cases of seafarers being left to rot on abandoned vessels have picked up dramatically in the 2020s, first thanks to the covid pandemic, and latterly in step with the increasing size of the dark fleet. Crew abandonment was discussed at the headquarters of the ILO where officials met to update the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC). Among the suite of MLC amendments agreed last week to improve the working and living conditions of seafarers onboard ships were provisions for seafarers to be designated as key workers; strengthened requirements to support seafarer repatriation; new mandatory measures to ensure that they have access to shore leave without needing a visa or special permit; and enhanced protections against bullying and harassment. Guidelines on how to deal with seafarer abandonment were adopted by a joint ILO and IMO tripartite working group in late 2022, although the continued rise in crew abandonment cases in the intervening years shows how intractable the problem is. “The rising tide of seafarer abandonment must be stemmed. Shipping’s good deeds are overshadowed by this abuse. Fake flags, dark fleets, and turmoil create a breeding ground for exploitation. This should serve as a red flag for our entire industry, and we need a system overhaul to protect seafarers and to hold abusers to account,” Steven Jones, the founder of the Seafarers Happiness Index, toldSplashlast year."

        "content": "Suba Sivandran, director of strategy, M&A and advanced services at Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore, gives readers an idea of the savings that are possible by installing wind tech on ships trading in Europe. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has finalised new measures that should provide a framework to decarbonise shipping. This is a pivotal moment as the sector needs to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternative fuels and innovative technologies, such as wind propulsion systems (WPS). Against this backdrop, recent regional regulations – like the EU’s Emission Trading System (ETS) and FuelEU Maritime (FEUM) – have already started to influence the investment and operational strategies of shipowners and operators. These regulations are encouraging owners and operators to adapt their operations to enhance efficiency whilst engaging with developing clean technologies, paving the way for a more sustainable future in maritime transport. With the development of alternative fuels in its nascent stages, wind propulsion has emerged as a competitive long-term solution for reducing the operating costs of vessels, particularly for those trading within the EU. As part of the newly introduced FuelEU Maritime regulation, vessels using wind propulsion technologies benefit from the framework’s wind rewards factor (WRF), a mechanism designed to incentivize the adoption of wind propulsion technologies. WRF offers up to a 5% reduction on the GHG calculation of energy used onboard for those vessels where wind propulsion accounts for 15% or more of the propulsive power used onboard. Furthermore, WPS also contributes to improving a ship’s Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI), and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) ratings. This aligns perfectly with the industry’s imperative to decarbonize. The adoption of WPS technology is clearly developing at pace. As of February 2025, more than 125 of these systems have been installed on over 57 ships, in addition to 17 already prepared for potential installation. In fact, a recent study suggested that over 1,600 ships will be ordered by 2030, and by 2050, it is estimated that 30% of the entire global fleet will have engaged with wind propulsion technology. Many of these will be classed by Bureau Veritas. As an accredited verifier of alternative fuels as well as pooling compliance under FEUM, Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore (BV) has recently developed a suite of tools to model the impact of EU and IMO regulations on shipping. This modelling demonstrates that vessels trading at least partially in the EU can achieve substantial savings by engaging with WPS technology. For example, an ultramax vessel trading internationally with the EU could see nearly a 20% reduction in operating costs from 2025-2040 if it uses wind assistance, compared to a reference vessel running on Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFOe). The operating cost benefits remain evident even when accounting for the initial CAPEX implications of installing WPS technology. Wind-assisted vessels, combined with a small biofuel mix, could see further reductions in operational costs in the period from 2035-2040. Wind assistance proves to be equally or even more competitive in the long term compared to biofuels. BV’s analysis indicates that by 2030, the operating costs for an ultramax vessel using 3% biofuel and one utilising wind assistance would be nearly identical, even after factoring in the additional capex of wind assistance (amortised over 15 years). Both strategies could reduce operating costs by approximately 12% compared to a reference vessel running on VLSFOe. Looking toward 2040, a vessel using 10% biofuel would cut its operating costs by 54%. Conversely, a vessel with wind assistance and 3% biofuel to comply with FEUM regulations could reduce its operating costs by over 60%. These figures illustrate wind propulsion as a key component in the future of sustainable maritime transport. By engaging with WPS technologies, vessels can effectively reduce their fuel consumption and emissions, assisting them in meeting stricter emission standards while contributing to the EU’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. BV’s recent modelling study underscores the critical role of WPS technology in navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. Wind propulsion represents a competitive long-term solution for minimising vessel operating costs whilst supporting regulatory compliance."

        "content": "Many of shipping’s go-to bodies for trade forecasts are now slashing economic predictions for the year ahead in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff war. Creating significant alarm, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has warned global merchandise trade for 2025 could drop by as much as -1.5%, potentially becoming only the sixth time in the past 60 years where a decline in world merchandise trade has been registered, joining famous economic shocks in modern history such as covid and the global financial crisis. The volume of world merchandise trade is expected to decline by 0.2% in 2025 under current conditions, nearly three percentage points lower than what would have been expected under a low tariff baseline scenario, according to the WTO secretariat’s latest Global Trade Outlook and Statistics report released yesterday. This is premised on the tariff situation as of April 14. Trade could shrink even further, to -1.5% in 2025, if the situation deteriorates come July 9 when Trump could slap more tariffs around the world. WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said: “I am deeply concerned by the uncertainty surrounding trade policy, including the US-China stand-off.” She said the enduring uncertainty threatens to act as a “brake” on global growth. Also voicing tariff concerns yesterday, the UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) warned the world economy is on a recessionary trajectory. Global growth is projected to slow to 2.3% in 2025, according to a new report from UNCTAD which cites trade policy shocks, financial volatility and a surge in uncertainty. “Trade policy uncertainty is at a historical high,” the report noted, “and this is already translating into delayed investment decisions and reduced hiring.” For tanker owners, both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC have revised down their global oil demand growth projections for 2025 and 2026, citing headwinds from ongoing trade tensions—most notably the protectionist measures introduced by Trump. OPEC’s updated forecast now anticipates an increase of 1.3m barrels per day for both years, representing roughly 1% annual growth. The IEA revised its global oil demand forecast 300,000 barrels per day downwards to 730,000 barrels per day in 2025 and to 690,000 barrels per day in 2026. The US Energy Information Administration recently slashed its 2025 growth forecast by 30%, down to 900,000 barrels per day, while Goldman Sachs projects an even more conservative rise of 300,000 barrels per day between the end of last year and the end of 2025. For the container trades, a recent report from Linerlytica noted: “The US-China standoff continues to keep container market sentiment poor with US tariff concessions far from sufficient to restore Transpacific volumes with cargo bookings in the next 3 weeks reported to be down by 30-60% in China and by 10-20% in the rest of Asia.” In related news, California on Wednesday filed a lawsuit seeking to block Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign trading partners, accusing him of abusing his powers and inflicting financial harm on the state and nation."

        "content": "Antonis Malaxianakis, founder and CEO of HarborLab, a port cost management platform, is willing to do what few others in maritime tech dare – going public on return on investment (ROI) numbers, something he’ll also happily share with delegates attending Geneva Dry, due to open on April 28. HarborLab is an AI-powered port cost management software solution providing disbursement account (DA) analysis across every port call, something that will likely come up for discussion during Geneva Dry’s Digital Efficiency Drivers At Port session due to kick off Day Two at the show on April 29. “Owners demand and deserve a clear ROI. And that’s exactly where HarborLab stands out. We’re not just tech for tech’s sake. We’re a platform that delivers tangible, measurable value, and we’ve proven it,” says Malaxianakis, who founded HarborLab five years ago. An an example, he cites a dry bulk operator with a fleet of 20 vessels who saved $792,000 via HarborLab in two years – something that works out at $1,533 saving per port call. “That’s the kind of return owners understand and appreciate,” Malaxianakis says. ROI isn’t just about savings, he says, maintaining it’s also about scalability and efficiency. Thanks to HarborLab’s AI-powered automations and insights, one person is now able to manage 40 vessels and communication among all stakeholders is enhanced. “That’s not replacing humans—it’s empowering them to focus on high-impact decisions while the system handles the heavy lifting,” Malaxianakis explains. “We stand out because HarborLab doesn’t just streamline—it redefines how DAs are managed. We’re creating a future where disruption means empowerment, where our customers take back transparency and control over their port call expenses,” insists Malaxianakis. On Geneva Dry, the Greek tech CEO says: “It’s a chance to connect with like-minded visionaries and challenge the industry status quo.” As well as familiar sessions such as iron ore, coal, agri-commodities, minor bulks and dry decarbonisation, Geneva Dry 2025 features some new panels including a 50-minute special of forward freight agreements, a chartering spotlight, while digital efficiency drivers at port and then at sea will form the first two sessions on Day Two. Another highlight based on how much discussion there was on the topic at this year’s event will be a high-level discussion on electric vehicles and how they are supercharging dry bulk."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "The latest American sanctions aimed at Iran’s oil industry make specific warnings to shipping about the use of substandard shipping. The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) yesterday designated a China-based independent teapot refinery, Shandong Shengxing Chemical, for its role in purchasing more than $1bn worth of Iranian crude oil, as well as imposing additional sanctions on several companies and vessels responsible for facilitating Iranian oil shipments to China as part of Iran’s shadow fleet. “Any refinery, company, or broker that chooses to purchase Iranian oil or facilitate Iran’s oil trade places itself at serious risk,” said secretary of the treasury Scott Bessent. “The United States is committed to disrupting all actors providing support to Iran’s oil supply chain, which the regime uses to support its terrorist proxies and partners.” This also marks the sixth round of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales since president Donald Trump issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 (NSPM-2), instituting a campaign of maximum economic pressure on Iran. Newly sanctioned vessels include theNyantara, Reston, Bestla, EgretandRani. OFAC also issued an updated sanctions advisory to assist the global shipping and maritime industry in identifying sanctions evasion practices related to the shipment of Iranian-origin fuel products while targeting known Asian insurers of shadow fleet vessels. Shadow fleet tankers rely on flag registries with lower operating and due diligence standards, OFAC warned yesterday, in advice that covered the rise of false-flagged ships and fraudulent registries. “When vessels are registered by jurisdictions known to service shadow fleet vessels or have flown multiple flags in an uncommonly short period of time (e.g., three flag registration changes within a year’s time), maritime stakeholders, including charterers, shipbrokers, insurers and port agents and operators, should request additional documentation on the vessel’s ownership, voyage history, and flag history,” OFAC advised. This may include utilising publicly available resources, such as the IMO’s Global Integrated Shipping Information (GISIS) database, to determine if a vessel is flying a false or unknown flag. In his first term, Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed a full embargo on Iran’s crude oil exports in 2019. As a result, Iran’s crude oil shipments collapsed from 2.5m barrels per day in the first half of 2018 to 250,000 barrels per day. During the Biden administration, sanctions were not as strictly enforced, and Iranian exports gradually recovered. In the opening months of Trump’s return to power, there have been many new sanctions packages aimed at Iran’s shadow fleet as well as Iran’s ties to the Houthis in Yemen."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "The stats surrounding the steep learning curve the US faces if it wants to claw back any market share in shipbuilding are astonishing. Donald Trump, the American president, is taking steps to try and build back the country’s shipyards, creating a shipbuilding office in the White House, and last week signing an executive order creating a Maritime Security Trust Fund to provide sustainable funding for initiatives that strengthen US maritime capabilities. This includes using funds from tariffs, fines, fees, or tax revenues with Trump also expected to rule on penalising Chinese-built tonnage calling at US ports soon. “We’re way, way, way behind,” Trump said last week, speaking in the Oval Office. “We used to build a ship a day, and now we don’t do a ship a year, practically, and we have the capacity to do it.” Overseas shipbuilding firms, notably from South Korea, are busy investing in American infrastructure in recent months. The US accounts for less than 1% of global ship output. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. Labour force-wise, Americans long ago ditched shipyards as a career, as data from Greek broker Ursa shows (see chart below). During the 1950s and 1960s, roughly 1 in every 400 non-farm workers in the US was employed in shipbuilding. Today, it is around one in every 1,000. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans last month in an OpEd, arguing: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.”"

        "content": "The scourge of crew abandonment is proving very hard for global administrators to rein in. A total of 54 ships and their crews have been abandoned so far this year, according to data carried by the International Labour Organization (ILO), putting 2025 potentially on track to be the second-highest toll for ships being ditched by their owners. Cases of crew abandonment more than doubled last year from 2023’s record levels to set an alarming new high with experts linking the rise to the ongoing growth of the so-called shadow fleet. According to data from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) there were 310 cases of crew abandonment registered last year, up 118% over 2023’s record total of 142. Cases of seafarers being left to rot on abandoned vessels have picked up dramatically in the 2020s, first thanks to the covid pandemic, and latterly in step with the increasing size of the dark fleet. Crew abandonment was discussed at the headquarters of the ILO where officials met to update the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC). Among the suite of MLC amendments agreed last week to improve the working and living conditions of seafarers onboard ships were provisions for seafarers to be designated as key workers; strengthened requirements to support seafarer repatriation; new mandatory measures to ensure that they have access to shore leave without needing a visa or special permit; and enhanced protections against bullying and harassment. Guidelines on how to deal with seafarer abandonment were adopted by a joint ILO and IMO tripartite working group in late 2022, although the continued rise in crew abandonment cases in the intervening years shows how intractable the problem is. “The rising tide of seafarer abandonment must be stemmed. Shipping’s good deeds are overshadowed by this abuse. Fake flags, dark fleets, and turmoil create a breeding ground for exploitation. This should serve as a red flag for our entire industry, and we need a system overhaul to protect seafarers and to hold abusers to account,” Steven Jones, the founder of the Seafarers Happiness Index, toldSplashlast year."

Also exempt are empty bulk carriers arriving at US ports to load up with exports such as wheat and soybeans. The measures announced yesterday do not apply to container vessels smaller than 4,000 teu.

For container shipping, where Chinese operators COSCO and OOCL typically operate ships of around 13,000 teu on the transpacific – equivalent to around 60,000 net tons – this translates to to fees of $8.4m per vessel, according to calculations by Lars Jensen, the head of container advisory Vespucci Maritime, who noted today that the new US proposals have no upper limit charges, while the previous proposal had a $1m limit. “Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce,” US trade representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer said in a statement. “The Trump administration’s actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain, and send a demand signal for US-built ships.” Not done on its mission to target Chinese maritime infrastructure, the USTR has set May 19 as the date for a hearing into 100% tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes, chassis that carry containers and chassis parts. While US steel and shipbuilding unions applauded the news from the Trump administration, many shippers voiced concern, amid a time when trade on the transpacific is already collapsing because of the trade war between China and the US. “We are deeply concerned that the newly announced port fees and shipping mandates are destined to have devastating consequences for American workers, consumers, and exporters,” said Nate Herman, senior vice president of policy at the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA). Analysts at Signal Ocean, a Greek maritime data analytics company, said the new fees represent a “major cost shock”. “The short- to medium-term consequences may include rising freight rates, reduced export competitiveness, and shifts in trade routes.

        "content": "Nonprofit ocean conservation organisation Oceana has revealed the destructive legacy of theDeepwater Horizondisaster, which marked its 15th anniversary on Easter Sunday, April 20. TheDeepwater Horizondisaster still remains the worst oil spill in US history, with 11 people tragically killed in the rig explosion that caused one of the most damaging environmental catastrophes the country has ever seen. Oil gushed from the seafloor for 87 days, spewing 134m gallons into the Gulf of Mexico. Toxic sludge washed up on 1,300m of shoreline, from Texas to Florida, oiling beaches and wetlands and killing tens of thousands of birds, sea turtles, and dolphins, among other marine life. In its research, Oceana found that the oil spill’s deep-sea footprint covered an area almost nine times greater than previously reported. The spill spread over 2,860 sq km of ocean, which equates to nearly 50 times the size of Manhattan. The impact of the spill also led to the loss of more than 25,000 jobs and $2.3bn in industry output. Oceana noted that the small dolphin population densities declined by up to 43%, while those of sperm whales declined by up to 31%. The population density of Cuvier’s beaked whales and Gervais’ beaked whales declined by 75% and 83%, respectively. Some Gulf fish species, such as white marlin, showed little to no recovery. In their research, the conservation organisation reported that US Coast Guard service members involved in the cleanup suffered from long-term endocrine and metabolic conditions. “On this solemn 15th anniversary, we face a new deluge of misguided efforts to expand offshore drilling into new and deeper areas that would risk more catastrophes. Oceana calls on lawmakers to reject any drilling expansion and permanently protect our coasts from offshore drilling,” said Oceana campaign director Joseph Gordon. “This anniversary is not just a memory of what was lost, but a call to protect what remains and fight for a healthy Gulf free from fossil fuels,” added Breon Robinson, Southwest Louisiana/Southeast Texas organiser for Healthy Gulf. These messages, however, fell on deaf ears as the secretary of the Department of the Interior, Doug Burgum, launched the country’s 11th Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing program only a day after Oceana’s report came out. More than 7,300 oil spills occurred in federal waters between 2010 and 2022 — an average of over one spill every day, either during exploration, production, or transportation. A poll released by Oceana in July 2024 revealed that two-thirds of American voters (64%) support their elected officials protecting U.S. coastlines from new offshore drilling, with similar support among registered voters in coastal states (66%)."

DHT said in a statement that it sold the 2011-builtDHT Lotusand theDHT Peonyfor a combined price of $103m. Splash has previously cited broking sources that claimed that the company sold the 320,000 dwt sister vessels built at Bohai Shipbuilding Heavy Industry in China. After repayment of existing debt on the vessels, amounting to $15.9m in aggregate, the transaction is expected to generate net cash proceeds of approximately $85m. The vessels are expected to be delivered to the new owner in April and July, respectively. According to DHT, the company expects to record gains of $17.5m and $15.5m in the second and third quarters, respectively. The vessels were acquired in 2017 as part of the acquisition of BW Group’s VLCC fleet for an aggregate price of $115.8m. “These two vessels have served us well over the past eight years. We have taken this opportunity to fine-tune our fleet profile, aligning our service offering with customer needs and market trends,” said Svein Moxnes Harfjeld, president and CEO of DHT. With the sale of the duo, DHT became the first VLCC owner known to have sold off all Chinese-built ships following US signals that Chinese-built tonnage could face pricey penalties when calling at American ports. The deal leaves the outfit with 21 Korean-built supertankers in the water and four VLCCs on order."

        "content": "The Korean-controlled Philly Shipyard is gearing up to build the first LNG carriers in America since the 1970s. Following last week’s announcement by the US Trade Representative (USTR) on port fees designed to boost American shipbuilding, Hanhwa Ocean, which bought Philly Shipyard last year, has said it will embark on a project to build gas ships in the US. Under new guidelines from the USTR, LNG carriers are required to move 1% of US LNG exports on US-built, operated and flagged vessels within four years. That percentage would rise to 4% by 2035 and to 15% by 2047. Only three of the 800 LNG carriers in the fleet today are US-built, all dating back to the 1970s. Hanwha Ocean, formerly Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME), is one of the world’s top builders of LNG carriers, one of the harder, more complex commercial ship types to consrtruct. Requiring the use of US-flagged ships for LNG exports has been branded unfeasible by the Washington DC-based lobby group Center for Liquefied Natural Gas (CLNG). “This proposal is simply not feasible and would hinder US LNG competition with other global suppliers,” said CLNG executive director Charlie Riedl, adding: “Placing this kind of unnecessary requirement on the US LNG industry would hurt the industry’s ability to compete for growing international demand.”"

The world’s 11th largest containerline confirmed the cyberattack in a stock exchange filing but said the incident had no significant impact on operations. The company added that no breach of internal or employee information had occurred. “Our company promptly initiated comprehensive cybersecurity response measures and engaged external cybersecurity firms and experts to assist with the incident. The affected website was immediately isolated to ensure information security, and the matter has been reported to relevant authorities,” Wan Hai said in a release. Most major liners, including MSC, Maersk, CMA CGM and COSCO, had been hit by cyberattacks in recent years. Meanwhile, Wan Hai’s website appears to be back in working order and the company said it would continue to bolster the security checks of its network and information infrastructure. According to a cybersecurity report published by Thetius, CyberOwl and HFW in March, one in five shipping companies faced a cyberattack in 2024, but the survey suggested that ransom payouts halved compared to 2023 levels, averaging about $100,000."

He told BOEM to initiate the first step in a public engagement process to develop a new schedule for offshore oil and gas lease sales on the US Outer Continental Shelf. “Launching the process to develop the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Program marks a decisive step toward securing American Energy Dominance. Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, we are unlocking the full potential of our offshore resources to benefit the American people for generations to come,” Burgum said. BOEM will soon initiate a 45-day public comment period for the leasing program, which will serve as the initial step in the multi-year planning process. A new planning area offshore Alaska, known as the High Arctic, is being established as the 27th OCS planning area. Additionally, boundaries of other existing planning areas are being updated to align with BOEM’s revised jurisdiction,given to the Bureauby the president. Once finalised, the 11th national OCS program will replace the current 10th program for the period 2024–2029, which includes just three lease sales over five years, all located in the Gulf of Mexico. While BOEM continues work to complete those sales, development of the 11th Program will proceed concurrently. The OCS is a vital national resource. As of April 1, 2025, BOEM manages 2,227 active oil and gas leases covering approximately 49,000 sq km in OCS regions. Of these, 469 leases are currently producing oil and gas. In fiscal year 2024 alone, production from OCS leases accounted for approximately 14% of domestic oil production and 2% of domestic natural gas production, yielding $7bn in federal revenues. The most recent assessment of oil and gas reserves on the OCS, announced on April 10, is around 68.79bn barrels of oil and 229.03trn cubic feet of natural gas."

Initially, Petrobras reported that one service provider suffered minor burns and was conscious, however, the number rose to 14 as more time passed. It was also stated that the man fell into the sea due to the accident. The state-owned giant stated that the worker rescued at sea was receiving hospital care and is stable. The company said that the other 13 injured workers are also receiving care at a “hospital in the region”. According to the general coordinator of the Northern Fluminense Oil Workers Union and director of the United Oil Workers Federation, Sergio Borges Cordeiro, 176 workers were on board the platform, which has not produced oil since 2020. Petrobras revealed that the remaining workers on the platform were fine following the incident on Monday and that it would form a commission to investigate the causes of the incident, which are yet unknown. Cordeiro revealed via social media that the gas flow was stopped and that communications with the platform were down. He added that emergency vessels were also activated. According to Brazil’s National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels, oil exploration and production activities in the country during 2024 saw 731 accidents last year with 183 people injured, 78 of them seriously, and one fatality.

        "content": "Hong Kong-listed Secon Shipping is growing its dry bulk fleet with an ultramax newbuilding at Tsuneishi Zhoushan Shipbuilding. The Qingdao-based owner and operator is paying $38.34m to see the Tsuneishi-controlled Chinese yard, in which Yangzijiang Shipbuilding also holds a 34% stake, deliver the 63,300 dwt vessel in April 2027. Seacon said the move is in line with its ongoing strategy to optimise and expand the fleet by gradually phasing out older controlled ships and replacing them with younger tonnage. The newbuild will have a higher operational and fuel consumption efficiency, which meets the latest environmental regulations, the company added. Seacon has ordered bulkers at Tsuneishi Zhoushan in the past, signing up for kamsarmax and handysize newbuildings in 2021 and 2023, respectively. The group controls more than 25 bulk carriers on the water, but it also has a diversified orderbook of nearly 40 self-owned, bareboat chartered and joint venture vessels."

        "content": "With trade between the world’s two largest economies effectively coming to a halt thanks to US president Donald Trump’s tariff war with China, containerlines are blanking sailings on a greater scale than was witnessed at the onset of the covid pandemic five years ago. The global trade outlook – as witnessed by planned blank sailings on the transpacific in the weeks ahead – is dire. China responded 10 days ago to Trump’s cumulative 145% tariffs, placing 125% tariffs on US products, effectively foregoing business between the two countries. Blank sailings occur when ocean carriers skip scheduled port calls due to low freight demand or equipment shortages, disrupting supply chains. In April 2025, over 80 blank sailings were reported, surpassing the 51 from May 2020, signalling a severe collapse in global shipping activity. Looking at the carriers’ decisions to blank sailings is a good proxy, with which to assess how booking uptake unfolds, as a consequence of the trade war. The Sea-Intelligence Blank Sailings Tracker measures, on a weekly basis, the number of planned sailings which are blanked for the coming 12 weeks, as well as the capacity taking out due to this blanking. The latest data from Sea-Intelligence, described as “staggering” in a weekly report published yesterday, shows that carriers anticipate container demand for week 18, next week, on the Asia to US west coast trade lane will be 28% lower than expected, while for week 19, carriers are expecting shippers to move as much as 42% less cargo than anticipated on the Asia to US east coast trade lane. “It is evident that the impact of the trade war has caused many shippers to pause, or outright cancel, shipments. In turn, this reduces demand for capacity on container vessels and carriers respond by cancelling bookings,” Sea-Intelligence noted. Judah Levine, head of research at Freightos, a box booking platform, commented: “The near term need to blank sailings out of China and possibly increase services from other origins may prove challenging for ocean carriers and cause delays for shippers, with empty containers concentrated in China likely to pose a challenge too.” “For the smaller niche carriers, the trade war is particularly destructive,” Sea-Intelligence warned in an earlier report. “Most of them rely on large volumes from China on their services and are not well equipped to suddenly switch to alternate non-Chinese origin cargo. For some of these we can potentially expect full-service closures, for the duration of the trade war.”"

        "content": "India’s largest private ports and logistics company, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), has acquired the North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT) in Australia in a non-cash deal worth about $2.54bn. The transaction involves the purchase of Abbot Point Port Holdings (APPH), a Singapore-based entity currently owned by Carmichael Rail and Port Singapore holdings, which is a related party and owns and operates the NQXT deepwater coal export facility. The terminal, with a nameplate capacity of 50 mtpa, is located at the Port of Abbot Point, some 25 km north of Bowen, in North Queensland on Australia’s east coast. It is under a long-term lease from the Queensland Government and currently supports eight major customers through long-term “take or pay” contracts and exports to 15 countries, with 88% of shipments going to Asia. Ashwani Gupta, CEO of APSEZ, said the acquisition is a “pivotal step” in the group’s international strategy, opening new export markets and securing long-term contracts, adding that the terminal is well-positioned for strong growth, backed by increased capacity, upcoming contract renewals, and future opportunities in green hydrogen exports. As part of the deal, Adani Ports will also assume other non-core assets and liabilities on Abbot Point Port’s balance sheet, which the company will realise within a few months of the deal and aims to take the port’s EBITDA growth to A$400m within four years."

Last week, Wood stated that it received a holistic non-binding conditionalproposal from Sidara, including a possible offer of 35 pence in cash per Wood share to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the company. This new offer is worth around £242m ($320m) and includes taking on Wood’s outstanding debt of approximately $1.1bn, which the company is looking to refinance. Sidara would also inject $450m into the UK company in two tranches. An extension to further negotiations with Sidara was already made, and it was supposed to end on April 17. However, to enable satisfaction or waiver of the pre-conditions to Sidara’s waiver or firm offer, the company decided to extend the deadline once again. Now, Sidara is required to make a firm offer for Wood or announce that it does not intend to make an offer by no later than 5 pm British time on May 15. This deadline can be extended further. In light of the extensive work needed to conclude its audit for FY24, Wood expects that it would not be able to publish its FY24 accounts by April 30; in that case, the company’s shares would be suspended from trading. Wood did point out that there can be no certainty that an offer will be made even if the pre-conditions are satisfied or waived."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Shipping spent the weekend digesting the news from the US where watered down plans to charge China-linked ships extra for American port calls have created considerable outrage in Beijing and Hong Kong, while causing consternation for members of the Ocean Alliance, one of the big groupings in container shipping. The 42-page document released by the US Trade Representative (USTR) has been pored over by world shipping and has attracted criticism for its lack of clarity. “The USTR announcement is detailed but poorly worded, leaving certain aspects open to interpretation,” noted broker Arrow. Under the new rules announced late last Thursday by the USTR, non-Chinese shipowners will be charged the higher of two calculated fees: a tonnage -based fee, starting at $18 per net ton as of October 14, 2025, and gradually increasing to $33 per net ton by April 17, 2028, or a container-based fee, starting at $120 per container discharged on October 14, 2025, that will increase to $250 per container by April 17, 2028. Non-US-built ships carrying cars will be charged $150 per vehicle. The fees will be applied once each voyage on affected ships, a maximum of six times a year. Temporary suspension of the fee—up to a maximum of three years—may be granted if the vessel owner orders and takes delivery of a US-built ship of equal or greater net tonnage. Exemptions apply to smaller vessels, ships on domestic voyages as well as to the Caribbean and in the Great Lakes, and certain specialised vessel types. Also exempt are empty bulk carriers arriving at US ports to load up with exports such as wheat and soybeans. The measures do not apply to container vessels smaller than 4,000 teu. They also do not apply to voyages shorter than 2,000 nautical miles. Chinese shipowners and operators do look to be hit with far higher bills. They will initially be charged $50 per net ton, rising by $30 a ton each year for the next three years. According to Clarksons, in terms of 2024 port calls, only 7% of containerships would be subject to the new fees as compared to 83% under the initial USTR proposal published in February, which came in for heavy criticism at a public hearing in March. Across all shipping, only 9% of 2024 port calls would be subject to these new fees versus 43% under the prior proposal. “Under this policy US crude oil, refined products, LNG, LPG, chemicals, coal and grains exports should see little impact; containers will see some disruption but not as previously feared; car carriers however will see an impact given all foreign ships will be subject to port fees of $150 per ceu,” shipping analysts at Jefferies, an American investment bank, summed up. The way the fees have targeted Chinese operators could see big shifts on the transpacific liner trades in particular. China’s COSCO and OOCL are part of the Ocean Alliance along with France’s CMA CGM and Taiwan’s Evergreen. Hede Shipping is another niche independent Chinese operator on the transpacific. Calculations by Sea-Intelligence, a Danish liner consultancy, suggest these three Chinese liners could be hit with US port fees of as high as $10m when the USTR fees are fully phased in, something that could see the Ocean Alliance shuffle operations, whereby CMA CGM and Evergreen handle the US-bound services and relegate COSCO and OOCL to Asia-Europe. The World Shipping Council (WSC), a liner lobby group, has hit out at the new fees, especially on the car-carrying ones. “Unfortunately, the fee regime announced by USTR is a step in the wrong direction as it will raise prices for consumers, weaken US trade and do little to revitalise the US maritime industry,” said Joe Kramek, president and CEO of the WSC. Structuring fees based on ship size — net tonnage — disproportionately penalises larger, more efficient vessels, the WSC argued while the fees on car carriers, including a new and previously unannounced fee based on car equivalent unit (ceu) capacity, will, according to the WSC, slow US economic growth and raise car prices for American consumers. WSC also flagged significant legal concerns, noting that the proposed fees appear to extend beyond the authority granted under US trade law. The Chinese government, shipbuilding and shipping associations, along with COSCO, have all condemned Trump’s port fees. China’s national shipbuilding association called on the international maritime industry to “jointly resist this short-sighted US behaviour, and jointly maintain a fair market environment”. The China Shipowners Association said the US move is “significantly discriminatory,” and the association “firmly opposes the US’ accusations based on false facts and prejudice”. COSCO, meanwhile, said: “The move is not conducive to fair competition and normal business operation order in the global shipping industry.” “Such measures not only distort fair competition and impede the normal functioning of the global shipping industry, but also threaten its stable and sustainable development. Ultimately, these actions risk undermining the security, resilience, and orderly operation of global industrial and supply chains,” COSCO said. The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing vowed to “resolutely take necessary measures to safeguard our own interests”, saying the fees “fully reveal the essence of its unilateralist and protectionist policies, and are typical, non-market practices”. In Hong Kong, home to the world’s fourth-largest shipping register, shipowners are assessing whether to reflag. The Hong Kong government said that despite the US’s “bullying,” it will continue to work with global maritime partners to safeguard free trade principles and promote the healthy development of the international shipping industry. Reading into the minutiae of the USTR report, Andrew Craig-Bennett,Splash’s lead columnist, advised: “Shipping companies incorporated in Hong Kong, Shanghai, or anywhere else in China will have to take another approach and I see much to commend the use of the time charter agreement or, where appropriate, the cross slot charter agreement, duly amended.” On LinkedIn, Dr Martin Kröger, the CEO of the German Shipowners’ Association, wrote: “The German shipping sector, like many others, will pay a steep price. More costs. More friction. More political games where merchants and consumers become collateral damage.”"

        "content": "Nonprofit ocean conservation organisation Oceana has revealed the destructive legacy of theDeepwater Horizondisaster, which marked its 15th anniversary on Easter Sunday, April 20. TheDeepwater Horizondisaster still remains the worst oil spill in US history, with 11 people tragically killed in the rig explosion that caused one of the most damaging environmental catastrophes the country has ever seen. Oil gushed from the seafloor for 87 days, spewing 134m gallons into the Gulf of Mexico. Toxic sludge washed up on 1,300m of shoreline, from Texas to Florida, oiling beaches and wetlands and killing tens of thousands of birds, sea turtles, and dolphins, among other marine life. In its research, Oceana found that the oil spill’s deep-sea footprint covered an area almost nine times greater than previously reported. The spill spread over 2,860 sq km of ocean, which equates to nearly 50 times the size of Manhattan. The impact of the spill also led to the loss of more than 25,000 jobs and $2.3bn in industry output. Oceana noted that the small dolphin population densities declined by up to 43%, while those of sperm whales declined by up to 31%. The population density of Cuvier’s beaked whales and Gervais’ beaked whales declined by 75% and 83%, respectively. Some Gulf fish species, such as white marlin, showed little to no recovery. In their research, the conservation organisation reported that US Coast Guard service members involved in the cleanup suffered from long-term endocrine and metabolic conditions. “On this solemn 15th anniversary, we face a new deluge of misguided efforts to expand offshore drilling into new and deeper areas that would risk more catastrophes. Oceana calls on lawmakers to reject any drilling expansion and permanently protect our coasts from offshore drilling,” said Oceana campaign director Joseph Gordon. “This anniversary is not just a memory of what was lost, but a call to protect what remains and fight for a healthy Gulf free from fossil fuels,” added Breon Robinson, Southwest Louisiana/Southeast Texas organiser for Healthy Gulf. These messages, however, fell on deaf ears as the secretary of the Department of the Interior, Doug Burgum, launched the country’s 11th Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing program only a day after Oceana’s report came out. More than 7,300 oil spills occurred in federal waters between 2010 and 2022 — an average of over one spill every day, either during exploration, production, or transportation. A poll released by Oceana in July 2024 revealed that two-thirds of American voters (64%) support their elected officials protecting U.S. coastlines from new offshore drilling, with similar support among registered voters in coastal states (66%)."

        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett on another virulent form of sea blindness. Timor arcium griseorum. I hope I have got the Latin for “Fear of grey boxes” correct, because it is the widespread fear – almost a medical condition – of container shipping that I want to write about. There was a time when fear of the grey box was widespread in the liner shipping industry, and with good reason. Liner shipping companies operated in so-called conferences which promised exporters a reliable service in exchange for restrictive practices aimed at limiting competition. This was because mid-Victorian shipowners had very soon discovered that in the absence of controls on competition liner shipping companies compete to the point of bankruptcy, and the entry premium into conventional liner shipping is low. The conferences had conference tariffs which were based on the useful insight that a given commodity on a given route always had a maximum freight rate which it could stand – i.e., if the shipping line charged more than ‘x’ the delivered cost of the commodity would be too high for it to sell, and thus to be worth shipping. The freight rate on wool was different to the freight rate on soap, and so on. Each tariff rate was set at a point that made it worthwhile to ship whatever it was, and these rates did not change by much, so an export industry could plan ahead. I will not spend more time on this huge subject, but I will recommend the excellent Wikipedia page on the Far East Freight Conference. The first form of ‘Timor arcium griseorum’ occurred amongst liner shipping companies of the old school when they realised that one ISO container is just the same as another, that being, in the immortal words of President Obama, the whole idea, and that, this being the case, it was impossible to apply different tariffs to different cargoes when they were all being carried in the same grey boxes and treated in exactly the same way. That is one reason why the container revolution literally ate its parents – the traditional liner companies. Today, the only survivors of the hundred and more liner shipping companies that operated under the conference system in its glory are Hapag-Lloyd, Mitsui OSK, NYK, and K Line. Maersk began as a conference outsider. It was allowed in, eventually, but it was always basically piratical – their hearts were never really in it. The liner conference era is generally held to have come to an end on October 17, 2008, when the Far East Freight Conference wound itself up following the withdrawal of the EU exemption of the conference system from antitrust rules. A clear win for the grey box So much for the first outbreak of fear of grey boxes. That occurred within our industry. The current outbreak is taking place outside shipping and involves the public and in particular the politicians. It is unlikely to result in a win. Splash readers who read my column on sea blindness correctly observed that it is possible to move military stores and equipment through a container terminal if the stuff is in ISO containers, although, for big stuff like tanks and armoured fighting vehicles, a roro terminal is preferable, and that it is possible to fit a cruise missile and the hardware needed to launch it into an ISO container, but we all know just how very vulnerable a gantry container crane is. I still think that container terminals are more military targets than military assets, but equally these places seem able to inspire fear in the general public and in the sorts of people, be they journalists, influencers, or actual politicians, who prey on the fears of the public in every land. I blame the Port of Long Beach, myself. As general cargo jumped into grey boxes, leaving the Port of Long Beach’s ample estate of warehouses and quays with less and less to do, the port found a new income stream in renting out its property to the almost adjacent film industry, as locations for action films. We have all seen some of these. For the first time, ports became scary places where nefarious activities went on. A container terminal is even more scary than a deserted general cargo berth. There is no human scale. Immense machines, many of them made in China, move big metal boxes around rapidly in what is clearly a planned and organised system, but the casual observer has no idea of what the plan is. It is like watching a colony of gigantic ants. There is absolutely no way to let the public see for themselves and explaining it all to politicians of the calibre of Vance and Hegseth would be counterproductive, as their power depends on stoking the fear of the unknown. People who seriously propose to look for the kill switch in a container crane are capable of any amount of nonsense. Timor arcium griseorumis a virulent form of sea blindness."

        "content": "Tobias Backer, executive director of Pelagic Capital, writes for Splash today on shipping’s cash requirements in uncertain times. The maritime industry is no stranger to volatility and uncertainty. However, shipping is currently experiencing a prolonged period of unrest from a myriad of geopolitical challenges that are having a significant impact on maritime markets. Ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Gaza continue to disrupt the maritime industry from a safety, supply, and operational perspective. At the same time, the industry is also having to adapt to increasingly more onerous regulatory frameworks designed to support shipping’s green transition. Furthermore, the recent emergence of a new wave of US protectionism is impacting established trade relationships, which has the potential to lead to a significant shift in traditional market dynamics. In parallel with these dramatic challenges, maritime investment has significantly evolved within the last 20 years. Following the financial crash in 2008, traditional banks have been exercising more caution, whilst tightening regulations have made lending to shipping companies less attractive. The priorities of institutional banks have changed since the late 2000s, which has reduced their appetite for engaging with a typically high leverage, high risk investment approach that used to support the rapid growth of a shipowner’s fleet. This trend is particularly challenging when considered within the context of a rapidly aging global fleet, that will see approximately 15,000 vessels reach the end of their economic life within the next ten years. As a result, there is an increasing capital requirement within the industry that is not being supported through traditional financial institutions. The advent of more rigid lending practices has led to a rise in prominence of alternative credit institutions within the industry. Funds such as MareVia Credit Fund – that was launched in September 2024 by Pelagic Partners to address the increasing capital needs of the industry – hold the market insight, as well as flexibility, to effectively collaborate with traditional banking structures. This approach supports the development of more dynamic capital products that leverage the investment strength of larger financial institutions, alongside the versatility, market expertise, and sector knowledge of more specialist alternative lenders. These relationships are vital means in creating leasing products that are tailored to the requirements of the maritime sector. For example, because of the deep knowledge, understanding and familiarity with the market that these lenders have developed in recent years, they are more attuned to the opportunities that exist within current market, which then makes them more willing to underwrite capital. With 10-12% equity IRR, combined with 3-4% margins bank leverage, shipowners are receiving alternative capital which would historically have been provided by a traditional banking institution. As an uncorrelated asset class, shipping has historically demonstrated resilience in volatile times, continuing to attract investors that are seeking to capitalise on the significant opportunities these challenges create within the market. As a shipowner and fund manager with extensive experience and heritage within the maritime industry, Pelagic Partners has built its reputation as a diverse specialist that invests in a range of maritime and offshore shipping segments. This approach has created flexibility in investment opportunities and enables the company to exit a market at the right time, providing consistency and stability of returns, as well as an adaptable framework that reduces the risk and optimises investor opportunity. The current uncertainty that the maritime markets are experiencing shows no sign of abating. However, the shipping industry tends to perform well in periods of economic upheaval, and whilst the current market volatility is set to continue, it is only by remaining adaptable that investors can hope to capitalise on the various ebbs and flows of the market."

In terms of what Gerlach wants to take away from next week’s big Swiss dry bulk summit, he tells Splash: “Learning from shipowners about their evolving operational challenges is invaluable, especially regarding the balance between compliance, operational efficiency, and market competitiveness.” Of specific interest for Gerlach and Sideris will be the Digital Efficiency Drivers At Sea session next Tuesday morning where an expert panel will look at how digitalisation can enhance dry bulk shipping operations to the benefit of both shipowners and charterers. This quick-fire session aims to eliminate some of the myths surrounding digital miracles at sea, while highlighting projects that are making a genuine impact."

The company will purchase renewable energy from the Fengmiao 1 offshore wind project, developed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The wind farm is located 35 km off the coast of Taichung and has a capacity of 500MW. The project is important to the country’s offshore wind sector as it is the first project from Taiwan’s Round 3.1 auction to achieve financial close. Once operational in 2027, the project will provide reliable power to support Google’s data centre, cloud service, and offices in Taiwan. The power from Fengmiao 1 will add to Google’s existing carbon-free energy portfolio in Taiwan. The tech giant already uses power from solar and geothermal sources. The US company has an ultimate goal of running on carbon-free energy full-time on every grid where they operate. The Taiwanese government aims to install 5.7GW of offshore wind capacity by 2025. Fengmiao 1 will look to add capacity to the second stage of the government’s plan, which is adding another 15GW by 2035."

        "author": "Andrew Craig-Bennett",
        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett warns about the risks of using prevalent knock-off spare parts. When a new ship leaves her builder for her maiden voyage, she will carry spare parts. We can probably – probably – assume that these spare parts, as well as the renewable and consumable components fitted in her mechanical and electrical systems, are genuine manufacturers’ items. I write ‘probably’ because the purchasing department is the profit centre in every shipyard that I know of, and some shipyard purchasing departments contain rather sharp characters. But let’s assume that the ship sets out in life with genuine spares onboard. This happy situation is unlikely to continue through the life of the ship. Our industry is absolutely infested with fakes, and we don’t care. Some readers may feel that the word fake is too strong and they would rather talk about pattern spares, secondary market spares, grey market spares and, particularly iniquitous, OEM spares. They are all fakes. And pretty much every seagoing engineer is engaged in a quiet battle with his own office and his own superintendents. Deck officers too, because there are fake spares for cranes, winches and especially hatch covers. This sort of thing goes on in the most admired shipowning companies as well as in the less reputable ones. The term OEM” means, of course, “Original Equipment Maker”. As a young man obsessed with motorcycles I asked my local motorbike shop for a new battery for a BMW bike. I knew the man I was talking to quite well (as one does) and he said: “Well, I can offer you two – here’s the BMW one (naming a price beyond the dreams of avarice – I think it was £70) or here’s the pattern spare (a third of the price). He went on: “If you look carefully at the plastic casing, you will see that the moulding marks are exactly the same!” I bought the pattern spare, of course. It had certainly come off the same production line as Bavarian Motor Works’ far more expensive battery and of course I thought no further than BMW are ripping their customers off. Now, I know better. A friend, of the engineering persuasion, has a hierarchy of spares and I’m going to quote his email to me: “In my experience these come in several types: Those manufactured by a third party but packaged identically to the genuine article – very difficult to tell until they fail. Copy spares manufactured to the correct specification under licence or even, once the original manufacturer has ceased trading to the original drawings – I have no problem with these and they frequently enable vessels to keep trading – spares for Titan separators and Malone pnumercators being two cases in point. We now come to the more dangerous spares, those marketed as OEM replacements but not fulfilling the original requirements.” At this point he gave as a prime example consumable spares for an extremely well known make of purifiers. Since everyone can guess the name I will leave you to do so. “There are a number of suppliers who make spares under licence for the original manufacturer / licensee, normally whilst these are being manufactured the original maker maintains a presence for quality control,” he wrote, adding: “Some of these manufacturers take advantage of having the proper drawings / specifications and produce extra ‘unofficial’ items. The (a ship we both remember) had a Sulzer engine and “X” sourced new liners from one of these manufacturers, sadly the material specification was not followed leading to rapid bore wear.” The conversation was started by my reminiscing about a set of generator valve springs which were indeed manufactured by the original maker, using indeed the correct material, but a part of the heat treatment had been skipped. That proved very expensive… Would you be happy to fly in an aircraft with pattern spares fitted? You would not, but you probably just said to yourself “Well, that’s aviation.. they are different” If (another case cited by my friend, in the engine room of a ship that I had ordered) a turbocharger explodes because the impeller contacts the volute, a consequence of the licensee (a very famous Japanese company) having substituted a non-creep-resistant material for the originally specified material, how safe is that? How safe is a purifier seal failure? What we have here is yet another case of, “It’s always been like this” and “How can you do anything about it?” Well, here’s a suggestion. How do you check if the Hours of Rest have been “flogged”? By comparing the Hours of Rest record with the Bell Book. (Yes, of course the thinking officer now writes up the Hours of Rest fiction with the Bell Book open in front of her or him). Do the same thing with the spares purchasing accounts – pick a couple of items and check against the real maker’s prices. Or (radical idea, I know) talk to your engineers."

        "content": "Belgium’s CMB.TECH and one of Europe’s largest dry bulk owners, Golden Ocean, have signed a term sheet for a stock-for-stock merger that will create a maritime giant with a combined fleet of more than 250 vessels. Under the agreement, unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, the shipowning vehicle controlled by the Saverys family would end up as the surviving entity, based on an exchange ratio of 0.95 shares of CBM.TECH for each share of Golden Ocean. CMB.TECH shareholders would own about 70% of the total issued share capital of the combined company, with Golden Ocean shareholders owning the remaining 30%, assuming the exchange ratio is not adjusted. “We have concluded unanimously that the proposed exchange ratio based on a net asset value of CMB.TECH of $15.23 per share and a value of $14.49 per Golden Ocean share is fair and believe this proposed merger is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders,” said Carl Steen, chairman of Golden Ocean’s transaction committee. CMB.TECH took John Fredriksen’s controlling stake in Golden Ocean for close to $1.2bn in March and has since picked up more of the bulker owner’s stock to build up a stake of close to 50% in pursuit of a likely merger. Analysts at Jefferies view Fredriksen’s exit from Golden Ocean in March as “exceptionally well-timed and also well-compensated”, noting that remaining shareholders will, unfortunately, receive a meaningfully lower consideration. CMB.TECH will issue 95.9m shares to the remaining Golden Ocean shareholders, worth about $851m, at some 19% premium to the bulker owner’s closing price; however, Jefferies noted that the all-stock parameters indicate this premium could shift materially based on CMB.TECH’s price movements. The merger, which remains subject to customary conditions, including definitive transaction agreements, would see the creation of one of the world’s largest diversified listed maritime groups across five shipping divisions and also one of the largest dry bulk fleets, including 87 modern capesize and newcastlemax vessels. “By merging CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean, we would take another great step forward in building our leading diversified maritime group,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH, adding, “The value of our fleet would reach more than $11bn and, combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares, we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities.” The two companies said they aim to finalise the deal during the second quarter of 2025 and to complete the merger in the third quarter, after which CMB.TECH would remain listed in New York and Brussels and pursue a secondary listing in Oslo. Commenting on the merger, Peder Simonsen, chief executive of Golden Ocean, added: “If completed, the merged company will be one of the largest listed maritime groups both in terms of market capitalisation, net asset value and expected share liquidity. This transaction will allow us to offer an even broader service to our customers, a wide range of possibilities to our employees and last but not least, the creation of long-term added value to our shareholders.”"

The latest data from Alphaliner covering the world’s largest global terminal operators shows Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports’ revenue leapt 11% last year to draw level with Singapore’s PSA International, despite moving far fewer boxes. BlackRock and MSC have made a $22.8bn bid to take over all of Hutchison Ports’ non-Chinese assets, the largest port deal in history, one which has yet to go through with fierce opposition coming from China. Alphaliner suggested in its latest weekly report that port infrastructure has become the “next battlefield in the fight for dominance” in the container industry as the world containership fleet was growing very rapidly, while there were only a finite number of terminals available. After booming consumer demand in 2024, six out of eight leading global port groups increased their revenue by double-digit figures in 2024. Only COSCO and China Merchants saw gains in the single digits. The two Chinese groups continue to top the list of port groups by throughput."

The carrier was observed continuing on its original planned route. The ICC International Maritime Bureau (IMB) revealed last week a rise in global piracy and armed robbery incidents in the first quarter of 2025 – driven by a spike of incidents in the Singapore Strait. A total of 45 cases of piracy and armed robbery against ships were recorded in the first three months of 2025 – an almost 35% increase compared to the same period in 2024. The Q1 report highlighted a spike in recorded incidents in the Singapore Strait as 27 incidents were reported from vessels transiting these waters compared to seven for the same period in 2024.

Emamjomeh’s expansive network includes a vessel, the 2024-built Tinos I, which intended but failed to load cargo last year on its maiden voyage off the coast of Houston. “Emamjomeh and his network sought to export thousands of shipments of LPG—including from the United States—to evade US sanctions and generate revenue for Iran,” said secretary of the treasury Scott Bessent. For more than a decade, Iran-based Emamjomeh and his son, United Arab Emirates-based British and Iranian national Meisam Emamjomeh, have owned and operated an LPG sales, transportation, and delivery network using multiple Iran and UAE-based companies. Emamjomeh and his UAE-based company, Caspian Petrochemical are part of a network that has exported thousands of shipments of LPG from Iran to Pakistan and have conducted tens of millions of dollars in business on behalf of Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industry Commercial Co. (PGPICC). This marks the seventh round of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales since president Donald Trump issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 (NSPM-2), instituting a campaign of maximum economic pressure on Iran."

        "content": "Non-Chinese shipowners can breathe a sigh of relief that they can still order most ship types risk-free in China, according to HSBC, following last week’s decision by the US Trade Representative to water down penalties on Chinese-linked tonnage. The competitiveness of Chinese yards remains intact, according to the global bank. “The diluted port fees will reduce the uncertainty on newbuild decisions for non-Chinese carriers which should be positive for Chinese shipyards,” HSBC suggested, with Splash reporting yesterday that Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC), the world’s largest containerline, has been one of the first companies to head back to China for orders, signing for six 22,000 teu newbuilds at Hengli Heavy Industry. The USTR decided to ease the most punitive measures against Chinese-linked tonnage following a public hearing last month, which attracted huge criticism. The less severe financial penalties – for non-Chinese owners – have reduced any potential competitive advantage that had emerged for Korean yards under the initial USTR proposal, HSBC pointed out. “We continue to expect Chinese yards to maintain their leading position in most vessel segments,” HSBC maintained in a shipbuilding update, arguing that pending new orders for Chinese yards will resume especially with the price gap emerging versus their Korean and Japanese peers lately. “While the [USTR] announcement is thorough, its vague language creates uncertainty, making it difficult to assess the full scope and implementation of the proposed fees,” analysis from Greece’s Xclusiv Shipbrokers suggested. Subject to a scheduled public hearing on May 19 and a subsequent final ruling, the proposed US port fees are scheduled to come into effect on October 14, with a gradual three-year phase-in period."

        "content": "President Donald Trump has hinted at easing his aggressive trade stance with China, suggesting a significant reduction in the steep tariffs on Chinese imports amid ongoing market turbulence. Speaking at a White House press briefing on Tuesday, Trump indicated that the current tariffs, which have soared past 145%, will be scaled back considerably, though not eliminated entirely. During a Q&A with journalists in the Oval Office, Trump acknowledged, “145% is excessive, and we won’t keep it at that level. It’ll drop substantially, but it won’t be zero.” His comments signal a potential softening of the hardline rhetoric that has defined the escalating trade conflict, characterised by retaliatory tariff hikes between the two nations. Trump’s remarks followed treasury secretary Scott Bessent’s statements at a JP Morgan Chase investment conference, where he described the trade war as unsustainable and predicted a de-escalation soon. Bessent emphasised a goal of rebalancing trade rather than severing ties with China. On Tuesday, Trump reiterated his desire for negotiations, promising a cordial approach. “We’ll be very friendly, and I think they will be too,” he said. “They’ll need to make a deal, or they won’t have access to the US market.” New data from project44 shows blank containership sailings from China have increased by 100% to the US east coast and 31% to the US west coast since new tariffs began in early February."

        "author": "Andrew Craig-Bennett",
        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett warns about the risks of using prevalent knock-off spare parts. When a new ship leaves her builder for her maiden voyage, she will carry spare parts. We can probably – probably – assume that these spare parts, as well as the renewable and consumable components fitted in her mechanical and electrical systems, are genuine manufacturers’ items. I write ‘probably’ because the purchasing department is the profit centre in every shipyard that I know of, and some shipyard purchasing departments contain rather sharp characters. But let’s assume that the ship sets out in life with genuine spares onboard. This happy situation is unlikely to continue through the life of the ship. Our industry is absolutely infested with fakes, and we don’t care. Some readers may feel that the word fake is too strong and they would rather talk about pattern spares, secondary market spares, grey market spares and, particularly iniquitous, OEM spares. They are all fakes. And pretty much every seagoing engineer is engaged in a quiet battle with his own office and his own superintendents. Deck officers too, because there are fake spares for cranes, winches and especially hatch covers. This sort of thing goes on in the most admired shipowning companies as well as in the less reputable ones. The term OEM” means, of course, “Original Equipment Maker”. As a young man obsessed with motorcycles I asked my local motorbike shop for a new battery for a BMW bike. I knew the man I was talking to quite well (as one does) and he said: “Well, I can offer you two – here’s the BMW one (naming a price beyond the dreams of avarice – I think it was £70) or here’s the pattern spare (a third of the price). He went on: “If you look carefully at the plastic casing, you will see that the moulding marks are exactly the same!” I bought the pattern spare, of course. It had certainly come off the same production line as Bavarian Motor Works’ far more expensive battery and of course I thought no further than BMW are ripping their customers off. Now, I know better. A friend, of the engineering persuasion, has a hierarchy of spares and I’m going to quote his email to me: “In my experience these come in several types: Those manufactured by a third party but packaged identically to the genuine article – very difficult to tell until they fail. Copy spares manufactured to the correct specification under licence or even, once the original manufacturer has ceased trading to the original drawings – I have no problem with these and they frequently enable vessels to keep trading – spares for Titan separators and Malone pnumercators being two cases in point. We now come to the more dangerous spares, those marketed as OEM replacements but not fulfilling the original requirements.” At this point he gave as a prime example consumable spares for an extremely well known make of purifiers. Since everyone can guess the name I will leave you to do so. “There are a number of suppliers who make spares under licence for the original manufacturer / licensee, normally whilst these are being manufactured the original maker maintains a presence for quality control,” he wrote, adding: “Some of these manufacturers take advantage of having the proper drawings / specifications and produce extra ‘unofficial’ items. The (a ship we both remember) had a Sulzer engine and “X” sourced new liners from one of these manufacturers, sadly the material specification was not followed leading to rapid bore wear.” The conversation was started by my reminiscing about a set of generator valve springs which were indeed manufactured by the original maker, using indeed the correct material, but a part of the heat treatment had been skipped. That proved very expensive… Would you be happy to fly in an aircraft with pattern spares fitted? You would not, but you probably just said to yourself “Well, that’s aviation.. they are different” If (another case cited by my friend, in the engine room of a ship that I had ordered) a turbocharger explodes because the impeller contacts the volute, a consequence of the licensee (a very famous Japanese company) having substituted a non-creep-resistant material for the originally specified material, how safe is that? How safe is a purifier seal failure? What we have here is yet another case of, “It’s always been like this” and “How can you do anything about it?” Well, here’s a suggestion. How do you check if the Hours of Rest have been “flogged”? By comparing the Hours of Rest record with the Bell Book. (Yes, of course the thinking officer now writes up the Hours of Rest fiction with the Bell Book open in front of her or him). Do the same thing with the spares purchasing accounts – pick a couple of items and check against the real maker’s prices. Or (radical idea, I know) talk to your engineers."

        "content": "Democratic Party Representative Salud Carbajal has reintroduced the California Clean Coast Act into the US Congress. The California Clean Coast Act would permanently ban future offshore oil and gas leasing in areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of California. The act was the first bill the congressman introduced as a member of Congress in an attempt to protect the state’s coast from offshore drilling and the devastating impact of oil spills. “Santa Barbara knows firsthand how devastating oil spills can be on our marine ecosystems and coastline,” said Carbajal. “I’m proud to lead this bill to ban future offshore oil drilling in our state and ensure California’s world-famous coastline is protected for future generations to enjoy.” “The California Clean Coast Act is critical to protecting our coast and climate from the threats of offshore oil drilling. From the 1969 blowout at Platform A to the 2015 pipeline spill along the Gaviota Coast, the California Coast has suffered the devastating effects of offshore oil development on communities who live, play, and work here. The California Clean Coast Act will preserve our precious coast from the threats of future oil spills and climate change,” added Linda Krop, chief counsel of the Environmental Defence Centre. At the end of the Biden administration, Carbajal’s eight-year push to ban future offshore oil drilling came to fruition when president Biden invoked his authority to protect over 2.5m sq km of federal waters from oil and gas exploration. Congressman Carbajal was one of 12 members of Congress who wrote to President Biden requesting this action before the end of his term. Several Republican-led states, Louisiana, Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, and Mississippi, filed a lawsuit to challenge Biden’s offshore drilling ban. After moving into the White House, US president Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council focused on boosting the country’s production and export of fossil fuels. The new council, headed by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, will be granted authority over federal agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, and transportation. Burgum was also directed to undo Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling. Carbajal’s bill is partnering with a pair of bills introduced in the Senate that aim to permanently block oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The combo package of legislations includes the West Coast Ocean Protection Act, introduced by Senator Alex Padilla, and the Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism Anti-Drilling Act, introduced by Senators Cory Booker and Jack Reed. Padilla’s bill would permanently prohibit new oil and gas leases for offshore drilling off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington state. The Booker and Reed bill would permanently bar the Interior Department or any of its agencies from issuing leases for the exploration, development, or production of oil and gas in the North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Straits of Florida Planning Areas of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf."

The offshore wind farm has a capacity of 576MW and is located off the coast of Wales. The wind farm has 160 wind turbines of 3,6MW and has been in operation since 2013. GYM OFTO owns the transmission assets that connect the wind farm to the National Grid. The N-Sea scope includes replacing a 5 km section of 132kV export cable from the onshore transition joint bay towards the offshore platform. This scope includes the pull ashore of the new cable through a horizontal directional drill duct under a railway, dredging of the shore approach, jointing, and testing of the new cable and burial. This is the third repair by N-Sea for this client. The company’s in-house survey, UXO, and data centre divisions will be used to engineer and deliver a new route for the new cable, including as-built data upon completion. The repair campaign will happen during the summer and will be carried out by the company’s cable repair vesselCuro. The vessel is equipped with an eight-point mooring system that allows it to maintain position during operations, even in strong tidal conditions. It also has beaching capabilities, which enable the vessel to safely approach and work as close as possible to the landfall location."

        "content": "BIMCO and the Association of Ship Brokers & Agents(ASBA) have revised ASBATANKVOY, the only dedicated tanker form not associated with an oil major. The updated version of the voyage charter party addresses changes in the tanker trade, commercial practices and regulations since its last revision. The original edition of ASBATANKVOY has become outdated since it was published by ASBA in 1977. Since then, various aspects of modern tanker trade have changed along with the regulatory framework such as safety, security and marine environment protection, including oil pollution. “The 2025 edition brings the form up to date with modern tanker trade. Throughout the process of updating the form, the joint BIMCO/ASBA subcommittee has worked closely with a wide representation of the tanker industry, including COSCO and Chevron. The result is the product of consultations with many stakeholders who have advised the subcommittee on what the industry needs,” said Stephen Harper, head of legal – shipping at BW Group and BIMCO co-chair of the subcommittee. Several provisions have been inserted or updated to the 1977 version with the aim of providing an updated form which still resembles the original, as requested by respondents in the initial consultation process. “Since its introduction in 1977, the ASBATANKVOY charter party has been recognised for carefully balancing the interests of owners and charterers. For this reason, it has become the most widely used independent tanker voyage charter party in the world. With ASBATANKVOY 2025, our subcommittee has succeeded in maintaining this balance while modernising the form by incorporating the latest operational advancements, legal and regulatory developments, communication practices and environmental considerations,” said Søren Wolmar, senior partner at Quincannon Associates, and ASBA co-chair of the subcommittee. The arbitration provision has been updated and, like BIMCO’s Law & Arbitration Clause 2020, caters for four named arbitration venues, namely New York, London, Singapore and Hong Kong. Contrary to the original form, the 2025 edition includes New York as a default venue. Due to the more comprehensive nature of the updated form, it should not be necessary to add as many rider clauses to ASBATANKVOY 2025 as compared with the 1977 edition. Rider clauses are additional terms that either replace or augment the original clauses. The reduced need for such clauses in ASBATANKVOY 2025 will limit the risk of inconsistency between standard provisions and rider clauses thereby increasing contractual and legal certainty."

That’s where we stand out,” Srivastava claims. Customers want simpler, smarter, and more connected solutions, he argues, pointing out that today most owners are stuck managing multiple platforms and tools for bunkering, routing, port disbursements, laytime, and emissions—leading to inefficiencies, errors, and lost time. GeoServe offers an end-to-end voyage management solution—from support during pre-fixture to post-fixture execution and post-voyage finalisation and analysis. “Instead of disconnected tools, we provide a unified ecosystem that improves efficiency, transparency, and financial predictability,”: he says, something he’s keen to show delegates attending next week’s Geneva Dry. “Geneva Dry is more than just a conference – it’s a strong platform for meaningful discussions on the challenges and opportunities shaping the industry,” says Srivastava. With more than 800 confirmed delegates, the sold out Geneva Dry reconvenes for its second edition at the Hotel President Wilson on Monday."

The deal is expected to close in 2025. S&P Global said it will also be taking an equity position in Orbcomm for an undisclosed sum, intending to develop a range of differentiated supply chain data and insight offerings, underscoring its commitment to further investing in this sector. In 2023, S&P Global acquired UK-based technology firm Tradenet and its live vessel-tracking platform, Market Intelligence Network (MINT), to bolster its capability to track and analyse commodity shipments. Other maritime data analytics players have also invested in the ship tracking market, with Kpler adding well-known brands MarineTraffic and FleetMon to its portfolio, as well as a soon-to-be-closed deal for Spire Maritime."

        "content": "Israeli carrier ZIM has been ordered to pay about $3.7m to Samsung Electronics America (SEA) for violating the US Shipping Act. The American affiliate of the Korean manufacturing giant filed a complaint with the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) in October 2022, claiming Zim engaged in “unreasonable practices, retaliation, refusal to deal, and improper invoices for home appliance products shipped to the US”. The case, which, according to FMC, saw the parties exchange more than two hundred thousand pages of documents, involved nearly 10,000 separate detention and demurrage (D&D) disputes on almost 3,000 containers from July 2019 to December 2022. Samsung had sought damages of over $12m – $10.8m for D&D charges plus $1.4m in additional costs. The majority of these shipments occurred prior to the Ocean Shipping Reform Act (OSRA), passed in 2022 and designed to resolve similar disputes quickly. ZIM argued that the accumulation of disputed charges was one of the reasons it imposed multiple cargo holds on SEA’s shipments, preventing it from being delivered and leading to additional demurrage charges; however, FMC ruled this argument to be insufficient. Meanwhile, FMC concluded that SEA has not established that ZIM was responsible for all detention and demurrage charges on door delivery/carrier haulage shipments. “SEA does not present evidence necessary to determine which specific detention and demurrage charges were the fault of ZIM, particularly given that some charges were due to SEA’s customers’ inability to accept deliveries,” it said. The two companies sought to settle the disputes earlier, and the proceeding was last stayed from April 18, 2024, to August 2, 2024, at the parties’ request. Based on the record provided, “after extensive discovery was conducted”, FMC ruled for reparations on three accounts totalling $3.68m. Samsung has also lodged cases with the FMC against COSCO, OOCL, SM Line and HMM, the latter being its largest complaint yet, claiming the South Korean carrier imposed around 96,000 detention and demurrage charges."

The110,500 dwt, Mitsui Ichihara-built vessel changed hands for $2.9m more than the last comparable deal that was struck in January. Then, Neda Maritime, controlled by the Lykiardopoulos family, sold the same aged, 109,300 dwt Suvretta, built by South Korea’s STX, for $31.5m to China’s Linghong Shipping. So far this year, only a few handful of Korean-built LR2 tankers have changed hands, according to VesselsValue. LR2-type tankers have coated tanks, unlike the equally sized aframax crude oil tankers, which allows them to carry both dirty cargo and clean petroleum products."

        "content": "Danish shipping giant Norden is celebrating what it claims is a world-first, completing a voyage from Singapore to Brazil using biofuel from what it claims came from a carbon-negative process. A Norden vessel used 65 tonnes of fuel blend with 20% MASH Makes biofuel in its auxiliary engine. MASH Makes biofuel is produced by heating agricultural residues at high temperatures without oxygen. The resulting bio-oil is comparable with ISO8217 standard fossil fuels. “This trial proves that MASH Makes’ biofuel is suitable for marine engines, and it marks an important milestone towards bringing the fuel into our operation,” said Henrik Røjel, head of decarbonisation and climate solutions at Norden. A recent climate impact report from independent research firm Boundless Impact assessed the environmental impact of the MASH Makes biofuel production process and found it to be carbon negative driven by the permanent carbon sequestration achieved through the co-produced biochar and its use in sustainable agriculture. For every tonne of biofuel produced, MASH Makes also generates 1.8 tonnes of biochar, a stable, carbon-rich material applied to soil. Each tonne of biochar locks 3.14 tonnes of CO₂ from theatmosphere into the ground, creating a direct link between fuel production and carbon removal. This means every tonne of MASH biofuel is associated with 5.7 tonnes of CO₂ being sequestered permanently in the soil. “Our biofuel meets the technical requirements of the shipping industry and can be used in unmodified engines. It’s a seamless, scalable alternative ready to cut emissions today,” maintained MASH Makes CEO Jakob Bejbro Andersen. MASH Makes biofuel is produced through pyrolysis, which converts agricultural residues into renewable energy. The company’s facility in Karnataka, India processes 23,700 tonnes of agricultural waste annually, producing 3,400 tonnes of bio-oil and large quantities of biochar. A second plant under construction will triple production capacity. The long-term goal: removing a gigatonne of CO₂ by 2040."

        "content": "London-listed dry bulk outfit Taylor Maritime has aligned its business with anticipated trade turbulence and taken advantage of improved market sentiment to sell 11 ships for $172.5m. The Ed Buttery-led company said that one bulker had already been delivered to its new owner, with the remaining 10 exiting the fleet by August this year, bringing in a total of $186.4m through vessel disposals this year. Taylor Maritime sold one ship in January for $13.9m and completed the transaction during the quarter. The company had 30 Japanese-built vessels at quarter end, which will reduce to 19 once all sales are complete. Overall, Taylor Maritime agreed to and completed 39 vessel sales since the beginning of 2023, generating gross proceeds of $630.6m. The company said that all net sales proceeds from the latest transactions, plus a portion of existing cash on the balance sheet, would be used for debt repayment, which is expected to reduce to $4.7m, saving about $12.4m in annual interest. “The vessel sales put the company on course to zero net bank debt,” Taylor Maritime said. Commenting on the trading update, chief executive Buttery, who, in addition to general overhead savings, agreed to a 25% reduction in his salary, noted: “Given our cautious view for 2025 amidst geopolitical and trade uncertainty, we have accelerated divestments, capitalising on seasonal improvement in market conditions and positive sentiment relating to Japanese-built vessels.” Buttery added that Taylor Maritime’s transition to a commercial company and focus on operational efficiency and cost reductions would “provide further resilience through a potentially volatile 2025”."

        "author": "Bojan Lepic",
        "content": "The US Department of the Interior has introduced a new policy which will see increased pressure differential during downhole commingling boost offshore oil output in the Gulf of Mexico. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement implemented new parameters for downhole commingling in the Paleogene (Wilcox) reservoirs, expanding the allowable pressure differential from 200 psi to 1,500 psi. This change could increase production output by roughly 10%, translating into a production increase of over 100,000 barrels per day over the next ten years. The Interior claimed that additional gains could be possible as operators provide further data. A University of Texas study shows that commingled production maximises per-well oil production compared to sequential schemes. Over 30 years, it provides 61% more oil recovery, and over 50 years, it yields 21% more. The policy shift is grounded in modern reservoir performance analysis and updates outdated guidance from a 2010 government study. Under the updated rules, operators can now safely produce from multiple reservoirs with greater pressure differences, provided they meet new conditions such as fluid compatibility certification, pressure monitoring, and regular performance reporting to BSEE. According to the Interior, this policy will increase production but also enhance resource conservation by expediting development from each reservoir, helping prevent waste and getting more value from every well."

        "content": "Today, there are around 130 VLCCs over 20 years old still trading, compared to fewer than 20 five years ago, according to data from Tankers International, which notes that around two-thirds of these vintage supertankers are engaged in moving sanctioned oil. Over the next four years, the number of vessels exceeding 20 years forecast by Tankers International to double, representing 21% of the trading fleet. A very small orderbook points towards an ongoing deficit in terms of fleet replacement. Just one VLCC was delivered last year, and only five are scheduled for 2025. Writing forSplashlast month, Mette Frederiksen, head of research and insight at Tankers International, noted: The current landscape presents a paradox: while the fleet is growing in number, the effective supply remains stagnant or in decline. With shipowner indecision and shipyard bottlenecks delaying the next wave of newbuilds, and older vessels struggling with efficiency losses, the VLCC market faces a prolonged period of supply tightness.” This supply tightness in terms of viable VLCCs able to trade worldwide has seen rates push up this month. The TD3C route from the Middle East to Asia was up $2,100 a day to $55,000 a day yesterday. “A shrinking list of available vessels is forcing charterers into swift action to avoid being left behind in this strengthening market,” noted a shipping report from SEB, a Swedish bank. “The gradual rate increases, unlike previous sharp spikes, are fueling owner optimism for sustained higher rates, a sentiment supported by the tighter vessel supply,” SEB added."

The first agreement, signed with China Energy Overseas Investment, entails the evaluation, development, and implementation of an offshore wind energy project in Azerbaijan. A second agreement, signed by the Ministry, SOCAR Green, China Datang Overseas Investment, and PowerChina, will focus on the development of a 2GW offshore wind energy project in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea. The parties will follow a phased approach, covering the design, financing, engineering, construction, operation, and maintenance of the project. These were just two of six documents relating to renewable energy projects signed by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev, during his visit to China. Other deals plan for solar power plants with a total capacity of 260MW, a 100MW floating solar power plant, a 30MW battery storage system, and cooperation on renewable energy and electric power system planning."

        "content": "Democratic Party Representative Salud Carbajal has reintroduced the California Clean Coast Act into the US Congress. The California Clean Coast Act would permanently ban future offshore oil and gas leasing in areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of California. The act was the first bill the congressman introduced as a member of Congress in an attempt to protect the state’s coast from offshore drilling and the devastating impact of oil spills. “Santa Barbara knows firsthand how devastating oil spills can be on our marine ecosystems and coastline,” said Carbajal. “I’m proud to lead this bill to ban future offshore oil drilling in our state and ensure California’s world-famous coastline is protected for future generations to enjoy.” “The California Clean Coast Act is critical to protecting our coast and climate from the threats of offshore oil drilling. From the 1969 blowout at Platform A to the 2015 pipeline spill along the Gaviota Coast, the California Coast has suffered the devastating effects of offshore oil development on communities who live, play, and work here. The California Clean Coast Act will preserve our precious coast from the threats of future oil spills and climate change,” added Linda Krop, chief counsel of the Environmental Defence Centre. At the end of the Biden administration, Carbajal’s eight-year push to ban future offshore oil drilling came to fruition when president Biden invoked his authority to protect over 2.5m sq km of federal waters from oil and gas exploration. Congressman Carbajal was one of 12 members of Congress who wrote to President Biden requesting this action before the end of his term. Several Republican-led states, Louisiana, Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, and Mississippi, filed a lawsuit to challenge Biden’s offshore drilling ban. After moving into the White House, US president Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council focused on boosting the country’s production and export of fossil fuels. The new council, headed by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, will be granted authority over federal agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, and transportation. Burgum was also directed to undo Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling. Carbajal’s bill is partnering with a pair of bills introduced in the Senate that aim to permanently block oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The combo package of legislations includes the West Coast Ocean Protection Act, introduced by Senator Alex Padilla, and the Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism Anti-Drilling Act, introduced by Senators Cory Booker and Jack Reed. Padilla’s bill would permanently prohibit new oil and gas leases for offshore drilling off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington state. The Booker and Reed bill would permanently bar the Interior Department or any of its agencies from issuing leases for the exploration, development, or production of oil and gas in the North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Straits of Florida Planning Areas of the US Outer Continental Shelf."

According to the Singapore firm, the agreement for the facility demonstrates the continued confidence of banking partners in the company’s strategy and credit quality. “This is Yinson Production’s first standby letter of credit and guarantee facility that enhances the efficiency of our capital structure by unlocking otherwise unproductive liquidity. It also provides added flexibility to support new projects, as we continue to see healthy demand for new FPSOs,” said Markus Wenker, CFO at Yinson Production. This is the second financial move made by the company this year, after the floater owner secured a$1bn investmentfrom a consortium of international investment companies in January. It also provided the option to issue additional redeemable convertible preferred shares of up to $500m within 24 months from closing."

        "author": "Andrew Craig-Bennett",
        "content": "Andrew Craig-Bennett warns about the risks of using prevalent knock-off spare parts. When a new ship leaves her builder for her maiden voyage, she will carry spare parts. We can probably – probably – assume that these spare parts, as well as the renewable and consumable components fitted in her mechanical and electrical systems, are genuine manufacturers’ items. I write ‘probably’ because the purchasing department is the profit centre in every shipyard that I know of, and some shipyard purchasing departments contain rather sharp characters. But let’s assume that the ship sets out in life with genuine spares onboard. This happy situation is unlikely to continue through the life of the ship. Our industry is absolutely infested with fakes, and we don’t care. Some readers may feel that the word fake is too strong and they would rather talk about pattern spares, secondary market spares, grey market spares and, particularly iniquitous, OEM spares. They are all fakes. And pretty much every seagoing engineer is engaged in a quiet battle with his own office and his own superintendents. Deck officers too, because there are fake spares for cranes, winches and especially hatch covers. This sort of thing goes on in the most admired shipowning companies as well as in the less reputable ones. The term OEM” means, of course, “Original Equipment Maker”. As a young man obsessed with motorcycles I asked my local motorbike shop for a new battery for a BMW bike. I knew the man I was talking to quite well (as one does) and he said: “Well, I can offer you two – here’s the BMW one (naming a price beyond the dreams of avarice – I think it was £70) or here’s the pattern spare (a third of the price). He went on: “If you look carefully at the plastic casing, you will see that the moulding marks are exactly the same!” I bought the pattern spare, of course. It had certainly come off the same production line as Bavarian Motor Works’ far more expensive battery and of course I thought no further than BMW are ripping their customers off. Now, I know better. A friend, of the engineering persuasion, has a hierarchy of spares and I’m going to quote his email to me: “In my experience these come in several types: Those manufactured by a third party but packaged identically to the genuine article – very difficult to tell until they fail. Copy spares manufactured to the correct specification under licence or even, once the original manufacturer has ceased trading to the original drawings – I have no problem with these and they frequently enable vessels to keep trading – spares for Titan separators and Malone pnumercators being two cases in point. We now come to the more dangerous spares, those marketed as OEM replacements but not fulfilling the original requirements.” At this point he gave as a prime example consumable spares for an extremely well known make of purifiers. Since everyone can guess the name I will leave you to do so. “There are a number of suppliers who make spares under licence for the original manufacturer / licensee, normally whilst these are being manufactured the original maker maintains a presence for quality control,” he wrote, adding: “Some of these manufacturers take advantage of having the proper drawings / specifications and produce extra ‘unofficial’ items. The (a ship we both remember) had a Sulzer engine and “X” sourced new liners from one of these manufacturers, sadly the material specification was not followed leading to rapid bore wear.” The conversation was started by my reminiscing about a set of generator valve springs which were indeed manufactured by the original maker, using indeed the correct material, but a part of the heat treatment had been skipped. That proved very expensive… Would you be happy to fly in an aircraft with pattern spares fitted? You would not, but you probably just said to yourself “Well, that’s aviation.. they are different” If (another case cited by my friend, in the engine room of a ship that I had ordered) a turbocharger explodes because the impeller contacts the volute, a consequence of the licensee (a very famous Japanese company) having substituted a non-creep-resistant material for the originally specified material, how safe is that? How safe is a purifier seal failure? What we have here is yet another case of, “It’s always been like this” and “How can you do anything about it?” Well, here’s a suggestion. How do you check if the Hours of Rest have been “flogged”? By comparing the Hours of Rest record with the Bell Book. (Yes, of course the thinking officer now writes up the Hours of Rest fiction with the Bell Book open in front of her or him). Do the same thing with the spares purchasing accounts – pick a couple of items and check against the real maker’s prices. Or (radical idea, I know) talk to your engineers."

The blast, which took place at Shahid Rajaee terminal on Saturday morning, damaged multiple buildings in the area and caused additional fires. Aerial footage showed at least three areas ablaze, with schools and offices in the area ordered to remain closed on Sunday as rescue teams work to contain the fire rising from the area of the explosion and attend to the injured. Iranian authorities have yet to determine the exact cause of the blast, however, Hossein Zafari, a spokesperson for Iran’s crisis management organisation, appeared to blame the incident on poor storage of chemicals in containers at Shahid Rajaee. “The cause of the explosion was the chemicals inside the containers,” he told Iran’s ILNA news agency. British maritime security consultants Ambrey said it believed the affected containers had contained solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles. The fire was the result of “improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles”, Ambrey said, adding that it was aware that an Iran-flagged ship “discharged a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel at the port in March 2025”. Zafari added that, the director general of crisis management had previously issued warnings to the port regarding the safe storage of chemicals during previous visits. Shahid Rajaee is Iran’s top container hub, handling a majority of the country’s boxed goods. The terminal on the Strait of Hormuz also suffered a major cyberattack incident in May 2020, for which Iran blamed Israel. Oil facilities were not affected by the blast on Saturday, Iranian authorities said. No damage to ships or casualties among crews had been confirmed.

No casualties or damage to cargo have been reported, however, the bulk carrier’s stern was punctured and partially sunk. The bulker was carrying 809 tons of gypsum. The containership’s bow hit the bulker’s port side near the bulker’s deckhouse, penetrating the bulker’s after hold. Flooding from the damage caused theGlengyleto partially sink and is now resting on the river’s shallow bottom. The collision caused fuel oil to spill from the bulker. As of Saturday, the two ships remained interlocked, with tugs on scene and monitoring. The Vietnamese authorities dispatched rescue vessels to separate the two vessels, while another team was sent to the location to handle the oil spill. After the incident, the two ships moved to a position close to the shore, so it did not affect traffic.

        "content": "Since US president Donald Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council and instructed Interior secretary Doug Burgum to undo Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling, more and more bills have been put in front of Congress to ban fossil fuel drilling in one part of the country or another. The latest in a package of eight bills sent to Congress to protect the Pacific and Atlantic oceans from fossil fuel drilling is a bill from representative Jimmy Panetta. The new bill, named the Central Coast of California Conservation Act, is looking to ban new offshore fossil fuel drilling along the coast from Monterey to Mendocino County. The bill would prohibit new exploration, development or production leases for natural gas or oil along the Central Coast and a portion of the North Coast of California. Panetta noted that the waters in question hold at least 26 marine mammal species, 94 seabird species, four sea turtle species, more than 340 fish species, thousands of invertebrate species, and more than 450 marine algae species. “California’s coast supports tourism, recreation, agriculture, fisheries, and shipping, contributing $44bn to California’s GDP each year,” he added. The Central Coast of California Conservation Act has also received support from many organisations and interest groups, such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Defenders of Wildlife California, Oceana, the Natural Resources Defence Council, Save Our Shores, the Centre for Biological Diversity, and the Ocean Conservancy. Splash recently reported on Democratic Party representative Salud Carbajalreintroducingthe California Clean Coast Act into the US Congress which is looking to permanently ban future offshore oil and gas leasing in areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of California. This bill was also followed by the West Coast Ocean Protection Act, introduced by senator Alex Padilla, and the Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism Anti-Drilling Act, introduced by senators Cory Booker and Jack Reed focused on California, Oregon, Washington state, the North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Straits of Florida Planning Areas of the US Outer Continental Shelf. Another similar bill wasintroducedby Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse and congressman Seth Magaziner, who are leading a bipartisan group of senators to ban offshore drilling along the coast of New England. New England consists of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. All of the states have representatives supporting the bill except Vermont."

Cairn will be one of the first companies in India to utilise 3D CSEM survey technology, which is known for mapping subsurface resistivity. The survey will be conducted using EMGS’ vessel,Atlantic Guardian. The vessel is expected to acquire data in the block over the next few weeks. Once data acquisition is complete, the survey will be processed to enable enhanced exploration strategies. The data gathered will be integrated with re-processed 3D seismic data, facilitating the creation of more accurate subsurface models. This integration is expected to significantly reduce exploration risks and help in identifying and prioritising key prospects within the block’s extensive offshore exploration portfolio. Cairn Oil & Gas currently holds over 4,500 sq km of offshore deepwater blocks in the KG Basin, with water depths ranging from 500 to 2,500 m. The company plans to begin drilling operations in 2026 within a 3,600 sq km area that includes four significant gas discoveries with a multi-trillion cubic feet potential."

        "content": "US president Donald Trump has called for free passage of American ships through two of the vital shipping waterways, the Panama and Suez canals. Trump said in a social media post on Saturday that American ships, both military and commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the two canals, adding that the two routes “would not exist” without the US and that he had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately take care of” the situation. The Panama Canal in Central America connects the Pacific and the Atlantic. The Suez Canal in the Middle East links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. The Trump administration has repeatedly insisted that the US will take back control of thePanama Canalin Central America, which links the Pacific and the Atlantic, and which he claims to be under China’s influence. The US largely built the canal in the 1900s and administered the territory surrounding the passage for decades. Washington handed control of the waterway to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter after a period of joint administration. An estimated 5% of global seaborne trade sails through the artificial 82-km waterway in an average year. The shortcut dramatically reduces the time for ships to travel between the two oceans, enabling them to avoid the route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan. It helps move roughly $270bn worth of cargo annually, including about 40% of all US container traffic. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said during a recent visit to Panama City that the US was seeking a deal under which its warships could pass through the canal “first and free”. He also floated the idea of US troops returning to Panama to “secure” its strategically vital canal. Meanwhile, Trump’s demand on the Suez route —a major economic lifeline for Egypt delivering billions in revenue and a vital shipping artery— represents a new shift of focus. The 193-km link between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, launched in 1869, attracted about 12% to 15% of worldwide trade and about 30% of global container traffic before attacks by Yemen’s Houthis on shipping routes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Red Sea crisis saw Egypt’s revenue stream from the operation plunge by more than 50% as ships started taking a long detour around the southern tip of Africa. The US has been attacking Houthis since January last year, and that campaign has intensified under Trump, who has pledged to pressure the Iran-backed militants until they are no longer a threat to shipping. American Ships, both Military and Commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the Panama and Suez Canals! Those Canals would not exist without the United States of America. I’ve asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to immediately take care of, and…"

        "content": "German utility RWE has frozen all of its US offshore wind operations due to the political environment created by the administration of current president Donald Trump. In November last year, while the campaign for the new US president was still hot, the company said that the possibility of a new administration could jeopardise its operations and that it might have to delay its plan to spend €55bn ($62.4bn) on green technologies globally by 2030. After Trump took office and started his crusade against offshore wind, RWE revealed that it would be scaling back its operations in the US and that it would lay off some of its offshore wind employees. RWE Offshore Wind Services, a US subsidiary of the company, said at the time that it would cut around 73 employees from the Boston area. The layoffs mostly affected workers supporting the long-term development of offshore wind projects across the country. Now, Marcus Krebber, CEO of RWE, said in a speech transcript that he’ll deliver at the company’s AGM on Wednesday, that its US offshore wind business is closed “for the time being”. However, the onshore wind, solar energy, and battery storage businesses will continue normally. Due to the US political developments, Krebber stated that the company would be more stringent regarding requirements for future US investments. “All necessary federal permits must be in place. Tax credits must be safe-harboured and all relevant tariff risks mitigated. In addition, onshore wind and solar projects must have secured offtake at the time of the investment decision. Only if these conditions are met will further investments be possible, given the political environment,” the RWE CEO said. RWE already has invested heavily in US offshore wind with $1.1bn already splashed out for a lease area in New York, where it is supposed to develop the 3GW Community Offshore Wind with the UK’s National Grid as its partner. The project was scheduled to come online in the early 2030s and should power over a million homes. It also paid an additional $5.6bn for the Louisiana lease in the Gulf of Mexico in 2023 to develop the Canopy Offshore Wind project off Northern California."

According to NOAA Fisheries data provided in the statement from the senators, ocean and coastal industries, including tourism, fishing, and recreation, generate more than $17.5bn in New England annually. They claimed in the statement that expanding drilling in the Atlantic would harm New England’s key industries and significantly increase the chance of environmental disaster in the region.

The unit is set to be deployed at the Petronas-operated Block 52. The Malaysian giant has also been the block’s 100% owner since ExxonMobil opted to abandon its share in November last year. The FLNG unit is set to be located some 120 km off Suriname’s coast, and will tap into the Sloanea gas field, at a water depth of around 450 m. According to Wison New Energies, the unit will be able to receive the feed gas from the subsea production system, process the stream to produce LNG and condensate product for both domestic use and export to the international market. The feasibility study could serve as the basis for a FEED study, accelerating Suriname’s energy independence."

        "content": "US president Donald Trump has called for free passage of American ships through two of the vital shipping waterways, the Panama and Suez canals. Trump said in a social media post on Saturday that American ships, both military and commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the two canals, adding that the two routes “would not exist” without the US and that he had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately take care of” the situation. The Panama Canal in Central America connects the Pacific and the Atlantic. The Suez Canal in the Middle East links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. The Trump administration has repeatedly insisted that the US will take back control of thePanama Canalin Central America, which links the Pacific and the Atlantic, and which he claims to be under China’s influence. The US largely built the canal in the 1900s and administered the territory surrounding the passage for decades. Washington handed control of the waterway to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter after a period of joint administration. An estimated 5% of global seaborne trade sails through the artificial 82-km waterway in an average year. The shortcut dramatically reduces the time for ships to travel between the two oceans, enabling them to avoid the route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan. It helps move roughly $270bn worth of cargo annually, including about 40% of all US container traffic. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said during a recent visit to Panama City that the US was seeking a deal under which its warships could pass through the canal “first and free”. He also floated the idea of US troops returning to Panama to “secure” its strategically vital canal. Meanwhile, Trump’s demand on the Suez route —a major economic lifeline for Egypt delivering billions in revenue and a vital shipping artery— represents a new shift of focus. The 193-km link between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, launched in 1869, attracted about 12% to 15% of worldwide trade and about 30% of global container traffic before attacks by Yemen’s Houthis on shipping routes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Red Sea crisis saw Egypt’s revenue stream from the operation plunge by more than 50% as ships started taking a long detour around the southern tip of Africa. The US has been attacking Houthis since January last year, and that campaign has intensified under Trump, who has pledged to pressure the Iran-backed militants until they are no longer a threat to shipping. American Ships, both Military and Commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the Panama and Suez Canals! Those Canals would not exist without the United States of America.

        "content": "Vitol has announced the launch of a new FuelEU Maritime-compliant co-processed very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). The Switzerland-based commodity trading giant said the co-processed fuel matches the chemical composition and operational qualities of conventional bunkers and eliminates the need for additional permissions or special clauses in charter party agreements. The new fuel is being produced under the ISCC-EU scheme certification by Vitol’s refinery in Fujairah and will be marketed in multiple locations by Vitol Bunkers. Vitol said the sustainable fraction of the fuel is comparable in carbon intensity to used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME), achieving a GHG reduction of more than 70% compared to fossil-based alternatives. “As regulatory complexity increases, we continue to innovate – bringing products to market that help our customers comply in the most efficient and convenient way for them,” said Ian Butler, head of energy transition for shipping at Vitol. Monitoring of lower GHG intensity fuels for compliance with FuelEU Maritime regulations is done in conjunction with DNV’s Emissions Connect platform where co-processed and other sustainable fuels consumption is monitored for ultimate verification in 2026. The first ship to take on the co-processed bunker at Fujairah was suezmax tankerElandra Falcon(pictured)."

        "content": "Jamie Jones, chief operating officer at GTMaritime, writes for Splash today. Cyber attacks are getting smarter. Email security tools are getting noisier. And crew are stuck in the middle – expected to spot sophisticated phishing attempts while juggling operational duties, limited bandwidth, and an inbox full of warning messages that all sound the same. This is the problem no one’s talking about: alert fatigue. Maritime operators have invested heavily in security. Training programmes, warning systems, malware filters – they’re all in place. But it’s not working as it should, because we’ve reached a tipping point where the noise is drowning out the signal. Crew are getting so many alerts that they’ve stopped paying attention. And when that happens, even the most sophisticated security system becomes meaningless. New research from Mimecast shows that 95% of organisations still expect email security challenges to persist into 2025. That alone is worrying. But 61% believe those challenges will have a negative business impact – and when you look at the current setup, it’s not hard to see why. Security tools are generating so many warnings that users are desensitised. It’s like a smoke alarm going off every time someone makes toast – eventually, you just stop listening. In shipping, this has real-world consequences. Email remains the backbone of vessel-shore communication: operational updates, compliance documents, crisis coordination, vendor contracts. Everything flows through email, especially with asynchronous connectivity at sea. If the inbox becomes a battlefield of constant alerts and false positives, it doesn’t just impact productivity – it creates serious risk. We’ve seen examples where phishing emails, disguised as messages from port agents or technical suppliers, slip through unnoticed among the numerous other security alerts. This leads to user uncertainty—when a legitimate warning appears, it may not receive the prompt attention it needs. In these moments of hesitation, system vulnerabilities can be exploited, resulting in security breaches. And this isn’t a training issue alone. Yes, 87% of organisations say they’re training staff to spot threats – but are they training the right people, in the right way? In shipping, the workforce is constantly rotating. Many crew don’t have English as a first language. They’re operating in high-stress environments where tech isn’t always intuitive, and distractions are everywhere. A quarterly awareness session or an online module just isn’t enough. What’s needed now is a reset in how we think about email security. Less noise, more intelligence. Security systems that do more of the work quietly, in the background. Tools that filter out low-priority clutter and only raise the alarm when it actually matters. Because if everything is urgent, then nothing is. According to SpamTitan, even the most sophisticated phishing campaigns typically fool only 1-2% of users. However, GTMaritime’s own phishing simulations reveal a higher vulnerability within the maritime sector: 15% of tested users clicked on malicious links, and 7% submitted personal data. Even a single compromised user, especially someone with high-level access or during a critical moment in the voyage cycle, could lead to significant damage. With AI-generated phishing emails becoming increasingly convincing and context-aware, distinguishing genuine communications from threats is becoming more challenging than ever. Trust in these systems is starting to erode. Crew see constant warnings, they click to dismiss, they stop believing what their tools are telling them. That’s when the real damage starts – not with the malware, but with the mindset. It’s no longer enough to tell people to “stay vigilant.” We need to build systems that are smart enough to know when not to cry wolf. Because when the wolves really do show up, they’ll be counting on us to be too tired, too distracted, or too desensitised to stop them."

The authorities decided to amend their North Sea Programme and, with it, reduce the offshore wind energy target from 50GW to 21GW. This also comes with the removal of the Lagelander wind energy area, located west of Texel and Vlieland, from future offshore wind plans due to its great value for fishing. As a result, the area is no longer considered a wind energy area. The removal of the wind energy area opens a zone between 1,520 to 1,620 sq km free of wind turbines. According to the amended plan, this will preserve a catchment area for the Norwegian lobster known as langoustine and allow the current fishing activities in this area to continue. The previous target of 50GW of wind energy has been postponed to the next North Sea Programme in 2028."

It will be moored at a water depth of approximately 2,000m, around 200 km South of Rio de Janeiro. The FPSO will feature a new custom-made next-generation hull to meet the 25-year design life. This will be the 19th FPSO to be developed by Modec for Brazil. It will be the second unit to be delivered directly to Shell by the Japanese firm for operation in Brazil. On top of the purchase and sales deal, Shell and Modec signed a 20-year contract for the operations and maintenance of the FPSO. The Gato do Mato consortium includes operator Shell with a 50% stake and its partners Ecopetrol and TotalEnergies, which hold 30% and 20% stakes, respectively.

The value of the contract is estimated approximately €520m ($592m) over the three years required to complete the project. The Liverpool Bay CCS project will serve the HyNet industrial cluster, situated in one of the UK’s most energy-intensive industrial districts. Saipem’s scope of work concerns the EPC and assistance to the commissioning of a new CO2 electrical compression station. This new facility will be integrated with both the offshore and onshore segments of the overall development. The gas compression and treatment facility will allow for permanent CO2 storage in offshore depleted fields under Liverpool Bay. This comes less than a week after Eni reached the financial close with the UK Government’s Department of Energy Security and Net Zero for the project. The Liverpool Bay CCS project will operate as the backbone of the HyNet Cluster to transport carbon dioxide from capture plants across the North West of England and North Wales through new and repurposed infrastructure to safe and permanent storage in Eni’s depleted natural gas reservoirs, located under the seabed in Liverpool Bay. The project itself foresees the efficient repurposing of part of the offshore platforms as well as 149 km of onshore and offshore pipelines, and the construction of 35 km of new pipelines to connect industrial emitters to the Liverpool Bay CCS network."

The offer will be made by a newly established company jointly owned by the three big shareholders. The new company, named Electric, has already agreed to acquire nearly 2.8m shares of Edda Wind owned by funds managed by Nordea for NOK 23 ($2.22) per share or around $6.2m. Following the acquisition of Nordea’s shares, Electric holds approximately 84.3% of the shares in Edda Wind. The offer for the remaining shares is a premium of 32.9% to the closing price for the shares on April 28 of NOK 17.30 ($1.67). It values the total share capital of the company at a market capitalisation of approximately NOK 2.97bn ($287.5m). As part of the offer, a delisting of Edda Wind shares from the Oslo Stock Exchange will be requested. If, following completion of the offer, Electric holds 90% or more of the total issued share capital of the company, it intends to carry out a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares. According to a statement on Oslo Bors regarding the offer, the trio sees Edda Wind’s concentrated ownership situation as a key hindrance for a low free float and poor stock liquidity. “Following a series of equity capital raises, it has become evident to the three largest shareholders that it will be challenging to continue investing and scaling the company in a public setting,” the statement read."

        "content": "US president Donald Trump has called for free passage of American ships through two of the vital shipping waterways, the Panama and Suez canals. Trump said in a social media post on Saturday that American ships, both military and commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the two canals, adding that the two routes “would not exist” without the US and that he had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately take care of” the situation. The Panama Canal in Central America connects the Pacific and the Atlantic. The Suez Canal in the Middle East links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. The Trump administration has repeatedly insisted that the US will take back control of thePanama Canalin Central America, which links the Pacific and the Atlantic, and which he claims to be under China’s influence. The US largely built the canal in the 1900s and administered the territory surrounding the passage for decades. Washington handed control of the waterway to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter after a period of joint administration. An estimated 5% of global seaborne trade sails through the artificial 82-km waterway in an average year. The shortcut dramatically reduces the time for ships to travel between the two oceans, enabling them to avoid the route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan. It helps move roughly $270bn worth of cargo annually, including about 40% of all US container traffic. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said during a recent visit to Panama City that the US was seeking a deal under which its warships could pass through the canal “first and free”. He also floated the idea of US troops returning to Panama to “secure” its strategically vital canal. Meanwhile, Trump’s demand on the Suez route —a major economic lifeline for Egypt delivering billions in revenue and a vital shipping artery— represents a new shift of focus. The 193-km link between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, launched in 1869, attracted about 12% to 15% of worldwide trade and about 30% of global container traffic before attacks by Yemen’s Houthis on shipping routes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Red Sea crisis saw Egypt’s revenue stream from the operation plunge by more than 50% as ships started taking a long detour around the southern tip of Africa. The US has been attacking Houthis since January last year, and that campaign has intensified under Trump, who has pledged to pressure the Iran-backed militants until they are no longer a threat to shipping. American Ships, both Military and Commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the Panama and Suez Canals! Those Canals would not exist without the United States of America. I’ve asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to immediately take care of, and…"

The spinoff of China’s largest private shipyard, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, said the newly incorporated company would function as a dedicated maritime investment platform, focused on “unlocking value across the entire maritime value chain” – from finance leasing and brokerage services to broader investment participation. The outfit will be led by Yangzijiang Financial’s chairman and CEO, Ren Yuanlin. “This is a natural evolution of our strategy,” Ren said, adding: “Our maritime business is ready to stand on its own, backed by strong fundamentals and a clear vision for expansion. By separating our maritime segment from Yangzijiang Financial’s investment platform, we will be better positioned to pursue focused growth while delivering enhanced value to shareholders.” Yangzijiang Financial was separated from its shipbuilding and shipowning parent in 2022 and has since invested in both wet and dry shipping segments. The shipping investment spinoff should take place in the next six to 12 months, with the remaining group continuing to focus on funds, diversified asset management and investment operations."

        "content": "A recent survey shows more than 80% of Americans woulds like to see more manufacturing move home, and yet the same poll shows less than 20% of the population would be willing to work in the sector, a juxtaposition perfectly illustrating the hurdles the Trump administration faces if it really genuinely wants to resurrect its moribund shipbuilding scene. The fact is, as I’ve stated on more than one occasion, shipbuilding is a heavy industry, and by extension, it is a stage an economy goes through, and then leaves behind. I well recall an old colleague of mine, more than 20 years ago, returning from South Korea where the vice president of Hyundai Heavy Industries, the nation’s number one yard, told him: “I look forward to the day my country is no longer the world’s largest shipbuilder.” He understood that this heavy industry is a building block on the way to a more advanced economy, a process that comes and goes. Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, lambasted the American plans earlier this year in an OpEd, arguing quite correctly in my opinion: “The chasm between American and Chinese shipbuilding is fundamentally a gap in industrial infrastructure. The forces of globalization swept away America’s steel mills, machine shops and skilled labor force, leaving behind rusting supply chains and a hollowed-out manufacturing base. Shipbuilding, a quintessential heavy industry, requires a robust industrial foundation. When that foundation crumbles, shipbuilding inevitably follows.” Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. This particular ship has passed for America.

        "content": "Just weeks into the new world order, bulk carrier owners were relieved to be told that the US Trade Representative had decided not to charge owners and operators of Chinese bulkers the egregiously excessive port fees that had been mooted. Not $1.5m per call, or even the lesser $50 per net ton for Chinese-owned ships calling at US ports. All bulk ships under 80,000 dwt get a free pass as do bulkers on the Great Lakes and those trading to the Caribbean. This will be a huge relief to US exporters of grains and beans who tend to use ships up to panamax size. The new rules are scheduled to take effect from October 2025, which gives ample time for them to be watered down, replaced or entirely forgotten as the US administration continues to have its attention distracted on a daily basis. The Chinese politburo will meet at the end of April to discuss subsidy measures to maintain economic growth. Meanwhile, Beijing has announced that some US products will not be subject to tariffs. With Trump saying that he will be “nice” to China, it seems both sides are pulling back from the brink, at least for now. Sadly, none of this has had time to filter into the bulk carrier freight market. The Baltic Dry Index followed a 30% rise in March to 1,598 points with a 16% fall in April to 1,373 points, making this the worst April since 2020 when the world was going into Coronavirus lockdown. The Baltic Capesize Index peaked at 2,893 on March 13 only to lose 1,004 points by April 25, when it was at 1,889 points. Iron ore prices dipped to below $96 in early April and remain just under $100 at the time of writing, having ended March at $105 per tonne. Is this just a wobble? Much depends on what combination of economic stimuli China’s leadership announces in early May. That may depend on China-US talks, though Chinese officials deny any trade discussions are actually taking place. Meanwhile, daily TCEs on the Australia-China voyage, which should have benefited from falling bunker prices, lost 25% in the first 25 days of April, dribbling to a mediocre $14,444 per day. TCEs on the Brazil-China route fared equally badly, also losing 25% to sit at $16,780. The transpacific trade war hit panamax earnings hard with TCEs for the panamax north Pacific round voyage losing 21% so far in April, to land at $12,130 per day as of April 25, though they had been as low as $11,519 on April 14. Dollar-per-day rates for the kamsarmax voyage from Mississippi to Qingdao varied surprisingly little in April, starting the month at $18,045 and ending up on the 25th at $18,522. However, with the cap on US port fees coming in at 80,000 dwt, Mississippi may see fewer kamsarmaxes after October this year. Kamsarmax rates from Santos to Qingdao lost 6% over April, falling to $13,249 per day. There was a 14% fall so far in April in panamax freight rates on the South China – Indonesia and back thermal coal round voyage. TCEs for this round trip sat at $11,483 on April 25 via a low of $10,475 on April 17. There appears to be an issue around ship sizes as freight rates on the same voyage for ultramax bulkers rose by 13% over the same dates to $16,011. Ultramax earnings have been variable and unpredictable this month. TCEs on the North China to West Africa trip out were stable, ending March at $13,670 and sitting at $14,068 on April 25. The North China – Australia round voyage lost 10% over the same dates, falling to $11,644. The trip out from the Indian Ocean to China rose 3% to $11,667. In the Atlantic, the West Africa – South America – Europe trip rose 7% to $11,221 while the US Gulf to Europe voyage fell 18% to $14,089 and the trip out from the Black Sea to Asia lost 7% to sit at $11,708 on April 25. Still, the monthly average for ultramax daily earnings is $10,077 so far in April, compared to $9,865 in March and $7,746 in February. There was less fortune in April for handysize bulker owners as earnings fell along all but one of the major routes. In the Atlantic, the rate from northwest Europe to east coast South America fell 9% to $6,514 and to the US Gulf rates fell 6% to 9,175. In the other direction, rates from Brazil to northwest Europe rose 4% to $14,928, the one bright spot, while rates from the US Gulf to NW Europe fell 6% to $10,304. In the Pacific, the Southeast Asia round voyage gave up its 14% March gain by falling 12% to $10,063 on April 25, though it had been as low as $9,975 two days earlier. The Northeast Asia round voyage TCE followed a 20% increase in March with an 11% fall in April so far to $10,406. The North China to Southeast Asia trip fell 12% to $10,100 per day."

        "content": "US president Donald Trump has called for free passage of American ships through two of the vital shipping waterways, the Panama and Suez canals. Trump said in a social media post on Saturday that American ships, both military and commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the two canals, adding that the two routes “would not exist” without the US and that he had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately take care of” the situation. The Panama Canal in Central America connects the Pacific and the Atlantic. The Suez Canal in the Middle East links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. The Trump administration has repeatedly insisted that the US will take back control of thePanama Canalin Central America, which links the Pacific and the Atlantic, and which he claims to be under China’s influence. The US largely built the canal in the 1900s and administered the territory surrounding the passage for decades. Washington handed control of the waterway to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter after a period of joint administration. An estimated 5% of global seaborne trade sails through the artificial 82-km waterway in an average year. The shortcut dramatically reduces the time for ships to travel between the two oceans, enabling them to avoid the route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan. It helps move roughly $270bn worth of cargo annually, including about 40% of all US container traffic. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said during a recent visit to Panama City that the US was seeking a deal under which its warships could pass through the canal “first and free”. He also floated the idea of US troops returning to Panama to “secure” its strategically vital canal. Meanwhile, Trump’s demand on the Suez route —a major economic lifeline for Egypt delivering billions in revenue and a vital shipping artery— represents a new shift of focus. The 193-km link between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, launched in 1869, attracted about 12% to 15% of worldwide trade and about 30% of global container traffic before attacks by Yemen’s Houthis on shipping routes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Red Sea crisis saw Egypt’s revenue stream from the operation plunge by more than 50% as ships started taking a long detour around the southern tip of Africa. The US has been attacking Houthis since January last year, and that campaign has intensified under Trump, who has pledged to pressure the Iran-backed militants until they are no longer a threat to shipping. American Ships, both Military and Commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the Panama and Suez Canals! Those Canals would not exist without the United States of America. I’ve asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to immediately take care of, and…"

        "content": "Donald Trump kicked off a month of chaotictariff announcements, ushering in a period of blank sailings for containerships greater than the covid era. April 2 saw the American president bring in a blanket 10% tariff on every nation, plus varying extra levels on many counties. These extra levies were then given a 90-day reprieve with the exception of China, where tit-for-tat tariff escalations saw levels rise to 145%, effectively shutting off trade between the two largest economies in the world. The 83rd gathering of theMarine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC)at the London headquarters of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The final agreement on mid-terms measures sees a fuel standard, as such a mandate on the greenhouse gas intensity of energy used, coupled with a pricing and trading mechanism. Ships that do not reduce their intensity of GHG emissions – including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — in line with two reduction trajectories outlined in the new regulations, which still need to be promulgated at the next MEPC in October, are deemed to have an emissions deficit. This must then be addressed by buying so-called remedial units. Also agreed at this month’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee meeting held at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), was the world’s biggestemission control area (ECA). The new Northeast Atlantic ECA, due by 2027, stretches along coastlines from Portugal to Greenland, joining existing nearby ECAs in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean. Belgium’sCMB.TECHand one of Europe’s largest dry bulk owners,Golden Ocean, have signed a term sheet for a stock-for-stock merger that will create a maritime giant with a combined fleet of more than 250 vessels. Under the agreement, unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, the shipowning vehicle controlled by the Saverys family would end up as the surviving entity, based on an exchange ratio of 0.95 shares of CBM.TECH for each share of Golden Ocean. The United States will impose fees onChinese-built ships calling at American ports—regardless of ownership, in a ruling that the global shipping community has been waiting to hear about for months. The glimmer of good news for non-Chinese owners is that the final measure is less severe than the originally proposed flat fee of $1.5m per port call. Chinese owners, on the other hand, are potentially on the hook for millions of dollars more in fees than originally envisaged in the latest example of the Trump administration singling out the People’s Republic for economic punishment. The European Commission adopted another key measure to crack down on the so-calledshadow fleetpassing through its waters. The amendment to the Vessel Monitoring Directive now requires all vessels, including those merely passing through European Union waters without entering an EU port, to provide insurance information."

The Bing Chen-led tonnage provider has booked six 10,000 teu vessels with delivery likely starting in 2028. No value has been revealed for the shipbuilding contract that was concluded in renminbi rather than US dollars, and detailed vessel specifications have yet to be revealed. Seaspan is the world’s largest containership lessor with a fleet of 188 vessels, excluding newbuildings, which have now reached 41 confirmed units. The latest deal marks the third batch of orders the company placed at Shanghai Waigaoqiao, after the 7,000 teu series and large 10,800 ceu car carriers. Alphaliner said the odds are that the 10,000 teu series have already been backed by a long-term charter deal with one of the box carriers."

        "content": "The forward freight agreement (FFA) market is now worth $100bn, but the shipping community as a whole still has much to learn from the sector, delegates attending this week’s Geneva Dry were told. Since 2020 onwards there has been a sharp increase in FFAs, bringing a big increase in liquidity according to Greg McAndrew, a partner covering derivatives for SSY. The increase in volumes from specialists, hedge funds, and commodities giants has been great for liquidity said Claudia Gerotto, Head of Sales – Global Commodities, European Energy Exchange who maintained the whole system benefits from this new customer group. “Over the past five years volumes have increased significantly and right now the liquidity is amazing,” said Ardalan Sappino, an FFA trader at Swissmarine. Philippe van den Abeele, the CIO at Consortium Maritime Trading, argued that FFAs give investors the chance to invest in a virtual ship by looking at the forward price curve. “Virtual shipping is a new way to navigate the market,” van den Abeele told delegates attending this week’s Swiss dry bulk summit. The FFA session also discussed screen trading, something that has been led by broker Braemar, but also something that was deemed to be a bit too advanced for shipping. Braemar Screen has had “quite a big impact” according to Chase Bennett, the CEO of Zuma Labs, while Swissmarine’s Sappino said that while this technology is “great”, the shipping market as a whole is not ready for screen trading. Van den Abeele suggested a new FFA screen should be created owned by all the FFA brokers. “The only way to have a more vibrant market is to have a more hybrid system,” van den Abeele said. SSY’s McAndrew cautioned that it would be hard to get all the broker community together."

        "content": "Steven Jones, founder of the Seafarers Happiness Index, discusses how the demands of old ships and new tech are taking something of a workload toll. They say change is as good as a rest. For seafarers, though, that is plain nonsense. Still, ever optimistic, there is much from the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) tripartite Maritime Labour Convention committee to unpack. So, first question, is this a genuinely positive shake-up to change life at sea, or just a case of hope initially triumphing over experience? In the latest Geneva meeting, the committee addressed important issues, including: recognition of seafarers as “key workers,” a push for wage hikes, strengthened shore leave rights, and steps to tackle practical onboard needs such as harassment protection, menstrual product provision, and properly fitting PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). Fine ideals indeed — but for those at sea such promises have a frustratingly long history of being lost in translation. The true assessment of regulatory progress can only ever really be measured against shipboard delivery, and here the picture becomes far less certain. So, will “key worker” status genuinely change the daily grind? Can improved shore leave rights overcome the persistent hurdles: impossibly short port stays, exhaustion that favours sleep over socialising, prohibitive transport costs, surly officials, and remote terminals? We can perhaps guess, but let’s keep it light for now. The upward adjustment to seafarer wages marks some (very) small progress, but here comes the reality check: the true value of remuneration must always be seen in the context of actual working conditions and hours performed. Increases are obviously welcome, but the fundamental question persists: do these adjustments genuinely reflect the value of seafarers and the demands placed upon them? Troublingly, whatever we may suspect we cannot truly say. We just do not know the full complete picture, as shipping lacks an accurate insight into real seafarer workloads. According to the World Maritime University (WMU), two-thirds of crew members admit to falsifying their work/rest records to appear compliant. This widespread manipulation creates a significant reality gap, particularly among shipowners and flags occupying the lower rungs of industry standards. Perhaps the most indicative issue is that of measuring rest and recreation, which brings us back to the ongoing shore leave problem. In the latest Seafarers Happiness Index (SHI) report, shore leave was a major concern, sitting alongside its troubling twin, fatigue. Tiredness, the lack of time off, and the dearth of chances to get ashore, show that workload issues are leading causes of stress and discontent at sea. Relentless work schedules with little to no margin for rest compound the exhaustion from unceasing toil. This creates a downward spiral of frustration and deteriorating morale. The latest happiness data paints a stark picture, especially on older ships, where compressed schedules, multiplying inspections, and dwindling crew numbers erode energy, resilience, and willingness. The risks to both welfare and operational safety are profound. A ticking workload timebomb threatens the industry, especially as crews must maintain aging vessels while adopting new technologies. For seafarers, old ships mean new problems, and new solutions raise old fears. Aging vessels present a perfect storm. Stretched crews face an ever-growing maintenance burden, forced to firefight only the most critical issues. Deferred maintenance threatens both vessel safety and crew wellbeing, as backlogs extend and weigh heavily on morale. When ships finally reach port, essential repairs often devour any hope of shore leave, no matter what new regulations might promise. As Chiefs and Superintendents demand work the ship comes first, with flogged hours the norm. This crew burden cycle creates not just physical exhaustion but psychological strain too, as seafarers struggle to keep aging systems operational with inadequate time and resources. Preventative maintenance is a luxury they can rarely afford. Yet the challenge does not end there. Alongside the struggle with deteriorating vessels looms the equally demanding task of mastering new systems and technologies. Seafarers report growing frustration at being expected to install, optimise, and operate new technology without proper training or support. The long-promised workload reduction has yet to materialise. Instead, implementation creates new stressors. Companies install new systems expecting immediate results, often providing little meaningful support. Officers bear responsibility for complex, unfamiliar equipment, with documentation that is either inadequate or excessively technical. Seafarers must self-teach on the fly, all while managing their original duties and that seemingly endless maintenance backlog. Pressure escalates, demands multiply, and the glossy promises made by technology salespeople crumble in the face of real-world pressures and unrealistic expectations. Sadly, even “key worker” status offers seafarers little insulation against the harsh realities of having too much to do, too few people to do it, and of it all being too difficult to ever get right."

        "content": "PD Ports has revealed plans to build one of the UK’s largest offshore wind manufacturing and installation hubs – the Teesport Offshore Gateway – an investment worth around £200m ($267m). The project will unlock just shy of 730,000 sq m of development potential for a range of offshore manufacturers, assembly, marshalling, and supply chain support services. The Teesport Offshore Gateway will include an up to 1 km long deepwater riverside quay, permitting unrestricted access to the North Sea and suitable for both floating and fixed-bottom offshore wind development. While the plans are at an early stage and subject to variation, the development of the Teesport Offshore Gateway would secure critical port facilities in support of the UK government’s offshore wind development ambitions. PD Ports is looking to engage with the offshore renewables sector to explore the potential of the proposals, working with original equipment manufacturers, developers, the government, and industry experts to shape the strategic direction of the site and identify opportunities for collaboration and funding. Insight from the offshore sector will aid the design of more detailed plans to meet future industry requirements. The site has already secured both planning consent and marine consent to extend an existing riverside berth to develop the 15.5m deepwater mooring, which would be large enough to accommodate all current and planned offshore installation vessels available globally. The creation of a new deepwater berth for Teesport will also future-proof the port, opening up wider opportunities for additional bulk and container facilities, in support of PD Ports’ existing Teesport Container Terminal and the Tees Bulk Quay."

        "content": "With trade policy chaos causing spikes in blood pressure but slumps in most other indices, the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index bucked the trend with a 15% increase between March 24 and April 24. The charge was led by aframaxes, with the Baltic Exchange’s aframax index rising 44% between those dates to $46,347, ahead of a 21% rise in suezmax average earnings to $62,639 and an 11% rise in VLCC average earnings to $51,123. The surge in aframax earnings was based on a recovery in demand in Europe. Day rates from the North Sea to Germany rose by 120% over the 30 days to 24 April, to $55,065, compared to only an 8% increase in the rate from the North Sea to the UK. There must have been some kind of sea change in German industrial strategy. Across the pond, day rates for afras between the Caribs and US Gulf rose 66% to $48,186 while rates for afras shipping US crude to northwest Europe added 31% to reach $46,507 on the back of a general increase in demand for tonnage. Suezmax rates on the new Guyana to ARA voyage added a buoyant 39% to reach an enticing $54,152 per day on the back of firm tonnage demand in the Atlantic and growing output from Guyana as well as Brazil. By contrast, cross-Med rates for suezmax have remained essentially unchanged for a month at around $42,000 per day. Even as China and the US eye each other ever more warily, the US continues to export crude oil to the Middle Kingdom at a steady rate, with freight rates also steady, as TCEs were $45,941 on April 24, just 1% higher than a month earlier though they did edge over $48,100 briefly on April 7. On the higher volume Mid-East to China voyage, VLCC daily earnings rose 20% over the month to April 24 to reach a tidy $55,010. Seasonality suggests that crude oil tanker rates should fall from here to a low at the end of Q3, but macro-economic and political woes might make the fall deeper and harder. Oil demand and thus tanker demand tends to track GDP growth and most organisations are downgrading expectations for this year. The IEA and EIA now expect oil demand growth of less than 1m barrels per day in 2025, with the IEA slashing its March estimate of 2025 demand growth by 300,000 barrels per day to 730,000 barrels per day as “escalating trade tensions have negatively impacted the economic outlook.” The IEA says half the cut in demand growth comes from China and the US as a direct consequence of Trump’s trade war. It points out that oil demand grew by 1.2m barrels per day in Q1, its best quarterly performance for two years. The IEA has also cut its 2026 oil demand growth forecast to 690,000 barrels per day. The US EIA will not have pleased Trumpwith its 400,000 barrels per day cut to its demand growth forecast for this year to 900,000 barrels per day and a further 100,000 barrels per day cut to its 2026 demand growth forecast, now 1m barrels per day. The EIA has stressed that this forecast is subject to “significant uncertainty” from trade tariffs. Ever the optimist, OPEC expects oil demand to grow by of 1.3m barrels per day this year. OPEC has agreed to open the spigots, seemingly in an attempt to protect market share. After Kazakhstan said it would prioritise national interest over OPEC+ prescriptions, it looks like the cartel’s three-year production cap is going to disintegrate this year. Oil markets will be oversupplied, but oil prices are not collapsing as the weakening US dollar shores up commodity prices. The IEA expects “global oil inventories will increase starting in the middle of 2025 as OPEC+ members unwind production cuts, production grows in non-OPEC countries, and oil demand growth slows.” Tanker owners may have to cross their fingers for time charter business storing all the surplus unsold crude oil. In contrast to their larger sisters, oil products tankers did not enjoy the last several weeks. The Baltic Clean Tanker Index fell 20% giving up all its gains since the start of February. The red ink was liberally splashed about. The TCE for the benchmark LR2 voyage from the Middle East to Japan spiked in mid- to late-March but lost 28% in the 30 days to April 24, to sit at $26,921, having been as low as $23,719 three days earlier. Daily TCEs for LR1s on the same voyage lost 22% over the same dates to sit at $22,849 but had been down to $18,022 on April 16. TCEs for LR2s on the voyage from the Middle East to UK/Cont followed a bouncy March with a deflated April, giving up all their gains to sit at $31,550 as of April 24, a 20% fall in 30 days. In the MR product tanker space, there was a 20% fall in the Atlantic basket to $22,498 and a 28% fall in the Pacific basket to $17,827 as Asian markets in particular felt the blast of the trade war. Lowlights include a 42% fall in South Korea-Singapore rates to a miserable $8,280 per day as Singapore oil inventories exceeded their five-year average and buyers stepped out of the market for a breather. The short MR voyage from ARA to the UK lost 35%, slumping to $20,500 per day, while the ARA to New York voyage bottomed out at $15,500 on April 23, before recovering to $16,231 a day later, still down 32% in 30 days. The seasonal pattern suggests a steady downswing from here to the end of Q3 but with weaker economic forecasts casting a pall over the market, any hopes for clean tanker earnings growth in 2025 are surely dashed."

The selection process will be in line with Petrobras’ usual closed-bid model, with the lowest price as the primary selection criteria, followed by an evaluation of each vessel’s technical specifications. The deadline for proposal submissions is May 19. The tender is for up to five general cargo PSVs, eight multipurpose or fluid carrier PSVs, two hybrid PSVs, and three multipurpose or fluid carrier PSVs on separate commencement dates. Deals for the vessels will have a duration of four years. All platform suppliers must have a deadweight of either 3,000 or 4,500 tonnes. The first lot will start work in January 2026 or within 180 days after contract signing, while the second and third lot will begin their contracts in May 2026 or within 240 days after contract signing. The final lot is set to kick off their contracts in September 2026 or within 305 days after contract signing. Petrobras currently has three other ongoing PSV tenders, which could bring the total to 26 new vessels contracted in the coming months. According to Rio de Janeiro-based offshore brokerage WSB Advisors, this is the first time since 2023 that Petrobras has launched such a big tender. In 2023, the company launched tenders for 20 and 21 vessels. Earlier this month, Splash reported that the Brazilian oil and gas player launched a tender forsix platform supplierswith the application deadline set for May 6. The contract duration is 1,460 days."

The company previously announced that the semisubsValaris DPS-3,DPS-5, andDPS-6would either be repurposed for alternative uses outside the drilling sector or scrapped. The driller has revealed that it sold the trio for recycling and retired them from service. Total sales proceeds were approximately $10m. Along with several contracts Splash already reported on between the previous fleet status report issued in February and now, the new contracts and contract extensions amount to a backlog of approximately $1bn. As a result, the contract backlog increased to approximately $4.2bn from approximately $3.6bn as of February 18, 2025. The contract backlog excludes lump sum payments such as mobilisation fees and capital reimbursements."

        "content": "Wattlab, the Netherlands-based maritime solar specialist, has introduced its SolarDeck technology to the seagoing shipping industry. SolarDeck is a modular and scalable system of deck-mounted solar panels that yield significant reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Moreover, based on installation on a seagoing general cargo vessel, SolarDeck combines substantial savings via Fuel EU Maritime and EU ETS regulations and an expected return on investment of three to five years. Established in 2017, Wattlab has spent its first years of operations focusing on the inland shipping sector with its Solar Flatrack. This is a modular solar energy system consisting of movable and stackable integrated solar panels and inverters. To date, Wattlab’s SolarHatches have been installed on more than 25 inland shipping vessels. Wattlab is now expanding into the ocean agoing shipping industry with SolarDeck. “At all times during the design of SolarDeck, we prioritised the shipowner’s requirements. We know that time is money. That’s why the SolarDeck can be installed in a minimum amount of time using container twist lock fittings. It also does not impact normal loading and unloading procedures,” says Wattlab’s CEO Bo Salet. “However, we also know – for cargo shipowners especially – that space is money. In the event of a deck load such as offshore wind blades, the ship’s crew can store the SolarDeck inside the volume of a 20-foot container, thus freeing up the deck for cargo.” Wattlab has spent the previous 18 months developing and testing the new system on board Vertom’s 7,280 dwt general purpose dry cargo vessel Anette, in a project co-financed by the European Union’s Just Transition Fund. “The test results show that SolarDeck performs well in the tougher environment – in terms of salinity and rougher sea states – of coastal shipping. Because salt water can drain freely from the solar panels, there’s no chance of a salt crust forming. As such, SolarDeck generates the expected power output levels,” Salet explained. “Furthermore, the system is robust enough to withstand storms as well as the usual day-to-day activities on board a seagoing cargo ship – while staying safe at all times.” Based on the test results of the 119 m long Anette, Wattlab predicts reductions of 20 toms of fuel and 68 tons of CO₂ emissions per year for this coaster-type. Such numbers are substantial enough to have a significant impact on a shipowner’s EEXI and CII scores in addition to potential savings via Fuel EU Maritime and EU ETS regulations."

In contrast to North and Baltic Sea ECAs as well as to the most recently agreed North Atlantic ECA, the Mediterranean ECA does not include nitrogen oxides. At last month’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting held at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the world’s biggest ECA was agreed upon. The new Northeast Atlantic ECA, due by 2027, stretches along coastlines from Portugal to Greenland, joining existing nearby ECAs in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean. “Almost all European waters will be emission control areas soon. This harmonised regulation not only benefits people and nature but also facilitates a level playing field for the maritime industry in Europe,” said Sönke Diesener, a shipping expert at Naturschutzbund Deutschland, a German NGO."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Mark Charman, CEO and founder of Faststream Recruitment, provides readers with insights from his company’s latest Global Ship Operators Employment Report. The maritime sector is undergoing a profound shift and ship operators are right at the centre of it. In the Global Ship Operators Employment Report 2025, Faststream Recruitment surveyed ship operators around the world to uncover how their expectations, ambitions, and working environments are evolving. The findings are a must-read for employers looking to attract and retain top talent in a competitive market. Retention is under pressure One of the most striking insights from the report is the sharp rise in job-seeking activity. 71% of ship operators plan to change jobs in the next 12 months, with the Asia-Pacific region seeing the highest levels of movement. Early-career professionals are particularly active, citing career growth and better compensation as key motivators. For employers, this sends a clear message: retention strategies must go beyond job security and company loyalty. The best talent is open to new opportunities and often being approached. In fact, more than half of the respondents had been headhunted in the previous six months. Flexibility and transparency are non-negotiable The desire for greater flexibility continues to shape career decisions. A majority of ship operators now work in a hybrid model, and 53% said they would reject a job that didn’t offer at least one day of remote working. Flexible hours were equally important, with 55% unwilling to take on roles that lacked this option. The demand for transparency in job adverts is also growing. A huge 84% of respondents said they expect to see salary and benefits included upfront. For maritime employers, clearly outlining what’s on offer is no longer optional, it’s essential for building trust and attracting the right talent. Salary and benefits play a pivotal role As in many sectors, compensation is a powerful driver in both retention and attraction. The report found that salary and benefits were the number one reason for staying in a role, cited by 31% of those not planning a move. Top benefits currently offered include bonuses, remote working, flexible hours, private medical coverage, and gym memberships. Encouragingly, 77% of ship operators received a pay rise, with most seeing increases of up to 10%. Yet, there’s room for improvement. 32% of respondents said they had never had their benefits formally communicated to them, revealing a missed opportunity for employers to reinforce the value of their total reward packages. Career progression remains a priority Career development is another major theme. Over half of ship operators surveyed want to become charterers, with most aiming to achieve this goal within two years. However, only 58% receive regular progression reviews, despite 91% agreeing these are critical to their growth and retention. Investing in training, feedback, and clear career paths can have a significant impact on employee engagement. Ship operators who felt invested in were much less likely to be planning a job move. The report makes one thing clear: the expectations of ship operators are evolving, and fast. Flexible working, clear career paths, competitive rewards, and transparent communications are no longer perks, they’re the price of admission for employers who want to compete for the best people. At Faststream Recruitment, we use insights like these to help maritime businesses shape better people strategies. Whether you’re looking to hire, retain, or better understand what today’s professionals value, this report is an invaluable resource."

        "content": "Pierre Aury reflects on MEPC 83 and mankind’s failure to rein in CO2 emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) just held the 83rd session of its Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC). Before we deal with the situation of the shipping industry, emissions-wise, it is useful to revisit the recent history of humans trying – or more accurately failing -to deal with CO2 emissions. The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997. In 1997 the world emitted 24.4bn tons of CO2. Fast forward to 2024 and that number is 39bn, an increase of 60%. In the meantime, the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, providing for a level of emissions in 2030 to be at a maximum of 50% of the emissions of 1990. As world emissions in1990 were 20bn tons, the Paris Agreement set a target of maximum 10bn tons of CO2 to be emitted in 2030. World emissions today are just shy of 40bn and will probably reach that number by 2030. This is not missing the target, it’s clearly not even aiming at the target. The total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is the real problem, is a cool 3,200bn tons. About 16bn tons are evaporating naturally every year so the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will keep on increasing until we start to see world emissions consistently below 16bn tons per annum which is just not happening in the foreseeable future. So facing one of the biggest threats they have ever faced, humans have managed to produce what can only be described as an abject failure. And now on to shipping with the funny part: in that overall picture of global failure, shipping, which is just a derivative of the world economy and world trade and is the ultimate individualistic industry, is behaving like a cult embarking on the path of becoming the first fully decarbonised industry by pricing each ton of CO2 emitted by ships. There is simply no solution deployable at scale which can produce a carbon neutral, whatever that means, shipping industry within a time frame consistent with preventing global warming turning from a runaway train to a slow-motion train wreck. We will not be able to power any meaningful number of ships with either kites, sails, batteries, biofuel, hydrogen or nuclear fuel quickly enough so, whatever its level and its formula, the new fuel levy will only lead to more expensive freight and not to actual decarbonisation. This extra cost will drive some marginal efficiency improvements, which by the way will probably be offset by the growth of the fleet. So far the improvements in term of CO2 emissions in shipping have come from more efficient hull shapes, underwater contraptions and more importantly from reducing the power of engines so ships are getting bigger but powered by smaller engines. This is potentially creating safety issues in storms and in ports and difficult waters. This has also triggered a wave of new speed/consumption clauses in charter parties. The owners who have no choice but to order these underpowered ships are trying everything possible to avoid being asked to pay charterers when one of their ships is losing three knots because a crewmember is sneezing in the wrong direction. Shipping, we believe, will only see its emissions drop dramatically when the world is finally adopting real and efficient steps toward decarbonising itself unless of course, in the meantime, the tariff war started by Donald Trump achieves a rapid decrease in world trade which will translate into a decrease of shipping CO2 emissions."

Beyer, nominated as assistant secretary of the interior, lands and minerals management, was asked by senator Angus King during a confirmation hearing about the administration putting a stop to Equinor’s fully-permitted 810MW offshore wind project. The senator claimed that the administration’s decision would have a “chilling effect” on developers and was an “extraordinary action”. He then asked if Beyer, a seasoned oil and gas industry professional, agreed that “a step that withdraws an already-issued permit” was “a dangerous message to the development community generally”. She did emphasise that the US needs all forms of energy that it “can get its hands on” and that there was “a premium to secure affordable and reliable energy that is not weather dependent.” But added that she also agreed with senator King that companies need certainty in the permitting system so they can make financial investment decisions, and that the order to stop the Empire Wind project was a negative signal. A few days ago Equinor chief executive Anders Opedal said in a quarterly earnings statement that the company would be seeking to engage directly with the US administration to clarify the matter regarding the $2.5bn offshore wind project, as well as consider its legal options. “We have invested in Empire Wind after obtaining all necessary approvals, and the order to halt work now is unprecedented and in our view unlawful,” Opedal said."

The effective date of the transaction is January 1, 2024. The payment will occur in two tranches, one at signing and a further one closer to closing. The payment will be subject to customary adjustments. PRIO has been a partner in the Peregrino field since last year when it acquired Sinochem’s 40% interest. Equinor has been operating the Peregrino field since 2009, and around 300m barrels of oil have been produced by the asset since. Peregrino is a heavy oil field and consists of an FPSO, supported by three fixed platforms. The Norwegian firm will be responsible for the operations of the field until closing of the transaction, after which PRIO will take over operatorship. “Brazil will continue to be a core country for Equinor, as we focus on starting up the Bacalhau field and continue progressing the Raia gas project. With these two operated projects and our partnership in Roncador, our equity production in Brazil will be close to 200,000 barrels per day by 2030,” said Philippe Mathieu, EVP for international exploration and production at Equinor."

        "content": "Pierre Aury reflects on MEPC 83 and mankind’s failure to rein in CO2 emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) just held the 83rd session of its Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC). Before we deal with the situation of the shipping industry, emissions-wise, it is useful to revisit the recent history of humans trying – or more accurately failing -to deal with CO2 emissions. The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997. In 1997 the world emitted 24.4bn tons of CO2. Fast forward to 2024 and that number is 39bn, an increase of 60%. In the meantime, the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, providing for a level of emissions in 2030 to be at a maximum of 50% of the emissions of 1990. As world emissions in1990 were 20bn tons, the Paris Agreement set a target of maximum 10bn tons of CO2 to be emitted in 2030. World emissions today are just shy of 40bn and will probably reach that number by 2030. This is not missing the target, it’s clearly not even aiming at the target. The total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is the real problem, is a cool 3,200bn tons. About 16bn tons are evaporating naturally every year so the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will keep on increasing until we start to see world emissions consistently below 16bn tons per annum which is just not happening in the foreseeable future. So facing one of the biggest threats they have ever faced, humans have managed to produce what can only be described as an abject failure. And now on to shipping with the funny part: in that overall picture of global failure, shipping, which is just a derivative of the world economy and world trade and is the ultimate individualistic industry, is behaving like a cult embarking on the path of becoming the first fully decarbonised industry by pricing each ton of CO2 emitted by ships. There is simply no solution deployable at scale which can produce a carbon neutral, whatever that means, shipping industry within a time frame consistent with preventing global warming turning from a runaway train to a slow-motion train wreck. We will not be able to power any meaningful number of ships with either kites, sails, batteries, biofuel, hydrogen or nuclear fuel quickly enough so, whatever its level and its formula, the new fuel levy will only lead to more expensive freight and not to actual decarbonisation. This extra cost will drive some marginal efficiency improvements, which by the way will probably be offset by the growth of the fleet. So far the improvements in term of CO2 emissions in shipping have come from more efficient hull shapes, underwater contraptions and more importantly from reducing the power of engines so ships are getting bigger but powered by smaller engines. This is potentially creating safety issues in storms and in ports and difficult waters. This has also triggered a wave of new speed/consumption clauses in charter parties. The owners who have no choice but to order these underpowered ships are trying everything possible to avoid being asked to pay charterers when one of their ships is losing three knots because a crewmember is sneezing in the wrong direction.

        "content": "Andrew Lemmis questions the regulator’s global role from a lifeboat industry perspective. Imagine a football match where the referee is paid by the teams and has no power to issue a red card. He can suggest the rules, sure, but it’s up to the players whether to follow them. Sound absurd? That’s essentially how the International Maritime Organization (IMO) functions. And nowhere is this more painfully clear than in the regulation of lifeboat systems. The IMO, the UN agency responsible for maritime safety, sets the rules, but enforcement rests entirely with member states. These same states vote on the rules, fund the organisation, and are expected to regulate themselves. It’s a system built on trust. But when it comes to lifeboats, that trust often feels dangerously thin. To its credit, the IMO has introduced important measures: MSC.402(96), for professionalising service, and amendments to SOLAS. But regulation is one thing. Enforcement is something else entirely. Take lifeboat servicing. Only “authorised” service providers are supposed to carry out maintenance. Who decides who’s authorised? The flag state. Some flags, like the Marshall Islands, outsource their entire registry operation. Others, like Liberia, charge providers up to $300 per lifeboat inspection, with over 5,000 vessels under their flag, that’s millions in fees. But where does that money go? Is it reinvested into stronger oversight or simply collected and just another cost of doing business. Most flags don’t engage meaningfully at all. They delegate to Recognized Organizations (ROs) or accept approvals from other flags without direct scrutiny. In practice, this means a vessel flagged with Country A might use a service provider approved only by Country B, no consistent oversight, no shared enforcement standard. And classification societies? While IACS provides some unified requirements, each class society applies its own standards. Application often varies by region, office, or individual surveyor. One vessel’s approval in one port may be challenged by the next surveyor somewhere else. This inconsistency raises a critical question: how much protection does the IMO framework really offer when its enforcement varies so widely? Even when progress is made, when new regulations are adopted, challenges remain. To secure consensus, regulations are often broad, with key details left to “Unified Interpretations” or guidance notes. The result is an evolving patchwork of assumptions and uneven implementation. Then there’s the language itself. The debate between “shall” (mandatory) and “should” (guidance) may seem minor, but the consequences are real. When survival-critical actions are labelled as “should,” compliance becomes optional. In aviation, such ambiguity would never be acceptable. Representation within the IMO also raises concerns. Influence is often shaped more by politics and budget contributions than fleet size or safety responsibility. And during regulatory discussions, flag states frequently bring external advisors, many with direct commercial interests. While industry input is valuable, this opens the door to conflicts of interest. Those who stand to gain or lose from regulation are helping write the rules. Transparency? Still limited. Meeting outcomes are published, but working group access is often restricted, and deliberations behind key decisions remain opaque. Critics, including NGOs and seafarer groups, have long questioned whether the IMO’s processes serve public safety or protect private interests. And what happens at sea? We see the cycle repeat: Inspections vary by flag. Some service providers operate with minimal scrutiny. Crew confidence in safety equipment is often low. And yet, the certificates are still issued. So, is the IMO fit for purpose? If its purpose is to create baseline global standards, then yes, it plays a vital role. Without it, we’d face fragmented regulation and greater risks. But if we expect the IMO to drive fast, independent, and uniform enforcement, to ensure every lifeboat is genuinely fit for purpose, then no, it falls short. The system was never built for that level of oversight. If we want real reform, we have to ask: Until these questions are answered, lifeboat safety, and seafarer safety, will continue to rest on something fragile: trust. And in this industry, trust alone is never enough."

The loan will be used to repay Navigator’s existing five-year secured loan of $143.4m due to mature in September 2025 and another loan due to mature in May 2027 in the outstanding amount of $14.7m. The remaining part will be available for general corporate and working capital purposes, Navigator said. The loan matures in 2031, bearing interest on a quarterly basis at SOFR plus 170 basis points. “The signing of the facility agreement is a key milestone for Navigator Gas in 2025 and continues to underscore our commitment to build on our strong financial footing while significantly pushing out our debt maturities, said Navigator chief executive Zacho, adding: “Against the backdrop of current global economic uncertainty, we believe the signing of the facility agreement at a record low margin for the Company also demonstrates the confidence shown in Navigator Gas by our banking partners.” The world’s top player in the handysize LPG carrier segment has a fleet of nearly 60 semi- or fully-refrigerated liquefied gas carriers, of which close to half are ethylene and ethane capable."

Under the agreement, AD Ports Group will develop, build, finance, operate, and manage the industrial and logistics zone in phases. The company has committed $120m for initial development and feasibility studies in the first phase, which covers an area of 2.8 sq km to be developed over three years. The development of the first phase will be anchored by key potential clients and partners, including one of the region’s foremost construction and development groups, Hassan Allam Holding, AD Ports said, adding that it expects the build-out to start by the ned of this year. Hassan Allam is also responsible for AD Ports’ new multipurpose terminal in Safaga, on Egypt’s Red Sea coast. AD Ports has a presence in more than 50 countries and controls nearly 250 ships, 34 terminals, in addition to an economic and industrial land bank of over 550 sq km. The group has invested heavily in Egypt since 2022, acquiring a regional shipping player, Transmar, a port operator and stevedoring company, TCI, and a maritime agency and cargo services provider, Safina. “KEZAD East Port Said is a milestone that highlights the strong economic relations between the UAE and Egypt,” said managing director and CEO of AD Ports Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, adding: “This infrastructure investment will provide a long-term source of economic growth for Egypt, while enhancing the Suez Canal role in promoting and supporting the East-West trade corridor.”"

The total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is the real problem, is a cool 3,200bn tons. About 16bn tons are evaporating naturally every year so the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will keep on increasing until we start to see world emissions consistently below 16bn tons per annum which is just not happening in the foreseeable future. So facing one of the biggest threats they have ever faced, humans have managed to produce what can only be described as an abject failure. And now on to shipping with the funny part: in that overall picture of global failure, shipping, which is just a derivative of the world economy and world trade and is the ultimate individualistic industry, is behaving like a cult embarking on the path of becoming the first fully decarbonised industry by pricing each ton of CO2 emitted by ships. There is simply no solution deployable at scale which can produce a carbon neutral, whatever that means, shipping industry within a time frame consistent with preventing global warming turning from a runaway train to a slow-motion train wreck. We will not be able to power any meaningful number of ships with either kites, sails, batteries, biofuel, hydrogen or nuclear fuel quickly enough so, whatever its level and its formula, the new fuel levy will only lead to more expensive freight and not to actual decarbonisation. This extra cost will drive some marginal efficiency improvements, which by the way will probably be offset by the growth of the fleet. So far the improvements in term of CO2 emissions in shipping have come from more efficient hull shapes, underwater contraptions and more importantly from reducing the power of engines so ships are getting bigger but powered by smaller engines. This is potentially creating safety issues in storms and in ports and difficult waters. This has also triggered a wave of new speed/consumption clauses in charter parties. The owners who have no choice but to order these underpowered ships are trying everything possible to avoid being asked to pay charterers when one of their ships is losing three knots because a crewmember is sneezing in the wrong direction. Shipping, we believe, will only see its emissions drop dramatically when the world is finally adopting real and efficient steps toward decarbonising itself unless of course, in the meantime, the tariff war started by Donald Trump achieves a rapid decrease in world trade which will translate into a decrease of shipping CO2 emissions."

        "content": "Offshore engineering and services player Subsea 7 has won a contract from oil and gas giant Petrobras to develop the Búzios 11 field located in the Santos basin, some 180 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The Buzios field began operating in 2018. It is only second to the Tupi field in terms of production volume and reserves in Brazil. The field is operated by Petrobras, with CNOOC and CNPC as its partners. Pré-Sal Petróleo is the field manager. The development concept includes 11 platforms or FPSOs. The contract, won through a competitive tender, includes engineering, procurement, fabrication, installation, and pre-commissioning of 112 km-long rigid risers and flowlines at 2,000 m water depth. Project management and engineering will start immediately at Subsea 7’s offices in Rio de Janeiro, Suresnes, and Sutton, while the fabrication of the pipelines will take place at the company’s spoolbase in Brazil. Offshore activities are scheduled for 2027 and 2028. Subsea 7 described the deal as a super-major contract, which means that it is larger than $1.25bn. According to Brazilian media, the Norwegian company submitted an offer of R$8.45bn ($1.4bn) in the tender, outbidding Allseas, TechnipFMC, and a partnership between Mota-Engil and McDermott."

The 3,800-3,900 dwt vessels were built between 2022 and 2024 and should be delivered by June. The Qingdao-based diversified owner and operator has financed most of its vessel additions, including newbuildings, via similar deals. The company said it believes the finance lease arrangements will further enhance its cash flow and allow it “to make a more efficient utilisation of internal financial resources, which will facilitate continuing growth of its principal businesses of providing shipping services and ship management”."

The deal spearheaded by chief executive Marco Fiori and chief of finance Enrico Barbieri has seen the acquisition of 100% of the share capital in the Genoa-based company for an undisclosed sum. The transaction is backed by Milan-based pan-European investor Pillarstone, which will stay on as a co-shareholder. Pillarstone became the sole shareholder of Premuda and delisted the company, whose history dates back to 1907, from the Milan Stock Exchange in 2017. Fiori (pictured) and his team took over management of the company in 2019 to drive the transition of the group towards a new business model. “After six years of close collaboration, it’s clear that not only the fleet, but the company as a whole, has been transformed,” Fiori said, adding: “With solid strategic relationships — both commercial and financial — we are well-positioned to face the future with confidence, even in an industry marked by geopolitical uncertainty, regulatory change, and the growing imperative for environmental sustainability.” Premuda today operates a fleet of 13 ships, comprising four bulkers and nine product tankers, with two more eco-design ships set to boost the tanker segment by the end of the year."

        "content": "All week,Splashwill be bringing readers reports from Geneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference, which took place on April 28 and 29 with more than 820 delegates in attendance. Up first in our coverage is the Commodities Shipping Outlook, a high-level scene-setter to open proceedings, designed to give delegates an indication of what to expect in the coming 24 months. From geopolitics to demand forecasts, new regulations, fuels and new technology this session covered a huge amount of ground in a short amount of time, co-moderated bySplasheditorial director Sam Chambers and Nick Brown, the corporate affairs director for marine and offshore at Bureau Veritas, with a heavyweight speaker lineup featuring John Xylas, the chairman of INTERGARGO, Fednav’s Paul Pathy, who is about to become president of BIMCO, as well as Saad Rahim, Trafigura’s chief economist. What is the lifespan of your assets? Quizzed as to how often he was having to change his global economic projections, Rahim replied: “I would say hourly, but it’s probably more likely by the tweet or by the Truth Social post.” Discussing tariffs, Rahim commented: “I think the keyword now is uncertainty… We’re now in unprecedented uncertainty for a little bit.” Rahim said China has diversified away from an over reliance on the US since the first Trump trade war eight years ago. “Overall, I think China is in a much better position, hence the reason that they’re not coming to the bargaining table anytime soon,” Rahim argued. INTERCARGO’s Xylas, who also heads up Greek owner Ariston Navigation, said today’s trading conditions were indeed unprecedentedly uncertain, worse in many ways than the nadir shipping experienced in the mid-1980s. “You don’t have that certainty today because you don’t know what is the lifespan of your assets. Is it 25 years? I’m not sure,” he said, stressing that this was especially pertinent regarding newbuilds, something picked up by Fednav’s Pathy, who noted that typical supramax rates today hover around the $10,000 a day mark and yet need to return twice that over the next 25 years to pay for a newbuild. Given today’s high newbuild prices, combined with mediocre rates and uncertainty over future fuels, both shipowners on stage urged delegates to stick to the secondhand market to buy time until a more certain picture returned. Pathy, who had just flown in that day from Fednav’s Montreal HQ, worried about prospects for global trade this year, telling delegates: “When you factor in the Trump tariffs and all the other effects of this administration’s policies, you start just increasing the cost of everything and increasing the cost of things is generally bad for trade.” The Canadian said that the current US administration was “pouring fuel” on an already inflationary environment, which he said was likely detrimental to world trade. At least, for non-Chinese owners the Chinese tonnage penalties recently introduced by the US Trade Representative look to have a minimal effect of the dry bulk fleet, Pathy said. Tomorrow,Splashwill be bringing coverage of Geneva Dry’s special session on electric vehicles and how they have been supercharging certain dry bulk trades. Delegate passes for next year’s Geneva Dry scheduled for April 28 and 29 areon sale now."

        "content": "Norway’s BW Energy has made a final investment decision (FID) for the Maromba development offshore Brazil worth around $1.5bn. The development targets 500m barrels of oil in place, and first oil is planned by the end of 2027 with expected plateau production of 60,000 barrels of oil per day. The development will more than double BW Energy’s total net production by 2028 and has a short pay-back time. The development involves an initial six production wells from the wellhead platform, converted from a drilling jackup with up to 16 well slots and flowlines. BW Energy agreed to acquire a jackup with complete leg extensions for $107.5m for that purpose. The well slots and flowlines will be connected to the redeployed FPSOBW Maromba, formerly known asPolvo. The FPSO refurbishment and life extension work is already underway at the COSCO yard in China. The FPSO is designed with 1m barrels of storage capacity. The total liquid capacity will be 100,000 barrels per day, with oil production capacity of 65,000 barrels per day and water treatment capacity of 85,000 barrels per day. The $1.5bn investment will be split up, and around $1.2bn will be spent on the initial development while a further $300m will go to the secondary drilling campaign. BW Energy anticipates Maromba to achieve a competitive production cost, averaging less than $10 per barrel over the first five years, underpinning robust project economics. The heavy oil from the project is expected to trade at a discount to Brent of approximately $7.5 per barrel. The Maromba field is located 100 km off the Brazilian coast in the Campos Basin. BW Energy acquired 100% ownership in Maromba in 2019 for a total of $115m. Magma Oil holds a 5% back-in right in the Maromba licence, which is expected to be executed upon first oil."

Imagine a football match where the referee is paid by the teams and has no power to issue a red card. He can suggest the rules, sure, but it’s up to the players whether to follow them. Sound absurd? That’s essentially how the International Maritime Organization (IMO) functions. And nowhere is this more painfully clear than in the regulation of lifeboat systems. The IMO, the UN agency responsible for maritime safety, sets the rules, but enforcement rests entirely with member states. These same states vote on the rules, fund the organisation, and are expected to regulate themselves. It’s a system built on trust. But when it comes to lifeboats, that trust often feels dangerously thin. To its credit, the IMO has introduced important measures: MSC.402(96), for professionalising service, and amendments to SOLAS. But regulation is one thing. Enforcement is something else entirely. Take lifeboat servicing. Only “authorised” service providers are supposed to carry out maintenance. Who decides who’s authorised? The flag state. Some flags, like the Marshall Islands, outsource their entire registry operation. Others, like Liberia, charge providers up to $300 per lifeboat inspection, with over 5,000 vessels under their flag, that’s millions in fees. But where does that money go? Is it reinvested into stronger oversight or simply collected and just another cost of doing business. Most flags don’t engage meaningfully at all. They delegate to Recognized Organizations (ROs) or accept approvals from other flags without direct scrutiny. In practice, this means a vessel flagged with Country A might use a service provider approved only by Country B, no consistent oversight, no shared enforcement standard. And classification societies? While IACS provides some unified requirements, each class society applies its own standards. Application often varies by region, office, or individual surveyor. One vessel’s approval in one port may be challenged by the next surveyor somewhere else. This inconsistency raises a critical question: how much protection does the IMO framework really offer when its enforcement varies so widely? Even when progress is made, when new regulations are adopted, challenges remain. To secure consensus, regulations are often broad, with key details left to “Unified Interpretations” or guidance notes. The result is an evolving patchwork of assumptions and uneven implementation. Then there’s the language itself. The debate between “shall” (mandatory) and “should” (guidance) may seem minor, but the consequences are real. When survival-critical actions are labelled as “should,” compliance becomes optional. In aviation, such ambiguity would never be acceptable. Representation within the IMO also raises concerns. Influence is often shaped more by politics and budget contributions than fleet size or safety responsibility. And during regulatory discussions, flag states frequently bring external advisors, many with direct commercial interests. While industry input is valuable, this opens the door to conflicts of interest. Those who stand to gain or lose from regulation are helping write the rules. Transparency? Still limited. Meeting outcomes are published, but working group access is often restricted, and deliberations behind key decisions remain opaque. Critics, including NGOs and seafarer groups, have long questioned whether the IMO’s processes serve public safety or protect private interests. And what happens at sea? We see the cycle repeat: Inspections vary by flag. Some service providers operate with minimal scrutiny. Crew confidence in safety equipment is often low. And yet, the certificates are still issued. So, is the IMO fit for purpose? If its purpose is to create baseline global standards, then yes, it plays a vital role. Without it, we’d face fragmented regulation and greater risks. But if we expect the IMO to drive fast, independent, and uniform enforcement, to ensure every lifeboat is genuinely fit for purpose, then no, it falls short. The system was never built for that level of oversight. If we want real reform, we have to ask: Until these questions are answered, lifeboat safety, and seafarer safety, will continue to rest on something fragile: trust. And in this industry, trust alone is never enough."

        "content": "UK supermajor Shell and its advisers have been considering a potential takeover of rival energy major BP, which could set up one of the largest deals in the history of the oil and gas industry. According to reports from Bloomberg, which cited people close to the matter, Shell may wait for BP to reach out for another possible buyer before playing its hand. The feasibility of this move, the sources claimed, has been discussed within Shell ranks for several weeks now. The report added that everything is allegedly still in its infancy, and Shell could perhaps decide to focus on share buybacks and smaller acquisitions rather than such a big merger. The deal between the two could be one of the largest oil and gas deals ever seen. Shell’s market value of £145.6bn ($193.2bn) is way above BP’s £55.9bn ($74.2bn), and a combination of the two would create a firm with a market value of over $267bn. BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said at the start of the year that he would reset BP’s strategy, with the company firmly backing fossil fuels again. However, the plan did not result in much as the profits for the first quarter of the year dropped to $1.4bn, a far cry from the $2.7bn from the same period last year. This was all accompanied by shares dropping over 30% within the past year. Shell also reported a lower profit than in the first quarter of 2024, but its adjusted profits of $5.6bn were still higher than analysts expected."

June 26 sees the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships enter into force ensuring that ships, when recycled after reaching the end of their operational lives, do not pose unnecessary risks to human health, safety, or the environment, a global regulation that will require many recycling sites to upgrade facilities to be compliant. In Bangladesh, one of the world’s top three demo nations, local ship recyclers are facing challenges. According to Clarksons Research, recyclers have requested an extension to meet Hong Kong Convention compliance requirements, though getting import clearances remains challenging, with local authorities continuing to process vessel approvals on a case-by-case basis, creating additional delays and complications for potential deliveries to recycling yards. GMS, the world’s largest cash buyer for ships to be recycled, notes that there are currently seven Bangladeshi yards that have been approved, with another 20 waiting for accreditation. Wirana, another cash buyer, counts up to 10 vessels waiting for a long time in Bangladeshi waters ahead of recycling. Some recycling candidates that could have been sold for Bangladesh have been instead sold to India."

Bremerhaven in Germany is facing similar problems, with about 30% of ships delayed while other major ports like Rotterdam, and in the UK, Felixstowe, London Gateway, and Southampton, are also congested due to vessel diversions from the continent, which are sending more volume to these alternative ports. “Experts expect this congestion to last another three to four months, until alliance network adjustments kick in and volumes settle down,” Braemar warned in a container report published yesterday. “Northern European ports are all challenged by heavily disrupted operations. Waiting time is too long, yard utilisation too high, and the berth line-up is extended,” Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta, a freight rate platform, toldSplash. Sand cited strikes in France and Belgium, maintenance carried out in a traditional slack season, and record-high levels of imports leaving Asia in January, as reasons for the boxship queues. “It’s particularly worrying right now, as carriers are lining up an all-time high of containership capacity to carry the frustrated US-bound Chinese-manufactured goods that will arrive 50 to 60 days from now. If the terminals are still severely congested at that time, chaos will reign,” Sand warned. Hua Joo Tan, co-founder of consultancy Linerlytica, said he expected the European box crunch to persist throughout the summer. Linerlytica data shows carriers have reacted swiftly to remove capacity deployed on the US trades in the wake of president Donald Trump’s tariff assault on China, with 8.6% of Asia-North America west coast capacity now removed. According to Linerlytica, 27 ships for 200,000 teu have been removed from the west coast since April, with the bulk of the surplus tonnage redeployed to the Asia-Europe and Med routes. Simon Sundboell, founder and CEO of liner analytics firm eeSea, acknowledged the growing delays but questioned the congestion narrative. “I believe carriers and vessels are becoming better at not steaming over to a port and sitting idle, at least less so. They’re instead slow steaming and thus not necessarily categorised as congestion or waiting outside a port,” Sundboell explained."

        "content": "Andrew Lemmis questions the regulator’s global role from a lifeboat industry perspective. Imagine a football match where the referee is paid by the teams and has no power to issue a red card. He can suggest the rules, sure, but it’s up to the players whether to follow them. Sound absurd? That’s essentially how the International Maritime Organization (IMO) functions. And nowhere is this more painfully clear than in the regulation of lifeboat systems. The IMO, the UN agency responsible for maritime safety, sets the rules, but enforcement rests entirely with member states. These same states vote on the rules, fund the organisation, and are expected to regulate themselves. It’s a system built on trust. But when it comes to lifeboats, that trust often feels dangerously thin. To its credit, the IMO has introduced important measures: MSC.402(96), for professionalising service, and amendments to SOLAS. But regulation is one thing. Enforcement is something else entirely. Take lifeboat servicing. Only “authorised” service providers are supposed to carry out maintenance. Who decides who’s authorised? The flag state. Some flags, like the Marshall Islands, outsource their entire registry operation. Others, like Liberia, charge providers up to $300 per lifeboat inspection, with over 5,000 vessels under their flag, that’s millions in fees. But where does that money go? Is it reinvested into stronger oversight or simply collected and just another cost of doing business. Most flags don’t engage meaningfully at all. They delegate to Recognized Organizations (ROs) or accept approvals from other flags without direct scrutiny. In practice, this means a vessel flagged with Country A might use a service provider approved only by Country B, no consistent oversight, no shared enforcement standard. And classification societies? While IACS provides some unified requirements, each class society applies its own standards. Application often varies by region, office, or individual surveyor. One vessel’s approval in one port may be challenged by the next surveyor somewhere else. This inconsistency raises a critical question: how much protection does the IMO framework really offer when its enforcement varies so widely? Even when progress is made, when new regulations are adopted, challenges remain. To secure consensus, regulations are often broad, with key details left to “Unified Interpretations” or guidance notes. The result is an evolving patchwork of assumptions and uneven implementation. Then there’s the language itself. The debate between “shall” (mandatory) and “should” (guidance) may seem minor, but the consequences are real. When survival-critical actions are labelled as “should,” compliance becomes optional. In aviation, such ambiguity would never be acceptable. Representation within the IMO also raises concerns. Influence is often shaped more by politics and budget contributions than fleet size or safety responsibility. And during regulatory discussions, flag states frequently bring external advisors, many with direct commercial interests. While industry input is valuable, this opens the door to conflicts of interest. Those who stand to gain or lose from regulation are helping write the rules. Transparency? Still limited. Meeting outcomes are published, but working group access is often restricted, and deliberations behind key decisions remain opaque. Critics, including NGOs and seafarer groups, have long questioned whether the IMO’s processes serve public safety or protect private interests. And what happens at sea? We see the cycle repeat: Inspections vary by flag. Some service providers operate with minimal scrutiny. Crew confidence in safety equipment is often low. And yet, the certificates are still issued. So, is the IMO fit for purpose? If its purpose is to create baseline global standards, then yes, it plays a vital role. Without it, we’d face fragmented regulation and greater risks. But if we expect the IMO to drive fast, independent, and uniform enforcement, to ensure every lifeboat is genuinely fit for purpose, then no, it falls short. The system was never built for that level of oversight. If we want real reform, we have to ask: Until these questions are answered, lifeboat safety, and seafarer safety, will continue to rest on something fragile: trust. And in this industry, trust alone is never enough."

The move is part of Maersk’s rollout of its new digital connectivity platform, OneWireless, which aims to offer real-time cargo tracking, enhanced supply chain visibility, and improved operational efficiency. “By transitioning to Nokia’s private wireless technology, Maersk will overcome the challenges of its current infrastructure onboard both its own and chartered vessels and gain access to increased scalability and future-proof connectivity,” Nokia said. The OneWireless platform will cover all Maersk-owned containerships and more than 100 time-chartered vessels. Maersk said that although its customers can already monitor the temperature of their reefer cargo, the current 2G network infrastructure onboard limits the frequency of data point updates and that transition to 4G technology, would enable “a substantial increase in data granularity” and pave the way for “smarter cargo tracking and enhanced operational insights”. “This platform is designed to support thousands of IoT devices, ensuring optimal performance for reefer tracking and fleet IoT,” noted Kjeld Dittmann, head of vessel and cargo connectivity at Maersk. The rollout is on track for completion by the first quarter of 2026. Other Maersk tech partners include Onomondo, 42com Sat, Complea, and Zededa."

        "content": "The Trump administration is changing another Biden-era offshore oil and gas industry rule regarding assurances for decommissioning of old infrastructure. The US Department of the Interior stated that it would be revising the Risk Management and Financial Assurance for OCS Lease and Grant Obligations Rule from 2024, albeit with almost no details on how it intends to do so. The previous administration’s rule was estimated to increase financial assurance requirements for offshore oil and gas operators by $6.9 billion in additional bonding, costing businesses an additional $665 million in premiums each year. This was intended to mitigate taxpayer risk if a driller failed to cover the dismantling costs of equipment. Smaller companies did claim that the Biden rule limited their ability to operate and invest in projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The previous administration’s rule even faced legal challenges from three oil-producing states, however, a federal judge refused to block the rule earlier this year. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum claimed that the revision of the rule would allow energy producers to channel their capital towards future leasing, exploration, and production. “Cutting red tape will level the playing field and allow American companies to make investments that strengthen domestic energy security and benefit the Gulf of America states and their communities,” Burnum stated. The Department of the Interior expects to finalise the rule in 2025 following public comments on its proposal once it becomes available. The change to this rule comes some two months after the Republican party used the Congressional Review Act to repeal a requirement that new oil and gas leaseholders on the US outer continental shelf submit an archaeological report before they start offshore drilling production. But the announcement about the decom rule change occurred only days after the implementation of new parameters for downhole commingling in the Paleogene reservoirs, expanding the allowable pressure differential from 200 psi to 1,500 psi."

        "content": "All week,Splashwill be bringing readers reports from Geneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference, which took place on April 28 and 29 with more than 820 delegates in attendance. Today’s panel in focus features a brand new slot: EVs And The Supercharging Of Dry Bulk. Electric vehicles are changing seaborne trading patterns dramatically. This unique session identified how, why, and on what scale with analysts, miners and owners on stage. Setting the scene, Alexis Ellender, lead dry bulk analyst at Kpler, detailed how EV sales had leapt from less than 1% of global car sales in 2016 to a forecast 25% this year. By 2035, Ellender said forecasts suggest EVs could account for a third of all car sales worldwide, and for 50% in China, the world leader in both production and consumption of this greener transport type. How this translates into commodities demand was detailed by the Kpler analyst. Typically, an EV needs around 900 kg of steel, half of what a conventional car uses, plus 300 kg of aluminium, around double what fuel-driven cars require, which works out at an extra half tonne of bauxite per vehicle. On top of this, nickel, manganese ore and copper are all in high demand to produce EVs. Giving a shipowner perspective on how this demand is translating into the seaborne cargo mix, Khalid Hashim, who heads up Thailand’s Precious Shipping, discussed growing copper concentrate moving from the west coast of South America, and how copper prices have been spiking. “There’s definitely some sort of an increase in cargoes that you can see. It’s palpable. You can feel it,” Hashim told delegates. Karim Coumine, head of commercial shipping covering minor bulks for miner Anglo American, said that while there had been a significant rise in copper output from mines in Chile and Peru in recent years, a cap was coming as new production sites were taking time to emerge. “Going forward, it’s difficult to see where the the new supply sources are going to be be coming from and if they’re still going to be in locations that are particularly difficult to mine,” Coumine said, adding: “Sooner or later the world is going to have to to to find new bigger sources of copper.” Burak Cetinok, head of research at broker Arrow, and the session’s moderator, then turned discussion to manganese, another important ingredient in the manufacturing of EVs, and a cargo that has become prevalent even on larger ships such as capesizes in recent years. Manganese is now the fourth most widely used metal in the world after iron ore, aluminum and copper, Cetinok told the audience. Emilie Nourry, head of shipping at French miner Eramet, said that around 95% of manganese is used by the steel industry, while around 1% goes into making lithium-ion batteries. Nourry explained how her company has recently started using newcastlemaxes out of West Africa to move manganese, product that previously would have moved only on supramaxes and handies, a shift she said that been led by economics, the environment, flexibility, and the improving port infrastructure situation seen across much of Africa. Turning back to the shipowner on the panel, Cetinok asked Precious’s Hashim how he saw geopolitics impacting trade flows of all these materials in the years ahead. “Ships sail on water, and water finds its way around all the obstacles that come there. So I think that any form of disruption is actually good news for shipping. At the end of the day, it increases ton-miles,” the shipping veteran told delegates. Quizzed by an audience member as to whether the rise of EVs – and all their charging needs – was a net positive or negative for coal, Kpler’s Ellender said that due to Asia’s – and most prominently China’s – continued reliance on coal for electricity production, EVs were a clear boon for the coal seaborne trades. Tomorrow,Splashwill be bringing coverage of Geneva Dry’s workshop on all things risk. Delegate passes for next year’s Geneva Dry scheduled for April 28 and 29 areon sale now."

Together, we can steer the industry toward a more sustainable future.” Abdalla is replacing Trafigura’s Rasmus Bach Nielsen, who took on the role in May 2023. In stepping down, Bach Nielsen said: “I’m ambitious on behalf of the Sea Cargo Charter. Shipowners and charterers need to be unified, and by continuing to build our member base, we can build even stronger baselines for the industry.” Developed by the Global Maritime Forum, the Sea Cargo Charter was launched in October 2020. The initiative offers a uniform baseline and allows charterers and shipowners to examine whether their activities align with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) greenhouse gas emission targets. The green movement represents over 20% of global seaborne trade and currently has 37 signatories onboard, comprised of bulk cargo owners from a variety of segments, commodity traders and shipowners. Engebret Dahm, chief executive of Klaveness Combination Carriers, was elected vice chairman, and Kartik Kathavate, head of fuel optimisation at Maersk Tankers, as treasurer."

        "content": "A total of 18 attorneys general filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging US president Donald Trump’s order to shut down offshore wind projects, stating that such a move was “unlawful and can jeopardise the continued development of a power source critical to the states’ economic vitality, energy mix, public health, and climate goals.” The court action, filed in the U.S. District Court in Boston, is brought by 17 state attorneys general joined by the attorney general from the District of Columbia. New York and Massachusetts are the states spearheading the move since the Trump administration hit offshore wind projects in those states the hardest. The lawsuit names New York, Massachusetts, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington State as the plaintiffs. The complaint stated that neither the president nor any executive branch agencies offered “any detailed justification to explain the abrupt change in longstanding federal policy supporting the development of wind energy”. This move puts more oil on the offshore wind debate fire, which saw Trump attempt to completely halt the sector and push the country towards fast-tracked oil and gas developments. “Executive actions encouraged domestic energy development – that is, all but wind and other renewable energy – and directed agencies to shortcut environmental reviews for other forms of energy, the very same reviews the Wind Directive labels as inadequate for wind energy,” the complaint stated. The Wind Directive has stopped most wind-energy development despite it creating billions of dollars in economic activity and tax payments, and supplying more than 10% of US electricity. “I am united with [New York] attorney general Letitia James, governor Hochul, and the 17 other states alongside New York for the logical resumption of wind energy projects and to move them forward to secure a reliable and abundant energy supply for future generations,” said Doreen Harris, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority."

        "content": "Greek owner and operator Meadway Bulkers has bolstered its shipbuilding programme in Japan by adding another ultramax to its orderbook. The George Dellaportas-led outfit has revealed a 64,000 dwt newbuilding at Imabari Shipbuilding with delivery expected in the second quarter of 2027. Prior to this, the Athens-based company, which currently lists 15 ships in its fleet, had three ultramaxes lined up for construction at Tsuneishi Zhoushan shipyard in China for delivery through 2026. Meadway Bulkers was set up by George Dellaportas in 2021, while his brother Costas continued at the original company, Meadway Shipping & Trading, which has since rebranded as DryDel Shipping. The latest order will see Meadway Bulkers add six newbuilds to its fleet in the next two years, which, in addition to ultramaxes, includes a pair of handysize vessels, delivering from Namura Shipbuilding in the first quarter of 2026."

        "content": "Russia has spent $14bn buying just over 400 tankers for its so-called shadow fleet since May 2022, an armada that is now struggling to deliver exports around the world, according to new data fromNavigating Russia, a substack penned by former Wall Street banker Craig Kennedy. Large-scale tanker sanctions in 2025 have helped significantly reduce Russia’s shadow fleet capacity, down some 46%, according to Kennedy’s calculations. In the second half of 2024, shadow vessels accounted for over 60% of the crude tankers loading at Russia’s Baltic terminals. By the end of March 2025, this had abruptly plunged to below 40%. Filling the gap has been a surge in loadings by mainstream crude carriers. The shadow fleet itself turns out to be highly vulnerable to direct vessel sanctions Kennedy argued in his latest article that the collapse in shadow fleet loadings is not the result of Urals prices dropping below the $60 price cap level; the plunge was already well underway before quoted prices fell beneath the threshold. Rather, it’s the result of the abrupt and sizeable loss of usable shadow fleet capacity in the wake of Washington’s January 10 “jumbo” tanker sanctions, which targeted some 158 oil tankers. It was helped along by additional tanker sanctions by the UK and the EU at the end of February. Kennedy suggested the large majority of the $14bn spent over the past three years by Moscow has been a waste of money on a large scale. “Billions get spent on a fleet to circumvent sanctions when the fleet itself turns out to be highly vulnerable to direct vessel sanctions,” Kennedy maintained. European and American shipowners have pocketed at least $6.3bn from selling hundreds of ageing tankers on to shell companies, from where they make their way into the shadow fleet, a February probe carried out by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and investigative journalists from Follow the Money revealed. The report tracked the sale of around 230 ships and how they often quickly changed names and flags on being sold, and then started to shift oil for Russia with some very well-known names in European shipping mentioned, especially out of Greece who accounted for more than half of the sales that ended up in the shadow fleet. Direct sales of oil tankers to Russian entities are prohibited under European Union sanctions imposed in 2023. But indirect sales to companies from countries that are not participating in sanctions are not illegal. Follow the Money and its media partners identified at least 32 tankers of European owners that were sold into the shadow fleet after those rules came into effect at the end of 2023. “More than a third of a shadow fleet of tankers transporting Russian oil consists of vessels that had previously been owned by shipowners from Western countries – the same countries that are sanctioning Russia because of its war of aggression against Ukraine,” the joint investigation stated. The number of vessels hit by sanctions surpassed 1,000 late last year with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showing that more 800 of these ships do not have confirmed insurance. Moreover, the average age of sanctioned ships – 21 years – is some eight years older than the global average, adding to growing concern that the sprawling so-called shadow fleet could lead to multiple costly environmental catastrophes."

        "content": "Andrew Lemmis questions the regulator’s global role from a lifeboat industry perspective. Imagine a football match where the referee is paid by the teams and has no power to issue a red card. He can suggest the rules, sure, but it’s up to the players whether to follow them. Sound absurd? That’s essentially how the International Maritime Organization (IMO) functions. And nowhere is this more painfully clear than in the regulation of lifeboat systems. The IMO, the UN agency responsible for maritime safety, sets the rules, but enforcement rests entirely with member states. These same states vote on the rules, fund the organisation, and are expected to regulate themselves. It’s a system built on trust. But when it comes to lifeboats, that trust often feels dangerously thin. To its credit, the IMO has introduced important measures: MSC.402(96), for professionalising service, and amendments to SOLAS. But regulation is one thing. Enforcement is something else entirely. Take lifeboat servicing. Only “authorised” service providers are supposed to carry out maintenance. Who decides who’s authorised? The flag state. Some flags, like the Marshall Islands, outsource their entire registry operation. Others, like Liberia, charge providers up to $300 per lifeboat inspection, with over 5,000 vessels under their flag, that’s millions in fees. But where does that money go? Is it reinvested into stronger oversight or simply collected and just another cost of doing business. Most flags don’t engage meaningfully at all. They delegate to Recognized Organizations (ROs) or accept approvals from other flags without direct scrutiny. In practice, this means a vessel flagged with Country A might use a service provider approved only by Country B, no consistent oversight, no shared enforcement standard. And classification societies? While IACS provides some unified requirements, each class society applies its own standards. Application often varies by region, office, or individual surveyor. One vessel’s approval in one port may be challenged by the next surveyor somewhere else. This inconsistency raises a critical question: how much protection does the IMO framework really offer when its enforcement varies so widely? Even when progress is made, when new regulations are adopted, challenges remain. To secure consensus, regulations are often broad, with key details left to “Unified Interpretations” or guidance notes. The result is an evolving patchwork of assumptions and uneven implementation. Then there’s the language itself. The debate between “shall” (mandatory) and “should” (guidance) may seem minor, but the consequences are real. When survival-critical actions are labelled as “should,” compliance becomes optional. In aviation, such ambiguity would never be acceptable. Representation within the IMO also raises concerns. Influence is often shaped more by politics and budget contributions than fleet size or safety responsibility. And during regulatory discussions, flag states frequently bring external advisors, many with direct commercial interests. While industry input is valuable, this opens the door to conflicts of interest. Those who stand to gain or lose from regulation are helping write the rules. Transparency? Still limited. Meeting outcomes are published, but working group access is often restricted, and deliberations behind key decisions remain opaque. Critics, including NGOs and seafarer groups, have long questioned whether the IMO’s processes serve public safety or protect private interests. And what happens at sea? We see the cycle repeat: Inspections vary by flag. Some service providers operate with minimal scrutiny. Crew confidence in safety equipment is often low. And yet, the certificates are still issued. So, is the IMO fit for purpose? If its purpose is to create baseline global standards, then yes, it plays a vital role. Without it, we’d face fragmented regulation and greater risks. But if we expect the IMO to drive fast, independent, and uniform enforcement, to ensure every lifeboat is genuinely fit for purpose, then no, it falls short. The system was never built for that level of oversight. If we want real reform, we have to ask: Until these questions are answered, lifeboat safety, and seafarer safety, will continue to rest on something fragile: trust. And in this industry, trust alone is never enough."

        "content": "Danish offshore wind developer Ørsted has discontinued the Hornsea 4 offshore wind project in the UK, citing rising costs and increased risks for development. The Danish firm said that, since the contract for difference (CfD) award in September 2024, the 2.4GW Hornsea 4 project had seen several adverse developments relating to continued increase of supply chain costs, higher interest rates, and an increase in the risk to construct and operate the project of this size on the planned timeline. Ørsted claimed that this increased the execution risk and deteriorated the value creation of the project, so the company decided to stop further spending at this time and terminate the project’s supply chain contracts. This means that the offshore wind developer will not deliver Hornsea 4 under the CfD awarded in allocation round 6. “Ørsted will evaluate options for future development of the Hornsea 4 project given the continuing seabed rights, grid connection agreement, and development consent order,” the company explained in a statement. As a consequence of the decision, Ørsted expects to incur breakaway costs of DKK 3.5-4.5bn ($533m-$685m) in 2025. The EBITDA impact is expected to be DKK 3-3.5bn ($457m-$533m), which includes a write-down of the offshore transmission assets and a provision for contract cancellation fees. The company will also write down capitalised construction costs of around DKK 500m-1bn ($76m-$152m). ”[…] Our capital allocation is based on a strict and value-focused approach, and after careful consideration, we’ve decided to discontinue the development of the Hornsea 4 project in its current form, well ahead of the planned final investment decision later this year,” said Rasmus Errboe, president and CEO of Ørsted. He added that the adverse macroeconomic developments, continued supply chain challenges, and increased execution, market, and operational risks have eroded the value creation. “We’ll keep the project rights for the Hornsea 4 project in our development portfolio, and we’ll seek to develop the project later in a way that is more value-creating for us and our shareholders,” Errboe concluded."

Established by HitecVision in 2022, the Randi Vestbø-led outfit has co-invested in 10 newbuild LNG carriers at Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea, together with Knutsen LNG. Apollo said it sees Hav Energy’s future growth trajectory supported by global LNG import projections driven by growth in Asia and Europe, and expectations for robust new liquification capacity coupled with limited newbuild vessel supply. “Hav Energy has quickly scaled into a top platform facilitating the global transport of LNG, which we view as a bridge fuel capable of reducing emissions for rapidly growing power demand,” commented Joseph Romeo, a partner at Apollo. Hav Energy and Knutsen have already seen two ships delivered, with the remaining eight due for delivery this year and in 2026 – all fixed on long-term contracts. “This transaction represents a critical juncture for Hav Energy as we continue to build a next-generation fleet of LNG infrastructure carriers and pursue attractive growth opportunities to expand our capabilities alongside our new partners at Apollo,” added Hav’s chief executive, Vestbø."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "It was a standing room during a specialist workshop, sponsored by Paratus, at the opening day of the second edition of Geneva Dry that saw panellists turn their attention to various aspects of risk management for dry bulk shipowners and operators. Moderator of the session, Neville Smith, director of maritime PR consultancy Mariner Communications, got proceedings underway by pointing out the panellists would try to go through the session without mentioning the president of the US or AI unless they wanted to face a time penalty or a shot of Geneva Dry gin. Andrew Roberts, head of EMEA at risk management platform RightShip, took first to the mic and outlined the big picture of where he thinks the industry is from a risk perspective. He said there are two things to look at that are being challenged at the moment: the ability to manage the long-standing risks that have been persistent in the industry for many years and continue to persist and the ability to adapt to the environment today and manage the new risks. “Vessel owners and managers really where the rubber hits the road are still struggling with those things. But those risks are very much symptomatic,” Roberts noted, adding that causal factors also include things like geopolitics, increasing tonne-miles, increasing age of vessels and the ability to source and retain crew onboard, in addition to the newer risks such as digitalisation and data literacy that people are struggling with. “These risk factors are actually putting pressure on what is already a very fragile and asymmetric system, and that is in itself an extreme risk that needs to be managed,” Roberts said. Bas Van Steijnen, chief risk officer at Nova Marine Carriers, stressed that the constantly changing landscape is causing a lot of problems for shipowners, such as the change in rules and regulations in terms of fuels. “We trade our ships worldwide, and the question is, will these fuels be available for everyone to take in the future? I think that, for us, is a massive risk.” Vasileios Gkikas, global lead for dry bulk at class society ABS, thought the biggest challenge in terms of general risk when it comes to decarbonisation and alternative fuels is the fact that, for the first time, this risk is “totally outside our reach and our control”. “The industry that is supposed to bring us this availability is not there,” he said. Gkikas saw risks extending and changing daily, whether it is the fuel choice, the technology, the retrofitting, or the regulatory visibility. “I don’t remember seeing this multitude of parameters and functions and uncertainties in 25 years. We see the owners coming to us every day with a new demand or inquiry, and we understand that this is done under pressure, which means that they are quickly changing their mind or they’re exploring new options,” Gkikas said. Gus Majed, group CEO and founder of Paratus, the world’s first reinsurance company that writes cover against the energy price for both consumers and producers, told delegates that a lot of the issues with shipping companies are that even if they want to manage their bunker fuel freight price risk, only about 5% can hedge, while the other 95% don’t have that ability. For him, “certainty is priceless”, and when one quantifies all the risks, “paying for a premium in the long term saves so much aggravation”. William Hogg, senior analyst at counterparty risk provider Infospectrum, divulged that there are people who happily exist in a high-risk environment. “Every day, my jaw just drops at the amount of risk that people are willing to take on…. People are prepared to take risks that you would never see in any other industry,” Hogg said, adding: “In 25 years of my career, I’ve always thought that at some point the quality will rise to the top and people will pay that premium, but it never does.” “I think the whole supply chain is trying to do a lot more with a lot less,” Roberts added. Asked how small dry bulk owners and operators would adapt to the new environment, panellists unanimously warned that most of them won’t survive. “This is why you’re seeing a lot more consolidations, which are going to get even more profound,” Roberts noted. Van Steijnen observed a lot of demand from external factors and also charterers demanding more and more but not willing to pay more. “Unless we also get charters to recognise that shipowners are investing time, money and effort and they back us to sustain these additional costs, we’ll see consolidation going forward,” Van Steijnen said. Gkikas suggested that there will be a level of clearing and that the market will reshuffle, stressing that “the amount of data, information, regulatory compliance and risk mitigation is so huge” and that he does not see any way that these companies will survive the next two or three years. “There are a lot of people who have nothing to do with shipping, making up rules and thinking they know better than us how to organise it. And in the end, the consumer will pay. So, I think we’re in for a very difficult period,” added Van Steijnen. Despite the initial warning, the session ended with Trump versus AI in terms of risk for shipping, with ABS’s Gkikas getting the best reaction from the audience by outlining the risk of AI acting as the US president. It was unclear whether he was forced to take a double shot of Geneva Dry gin for this closing statement.

        "content": "Donald Trump, the American president, has claimed that after more than 17 months, the Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to a close. Speaking at the White House yesterday, Trump said Yemen’s Houthis have agreed to halt their attacks on shipping and that Washington would in turn stop carrying out strikes on the Iran-backed rebels. Trump’s claims have been backed up by Oman’s foreign minister, who has been negotiating between the two sides. “The Houthis have announced… that they don’t want to fight anymore. They just don’t want to fight. And we will honour that, and we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated,” Trump told reporters at an Oval Office meeting with Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney. “They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore, and that’s… the purpose of what we were doing,” the US president said. “President Trump promised to restore the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, and he used great American strength to swiftly deliver on that promise,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a post on X. Omani foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi confirmed that the US bombing campaign was ending, posting on X that discussions involving the US and Oman, as well as negotiators in Yemen, “have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides”. “In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping,” he wrote, calling the agreement a “welcome outcome”. The news comes after a particularly explosive few days for Arab ports on the Red Sea with the Yemeni ports of Ras Issa Oil and Hodeidah as well as Port Sudan all being bombed over the past week. Shipping volumes in the Red Sea continue to be depressed, currently around 50% lower than 2023 figures, according to data from SEB, a Swedish bank. “The prospect of a ceasefire agreement and enhanced security suggests a likely resurgence in commercial shipping operations in the region,” shipping analysts at SEB suggested in a note to clients this morning, arguing that car carrier and container markets are projected to experience the most significant rebalancing."

EMGS said that the acquisition represents a strategic diversification, complementing its existing electromagnetic operations and expanding into the growing subsea construction segment. The vessel was built in 2013 by Vard. The OSCV was bought from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Siem Offshore, Siem Day II AS. Under the transaction, EMGS will enter into a five-year bareboat charter agreement with Siem at a rate of $42,000 per day until December 31, 2025, increasing to $45,000 per day thereafter. The charter includes purchase options exercisable at the third and fourth anniversaries of the charter commencement, as well as an unconditional purchase obligation at the end of the charter period. The total acquisition price of $108.90m is structured to minimise upfront cash outlay, with an initial payment of only $10.89m due at charter commencement. Following the expiry of the current charter on December 31, 2025, EMGS plans to operate the vessel on term contracts. Spot charter rates are currently estimated to range between $100,000 and $140,000 per day. The long-term strategy for EMGS is to pursue growth in the subsea sector through the addition of further vessels by acquiring a high-quality asset already under contract and with opportunities in a dynamic subsea market beyond 2025. To ensure efficient operations without increasing the company’s fixed cost base, EMGS intends to engage the vessel’s current manager, Aurora Offshore, for technical and commercial ship management. Siem Offshore owns and controls 40% of the share capital of Aurora Offshore."

        "content": "A Danish partnership has claimed the world’s first ship fitted with a new type of flue gas sensor that can measure emissions of soot particles also known as ‘black carbon’ in real time. Uni-Tankers in collaboration with the Danish Technological Institute and emission control tech specialist Green Instruments have installed the sensor on board the 2006-built 6,900 dwt Falstria Swan in a first of many ships that could benefit from the new technology in the coming years. “This type of equipment will be of great importance to the shipping industry when new requirements are introduced to reduce emissions of soot particles and is an important step in the efforts to make shipping climate neutral,” the release said. The installation of the black carbon monitoring sensor, produced by Green Instruments, is part of Project Cleanship, which is being supported by funds from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency over a three-year period and also includes the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Centre for Zero Carbon Shipping, Danish Maritime and Danish Shipping. ”With the installation on the ship, we are now a big step closer to reducing black carbon emissions, the second largest maritime source of global warming after CO2. This is the first time ever that it is possible to accurately measure black carbon emissions in real time and under realistic conditions on a ship. This means that we have a much better understanding of how emissions in shipping can be reduced,” said Sonny Baekdahl Trudslev, development manager at Green Instruments. Black carbon is among other things formed by incomplete combustion in ship engines, and considered as a significant risk after CO2 that causes a number of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The IMO and the EU are expected to adopt requirements for the shipping industry to reduce emissions of soot particles – including black carbon – which accounts for around 20% of the CO2-equivalent emissions from shipping. “Without precise measurements, shipping companies navigate blindly, but now they will be able to see where they need to take action to reduce emissions of very harmful particles, and they can document their emissions. We can clearly see that there is a growing interest in this type of equipment, and we have already received several specific enquiries from shipping companies who want to hear more about the flue gas sensor,” added Trudslev. In addition to black carbon emission studies, Project Cleanship also focuses on the effect of energy-saving measures and new fuel types to provide the shipping sector with more knowledge that can influence future investments in cleaner technology."

The level of conversation was top-notch, and what made it truly valuable was the openness of participants and the diversity of views. The main theme? Uncertainty — not in a negative sense, but as a realistic recognition of a fast-changing, adapting, and resilient market. Here are some of the key points. Grain trade remains strong — but routes are shifting Demand is still high, but trade flows are changing. South America (especially Argentina and Brazil) is coming back with strong crops — and likely more congestion. China remains the key driver of demand, and its policy decisions will be crucial in the next season. Congestion is back — and that’s (maybe) good news for freight After two quieter years, congestion is rising again, especially in South American ports. For shipowners, this could be positive: more delays mean more ton-miles, tighter vessel availability, and potentially stronger rates. Trade is learning to live with new risks Tariffs, shifting alliances, and supply chain rewiring are becoming the new normal. Flexibility — in geography, operations, and commercial strategy — is now essential. Old routines no longer work. If you can’t adapt fast, you fall behind. An ageing fleet is becoming a serious issue Nearly 50% of the global dry bulk fleet is over 15 years old. Newbuilding slots are almost fully booked, and investors are hesitant due to uncertainty around fuels and emissions rules. This could reduce fleet supply going forward. Spot is the new standard Chartering is becoming more short-term. Most deals are made on the go. This increases volatility but also opens new opportunities for those who know the cargo flows well and can act fast. Capesize segment remains solid Despite seasonal softness, capesize vessels are holding up well. Trade from Brazil and West Africa stays firm, and long-haul voyages support tonnage demand. Regulations and efficiency benefits also give larger vessels an edge. Geneva Dry 2025 was a reminder of how fast shipping is changing — and how important it is to stay alert to market signals. For smaller shipowners, especially from Ukraine, these insights are very relevant. Despite all the challenges, we are an important part of the global agri supply chain. Despite all the challenges of war Ukraine remains a strong pilar of the global food security. Understanding trends helps us build stronger, more resilient logistics — not just for today, but for the years ahead. Events like Geneva Dry are a platform for real dialogue, experience-sharing, and future thinking."

In July 2024, Ocean Yield took over interests from infrastructure fund CVC DIF, which held a 31% stake in Geogas LNG. This provided the company with an indirect economic interest of 34% in France LNG Shipping (FLS). Ocean Yield has now bought Access Capital Partners’ share in Geogas LNG, increasing its indirect economic interest in FLS from 34% to 45%. The outfit, 50/50 owned by Japan’s NYK and Geogas LNG, owns a portfolio of 12 LNG carriers on long-term charters to tier-one investment-grade-rated European energy companies. The fleet consists of seven vessels on the water and five newbuildings, with an average contract duration of nine years, or 13 years including extension options. The transaction will add approximately $250m to Ocean Yield’s EBITDA backlog. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the second or third quarter of 2025."

That’s essentially how the International Maritime Organization (IMO) functions. And nowhere is this more painfully clear than in the regulation of lifeboat systems.

The flag state. Some flags, like the Marshall Islands, outsource their entire registry operation. Others, like Liberia, charge providers up to $300 per lifeboat inspection, with over 5,000 vessels under their flag, that’s millions in fees. But where does that money go? Is it reinvested into stronger oversight or simply collected and just another cost of doing business. Most flags don’t engage meaningfully at all.

India conducted missile strikes on nine targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir last night. India’s military reported seven civilian deaths from Pakistani shelling along the de facto border, while Pakistan stated 26 people were killed and 46 injured due to Indian airstrikes and firing along the line of control. Tensions between the nuclear-armed nations escalated following a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month, something that quickly saw trade between the two neighbours come to a halt. The last six months saw 520 port calls of vessels between Pakistan and India, according to data from maritime analytics firm Windward. The two nations do not have a huge trading relationship. In the last full financial year, Pakistan imported Indian goods worth $1.2bn, while India imported goods worth only $3m from Pakistan. Punit Oza, president of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers, who also teaches a course on geopolitics and their impact on shipping at Singapore Management University, took to LinkedIn today to detail the knock-on effects for shipping from this skirmish. The first impact, Oza suggested, will be in form of extra costs, either in form of deviation or in form of extra insurance costs."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "British consultancy Maritime Strategies International (MSI) has given an early indication of the impact that the International Maritime Organization’s recently agreed Net Zero Framework will have on the bunker market. By extending the annual fuel consumption estimates calculated for 2024 through to 2035, and applying MSI’s forecasts for bunker prices, it is possible to project the future fuel costs for conventionally-fuelled ships alongside the projected IMO penalties. By this approach, the IMO’s penalties would be equivalent to an 82% premium on top of the fleet bunker costs by 2035 – almost $100bn for the 30,000 ships tracked in MSI’s database. From another perspective, this also highlights the opportunity for the shipping bunker market – an annual pot directed towards drop-in biofuels and low carbon alternatives that could rise to $100bn per year within the next decade. Shipping is set to become the only sector in the world with the first-ever global price on carbon emissions following last months’s 83rd gathering of the Marine Environment Protection Committee at the IMO’s London headquarters. Simply put, from 2028, shipowners who do not meet certain emission targets will have to pay a penalty, buy carbon credits or use credits purchased earlier. While it won’t fully close the current price gap between green and fossil fuels, this first-of-its-kind regulatory framework will bring them closer in an effort to accelerate a transition to cleaner fuels. Ships missing the IMO emission tougher target would initially have to pay $100 annually for every tonne of CO₂ emissions that exceeds this goal. Those falling below the weaker target would have to pay up to $380 for every tonne of emissions above this level. Ships could pay that money to the IMO or buy credits from vessels that meet both targets by running on lower-carbon fuels. The IMO can use these revenues to compensate ships using low-carbon fuels, while investing in decarbonising the maritime sector, and addressing any negative impacts of the measures on food security."

        "content": "Perenco affiliate Dixstone and UAE-based engineering and construction firm Technomak have signed a strategic engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, integration (EPCCI) agreement for the Cap Lopez FLNG project in Gabon. After Perenco made the final investment decision for the Cap Lopez FLNG project, the contract for the construction, procurement, and integration of the project was awarded to Dixstone. The project is a nearshore type LNG facility that will produce 0,7 mtpa of LNG and 25,000 tonnes of LPG per year with a storage capacity of 137,000 cum in an ex-gas tanker converted to an FSO. The project is expected to expand on the existing Cap Lopez oil export terminal once it comes online, scheduled for 2026. Under the deal between Dixtone and Techcomak, the latter will fully construct and assemble the FLNG barge at its facility in the United Arab Emirates before being transported to Gabon. A contract for the LNG liquefication technology has already been awarded to Aragon, an affiliate of Seatrium, earlier this year."

        "content": "The Houthis from Yemen appear not to have got this week’s memo from the White House claiming that the Red Sea shipping crisis is drawing to a close. Donald Trump, the American president, said on Tuesday that after more than 17 months, the Houthis have agreed to halt their attacks on shipping and that Washington would in turn stop carrying out strikes on the Iran-backed rebels in a deal it was subsequently revealed was largely brokered by Oman. However, the Houthis have maintained they will continue their fight against Israeli-linked tonnage. Moreover, last night the official military spokesperson of the Houthis broadcast details of an alleged attack against US aircraft carrierUSS Harry S Trumanand its support vessels. Insurers and leading shipping associations are advising commercial shipping to keep away from the region for the time being despite the rhetoric coming out of the White House. “Given the fast-changing news flow in the current climate, we do not expect a rush to return to normal Red Sea transits given the risks,” shipping analysts at investment bank Jefferies argued in a note to clients, pointing out how the container shipping industry remains the most exposed to a change in market fundamentals should Red Sea transits resume normally. Jefferies estimates the effect of diversions has tightened capacity by 11-12% and is effectively the difference between a healthy market and one with limited ocean carrier pricing power. Other shipping segments are less exposed, with Jefferies suggesting tankers seeing a moderate 2% supply tightening benefit, dry bulk 1%, LPG 2% and LNG 3%. Shipping volumes in the Red Sea continue to be depressed, currently around 50% lower than 2023 figures, according to data from SEB, a Swedish bank."

        "content": "Andrew Lemmis questions the regulator’s global role from a lifeboat industry perspective. Imagine a football match where the referee is paid by the teams and has no power to issue a red card. He can suggest the rules, sure, but it’s up to the players whether to follow them. Sound absurd? That’s essentially how the International Maritime Organization (IMO) functions. And nowhere is this more painfully clear than in the regulation of lifeboat systems. The IMO, the UN agency responsible for maritime safety, sets the rules, but enforcement rests entirely with member states. These same states vote on the rules, fund the organisation, and are expected to regulate themselves. It’s a system built on trust. But when it comes to lifeboats, that trust often feels dangerously thin. To its credit, the IMO has introduced important measures: MSC.402(96), for professionalising service, and amendments to SOLAS. But regulation is one thing. Enforcement is something else entirely. Take lifeboat servicing. Only “authorised” service providers are supposed to carry out maintenance. Who decides who’s authorised? The flag state. Some flags, like the Marshall Islands, outsource their entire registry operation. Others, like Liberia, charge providers up to $300 per lifeboat inspection, with over 5,000 vessels under their flag, that’s millions in fees. But where does that money go? Is it reinvested into stronger oversight or simply collected and just another cost of doing business. Most flags don’t engage meaningfully at all. They delegate to Recognized Organizations (ROs) or accept approvals from other flags without direct scrutiny. In practice, this means a vessel flagged with Country A might use a service provider approved only by Country B, no consistent oversight, no shared enforcement standard. And classification societies? While IACS provides some unified requirements, each class society applies its own standards. Application often varies by region, office, or individual surveyor. One vessel’s approval in one port may be challenged by the next surveyor somewhere else. This inconsistency raises a critical question: how much protection does the IMO framework really offer when its enforcement varies so widely? Even when progress is made, when new regulations are adopted, challenges remain. To secure consensus, regulations are often broad, with key details left to “Unified Interpretations” or guidance notes. The result is an evolving patchwork of assumptions and uneven implementation. Then there’s the language itself. The debate between “shall” (mandatory) and “should” (guidance) may seem minor, but the consequences are real. When survival-critical actions are labelled as “should,” compliance becomes optional. In aviation, such ambiguity would never be acceptable. Representation within the IMO also raises concerns. Influence is often shaped more by politics and budget contributions than fleet size or safety responsibility. And during regulatory discussions, flag states frequently bring external advisors, many with direct commercial interests. While industry input is valuable, this opens the door to conflicts of interest. Those who stand to gain or lose from regulation are helping write the rules. Transparency? Still limited. Meeting outcomes are published, but working group access is often restricted, and deliberations behind key decisions remain opaque. Critics, including NGOs and seafarer groups, have long questioned whether the IMO’s processes serve public safety or protect private interests. And what happens at sea? We see the cycle repeat: Inspections vary by flag. Some service providers operate with minimal scrutiny. Crew confidence in safety equipment is often low. And yet, the certificates are still issued. So, is the IMO fit for purpose? If its purpose is to create baseline global standards, then yes, it plays a vital role. Without it, we’d face fragmented regulation and greater risks. But if we expect the IMO to drive fast, independent, and uniform enforcement, to ensure every lifeboat is genuinely fit for purpose, then no, it falls short. The system was never built for that level of oversight. If we want real reform, we have to ask: Until these questions are answered, lifeboat safety, and seafarer safety, will continue to rest on something fragile: trust. And in this industry, trust alone is never enough."

According to the US giant, this will be the first time that a corporate PPA will extend the lifespan of an offshore wind farm. Shell NoordzeeWind is also the oldest and first offshore wind farm to undergo a life extension in the Netherlands. This agreement will extend the lifespan of the Netherlands’ first offshore wind farm by at least four years beyond its original decommissioning date. Google opted to purchase 100% of the wind farm’s capacity, which enabled Shell to pursue permit extensions and invest in crucial upgrades, preventing the premature loss of valuable clean energy. “This initiative helps to keep existing carbon-free energy resources on the grid that would otherwise have retired,” Google explained. To date, the US firm has supported over 1GW of clean energy generation capacity in the Netherlands through PPAs such as its largest offshore wind power deal to date – the PPA for 478MW from Hollandse Kust Noord Wind Farm Zone Site V and Hollandse Kust West Site VI, currently under construction. In April 2023, Google also signed a ten-year PPA with Eneco to procure 153MW from a number of near-shore wind farms. The deal with Shell comes only a few weeks after the technology conglomerate signed its first offshore wind power purchase agreement in the Asia Pacific region.

        "content": "Shipyards and owners are increasingly willing to wait a long time for newbuilds. New data from Danish Ship Finance shows that 20% of all ships on order today will deliver only after more than three years from now. At the beginning of 2021, only around 5% of the global orderbook had been due for delivery beyond the following three years. Delivery times for newbuild contracts signed today have seen one year added, on average, relative to four years ago, according to analysis from Danish Ship Finance. Chinese yards account for three out of every four deliveries due beyond 2027 and have already secured preliminary utilisation rates of 50% in 2028 and 20% in 2029 with some LNG contracts now stretching into the next decade. Danish Ship Finance is forecasting that newbuilding prices will decline in the near term, but the number of shipyards securing new orders may fall as the appetite for new vessels wanes along with what it sees as softening freight rates. Latest data from Clarksons Research shows that after three bumper years of orders, the appetite for newbuilds among owners is weak, down 57% year-on-year. Currently, there are about 348 operational shipyards worldwide, having either secured new contracts or completed deliveries in the past year, according to March data from broker BRS. This is roughly 50% of 2007’s peak of around 700 active yards. BRS has argued that the shipbuilding industry entered a supercycle in 2021, equivalent to the 2003 to 2008 boom. BRS is predicting 100m dwt of ships will be ordered this year, down from last year’s 193m figure. “We expect that current worldwide uncertainties will prevail, with a renewed pressure on freight markets delaying investment decisions. The new wave of shipbuilding expansion will have a downward impact on newbuilding prices, which should weaken during 2025 by more than 10% depending on type and size of ships, despite the resistance that will remain given the considerable orderbooks,” BRS predicted in its annual review published towards the end of March."

        "content": "How brokers will evolve, and what owners and charterers will seek out of their broking houses in the years ahead formed much of the debate in the Chartering Spotlight panel at last week’s Geneva Dry summit. Torbjørn Gjervik, CEO of Norway’s Western Bulk, told delegates he felt the future of chartering would involve people who had good soft skills as well as the capability to process data well. “The human factor is truly important for the business. The knowledge, no tool is going to substitute that, but the tools are there to facilitate,” argued Michelle Gonzalez, Vale’s head of chartering in Asia. Jeremy Palin, the CEO of major broking house Arrow, admitted there were still “some bloody awful brokers” about, but the days of the lunching broker were just about over. “I think as brokers you need to be stronger, fitter, faster than you ever had to be before,” Palin said, arguing that brokers are nowhere near being replaced by technology. Rather, Palin suggested brokers are able to vastly improve what they offer to their principals via very heavily data-driven research from a variety of systems. Quite so, concurred Christoffer Svard, chief commercial officer at Sea, a charter party and recap management system. “I think the role of technology and tools are empowering the users. It’s augmenting the service that you can provide to your customer,” Svard said, going on to argue that while AI and large language models are great for processing big quantities of data, they are “absolutely crap” in making decisions. The session had opened with a discussion on the merits of Clarksons-backed Sea, and the newly formed Ocean Recap, a rival offering recently launched by five brokers, including Arrow. Arrow’s Palin said Ocean Recap had been created as a result of a perception that Sea was monopolising the charter party space “We had a situation where, even just as Arrow last year, I think we paid north of $200,000 for Clarksons to produce our charter parties. That gives me very, very serious indigestion,” Palin said, adding: “Ocean Recap is born from the market, by the market, and for the market. We don’t anonymise data, we don’t aggregate data, we just produce charter parties.” Replying, Svard from Sea maintained that competition is always healthy as long as innovation is driven and leads to positive change, not just trying to repeat and do the same. Moderator Tim Huxley, a former broker who now runs Hong Kong shipowner Mandarin Shipping, then questioned where all this debate leaves smaller broking outfits. “I think definitely there is room for for those niche brokers that really build a deep relationship with the customer and know the trade, know their commodity,” said Western Bulk’s Gjervik, who then went on to outline what he was attempting to do with his own workforce. “We’re trying to prepare the organisation, to create the culture where the tech team is, first of all, listening to the chartering team so that what they’re trying to build is sort of aligned with what the chartering team needs. That’s the first step, and then you need to have a chartering team, which has an open mind for using data,” Gjervik explained. In his concluding remarks, Palin from Arrow stressed how information is freely available and abundant everywhere. “The role of a broker is to understand what is pertinent there. Our commodity, our only commodity, is information and our ability to collate that, direct that and advise,” Palin said, noting how there is a more consultative element to what brokers do as a job these days as opposed to just price matching and transacting and fixing ships. “There is certainly a collaboration that needs to happen between vendors, charterers, operators, owners and brokers in order to drive the innovation in order to ensure that there is also enough money in it to continue to invest and reinvest to build products that can actually ultimately solve problems,” concluded Svard from Sea.

        "content": "Danish liner giant Maersk has lowered its global container market forecast for this year due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Maersk has issued a fresh prognosis for market development in 2025, ranging from a 1% dip to a 4% increase, compared to the 4% rise projected earlier this year. The Vincent Clerc-led company said the outlook for global container demand over the remainder of the year “remains highly uncertain, shaped by a rapidly evolving trade policy landscape and increasing recession risks in the United States”. Maersk added that it expects market growth in the second quarter if shippers take advantage of a 90-day pause of reciprocal tariffs by frontloading shipments and building inventories. “In the latter part of the year, there is, on the one hand, a growing risk that demand could contract, and on the other the possibility that trade rebounds if tariffs are rolled back,” the company said. Maersk has yet to drop any transpacific services this year, while German peer Hapag-Lloyd said last month that it saw 30% of shipments to the US from China cancelled. The company added that policy uncertainty and the threat of a further escalation in the trade war “cast a shadow” over the US economic outlook. “If Chinese exporters redirect lost US exports to other markets, a protectionist backlash could follow, risking a broader trade war,” it warned, adding that it also expects Red Sea turmoil to continue throughout the year. HSBC saw last week’s global bookings fall 25% week-over-week, but they improved 15% year-over-year following four consecutive weeks of decline. China to US bookings eroded 27%, but the pace of decline eased. Growth in non-China to US bookings improved to 16% year-over-year. “We caution that weekly volumes could be volatile due to blanked sailings and tariff developments,” HSBC said, but noted that the share prices of long-haul liners have eroded by only 3% on average since ‘Liberation Day’. According to Sea-Intelligence, the downfall in China volumes has not made its way to the US coastline yet. This will change in the week ahead, as the first wave of blank sailings and booking downfalls make it to land. “Container volume data for Asian exports in April will not be available before early June, but indications from carriers and forwarders suggest a Chinese booking downfall in the -30% to -50% range, much greater than the 4%-5% reduction in capacity. While the Chinese volume drop will be partially offset by uptake elsewhere in Asia, it does not seem likely that gains in the rest of Asia can offset the loss from China. This could result in even more blank sailings in the coming weeks, and possibly lead to a significant drop in spot rates,” Sea-Intelligence said in a recent report. According to the Port of Los Angeles, business is expected to drop 35% year-over-year. “This is a number which tallies quite well with statements from carriers such as Hapag-Lloyd and Evergreen, as well as forwarders Kuehne+Nagel and Flexport, which are reporting anywhere from 30-50% downfall on bookings out of China,” Sea-Intelligence noted. “The geopolitical situation and tariff implications make 2025 more unpredictable than usual,” conceded Soren Toft, chief executive of the world’s largest liner, MSC, in a recent social media post."

The initiative will deliver prototype humanoids by the end of 2026, with field testing and full commercial deployment scheduled to begin in 2027. Persona AI will lead the development of humanoid hardware and AI-based control and learning algorithms. Vazil Company will develop the welding tools and build the industrial testing environment. HD KSOE will support deployment in live shipyard settings and provide field engineering data. HD Hyundai Robotics will contribute welding-path AI training data and performance validation. HD KSOE senior vice president Dong-ju Lee stated, “Welding humanoids will not only boost productivity but also significantly reduce the burden on workers and greatly enhance safety. By developing robots optimised for shipyard tasks, we aim to set a new paradigm in shipbuilding automation. Our goal is a smart shipyard where humans and intelligent robots collaborate seamlessly.” Persona AI is led by Nicolaus Radford who previously ran Nauticus Robotics. Radford commented, “As heavy industry faces growing labour constraints—especially in high-risk trades like welding—the need for rugged, autonomous humanoid robots is more urgent than ever.” According to Persona AI, shipyards around the world are reporting attrition rates of 20–22% among average workers, with critical trades experiencing rates as high as 30% or more. Additionally, recruitment programs have struggled to retain new hires, with reports indicating that 50–60% of first-year shipyard employees leave within their first year.Splashhas reported repeatedly on South Korea’s struggles to attract suitable numbers of shipyard labourers in recent years as the country’s ship orders have swelled. Persona’s purpose-built humanoids claim to have the dexterity and toughness to execute tasks such as hull welding, repair, and fitting in confined spaces. HD Hyundai Robotics vice president Young-hoon Song stated, “Unlike conventional robots that focus solely on repetitive tasks, these robots must be able to observe, reason, and make decisions.” Vazil Company CTO Sungwon Kim added, “By developing humanoids capable of precision welding, we will elevate shipyard automation to the next level. This partnership marks a significant milestone in a global industrial robotics collaboration.”"

        "content": "UK-based oil and gas producer Harbour Energy has revealed plans to axe around 250 jobs in Aberdeen due to the government’s “punitive” measures. According to the oil and gas firm, cutting around a quarter of its Aberdeen workforce comes as part of a review of its UK operations. The 250 jobs are on top of the 350 jobs cut by the firm in 2023. Harbour Energy has been a huge opponent of the previous Conservative government’s measures, such as the Energy Profits Levy, otherwise known as the windfall tax, which was extended after the Labour Party came to power last year. The company’s recent financial results for 2024 revealed that the company made $1.2bn (£898m) in pre-tax profits. However, after Harbour was hit with what it claimed was an effective 108% tax rate, it was left with post-tax losses of $93m (£69.6m). “Harbour is launching a review of its UK operations, which we expect to result in a reduction of around 250 onshore roles in our Aberdeen-based business unit. The review is unfortunately necessary to align staffing levels with lower levels of investment, due mainly to the government’s ongoing punitive fiscal position and a challenging regulatory environment,” said Scott Barr, managing director of Harbour Energy’s UK business. The Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce (AGCC) stated that the cuts were a “devastating blow” to the workers, and called on the government to “end the windfall tax now”. “I fear it is just the tip of the iceberg, unless the Government changes course. Labour’s long-term ambitions are laudable, but in the absence of a proper industrial strategy, we are left with policies which are destroying a world-class British industry,” stated Russell Borthwick, chief executive at the AGCC. UK’s largest offshore trade union, Unite, also criticised the government’s policy for the latest loss of jobs. Unite said it is “crystal clear” that government policy and the current regulatory framework are contributing to companies slashing jobs. “Unite fears that the scale of the job losses in the years to come will run into the tens of thousands unless the UK government changes direction and produces a concrete plan with real jobs for the transition of North Sea workers,” said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. “Governments need to realise that for any just transition to work, it needs to be a managed transition that puts the workers at its centre. The current political ideology of prematurely ending the oil and gas industry without any thought to the impact it has on workers is unforgivable,” added Unite’s lead officer for the offshore sector John Boland."

        "content": "Donald Trump, the American president, has claimed that after more than 17 months, the Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to a close. Speaking at the White House yesterday, Trump said Yemen’s Houthis have agreed to halt their attacks on shipping and that Washington would in turn stop carrying out strikes on the Iran-backed rebels. Trump’s claims have been backed up by Oman’s foreign minister, who has been negotiating between the two sides. “The Houthis have announced… that they don’t want to fight anymore. They just don’t want to fight. And we will honour that, and we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated,” Trump told reporters at an Oval Office meeting with Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney. “They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore, and that’s… the purpose of what we were doing,” the US president said. “President Trump promised to restore the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, and he used great American strength to swiftly deliver on that promise,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a post on X. Omani foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi confirmed that the US bombing campaign was ending, posting on X that discussions involving the US and Oman, as well as negotiators in Yemen, “have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides”. “In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping,” he wrote, calling the agreement a “welcome outcome”. The news comes after a particularly explosive few days for Arab ports on the Red Sea with the Yemeni ports of Ras Issa Oil and Hodeidah as well as Port Sudan all being bombed over the past week. Shipping volumes in the Red Sea continue to be depressed, currently around 50% lower than 2023 figures, according to data from SEB, a Swedish bank. “The prospect of a ceasefire agreement and enhanced security suggests a likely resurgence in commercial shipping operations in the region,” shipping analysts at SEB suggested in a note to clients this morning, arguing that car carrier and container markets are projected to experience the most significant rebalancing."

        "content": "Dutch surveyor Fugro has been awarded a contract to perform comprehensive geotechnical surveys for the eastern array of the Dogger Bank South (DBS) offshore wind farms. The initiative is led by RWE and Masdar to develop one of the UK’s most powerful offshore wind energy projects. The detailed surveys will provide data on subsurface conditions at planned wind turbine locations, inter-array cable routes, and platform foundations. Starting in mid-May, Fugro will mobilise multiple geotechnical vessels to carry out the fieldwork 122 km off the northeast coast of England. This will include a range of techniques such as cone penetration tests, vibrocores, and sampling boreholes. Fugro will also use its SEACALF MkV Deep Drive system of seabed investigations for faster project delivery and reduced environmental impact. This contract builds on previous work Fugro has completed for the DBS offshore wind farm, including preliminary geophysical and geotechnical investigations, a shallow geotechnical survey on the export cable route, and a detailed geotechnical investigation of DBS West. “This year’s site investigation at the eastern array builds upon similar work completed at the western array in 2024. The DBS projects are critical infrastructure projects and have the potential to supply 3m homes with 3 GW of offshore wind generation capacity, supporting the UK Government’s clean power ambitions,” said Colin McAllister, development project lead for DBS offshore wind farms."

Through this acquisition, MOL enters Fengmiao I as co-owner alongside CIP’s fifth flagship fund, CI V. Fengmiao I is CIP’s third offshore wind project in Taiwan and is located off the coast of Taichung County. Development of Fengmiao I began in 2020, and site exclusivity and grid allocation were secured in Taiwan’s Round 3.1 auction in December 2022. Construction of Fengmiao I was initiated following financial close in March 2025, and the offshore wind farm is on track for completion of construction by the end of 2027. The project is financed through a combination of equity and senior loans from a consortium of 27 international and Taiwanese banks and financial institutions, partly guaranteed by four export credit agencies and Taiwan’s National Credit Guarantee Administration. Once operational, Fengmiao I will deliver energy to a group of six large local and international energy users in Taiwan who have entered into long-term power purchase agreements for the entire capacity of the wind farm."

        "content": "Filipino seafarers represent the largest global crew contingent but are we doing enough to support them for tomorrow’s shipping industry, asks Mailyn Borillo, managing director, OSM Thome Philippines. Filipino seafarers remain an essential pillar of global maritime operations. Representing more than a quarter of the world’s maritime workforce, they are known for their resilience, loyalty, and dedication – contributing quietly but significantly to the world economy. Each year, over 400,000 Filipino seafarers are deployed abroad, generating more than USD 6.7 billion in remittances and reinforcing the Philippines’ position as a leading maritime labour provider. This strength stems from the country’s deep maritime tradition, supported by over 90 maritime higher education institutions. However, as the global shipping industry rapidly evolves – shaped by digitalisation, decarbonisation, and new safety standards – the basic systems supporting Filipino seafarers must also transform to meet growing demands. Closing the recruitment gap For more than two decades, the maritime industry has anticipated a looming seafarer shortage. That forecast is now reality. Despite thousands of maritime graduates annually in the Philippines, less than 10% are absorbed into seafaring roles. This gap is not just a talent mismatch – it’s a lost opportunity. A significant barrier to employment is the insufficient availability of onboard training slots. Shipowners and stakeholders must invest in turning maritime graduates into fully-fledged maritime professionals. Beyond cadetship programs, emphasis must also be placed on ratings development. The industry also needs to move beyond strategy and embed inclusivity in daily operations. Women remain an untapped 50% of the talent pool. Awareness must start early – and real support structures around maternity, safety, and family dynamics must be prepared in advance of female integration onboard. Rethinking retention and welfare Retaining talent is not just about loyalty – it’s about continuous, holistic development. With vessel automation and emerging technologies, seafarers need ongoing training to remain competent and confident. Digital upskilling must be accessible, regular, and industry aligned. Mental health is equally critical. Emotional well-being, bolstered by wellness programs and stable internet access onboard, helps seafarers manage isolation and stay connected with loved ones. Between contracts, reintegration support – covering health, financial planning, and career guidance – ensures a smoother transition from sea to shore. Meanwhile, empowering families through life skills programs such as financial literacy, health, wellness and psychological support provides seafarers with strength and peace of mind. Strengthening legal and institutional support The Magna Carta for Filipino Seafarers represents a significant step forward in safeguarding the rights and welfare of maritime professionals. Once fully enacted, this legislation aims to institutionalise key protections in areas such as training, employment, repatriation, and grievance handling – aligning national practices with international labour standards. More importantly, it seeks to uphold dignity, fairness, and accountability throughout a seafarer’s entire career. To ensure its success, both local and international stakeholders must remain actively engaged and contribute to the shaping and implementation of government policies and legislation. Strengthening the shore organisation The performance and well-being of seafarers are closely tied to the strength of the shore organisation behind them. Effective support – both while they’re onboard and during their time ashore – starts with capable, well-trained shore teams. Bureaucratic and manual procedures can be burdensome for seafarers. Therefore, continuous improvement of systems and internal processes is crucial. Further, seafarers are not just numbers – they need human resource professionals who can truly engage with them. It’s essential to invest in the development of shore staff, not only to enhance their technical capabilities but, more importantly, to strengthen their people and leadership skills. When we operate efficiently onshore, we create more meaningful employment for seafarers, build high-performing crews, and help position the maritime industry as a strong, attractive career path for future talent. A shared responsibility for action, not just discussion While a ship can be built in a few years, producing a fully qualified, experienced, and licensed Senior Officer takes a decade or more. This underscores the value of investing in long-term seafarer development to ensure a sustainable maritime industry. Supporting seafarers requires a united effort – from ship owners, ship managers, crew managers and training institutions to government bodies and international partners. By investing in Filipino seafarers through inclusive recruitment, continuous development, legal protections, and efficient shore organization, we can foster a more sustainable and people-centred maritime industry. Filipino seafarers have long embodied excellence at sea. It is now our collective responsibility to ensure they continue to sail forward with greater opportunities and dignity."

Wan Wenguo, 43, appeared at a court in Hong Kong yesterday to face a charge of criminal damage and two additional charges for breaching local maritime regulations. Prosecutors said he is responsible for damage to the 77 km Balticconnector – a natural gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland – as well as to a nearby telecommunications cable. The Balticconnector gas pipeline was damaged in early October 2023 in the Finnish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Later that month, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation stated that the damage was caused by an external mechanical force and that they had founda heavy objectnear the damaged pipeline. It turned out that the mentioned heavy object was an anchor from the Hong Kong-registered vessel, and the Finnish authorities found that the same type of paint was identified on the anchor as on the Balticconnector and that it was most probably from theNewnew Polar Bear. Seabed gas pipelines, power cables and fiber optic cables have all been attacked – likely by merchant ships dragging their anchors – over the past couple of years across the Baltic, forcing NATO to establish Baltic Sentry, a naval protection operation."

Massimo Giovannini, managing partner at Monaco owner Trans Sea Transport Group, ensured the session got off to an interesting start, maintaining that net-zero by 2050 goals are a “unicorn” in that no one has the answers today. Nuclear further down the line, might be shipping’s way to meet green targets, the Italian shipowner suggested. A good compromise is when all parties are not happy “I don’t think anybody, including myself, has that crystal ball to say, OK, which zero-carbon fuel is going to be the answer for dry bulk vessels,” conceded Eman Abdalla, global operations and supply chain director at Cargill Ocean Transportation, who admitted there was a chance shipping would miss hitting its 2050 targets. On last month’s MEPC gathering in London where member states agreed upon a watered-down net zero framework, Abdalla said: “There isn’t necessarily a well-defined business case for anybody to go and immediately order ships for specific zero carbon fuels, but at least it has definitely planted the right seeds so that we can start ordering dual fuel vessels or dual fuel capable vessels.” Also discussing MEPC, Gaël Coronel, regulatory and public affairs officer at SUISSENÉGOCE, a local trade body, commented: “As a Swiss citizen, we always say a good compromise is when all parties are not happy. And that’s exactly what has happened with this regulation.” Providing advice on how to advance green ambitions, Salvatore Castellano, freight decarbonisation manager at Chinese agri-business giant COFCO International, called for greater open communication and “chemistry” between charterers and owner/operators. “Once that is defined, we have our operation teams who are more dedicated to maximise the intake, minimise the consumption, using all the different tools that thankfully we have already with digitalisation and the latest technology.” These are all small steps, Castellano said, concluding: “Rome was not built in a day, little by little.” Geneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference,returns on April 28 and 29 next year,with delegate passes being limited.Tickets are now on sale here."

Announcing the latest move, Britain said the ships being targeted had transported more than $24bn worth of Russian oil and oil products since the start of 2024, with some also involved in damaging cables and pipelines in the Baltic Sea. “The shadow fleet operation, masterminded by Putin’s cronies, is not just bankrolling the Kremlin’s illegal war in Ukraine – the fleet’s languishing vessels are known to be damaging critical national infrastructure through reckless seafaring in Europe,” prime minister Keir Starmer’s office said. The UK previously imposed sanctions against 133 vessels linked to Russian oil trade – more than any other European nation. “We will do everything in our power to destroy (President Vladimir Putin’s) shadow fleet operation, starve his war machine of oil revenues and protect the subsea infrastructure that we rely on for our everyday lives,” Starmer said. In January, the US announced a massive sanctions action covering 183 Russian-controlled and shadow fleet ships, the largest to date."

        "content": "Brazilian state-owned giant Petrobras has revealed it will decommission almost 70 offshore platforms and FPSOs, three of which it has already decided to repurpose. Petrobras said that it is planning on decommissioning 68 platforms, two this year and a total of ten by 2029. The remaining 58 will be removed after that. This is according to a statement made by Petrobras’ general manager of decommissioning projects, Carlos Castilho. He added that Petrobras works with around 70 shipyards in Brazil to recycle its platforms and FPSOs. Of the first batch of 10 decommissioning projects, Petrobras stated that at least three platforms will be refurbished and reused. TheP-35,P-37, andP-47FPSOs, all previously installed in the Marlim field, were initially supposed to be dismantled. However, the units will now be modernised and reused. The first of the three units to be reused will be theP-37, followed by theP-35. The three FPSOs worked on the Marlim field until theAnna NeryandAnita Garibaldiwere added as part of the Marlim and Voador revitalisation project. The two will extend production from the fields until 2048. The FPSO duo also replaced nine platforms – theP-18,P-19,P-20,P-26,P-32,P-33,P-35,P-37, andP-47. The shipyard employers’ union Sinaval, and the Brazilian Petroleum and Gas Institute are working together with Petrobras to establish which units can be modernised for further use. Results of this collaboration are expected by the end of July."

        "content": "Darren Shelton discusses why shipping prefers the illusion of regulation. In global shipping, we often talk about regulation as a good thing – and rightly so. Rules are meant to protect the environment, improve safety and support fair labour conditions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other bodies have spent decades creating systems to guide our industry toward higher standards. But despite all this effort, something still feels off. Progress comes way too slowly. Enforcement appears uneven. The playing field unlevel. And the best-written rules don’t seem to change much at sea. So we must ask the harder question: what if the real issue isn’t the quality of regulation but the quiet preference for keeping it ineffective? Rules that reassure but fail to reform Shipping has many standards, but not all are enforced equally. Some ports have strong oversight and others where the rules are far more relaxed. Ships can sail through some waters without ever facing accountability’s headwinds. Yet, most in the industry still support the idea of regulation. Why? Perhaps it’s because law – at least the appearance of it – offers something useful. It reassures the public that action is being taken. It gives a sense of structure and legitimacy and, at times, helps avoid deeper scrutiny. This creates a quiet system where everyone looks like they’re doing something, without ever disrupting the way things really work in the background. To be clear, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Shared accountability, shared avoidance Much like the nets used at sea, shipping is a complex web in which enforcement is difficult because responsibility is spread out. It’s literally pointless because all could be right in redirecting the concerns. Likewise fruitless since accountability slips through the cracks, not because people are dishonest but because the system itself allows ambiguity. This ebb and flow of responsibility makes it easy to celebrate new rules on paper while real change stalls at sea. We are not alone Shipping isn’t the only industry playing this game. Finance, big tech and energy all operate within frameworks that look robust, allow power, innovation and decision-making to flow far from the reach of regulators. In this light, maritime is simply playing the same game – just at sea. As is true in these other industries, all of whom intersect in shipping, the illusion of strong oversight gives helpful cover for the real work to happen in the shadows. There companies can experiment, invest and grow – without the friction of strict control. And to be fair, that’s where the most meaningful progress happens. So maybe we should ask: should it be this way? And if so, why not simply say it openly? Calling it what it is The nomenclature of naming ships is an enigma that baffles the heartiest of sailors. How we call what we mean is, to be sure, a riddle. Considering that, perhaps shipping prefers space to solve big problems in its own way – through commercial novelty, pilot programs, private partnerships and advanced technology. Nothing wrong with any of that. In fact, many of shipping’s greatest leaps forward didn’t come from rule-making bodies. They came from captains of industry who decide to lead. And if that’s the best path for progress: let’s be honest about it. Let’s stop pretending that more rules, by themselves, will fix everything. Let’s acknowledge that what we often call “regulation” is more like a mutually beneficial agreement: You write rules that we mostly like. We’ll act like we’re really following them. Together, we’ll smile like progress is being made. Because it probably is. A higher path forward The probability of all ploys is that the illusion can only last so long. Eventually people figure out the magician isn’t truly sawing the woman in half. When public trust fades or when a crisis hits, soft enforcement turns into a harsh spotlight. Suddenly the very freedom that worked so long can be quickly snatched away, more by force than by choice. So, what if there is a better way? What if we deliberately moved from illusion to intention? That doesn’t mean getting rid of accountability. It means embracing it authentically. Regulation is then perceived not as threats, but as tools. Not as boxes to be checked, but as compasses that guide. Not for performing compliance, but for living out commitment. Imagine a universal faithfulness to responsibly innovating in ways that allow freedom to be earned through action, rewarding the best actors who rise to the occasion, meeting the challenge and not the mere minimum. What kind of best practices might that encourage? Choosing the harder, higher road Our maritime world has always been driven by those bold enough to sail beyond the visible horizon. Today that horizon is less of a line separating sky and sea; it’s a destination where truth, responsibility and progress converge. Yes, regulation may remain our pet paper tiger. But it only stays a ‘toothless wonder’ if we choose to keep it that way. Let’s be better than that. Let’s be honest about where we are, and committed to where we can go. Let’s build a culture where rules matter not by mandate, but because they’re meaningful. That’s not a burden. That’s leadership."

        "content": "Australia’s offshore safety regulator NOPSEMA has ordered driller Valaris to stop drilling at the Barossa gas field 300 km north of Darwin over concerns regarding crucial safety equipment. Valaris’ 2011-builtMS-1semisub drilling rig was told to halt drilling due to concerns about the blowout preventer (BOP) that is designed to quickly stop the flow of oil and gas from a well in an emergency. The regulator said on Monday that the BOP system had degraded and that it might not function as intended in an emergency scenario, such as a well blowout. NOPSEMA noted that this could potentially result in a major accident event with serious or fatal health consequences to workers. Namely, a set of hydraulic rams failed a pressure test conducted after the blowout preventer had been installed underwater. The safety standard needed for Valaris to drill in this location requires two pairs of rams to work. One of the main reasons for the 2010Deepwater Horizondisaster was the failure of the blowout preventer to seal the well. It resulted in 11 deaths and the largest oil spill in US history. The offshore regulator did inform Valaris that the state of the BOP used was unacceptable before shutting the operation down. The driller did not inform NOPSEMA if the situation had been rectified. Now, the well will be secured safely, and Valaris must return the BOP to the surface to be fixed. Australian media cited a Santos spokesperson who claimed that there was no safety incident and that Valaris was making repairs, with drilling expected to resume later this week. The rig is still set to complete two of the original six-well campaign. Even without the two final wells, the completed ones are enough to achieve Barossa’s nameplate capacity."

        "content": "Danish offshore wind vessel operator Esvagt has officially formed a joint venture with South Korean shipping company KMC Line. The jv named KESTO will target the growing South Korean offshore wind market, where current plans include as much as 18.3 GW offshore wind to be established by 2030. The two companies said the new business is already in talks with partners on several Korean offshore wind farms to be established from 2027 onwards. “It is our ambition to grow, and we are responding to a request from our customers to be able to draw on known skills and competences in new markets,” said Søren Karas, chief executive of Esvagt. “The potential of the Korean offshore wind market is very attractive, but as an emerging market it also comes with unknowns. International developers and turbine manufacturers have a heightened focus on using well-known partners and respected suppliers when much else is new. That is to our advantage,” he added. In February 2024, Esvagt and KMC Line signed aletter of intentto work together on renewable energy projects in Korea. Founded in 1989, KMC Line lists 12 ships in its fleet, including bulkers, roros and heavy and project cargo carriers. The company is one of the nation’s leaders in coastal shipping, serving clients such as Posco, Hyundai Steel, and Hyundai Oilbank. “KMC Line brings important market insight and strong relationships with local partners and authorities as well as the largest maritime universities in Korea. This will be important in combining Esvagt’s years of experience within offshore wind in a new market and in ensuring a competent delivery and quality product from the first day,” said Jacob Lykke-Kjeldsen, senior sales executive at Esvagt. James Jonghoon Kim, president and CEO of KMC Line, added: “We have a strong industrial base in South Korea but lack experience and the standard of service quality in the offshore wind industry. When we combine ESVAGT’s expertise and experience in SOVs with KMC Line’s regional maritime knowledge, I am convinced that KESTO will raise the bar for both safety and service quality in the industry.” The move will see Esvagt expand its presence to three continents, after setting up a joint venture with US shipping conglomerate Crowley for the North American wind market. The duo is currently building an SOV to support Siemens Gamesa’s service operations at Dominion Energy’s wind farm when it becomes operational in 2026."

        "content": "Tariffs, increasing stem sizes and changing trade patterns formed much of the debate at the Minor Bulks session at this year’s packed Geneva Dry summit. Wlillem Vermaat, shipping director at Heidelberg Materials Trading, the second largest cement producer globally, noted that commodity trade flows tend to adjust to market changes. For example, US cement imports shifted from Canada and Mexico to Vietnam and Turkey when borders were closed. Arthur English, the CEO of open hatch specialist G2 Ocean, focused on forest products and steel in his opening comments of the session. Forest products such as lumber and wood pulp were flat in 2024 due to weak US housing starts. Steel exports from China surged to 115m tonnes , up 25% year-on-year, but port congestion in South America and anti-dumping investigations in six countries – Vietnam, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, India – have created uncertainty. Asian nations are the primary importers of Chinese steel, with US imports being minor, English pointed out. The panel spent plenty of time discussing the bauxite and alumina trades. At 200m tonnes a year, the seaborne trade of bauxite can hardly be described as a minor bulk anymore, the panel felt. Bauxite trade has doubled in under a decade, driven by Guinea’s exports to China, Robert Haggquist, charterer and decarbonisation lead at South32, a miner, told delegates. Chinese domestic bauxite is depleting, boosting imports. Alumina trade – now at 40m tonnes a year – is growing, with Indonesia refining domestically due to export bans, supported by Chinese investments. US tariffs have disrupted the aluminium trade, redirecting Canadian exports to Europe and increasing Middle Eastern and African supply to the US, delegates were told. Derek Langston, the session’s moderator and global head of dry research at broker Braemar, also discussed nickel ore, noting how China imported 38m tonnes of the commodity last year, primarily from Guinea, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Potential export bans and elections in the Philippines add uncertainty to this trade, he warned, neatly bringing the discussion back to a recurring theme, namely trade adjustments with G2 Ocean’s English and Bas Van Steijnen, chief risk officer at Nova Marine Carriers, discussing how tariffs and market shifts are driving trade flow changes such as Canadian aluminium to Europe, Indian smelters targeting the US, and Brazilian wood pulp replacing US exports to China. “At the end of the day, the market finds an equilibrium and trades will happen, and I think you’ll see that with tariffs as well,” Van Steijnen said. Vessel size trends were also under the microscope in the busy session, with panellists noting how larger vessels are coming to dominate some cargo types with manganese and chrome ore now a common sight on capes. However, port restrictions cap stem sizes. “Shipowners, they have big egos and they always think bigger is better,” quipped Heidelberg’s Vermaat. Smaller vessels remain relevant for “proper shipping” versus commodity trading on larger panamax and above vessels, Van Steijnen argued. The Minor Bulks session will return at the 2026 edition of Geneva Dry scheduled for April 28 and 29."

        "content": "In a significant curtailment of the trade war between the world’s two largest economies, the United States and China have agreed to considerably slash tariffs for the next 90 days. As part of the deal reached in Geneva over the weekend, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both countries would lower their reciprocal tariffs by 115%, meaning the US will lower tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China will reduce duties on US imports to 10%. The measures should kick in by May 14. News on rolling back tariffs moved the global stock market upwards, with S&P 500 futures up by around 3% and the US dollar rallying to a one-month high. “We want more balanced trade, and I think both sides are committed to achieving that,” Scott Bessent, US Treasury secretary, said at a briefing in Geneva on Monday, adding that neither side wants a decoupling. The two sides have been involved in a growing trade battle since early April, when Trump put more tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting reciprocal action from Beijing. While the agreement is only the first step towards a more permanent accord, it does signal a reduction in economic tensions between the two economic titans. In a joint statement, both parties stated that an agreement had been reached to establish a trade consultation mechanism aimed at preventing a tariff war. “These discussions may be conducted alternately in China and the United States, or a third country upon agreement of the Parties. As required, the two sides may conduct working-level consultations on relevant economic and trade issues,” according to the joint statement. Bessent was speaking alongside US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who said, “It’s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to an agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought.” “The US has a massive $1.2trn trade deficit, so the president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we’re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving that national emergency,” Greer added.

The UK previously imposed sanctions against 133 vessels linked to Russian oil trade – more than any other European nation. “We will do everything in our power to destroy (President Vladimir Putin’s) shadow fleet operation, starve his war machine of oil revenues and protect the subsea infrastructure that we rely on for our everyday lives,” Starmer said. In January, the US announced a massive sanctions action covering 183 Russian-controlled and shadow fleet ships, the largest to date."

It served as an accommodation and support unit since November 2024. The firm term of the contract is expected to run until December 2026. The Norwegian firm has additional option wells after that. In its previous update in March, Shelf Drilling stated that its 1981-builtTrident VIIIjackup was mobilised to the United Arab Emirates, where it was supposed to be sold for recycling. Now, the company confirmed that the sale of the rig was completed in April. Several rigs, such as theKey Manhattan,C.E. Thornton,F.G. McClintock,Shelf Drilling Mentor,Shelf Drilling Scepter,Shelf Drilling Victory, and theAdriatic I,have had their contracts amended due to scheduled out-of-service time at one point or another."

        "content": "Dutch owner JR Shipping has set out to return to the shortsea dry cargo sector with two diesel-electric newbuilds to be built at Chowgule Shipbuilding in India. The Harlingen-based group will be adding 8,500 dwt ships with delivery scheduled for the end of June 2027 and the end of February 2028. The newbuildings are part of theeight-ship orderDutch shortsea specialist Boomsma Shipping and Germany’s Leonhardt & Blumberg Shipmanagement placed in late 2023 and in which JR Shipbrokers & Consultants, part of JR Shipping Group, acted as matchmaker and newbuilding broker. JR Shipping, which operates in the container feeder and crew transfer vessel segments, said the move is part of the group’s broader strategy to enhance its fleet and that investment in these new low-emission vessels underscores its “dedication to sustainable practices and its proactive approach to meeting the future demands of maritime logistics”. The vessels developed in cooperation with Dutch designer Conoship will come with optimised diesel-electric propulsion, ready for lifetime expansion and future fuels. They will require 50%–60% less propulsion energy compared to existing tonnage and be prepared for wind-assisted propulsion, carbon capture and emission-free operation on batteries. JR Shipping paused its shortsea dry cargo business in 2019 after selling the last 5,000 dwt vessel in the fleet but has since maintained its ambition to come back to this market. “With extensive knowledge and experience in dry cargo shipping embedded within the organisation, the company is well-equipped to re-enter this market segment,” JR Shipping said, adding that the strategic decision reflects its “vision to become a progressive, all-round shipping group”."

        "content": "Dutch surveyor Fugro has been awarded a contract by the Norwegian Hydrographic Service to support the 2025 MAREANO seabed mapping programme. This sort of programme will use uncrewed surface vessel (USV) technology to acquire the data for the first time in its history, with Fugro deploying its new 18 mBlue EclipseUSV in its commercial debut. This approach aims to lower carbon emissions in seabed mapping. The largest USV in Fugro’s fleet will survey over 675 sq km in the North Sea, with water depths ranging from 90 to 250 m. The USV will be controlled remotely from Fugro’s remote operations centre in Aberdeen. Equipped with advanced high-resolution, high-density multibeam echo sounders and sub-bottom data acquisition systems, the USV will gather comprehensive datasets, including bathymetry, water column data, acoustic backscatter data, and sub-bottom profiler data to understand the seabed’s topography and geology. Fugro has worked previously on the MAREANO programme. Since 2006, it has acquired over 147,000 sq km of data. “The MAREANO programme wants to accelerate the shift towards lower carbon emissions in seabed mapping. Experiences from this year’s seabed mapping with USV technology will give us direction for opportunities in future surveys,” said Helge Welde, chief engineer at the Norwegian Mapping Authority."

As part of the deal reached in Geneva over the weekend, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both countries would lower their reciprocal tariffs by 115%, meaning the US will lower tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China will reduce duties on US imports to 10%. The measures should kick in by May 14. News on rolling back tariffs moved the global stock market upwards, with S&P 500 futures up by around 3% and the US dollar rallying to a one-month high. “We want more balanced trade, and I think both sides are committed to achieving that,” Scott Bessent, US Treasury secretary, said at a briefing in Geneva on Monday, adding that neither side wants a decoupling. The two sides have been involved in a growing trade battle since early April, when Trump put more tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting reciprocal action from Beijing. While the agreement is only the first step towards a more permanent accord, it does signal a reduction in economic tensions between the two economic titans. In a joint statement, both parties stated that an agreement had been reached to establish a trade consultation mechanism aimed at preventing a tariff war. “These discussions may be conducted alternately in China and the United States, or a third country upon agreement of the Parties. As required, the two sides may conduct working-level consultations on relevant economic and trade issues,” according to the joint statement. Bessent was speaking alongside US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who said, “It’s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to an agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought.” “The US has a massive $1.2trn trade deficit, so the president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we’re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving that national emergency,” Greer added.

Formosa 2 is the first offshore wind farm to achieve commercial operation among all projects in Taiwan’s second phase of offshore wind development. Synera is a founding shareholder and developer of Formosa 2 along with Macquarie Asset Management and JERA. In January, Macquarie announced it would be selling its 26% stake in the project to Pine Wind Power, a wholly-owned subsidiary of J&V Energy. JERA and Synera would retain their 49% and 25% stakes, respectively. However, Synera announced that it exercised its right of first refusal, held across all its assets, to acquire the 26% stake in Formosa 2 held by Macquarie. Following the acquisition, Synera holds a majority stake of 51% in the project while JERA holds the remaining 49%. “Synera’s acquisition of an additional stake coincides with the second anniversary of Formosa 2’s commercial operation. The increased ownership allows us to further enhance the wind farm’s performance and governance, and to ensure a stable supply of clean energy that supports Taiwan’s export-oriented industries and strengthens confidence in the long-term, healthy development of the offshore wind sector,” said Lucas Lin, chairman of Synera. The company holds stakes in two operational offshore wind farms, Formosa 1 and Formosa 2, while actively developing Formosa 4 and Formosa 6, all in Taiwan. Beyond its home market, the developer is also expanding its presence in Japan and South Korea. Synera is supported by Stonepeak, a New York-based investment firm specialising in infrastructure and real assets with $72bn in assets under management."

Analysis from Windward, a maritime analytics firm, has highlighted the spoofing patterns that ended up with the ship aground near the Eliza Shoals west of Jeddah, with vessel tracking from MarineTraffic supporting this theory. GPS jamming in the Red Sea has been commonplace in recent years. With GPS spoofing on the rise at multiple locations around the world and cyber attacks proving how easy it is to take control of a ship, a report from by Thetius, CyberOwl and HFW, published last year, entitledThe Great Disconnect, detailed many recent cyber incidents including how theStena Imperotanker’s GPS was spoofed to force it to cross into Iranian waters unintentionally in 2019 with the ship and its crew then held for months. The equipment required for basic GPS attacks costs less than $100, the report warned while adding that with the resources of a nation-state, “a sophisticated spoof on an entire region or sea is not just a possibility, it is a reality”. Windward’s Q1 2025 report indicated that the average distance vessels “jump” to when their AIS is jammed grew dramatically from 600 km in Q4 2024 to 6,300 km in Q1 2025, representing a significant escalation in jamming capability. Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC) has yet to reply to questions sent bySplashyesterday. The 2009-builtMSC Antoniamade headlines last August when it lost a number of containers in bad weather while sailing off South Africa."

The activists claim that the action is part of a larger series of actions over the next 10 days that will focus on the alleged role of Maersk in the climate crisis and Israel’s war crimes. They stated that the actions will take place all over Europe. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said that the protesters are demanding that Maersk take “just and necessary action, whether it concerns the climate collapse or the genocide in Palestine.” The Green Youth Movement also brought with them cleaning products that are used to wash windows, walls and floors, symbolising what the activists said was Maersk’s greenwashing. “Maersk emits more CO2 than all of Denmark combined, and the company still ships oil and gas around the world despite green promises. We demand that Maersk stop their shipments of weapons to Israel, which are used directly in the genocide of the Palestinians, but we also demand that they stop all shipments of oil and gas,” said Green Youth Movement activist Freya Skriver, present at the protest. The Copenhagen Police are also present at the scene. The police said via social media that they were in dialogue with the protesters who are inside the building. They have been asked to leave the location voluntarily in agreement with the owner. At the same time, a larger group has gathered outside another Maersk subsidiary, Maersk Cargo, and is blocking the entrance. This is the second protest in just a few months, as 800 people blocked the headquarters of Maersk in late February. This protest also revolved around demands for Maersk to stop transporting military equipment and weapon parts to Israel. During the February protest, it was claimed that Maersk made 2,100 shipments of weapons and weapon parts to Israel in just the past year. Thunberg, along with 19 other protesters, was arrested as a result. A post shared by Den Grønne Ungdomsbevægelse ( DGUB ) (@dengroenneungdomsbevaegelse)"

        "content": "The 90-day tariff ceasefire between the world’s top two economies could see covid era surges in shipments and box freight rates, one leading analyst has suggested. The US and China have agreed to slash reciprocal tariffs by 115% for the next 90 days. Now the US tariff on China is at 30%, whilst the Chinese tariff on the US has been set at 10%. “This large tariff cut reflects both sides were uneasy about deteriorating global economic conditions – peak trade-tension may be behind us as growth regains political importance,” broker Arrow maintained in a note to clients yesterday. “The volume rebound will coincide with the traditional summer peak season, with freight rates set to surge as a result,” Linerlytica, an Asia-based container shipping consultancy predicted, suggesting the import surge into the US expected over the next three months could exceed the covid-era peaks seen in 2021-2022. Carriers have pre-announced provisional transpacific peak season surcharges of $1,000 to $2,000 per feu that would apply as early as this week that will push rates to the US west coast above $3,500 again. Freight rates on routes outside of the US are also tipped by Linerlytica to benefit as vessel capacity is drawn back to the transpacific. Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta, a freight rate platform, said that with an average transit time of 22 days on the transpacific trade, shippers are likely to maximise this opportunity by moving as much cargo as possible during the 90-day period, creating upward pressure on freight rates. “Q3 is traditionally the peak season for ocean container shipping, but that may arrive earlier in 2025 if there is now a rush to import goods into the US from China,” said Sand. More cautious was Judah Levine, head of research at Freightos, a box booking platform, who predicted rates will rise but not explode. “The volume rebound will probably signal the start of an early peak season that will keep rates elevated – but we might not see last year’s $8,000+ per feu highs due to a more competitive, well-supplied carrier landscape already keeping rates lower year-on-year,” Levine said. “If freight rates spike due to the tariff-induced shipping disruptions — which will take months to unwind — we could see costs and prices creep up even further. What’s needed now is a long-term deal — not just with China but with all our trading partners — so we can predictably make long term trade, investment, and sourcing decisions,” said American Apparel & Footwear Association president and CEO, Steve Lamar. “Given the tighter capacity on the Transpacific, ocean carriers are in the driver’s seat to push freight rates meaningfully higher,” argued Jefferies, an investment bank, in a note to clients. Rodolphe Saadé, CEO of CMA CGM, the world’s third-largest container carrier, hailed the truce in the trade war between Washington and Beijing. “For CMA CGM, it’s good news,” Saadé said during a hearing in the French Senate on Monday. “We’ve lost 50% of our volumes toward the US since the start of this crisis.” Turning away from containers, SEB, a Swedish bank, said the trade agreement between the US and China will likely benefit shipping in general. For LPG, the 10% import tariff on US LPG to China will likely see Chinese buyers re-entering the market, SEB maintained. “Talk of purchase agreements could result in increased US-China grain / oil / gas trades, a positive for shipping,” analysts at Arrow argued."

Since returning to power, Trump has spent plenty of time looking at ways to restrict China’s dominance in the shipbuilding sector, with new US port service fees on China-linked ships set to come into force later this year. Trump’s actions have been seen as a bonus in ongoing trade discussions between South Korea and the US. Another Korean yard major could face pressure from the Trump administration over its links to China.

        "content": "Norwegian energy giant Equinor is considering terminating its 810MW Empire Wind wind farm off Long Island due to the Trump administration putting a halt to the construction of the project. Interior secretary Doug Burgum directed the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management tostop Equinorfrom continuing construction of the project, stating that more time was needed to assess the project’s previous approvals. Some democrats claimed the stoppage of the project would have a “chilling effect” on developers. Even Leslie Beyer, Donald Trump’s nominee for the assistant secretary role in the Department of the Interior, agreed during her confirmation hearing that the order to stop work on the Empire Wind project sent “a dangerous message” as companies needed certainty in the permitting system so they could make financial investment decisions. Burgum accused the prior administration of rushing approvals for Empire Wind “without sufficient analysis or consultation among the relevant agencies as relates to the potential effects from the project”. However, Empire Wind needed years to acquire all permits and the final nod to begin construction. Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables Americas, said that Equinor had already invested over $2.5bn in the project and that the stoppage caused an “urgent, unsustainable situation”, which is costing the company up to $50m per week. Those costs include 11 vessels on standby. She claimed that Equinor would be forced to terminate the project if no progress was made towards a resolution “within days”. Morris warned that the US was making “a dangerous precedent by stopping a project in mid-execution” and that the issue was about honouring contracts and financial investments made in the US. Morris and Equinor CEO Anders Opedal did have a meeting with the director of the US National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, last week to try and resolve the issue. However, the Equinor officials were not able to arrange a meeting with Interior secretary Burgum, who is the man responsible for the issue."

The FSRUHoegh Gandriawill replace the FSRUHoegh Galleon, which was deployed to Egypt in July 2024, on an interim charter from AIE and Höegh Evi. The Galleon will remain in Egypt for up to an additional year before deployment to the LNG terminal in Port Kembla, Australia, in 2027."

Rules are meant to protect the environment, improve safety and support fair labour conditions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other bodies have spent decades creating systems to guide our industry toward higher standards. But despite all this effort, something still feels off. Progress comes way too slowly. Enforcement appears uneven. The playing field unlevel.

Rules that reassure but fail to reform Shipping has many standards, but not all are enforced equally. Some ports have strong oversight and others where the rules are far more relaxed. Ships can sail through some waters without ever facing accountability’s headwinds. Yet, most in the industry still support the idea of regulation. Why? Perhaps it’s because law – at least the appearance of it – offers something useful. It reassures the public that action is being taken.

This creates a quiet system where everyone looks like they’re doing something, without ever disrupting the way things really work in the background. To be clear, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Shared accountability, shared avoidance Much like the nets used at sea, shipping is a complex web in which enforcement is difficult because responsibility is spread out.

Finance, big tech and energy all operate within frameworks that look robust, allow power, innovation and decision-making to flow far from the reach of regulators. In this light, maritime is simply playing the same game – just at sea. As is true in these other industries, all of whom intersect in shipping, the illusion of strong oversight gives helpful cover for the real work to happen in the shadows.

        "content": "We are in danger of forgetting the faces behind our workforce as companies remain heavily focussed on compliance, writes Claudia Paschkewitz, Columbia Group’s director of sustainability and diversity. Regulatory compliance is a crucial aspect of the maritime industry that ensures the safety and efficiencies of crews and vessels. The last five years has seen a significant amount of change within the industry with developments in digitalisation, remote working and training, and the move towards net zero carbon emissions. The role of regulations is not to be underestimated. They serve as a strong foundation for safety and sustainability and mean that organisations avoid any legal issues that may arise if followed correctly. From the latest International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations, such as SOLAS, to the European Commission, these regulations are crucial for ensuring that the industry adapts to the challenges of an ever-changing world. While these developments are necessary, they are only effective if designed with the people who follow them in mind. Unfortunately, it seems the industry is in danger of becoming too fixated on regulations and compliance that it could lose sight of the individuals most impacted by them. Every policy ultimately relies on the people who are required to understand, apply, and follow the guidelines. Crew members and other maritime professionals are expected to ensure compliance. However, as the industry tightens regulations it risks distancing itself even further from its intended goals. What seems simple on paper can end up placing a heavy burden on those required to enforce it. Without proper instruction or support, regulations can feel complex and burdensome foe those having carry them out. Crews on the front line often feel like they have been designed without their input or consideration, leaving them feeling frustrated and overworked. It is important that regulations support and motivate people, rather than just adding pressure. At Columbia Group, we embed regulatory changes into our operations through proactive crew engagement, continuous training, and open reporting systems—ensuring that compliance is not just enforced, but understood, supported, and human-focused. This is not to say that regulations should be disregarded. On the contrary, they are essential for the industry’s long-term success and, ultimately, the planet. These regulations must be shaped in a way that makes them accessible and manageable for those who are directly impacted. Training and guidance is essential in ensuring maritime professionals are equipped to meet these new standards safely and effectively. The Omnibus CSRD decision is a prime example of how regulations should and can evolve. While the incentive was to enhance transparency and ensure companies are held accountable for their environmental impact, it has faced criticism for creating additional burdens on smaller businesses. If a rule is making things harder instead of helping, it should be reviewed and improved. This way, regulations stay useful and practical for the people they affect while still achieving their purpose. The success of a policy ultimately depends on the extent to which it is executed. We must find a balance between striving for full compliance and considering how realistic and achievable that is for those who are expected to follow it. We should also be willing to change regulations if they turn out to be more of a barrier than a help. The Omnibus CSRD decision is a good example of how regulations need to adapt. If a rule is making things harder instead of helping, it should be reviewed and improved. This way, regulations stay useful and practical for the people they affect while still achieving their purpose."

Analysis from Windward, a maritime analytics firm, has highlighted the spoofing patterns that ended up with the ship aground near the Eliza Shoals west of Jeddah, with vessel tracking from MarineTraffic supporting this theory. GPS jamming in the Red Sea has been commonplace in recent years. With GPS spoofing on the rise at multiple locations around the world and cyber attacks proving how easy it is to take control of a ship, a report from by Thetius, CyberOwl and HFW, published last year, entitledThe Great Disconnect, detailed many recent cyber incidents including how theStena Imperotanker’s GPS was spoofed to force it to cross into Iranian waters unintentionally in 2019 with the ship and its crew then held for months. The equipment required for basic GPS attacks costs less than $100, the report warned while adding that with the resources of a nation-state, “a sophisticated spoof on an entire region or sea is not just a possibility, it is a reality”. Windward’s Q1 2025 report indicated that the average distance vessels “jump” to when their AIS is jammed grew dramatically from 600 km in Q4 2024 to 6,300 km in Q1 2025, representing a significant escalation in jamming capability. Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC) has yet to reply to questions sent bySplashyesterday. The 2009-builtMSC Antoniamade headlines last August when it lost a number of containers in bad weather while sailing off South Africa."

Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin said that more than RUB500bn ($6.2bn) in federal funding will be spent over the next six years to support shipbuilders, component manufacturers and shipowners. He noted that against the backdrop of foreign sanctions and restrictions, the renewal and expansion of the Russian fleet is of key importance for building logistics routes to friendly countries, cargo transportation along the Northern Sea Route and the development of river tourism. Priority will be given to vessels for the Northern Sea Route and the North-South transport corridor, with a focus on developing capabilities for large-capacity projects, including crude oil tankers, gas carriers, shuttle tankers and bulk carriers, the government said. The newbuilding programme will also cover icebreakers, support vessels and maintenance ships, as well as the renewal of the passenger and fishing fleets. The baseline scenario foresees 1,637 vessels will be built in Russia by 2036, of which 713 within the next five years. More than 120 ships are envisioned for regular sea transport and another 51 for the Northern Sea Route. The country’s long-term strategy, which stretches to 2050, anticipates fleet expansion by more than 2,600 additional ships from 2037, including over 200 sea transport vessels and nearly 90 Northern Sea Route-dedicated units. Russian first deputy prime minister Denis Manturov said that the scheme includes large-scale modernisation and efforts to eliminate the shortage of shipbuilding capacity, including establishing new shipyards, replacing foreign shipboard equipment with domestic alternatives and developing ship repair centres. To implement the plan Russian government said it would also need to increase the workforce by at least 15% by 2036, to around 190,000 people, and also work towards attracting new talent to design and development centres and push forward with automation and digitalisation at the shipyards to boost labour productivity and gradually transition to large-block shipbuilding."

Pierre-Francois Mahieu, a global wheat trader with Olam, told delegates he was expecting a recovery in grains demand for the next 12 months, with Costas Delaportas, president and CEO of DryDel Shipping, also forecasting “moderate growth”, while Ghigo Ravano, executive chairman of IFCHOR GALBRAITHS, predicted there will be increased congestion. “The Chinese are stepping away from the US Gulf. Most of the cargo of grains is coming from the east coast of South America, Brazil and Argentina,” Delaportas said at the session on April 29, some two weeks before the US and China found some trade agreement. Congestion out of these two South American nations has more than doubled in the space of a month in terms of waiting time days. The Greek shipowner also discussed how the Chinese have been building up their own grain facilities a lot of late. Other exporting grain countries, such as India and Black Sea countries, have reduced dramatically their exports of grains, Delaportas relayed, leading to Southeast Asian nations sourcing from elsewhere, something he said was positive for tonne-miles. Alex Haubert, director of Hong Glory Bulk, noted how the market had become far more spot-orientated. “There is less forward commitments from end users to buy,” he said, noting there was more freight risk sitting on the traders as a result. Olam’s Mahieu said the market had been “very efficient” to switch Chinese supply from the US to Brazil, as had American sellers in finding alternative destinations, all of which was proving positive from a tonne-mile perspective. “It’s a very dynamic market, very uncertain and very hard to hedge,” Mahieu said. The ageing dry bulk fleet was also discussed as were expanding ports and secondhand prices, with Delaportas arguing that following a recent 20% drop in prices, now was a good time to buy vessels. Geneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference, returns on April 28 and 29 next year, with delegate passes being limited.Tickets are now on sale here."

The activists claim that the action is part of a larger series of actions over the next 10 days that will focus on the alleged role of Maersk in the climate crisis and Israel’s war crimes. They stated that the actions will take place all over Europe. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said that the protesters are demanding that Maersk take “just and necessary action, whether it concerns the climate collapse or the genocide in Palestine.” The Green Youth Movement also brought with them cleaning products that are used to wash windows, walls and floors, symbolising what the activists said was Maersk’s greenwashing. “Maersk emits more CO2 than all of Denmark combined, and the company still ships oil and gas around the world despite green promises. We demand that Maersk stop their shipments of weapons to Israel, which are used directly in the genocide of the Palestinians, but we also demand that they stop all shipments of oil and gas,” said Green Youth Movement activist Freya Skriver, present at the protest. The Copenhagen Police are also present at the scene. The police said via social media that they were in dialogue with the protesters who are inside the building. They have been asked to leave the location voluntarily in agreement with the owner. At the same time, a larger group has gathered outside another Maersk subsidiary, Maersk Cargo, and is blocking the entrance. This is the second protest in just a few months, as 800 people blocked the headquarters of Maersk in late February. This protest also revolved around demands for Maersk to stop transporting military equipment and weapon parts to Israel. During the February protest, it was claimed that Maersk made 2,100 shipments of weapons and weapon parts to Israel in just the past year. Thunberg, along with 19 other protesters, was arrested as a result. A post shared by Den Grønne Ungdomsbevægelse ( DGUB ) (@dengroenneungdomsbevaegelse)"

The Treasury also targeted a VLCC calledBaluand an LR1 product tanker calledRoc, which officials accused of being used by Sepehr Energy official Elyas Niroomand Toomaj, who was previously sanctioned to facilitate shipments of Iranian oil to China. “Today’s action underscores our continued focus on intensifying pressure on every aspect of Iran’s oil trade, which the regime uses to fund its dangerous and destabilising activities,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “The United States will continue targeting this primary source of revenue, so long as the regime continues its support for terrorism and proliferation of deadly weapons.” The sanctions follow similar designations in recent weeks, at the same time as Washington and Tehran have stepped up nuclear talks."

The Jan Rindbo-led owner and operator said that these recent additions to the fleet reinforce its commitment to building a core MPP fleet and growing its presence in the project cargo market, which benefits from a strong projected demand outlook coupled with a rapidly ageing fleet and low orderbook. Since entering the segment in 2023, Norden has expanded to around 50 vessels, transporting windmill components, industrial equipment, and break-bulk cargo.

Rabab Raafat Boulos, chief operating officer at A.P. Moller – Maersk, said: “We are excited to receive the first e-methanol from the Kassø facility, marking an important milestone in our global efforts to source alternative fuels for our vessel fleet. The future of shipping must include multiple fuel types operating alongside each other, with methanol playing a key role in the industry’s net-zero ambitions.” TheLaura Maersk, the Danish’s owner’s first methanol dual-fuelled ship, is taking fuel from the new plant this week."

        "content": "Egypt’s Suez Canal will offer a 15% discount for the next three months on transit fees for containerships of approximately 13,500 teu and above in terms of capacity, to encourage trade back, with recent headlines suggesting the Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to a close. The Suez Canal Authority said the offer was in “response to requests from containership owners and operators, and in light of recent positive developments in the security situation in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait”. Revenues from Suez Canal transits have more than halved over the past year as a huge swathe of the global merchant fleet – led by containerships – avoided the area as the Houthis from Yemen, in support of Hamas’s war with Israel, have been attacking merchant shipping. Donald Trump, the American president, claimed last week that after more than 17 months, the Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to a close. Speaking at the White House, Trump said Yemen’s Houthis have agreed to halt their attacks on shipping and that Washington would in turn stop carrying out strikes on the Iran-backed rebels. Trump’s claims have been backed up by Oman’s foreign minister, who has been negotiating between the two sides. However, the Houthis have since continued to fire missiles towards Israel, eliciting a military response from Tel Aviv. Most liners questioned at recent quarterly results have insisted it is still too early for any resumption of Red Sea transits. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc said last week it would be “irresponsible” to resume Red Sea transits based on an unclear ceasefire deal, warning the region remains too volatile for a safe return. Speaking withSplashtoday, Lars Jensen, who heads up Vespucci Maritime, a container shipping advisory, said: “I would not think a 15% discount would have any meaningful impact on the decision on whether or not to transit the Red Sea under the present circumstances. That decision will be based on a risk assessment.” “Given the fast-changing news flow in the current climate, we do not expect a rush to return to normal Red Sea transits given the risks,” shipping analysts at investment bank Jefferies argued in a note to clients last week, pointing out how the container shipping industry remains the most exposed to a change in market fundamentals should Red Sea transits resume normally. Jefferies estimates the effect of diversions has tightened capacity by 11-12% and is effectively the difference between a healthy market and one with limited ocean carrier pricing power."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "The future of coal was one of the dominant topics crystal balled at this year’s Geneva Dry conference, with some panellists believing that last year saw the peak in seaborne trades. The panel, led by Benjamin Wilkes, chief operating officer of d’Amico’s dry cargo division, opened with coal’s largest importer, China, and discussed where the volumes are heading. Peter Weernink, chairman of dry bulk operator SwissMarine, told delegates that volumes are declining and that he thinks they will very likely continue to decline. “The market is weak. Anything you read about the Chinese market suggests there’s no pool for coal imports,” he said. For Stamatis Tsantanis, chairman and CEO of capesize owners Seanergy and Union Maritime, it’s all about energy security, and the reason for increased imports in China was backed by the need to feed its power production plants. “If you remember, everything has been revised a number of times about coal and imports of coal, and there are so many things going on in the world, but most importantly outside of the SDG agenda, and we have to think about energy security, and in the world of tomorrow, I think energy security is paramount.” William Fairclough, the managing director of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport, agreed with Tsantanis that national security is at the heart of the discussion. “I think what we’ve seen is a fundamental shift in the balance of power between decarbonisation on the one hand and national security on the other hand,” he said, noting that last year China approved and started construction of more coal-fired power stations than at any point in the last 10 years. This additional coal capacity is, however, seen as a safety net for China as it invests and relies more on renewable energy. “That capacity is there for a rainy day,” Fairclough argued, reminding that the real question one should be asking is how many rainy days there are going to be between now and 2030. Asked if China is going to try and maintain a certain amount of import volume, Jason Martinet, ex-head of dry freight at Montfort Trading, said it is very much subject to how much it will outperform on the renewable front, as it has in the last five years. “Do I think that the share of coal in their energy mix is going to move? That’s anyone’s guess,” he mused. Turning the discussion to India, Tsantanis argued imports would continue at pace, with industrial production moving into the country and out of China and projected steel production growth needed for infrastructure projects. “I don’t see India slowing down their coal imports, whether that’s metallurgical coal or thermal coal, anytime soon,” he said. Weernink maintained his view on falling coal imports for India as well, noting that “there’s just a lot of coal around in India and in China and it is difficult to place anything.” Concerns were also raised about the deteriorating Atlantic coal trade since Colombian miners were cutting back on production, and a decrease in US activity was anticipated. Overall, energy security was cited as a main driver for continued imports, with Tsantanis advocating that Europe and the rest of the world should not be relying so much on renewables, at least for the vast majority of their energy needs. “We really need to be stocked, up to a point, to undertake the future demands of energy,” he said. For Fairclough, there will be fluctuations based on how many ‘rainy days’. “I think the key for me is that the capacity is there; that could be a reactive thing to an external event, and we’ve seen a few of those.” Speaking from the audience, Guillaume Perret, the founder and director of consultancy Perret Associates, noted that in terms of demand, coal has yet to peak, and the big question is whether the Chinese and Indian coal production can follow this demand and whether that will potentially trigger an increase or a decrease in seaborne flows. Geneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference, returns on April 28 and 29 next year, with delegate passes being limited.Tickets are now on sale here."

The activists claim that the action is part of a larger series of actions over the next 10 days that will focus on the alleged role of Maersk in the climate crisis and Israel’s war crimes. They stated that the actions will take place all over Europe. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said that the protesters are demanding that Maersk take “just and necessary action, whether it concerns the climate collapse or the genocide in Palestine.” The Green Youth Movement also brought with them cleaning products that are used to wash windows, walls and floors, symbolising what the activists said was Maersk’s greenwashing. “Maersk emits more CO2 than all of Denmark combined, and the company still ships oil and gas around the world despite green promises. We demand that Maersk stop their shipments of weapons to Israel, which are used directly in the genocide of the Palestinians, but we also demand that they stop all shipments of oil and gas,” said Green Youth Movement activist Freya Skriver, present at the protest. The Copenhagen Police are also present at the scene. The police said via social media that they were in dialogue with the protesters who are inside the building. They have been asked to leave the location voluntarily in agreement with the owner. At the same time, a larger group has gathered outside another Maersk subsidiary, Maersk Cargo, and is blocking the entrance. This is the second protest in just a few months, as 800 people blocked the headquarters of Maersk in late February. This protest also revolved around demands for Maersk to stop transporting military equipment and weapon parts to Israel. During the February protest, it was claimed that Maersk made 2,100 shipments of weapons and weapon parts to Israel in just the past year. Thunberg, along with 19 other protesters, was arrested as a result. A post shared by Den Grønne Ungdomsbevægelse ( DGUB ) (@dengroenneungdomsbevaegelse)"

        "content": "Russia is stepping up the development and renewal of its fleet with plans to add more than 1,600 domestically built ships by 2036. Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin said that more than RUB500bn ($6.2bn) in federal funding will be spent over the next six years to support shipbuilders, component manufacturers and shipowners. He noted that against the backdrop of foreign sanctions and restrictions, the renewal and expansion of the Russian fleet is of key importance for building logistics routes to friendly countries, cargo transportation along the Northern Sea Route and the development of river tourism. Priority will be given to vessels for the Northern Sea Route and the North-South transport corridor, with a focus on developing capabilities for large-capacity projects, including crude oil tankers, gas carriers, shuttle tankers and bulk carriers, the government said. The newbuilding programme will also cover icebreakers, support vessels and maintenance ships, as well as the renewal of the passenger and fishing fleets. The baseline scenario foresees 1,637 vessels will be built in Russia by 2036, of which 713 within the next five years. More than 120 ships are envisioned for regular sea transport and another 51 for the Northern Sea Route. The country’s long-term strategy, which stretches to 2050, anticipates fleet expansion by more than 2,600 additional ships from 2037, including over 200 sea transport vessels and nearly 90 Northern Sea Route-dedicated units. Russian first deputy prime minister Denis Manturov said that the scheme includes large-scale modernisation and efforts to eliminate the shortage of shipbuilding capacity, including establishing new shipyards, replacing foreign shipboard equipment with domestic alternatives and developing ship repair centres. To implement the plan Russian government said it would also need to increase the workforce by at least 15% by 2036, to around 190,000 people, and also work towards attracting new talent to design and development centres and push forward with automation and digitalisation at the shipyards to boost labour productivity and gradually transition to large-block shipbuilding."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Martin Hedman, director of mental wellness practices at VIKAND, writes for Splash today. The issue of burnout among seafarers has often been pigeonholed into a narrow focus on mental health, yet the reality on the high seas is far more complex. Recent findings from VIKAND, which show a significant rise in psychological assessments among crew members, provide a crucial starting point for a broader discussion. Burnout in this uniquely demanding environment stems from a confluence of factors that extend well beyond mere mental exhaustion, encompassing physical health, environmental stressors, and the very nature of maritime work. Burnout in seafarers, deeply intertwined with mental health, arises from chronic stress and manifests as emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion. The isolated and demanding maritime environment exacerbates this condition, as constant high demands erode seafarers’ enthusiasm and satisfaction. Preventing burnout requires addressing mental health proactively through access to psychological support, fostering a supportive onboard community, and ensuring regular mental health evaluations. Effective interventions not only enhance seafarers’ wellbeing but also contribute to the safety and productivity of maritime operations. Physical exhaustion cannot be overlooked when discussing burnout. The physical demands of maritime jobs — from handling heavy equipment to maintaining extensive machinery—can be overwhelming. Coupled with irregular shifts and extended periods at sea, the physical toll on seafarers is immense. Without adequate rest, nutritious food, and physical downtime, the body wears down, and burnout becomes inevitable. The environment in which seafarers operate is fraught with stressors that go unnoticed on land. Constant motion, noise from engines and machinery, vibrations, and the lack of natural light contribute to a sensory burden that can sap energy and diminish the spirit. These factors, when not managed properly, heavily contribute to burnout by creating an oppressive working environment. Organisational factors play a significant role in causing burnout. Inflexible hierarchies and rigid command structures can stifle communication and leave little room for personal initiative or decision-making. For crew members, this can translate into a workplace that feels more confining and can escalate stress levels, contributing further to burnout. Addressing burnout effectively requires a multifaceted approach. First, acknowledging the physical demands and providing practical solutions such as improved shift scheduling, better quality of sleep accommodations, and enhanced meal quality can make substantial differences. Reducing environmental stressors through better ship design — quieter engines, more comfortable living quarters, and access to leisure activities can improve the overall working conditions. The isolation experienced during long voyages can also compound feelings of burnout. Implementing programmes that enhance social connectivity on board is crucial. Activities such as organised social events, communal leisure areas, and improved internet access allow crew members to maintain contact with family and friends, as well as bond with their colleagues. This social support is vital for mental health and can significantly reduce the sense of isolation and burnout. Enhancing a sense of control can be achieved through ensuring that seafarers are involved in decision-making processes related to their work and living conditions. This not only improves morale but also empowers crew members, reducing feelings of helplessness and burnout. The maritime industry needs to adopt proactive measures to monitor and address signs of burnout early. Regular survey and feedback mechanisms can help identify potential issues before they escalate. Embedding mental health professionals and counsellors within the crew, whether physically on long voyages or via telehealth platforms, can provide ongoing support and intervention. Ultimately, tackling burnout in the maritime industry requires us to look beyond the conventional mental health paradigm and address the broader spectrum of influences that impact a seafarer’s life. Employers, and the entire maritime community, need to adopt a more holistic approach to worker well-being. This includes not just better mental health support but a robust reassessment of how we can make life at sea safer, healthier, and more fulfilling for those who keep our global trade moving."

        "content": "Some heavy-hitters were on stage for the final session of this year’s Geneva Dry summit, the iron ore panel moderated by Tim Huxley, the CEO of Mandarin Shipping, who kicked proceedings off by asking panellists if there had ever been a more difficult time to form a market view. “We’re always swimming in uncertainty in the capesize market,” replied John Michael Radziwill, the chairman of CTM. The panel went on to discuss how China was moving away from low Fe grade iron ore at home and Australia, with a lot of emphasis being placed on the Simandou iron ore mine that is due to start exports from Guinea towards the end of this year. Whatever you sell now, you can’t replace “In the next five to 10 years, China will basically reduce their internal production and concentrate on higher grades,” explained Pierre Morel, vice president of market intelligence and data modelling at AXSMarine. “The Chinese have already said that they want to decarbonise and especially the steel industry so they are substituting for better iron ore and better Fe,” said Milena Pappas, commercial director at Star Bulk and head of Oceanbulk Maritime.Turning to the supply side, moderator Huxley noted the “manageable” newbuilding supply with all the ships ordered in the pre-financial crisis years now hitting their third special survey. “Are we going to see a supply crunch, and is there going to be a rush of new orders?” he asked. To Huxley’s point about the swathe of 15-year-old capes, CTM’s Radziwill pointed out that in 2025 there will be about 13,000 days of cape drydockings for this age bracket, which equates to around 33 capes, while there are 36 cape newbuilds due to enter the market. “You could even see a shortage, a shrinking of the fleet without scrapping, which I think is very encouraging,” Radziwill said. The capesize market has a total orderbook of 8%, according to Pappas who focused on the waiting time owners will face if they want to order a ship today. With available yard delivery slots in 2028, owners face markets, regulation and fuel uncertainty as well as very high newbuild prices – all deterrents to order, Pappas argued, a point of view picked up by Lars-Christian Svensen, the CEO of 2020 Bulkers and Himalaya Shipping, who was grateful for container liners hogging so much of the newbuilding limelight this decade. “The fact of the matter is that there are 50% less shipyards available to build [capesizes] now than it was 10 to 15 years ago,” Svensen said. Turning to secondhand prices, Radziwill, who confided he is more of a buyer of capes than a seller at the moment, he still maintained that values will hold. “Whatever you sell now, you can’t replace,” Pappas pointed out, reminding delegates that earliest, pricey delivery slots from yards are three years out, with the panel digesting recent news of a 20-year-old cape changing hands for a “historically high” $22m. With supply tight, AXS’s Morel suggested that if cape rates spike, then ships will inevitably speed up, killing off the green argument for slow steaming. “So manage greed, not consumption,” quipped Huxley with Radziwill, a champion of slow steaming for years, then urging the International Maritime Organization to enforce speed limits. Geneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference, returns on April 28 and 29 next year, with delegate passes being limited.Tickets are now on sale here."

With this loan, the company can partly finance its 20% participation in the GranMorgu project in Suriname’s offshore block 58. The new loan will also be used to fully repay the outstanding bank loan of $130m. The Surinamese firm said it would exercise its option to enter the project with up to 20% interest following TotalEnergies announcing its final investment decision. According to the company, the full financing of its stake in the project will require an estimated $2.4bn. In addition to the bank loan, the financing needed for the GranMorgu stake will include cash, cash flow from the business, and the proceeds from the bonds issued in March 2025. The GranMorgu project is located 150 km off the coast of Suriname and is the first oil and gas development off the country’s shores. SBM Offshore has already been awarded contracts for the project in November last year. Under these contracts, the company, in partnership with Technip Energies, will construct and install an FPSO. The award follows completion of FEED studies. TechnipFMC and Saipem then won contracts worth billions for the same project. TechnipFMC’s contracted scope for the project includes subsea tree systems, manifolds, connectors, and topside control equipment. The company will also supply umbilicals, flexible jumpers, and flexible risers. As for Saipem, its scope of work entails the engineering, procurement, supply, construction, installation, pre-commissioning, and assistance for the commissioning and start-up of the SURF package."

The five tender winners were originally announced in August 2024 with a total of 2.7GW in offshore wind capacity. They include Synera Renewable Energy’s 800MW Formosa 6, Shinfox’s 700MW Youde, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners’ 600MW Fengmiao 2, Corio and TotalEnergies’ 360MW Formosa 3, and Enervest’s 240MW Deshuai projects. Grid connection for the round 3.2 projects is expected between 2028 and 2030. The Ministry said that it will now start the review process for the projects in accordance with relevant regulations. Those developers who fail to meet requirements and sign the contract will have their wind farm qualification and capacity revoked. The site space and capacity will be included in a future tenders. If the projects are approved, they will be commissioned and connected to the grid between 2028 and 2030. Taiwan’s goal is to reach 5.7GW of offshore wind capacity by the end of 2025. The offshore wind target was extended in 2019 to 10GW between 2026 and 2035, and again in 2021 to 15GW by 2035. At the end of 2024, offshore wind capacity totalled 2.5GW."

        "content": "Liner executives are reporting a dramatic pick-up in box bookings between China and the US this week as a 90-day mini-reprieve in the tariff war between the world’s two largest economies gets underway. The busier liner bookings have yet to translate into an immediate rate surge, but analysts are confident carriers will make strong profits this summer. Starting yesterday, cargo leaving China bound for the United States will carry a 30% tariff rate – a reduction from the higher 145% tariff that was in place for six weeks. The United States and China announced a dramatic de-escalation in tariffs on Monday, lowering cripplingly high rates for 90 days. Experts say retailers will likely frontload more cargo during the pause, working against the clock to bring in inventory before things change again. Yesterday, Hapag-Lloyd management highlighted that China-US bookings this week have jumped by more than 50% compared to what had been seen during the prior four weeks, and they are up “double-digit percentages” relative to what was seen prior to the aggressive tariffs that were put in place in early April. Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta, a freight rate platform, told Splash today there had been a 2% lift in transpacific freight rates this week, and a very noticeable reduction in blank sailings by carriers. Sources tell Splash also that carriers are seeking extra loaders to move the bumper amount of cargo, presaging an early start to peak season. Sand said he expects transpacific rates to climb by 20% rise over the coming month. “Rates are up a couple hundred dollars but carriers are pushing for larger increases for June,” commented Hua Joo Tan, co-founder of Linerlytica, an Asia-based container shipping consultancy. “Already freight rates had been better supported as liners adjusted capacity, with Asia-USWC spot rates bottoming in March at just below $2,000/feu, rising to $2,500/feu coming into this week and are now quoted at above $3,000/feu,” Jefferies, an investment bank, noted in an update yesterday. “While we expect carriers to reactivate capacity and deploy bigger ships in the transpacific, we note that repositioning boxes and vessels following the recent steep capacity withdrawals could take time,” HSBC stated in a new container report issued today, warning of the potential for bunching of ship calls causing port congestions and bottlenecks on the landside logistics, similar to what was witnessed during the covid pandemic. HSBC is expecting rate increases scheduled for mid-May and early June to stick, noting how the share prices of global liners have now surpassed the pre ‘Liberation Day’ levels reflecting to some extent the much improved outlook. “If demand does pick up sharply, shippers may face a period of tight capacity and equipment shortages as volumes rebound and vessels and containers are still being moved back into place. The quick restart could also mean a big bump in the number of vessels and container volumes arriving at US ports in a few weeks,” Freightos, a box booking platform, suggested in a market update."

        "content": "The UK is not on track to meet its Clean Power 2030 target of between 43 and 51GW of offshore wind capacity, so the upcoming allocation round needs to be the most ambitious auction round yet. In its 2025 Offshore Wind Insight, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said the country would fall short of meeting its ambitious offshore wind target. In the report, OEUK stated that unless the pace quickens, the UK stands to achieve only 35GW by 2030. This means, according to the report, that the UK needs to secure 8.4GW of new offshore wind capacity in the upcoming AR7 round if the UK is to stay on course for hitting its desired targets. That big of a number will make AR7 the biggest in history. OEUK also noted that offshore wind is becoming more challenging with cost inflation and rising costs, as was shown by the halt of the Hornsea 4 wind farm last week. This puts more pressure on the delivery of Clean Power 2030 targets. Apart from offshore wind power, the UK must also develop 27-29GW of onshore wind and 45-47GW of solar power to meet all targets. “Meeting the government’s 2030 target of 43 and 51 GW of installed offshore wind capacity means securing £15bn of private investment in offshore wind every year between now and 2030. The government’s next Contract for Difference auction in AR7, which incentivises new low carbon electricity generating projects, will need to secure historic levels of renewable energy procurement,” said Thibaut Cheret, OEUK’s wind and renewables manager. Wind power remains a key component of the UK’s energy system. Its share of the UK’s electricity amounted to 29.5% in 2024. Of that, offshore wind contributed 17.2% of total electricity generation. Another challenge is the massive price tag of £58bn for rebuilding the National Grid electricity transmission system to support 50GW of offshore wind."

        "content": "Germany has approved its first facility dedicated to the dismantling and recycling of large ships. This facility, operated by EWD Benli Recycling, is located in Emden on the site of the parent company Emder Werft und Dock (EWD). The company has secured the necessary governmental permits that classify it as a specialised waste management business, following the approval process, which took about one year. “We immediately received the first enquiries, which we still had to turn down due to the ongoing approval phase,” remarked Björn Sommer, one of the two managing directors. EWD Benli Recycling said it aims to focus primarily on the dismantling of seagoing vessels, inland waterway vessels, coasters, passenger ships and ferries, but also wind turbines and industrial plants. The yard, established in 1903 as Nordseewerke – Emder Werft und Dock, currently employs 150 workers and features two floating docks, a dry dock, and nearly 2km of quay facilities. “In principle, we will be able to dismantle anything that can enter the port of Emden through the sea lock,” said Sommer. This initiative comes as a response to the current practices in the industry, where many decommissioned ships are sent to South Asia. According to the German Shipowners’ Association, roughly 700 ships are scrapped each year, with most of them ending up at breakers in Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, where safety and environmental protection concerns have been raised for many years. The launch of the first shipbreaking operation in Germany also comes ahead of the Hong Kong Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships entering into force in June. The convention calls for shipbreaking yards to be comprehensively certified for occupational safety and environmental protection by the independent classification societies. Since late 2018, the EU Ship Recycling Regulation has required all large seagoing vessels sailing under an EU member state flag to use an approved yard included in the European List of ship recycling facilities. The most recently updated list contains 43 facilities, comprising 31 in Europe, 11 in Turkey, and one in the US."

Analysis from Windward, a maritime analytics firm, has highlighted the spoofing patterns that ended up with the ship aground near the Eliza Shoals west of Jeddah, with vessel tracking from MarineTraffic supporting this theory. GPS jamming in the Red Sea has been commonplace in recent years. With GPS spoofing on the rise at multiple locations around the world and cyber attacks proving how easy it is to take control of a ship, a report from by Thetius, CyberOwl and HFW, published last year, entitledThe Great Disconnect, detailed many recent cyber incidents including how theStena Imperotanker’s GPS was spoofed to force it to cross into Iranian waters unintentionally in 2019 with the ship and its crew then held for months. The equipment required for basic GPS attacks costs less than $100, the report warned while adding that with the resources of a nation-state, “a sophisticated spoof on an entire region or sea is not just a possibility, it is a reality”. Windward’s Q1 2025 report indicated that the average distance vessels “jump” to when their AIS is jammed grew dramatically from 600 km in Q4 2024 to 6,300 km in Q1 2025, representing a significant escalation in jamming capability.

The world’s largest car carrier in terms of capacity set sail on its maiden voyage to Europe from Shanghai on Thursday evening with around 7,000 Chinese-made vehicles. This surpassed a record set in the last week of April, when the 9,200 ceuBYD Shenzhenleft a yard in China on its maiden voyage to Brazil. The BYD-owned vessel took the title from the Höegh Autoliners’ Aurora class series by 100 cars in terms of capacity. The new world record holder, theAnji Ansheng,measures 228 m in length and 37.8 m in width, slightly longer than the 219 m long BYD Shenzhen. The avalanche of newbuilds coming out of China comes at a time when analysts are turning bearish on the trade. A recent report from Veson Nautical predicts a scenario of negative car-mile growth through 2026 and 2027. By contrast, the company believes that supply growth is expected to be in positive double-digit territory over the same period, suggesting an accelerated correction in both time charter rates and asset values, with levels likely reverting towards long-term historical averages. However, Veson forecasts that this will be followed by a major scrapping phase reminiscent of 2009."

Despite the availability of digital alternatives for years, eBL adoption has remained constrained by platform fragmentation. The industry’s digital transformation has been hindered by siloed eBL platforms requiring all transaction participants to use the same solution provider. This approach has prevented the widespread adoption needed to capture the estimated $6.5bn in direct cost savings and $40bn in increased trade that eBLs can deliver, according to McKinsey & Company research. This successful interoperable eBL transaction represents a breakthrough in addressing these challenges, powered by DCSA’s interoperability framework. Commenting on the successful transaction, John Kim, senior manager of digital at HMM, said: “It was an incredible experience to participate in this interoperability pilot as a carrier and see eBL being sent to our shipper, Suzano, on two different platforms in real time.” “This achievement shows how collaboration can unlock real value and drive efficiencies across the supply chain,” remarked Targe Bock, COO Suzano Europe. Bojan Čekrlić, CEO of CargoX, said: “Global trade needs multiple parties to work, and the digitalisation of trade needs those parties to share data and documentation easily. Concerns around what is truly interoperable and what changes must be made to existing systems have held back adoption of innovations such as eBL. With interoperable eBL, we’ve overcome that obstacle.” More eBL transactions are coming up. Enigio and CargoX are preparing an interoperable transaction with HMM and a Fortune 500 shipper in Q2. WaveBL and TradeGo are preparing their first interoperable transaction with DCSA member-carrier ONE and a large freight forwarder."

Even its supporters agree that the foundations of the STCW Convention are being tested and there is growing consensus that improvements are needed for it to best serve the industry in the age of digitalisation and new fuels. This year’s Singapore Maritime Week heard a number of industry leaders call for a revision that would make it fit for purpose in the next decade and beyond. The scale of the training challenge is also vast. A coalition of the International Transport Workers Federation, IMO, International Chamber of Shipping and International Labour Organization and the UN Global Compact has previously estimated that over 800,000 seafarers from the current cohort would need to be upskilled to prepare for transitions in technology and energy. New seafarer skills are needed but so too is the flexibility to move between roles across a fleet and to shore. Recruiting and retaining skills within in an industry sector is not unique to shipping, but it is keenly felt when expectations are changing so rapidly. Meeting the challenge The problem is clear, what isn’t yet is how we solve it. However it makes no sense to pursue excellence in isolation and fail to recognise that we should train seafarers just like workers in healthcare or aviation. Somehow, this enhanced training requirement needs to be fulfilled alongside mandatory certification requirements. And let’s be clear, to maintain safety and quality, we need to make that investment at speed and scale. A 2020 survey for Nautilus International found that seafarers are increasingly self-funding their training, spending between 10%-20% of their income on training with investment specifically in certification and training related to new technologies and decarbonisation efforts. The Seafarers’ Happiness Index Q4 2024 report noted a sharp division between the experience of those onboard ship. While many appreciated the quality of the instruction received, there was widespread concern that the volume of training was excessive, and risked disrupting rest time. Junior personnel noted a lack of hands-on experience, feeling that online training formats were insufficiently engaging and did not adequately prepare them for real-world applications. This situation appears to have led to increased fatigue and frustration, further contributing to the decline in overall satisfaction. The industry must look to adopt best practices in the maritime space that foster and retain skills and in the process support better health and wellbeing as well as safety. We need to give seafarers time and space to learn and build confidence. This happens over time and with continued exposure. The next generation of simulation technology need to become the norm and not the exception for the maritime industry. Delivery also needs to improve. With technology available today, not all the time needs to be at a physical simulator. It is possible to create any environment and situation virtually. The seafarer just needs a desk, a computer and the internet and they can try, fail in a safe environment, learn, and try again. Learning together It seems obvious that the industry needs to work together to truly solve the problem. Owners, operators, class societies, OEMs and other leaders can all benefit by forming alliances to tackle the problem. Nonetheless it remains true. This way it will be possible to share non-sensitive information on what happens in an emergency, create realistic preparedness and build response scenarios from root cause analysis. The models we can build can be used to train colleagues together, in the classroom using virtual environments – we call it Group Immersive – creating a safe space for practical learning, applying experience and taking initiative. Critical to understanding the problem is recognising that it is not something that can be solved by just building a few training courses or sending someone to a simulator for a week. Training for a ‘what-if’ scenario is hard to teach from a textbook. A viable global model that can tackle the industry’s training requirements is one we can draw on to improve how we assess the workforce and build learning methodologies that are closer to reality, even if the medium is virtual."

Rates from China to the US west coast leapt 31% week-on-week, while rates to the east coast jumped 22% as shippers rush to make the most of a 90-day mini-reprieve in the tariff war between the world’s top two economies. Drewry’s spot index, published yesterday, also shot up. Freight rates tracked by Drewry from Shanghai to New York surged 19% or $704 to $4,350 per feu and those from Shanghai to Los Angeles increased 16% or $423 to $3,136 per feu. “Following the latest US–China trade developments, Drewry expects an increase in Transpacific spot rates in the coming week due to shortage in capacity,” Drewry commented yesterday. From Wednesday this week, cargo leaving China bound for the US carries a 30% tariff rate – a reduction from the higher 145% tariff that was in place for six weeks. The US and China announced a dramatic de-escalation in tariffs on Monday, lowering cripplingly high rates for 90 days. “While we expect carriers to reactivate capacity and deploy bigger ships in the transpacific, we note that repositioning boxes and vessels following the recent steep capacity withdrawals could take time,” HSBC stated in a new container report issued yesterday, warning of the potential for bunching of ship calls causing port congestions and bottlenecks on the landside logistics, similar to what was witnessed during the covid pandemic. HSBC is expecting rate increases scheduled for mid-May and early June to stick, noting how the share prices of global liners have now surpassed the pre ‘Liberation Day’ levels, reflecting to some extent the much improved outlook."

The test program created by DanPilot and Danelec allows pilots to guide ships from land, using only advanced data transmitted directly from the vessels. “The approval marks a significant step towards a technological paradigm shift, opening new possibilities for safety, climate action, and operational efficiency in the maritime sector,” DanPilot stated in a release. The 18-month remote pilotage program will take place in the Kattegat and the western Baltic Sea. For the first time, it allows pilots to guide selected ships through Danish waters without boarding them physically. Instead, the operation is carried out from a control center in the city of Randers – removing the most hazardous part of a pilot’s job: the physical boarding of ships.“Remote pilotage makes our work safer and helps reduce both CO₂ emissions and operational costs for our customers. We have worked intensively towards this for six years, and now we can finally test it in practice. It has the potential to become a major paradigm shift in how pilotage is carried out,” said Erik Merkes Nielsen, CEO of DanPilot."

At sea, that figure drops to just 1%. Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of IMO, admitted shipping has “some way to go” when it comes to gender diversity. “Female representation is still disproportionately low, and women represent a small fraction of the seagoing workforce, highlighting the urgent need for continued commitment and action,” Dominguez said. Elpi Petraki, president of WISTA International, commented: “Attracting, retaining and promoting women – both on land and at sea – remains a priority moving forward. However, the new data also shows how opportunities across the industry continue to be limited for women due to barriers such as gender stereotyping, workplace safety concerns, a lack of family-friendly policies and the ongoing gender pay gap.” On Sunday,Splashwill be taking part in theRewriting Women into Maritime Historyinitiative – a collaboration with leading maritime organisations to raise the profile of female maritime expertise, experience and leadership, and help promote gender equity, diversity and inclusion."

Independently, RWE stated at the end of last month that it had stopped all its offshore activities in the US, as well as claiming that it would cut around 73 employees from the Boston area. National Grid said in its most recent financial results that it does see longer-term trends that give the company confidence in the need for offshore wind generation in the US northeast. However, significant near-term policy uncertainty pushed the company towards taking the accounting impairment of $403m as an “exceptional charge”. This big of an impairment was the main cause of 2.1% negative asset growth in the company’s National Grid Ventures arm. The report revealed that both RWE and National Grid would reduce the scope of their development activities until there is greater certainty in the offshore wind sector."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Martin Hedman, director of mental wellness practices at VIKAND, writes for Splash today. The issue of burnout among seafarers has often been pigeonholed into a narrow focus on mental health, yet the reality on the high seas is far more complex. Recent findings from VIKAND, which show a significant rise in psychological assessments among crew members, provide a crucial starting point for a broader discussion. Burnout in this uniquely demanding environment stems from a confluence of factors that extend well beyond mere mental exhaustion, encompassing physical health, environmental stressors, and the very nature of maritime work. Burnout in seafarers, deeply intertwined with mental health, arises from chronic stress and manifests as emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion. The isolated and demanding maritime environment exacerbates this condition, as constant high demands erode seafarers’ enthusiasm and satisfaction. Preventing burnout requires addressing mental health proactively through access to psychological support, fostering a supportive onboard community, and ensuring regular mental health evaluations. Effective interventions not only enhance seafarers’ wellbeing but also contribute to the safety and productivity of maritime operations. Physical exhaustion cannot be overlooked when discussing burnout. The physical demands of maritime jobs — from handling heavy equipment to maintaining extensive machinery—can be overwhelming. Coupled with irregular shifts and extended periods at sea, the physical toll on seafarers is immense. Without adequate rest, nutritious food, and physical downtime, the body wears down, and burnout becomes inevitable. The environment in which seafarers operate is fraught with stressors that go unnoticed on land. Constant motion, noise from engines and machinery, vibrations, and the lack of natural light contribute to a sensory burden that can sap energy and diminish the spirit. These factors, when not managed properly, heavily contribute to burnout by creating an oppressive working environment. Organisational factors play a significant role in causing burnout. Inflexible hierarchies and rigid command structures can stifle communication and leave little room for personal initiative or decision-making. For crew members, this can translate into a workplace that feels more confining and can escalate stress levels, contributing further to burnout. Addressing burnout effectively requires a multifaceted approach. First, acknowledging the physical demands and providing practical solutions such as improved shift scheduling, better quality of sleep accommodations, and enhanced meal quality can make substantial differences. Reducing environmental stressors through better ship design — quieter engines, more comfortable living quarters, and access to leisure activities can improve the overall working conditions. The isolation experienced during long voyages can also compound feelings of burnout. Implementing programmes that enhance social connectivity on board is crucial. Activities such as organised social events, communal leisure areas, and improved internet access allow crew members to maintain contact with family and friends, as well as bond with their colleagues. This social support is vital for mental health and can significantly reduce the sense of isolation and burnout. Enhancing a sense of control can be achieved through ensuring that seafarers are involved in decision-making processes related to their work and living conditions. This not only improves morale but also empowers crew members, reducing feelings of helplessness and burnout. The maritime industry needs to adopt proactive measures to monitor and address signs of burnout early. Regular survey and feedback mechanisms can help identify potential issues before they escalate. Embedding mental health professionals and counsellors within the crew, whether physically on long voyages or via telehealth platforms, can provide ongoing support and intervention. Ultimately, tackling burnout in the maritime industry requires us to look beyond the conventional mental health paradigm and address the broader spectrum of influences that impact a seafarer’s life. Employers, and the entire maritime community, need to adopt a more holistic approach to worker well-being. This includes not just better mental health support but a robust reassessment of how we can make life at sea safer, healthier, and more fulfilling for those who keep our global trade moving."

        "content": "As the FuelEU Maritime regulation enters into force, the shipping industry may be looking at a surprising upside. Instead of acting solely as a cost driver, the regulation could create a net financial gain, potentially around €250m ($280m), according to a recent analysis by maritime data and compliance firm OceanScore. “FuelEU isn’t just another penalty,” said Albrecht Grell, managing director at OceanScore. “It’s structured in a way that can push money back into parts of the industry — but only if you understand where and how that happens.” OceanScore’s analysis focuses on the balance of GHG intensity compliance under FuelEU. The initial compliance deficit across vessels exceeding the regulation’s threshold is estimated at around 2.1m tons of CO₂e, while more efficient vessels — mainly LNG and LPG carriers — generate a surplus of about 1.3m tons of CO₂e. That leaves a net compliance gap of roughly 0.8m tons, which is likely to be closed using biofuels. These fuels have a lower calorific value and higher price point, but offer the advantage of emissions reduction credits and corresponding savings under the EU ETS. At today’s prices, factoring in the ETS phase-in rate of 70% and current exchange rates, covering this compliance gap via biofuels is expected to cost the industry around €200m, or €230 per ton of CO₂e. The other half of the story is about how emissions-related costs are passed on, especially in container, ferry, and cruise segments, which together make up nearly 50% of total emissions. In many cases, emissions surcharges are now included in COAs, and some are linked to FuelEU’s penalty levels. “It’s not a universal practice, but we’ve seen a significant number of surcharges that shadow the penalty rates,” Grell said. “And when you run the numbers, even conservatively, the revenue side starts to look pretty interesting.” OceanScore’s model assumes that just half of operators apply surcharges at two-thirds of the penalty rate, which equates to about €640 per ton of CO₂e. Under these conditions, total additional revenue could reach €450m. Subtracting compliance costs leaves a potential net gain of €250m— although how sustainable that is remains uncertain. “Windfalls like this don’t last forever,” said Grell. “But in the short term, there’s clearly value on the table. The trick is knowing how to capture it — and who actually does.” Owners, charterers, and shipmanagers all have different exposure to compliance costs and different leverage in passing them along. “Shipmanagers are in a uniquely exposed position,” said Grell. The additional cost, for tools, processes, and reporting systems could quickly reach €4,000 per vessel annually, according to OceanScore estimates. “Managers shouldn’t be shy about asking for their share of this upside,” Grell said. “They’re doing the heavy lifting, and it’s in everyone’s interest that they’re properly resourced to do it well.”"

        "content": "On International Women in Maritime Day, Sakura Kuma, senior advisor at Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL), outlines how the maritime industry could more effectively make use of its innate diversity. Shipping is a truly international business and I was drawn to a career in the industry as the result of the opportunity it offered to deal with different nationalities and cultures. However, while maritime offers this innate diversity, it’s not always been the case that people from different backgrounds have been empowered to fully realise their potential. With a smarter approach, maritime could more effectively engage a broader cross-section of society and deliver improved business results. Understanding the current picture can help us move to a better way of working. Challenging gender myths Over 20 some years ago, at the early stages of my career I was based in a male-dominated organisation with a conservative culture, but was also given a lot of opportunities to progress my career. Quite frankly, expectations from my colleagues were very low due to my gender, yet I surpassed them every time. I was very fearless in my willingness to do my best and succeed. This eventually led to me being sent as chief representative to NYK’s Los Angeles terminal and I remember on my first day in post my new US colleagues could not believe that the Tokyo office had ‘sent a girl’ as I was the first female representative that NYK had ever sent there. Yet I have never considered my gender to be a barrier in business, as I believe that it only becomes one if you accept other peoples’ perspectives. Opportunities and obstacles always come in a package, which is why I have been trying to focus on the areas where I can make a difference and avoid what I can’t change, such as people’s preconceived notions. You know what is funny about those blinkered perceptions? They swing as they recognize your success. After Los Angeles, I was seconded to go and work at the Yokohama port which at that time was going through a major development backed by funding from the central Japanese government. My role was to market and sell the port to major shipping lines and grow the business to help justify the huge costs of the development work. During my time at Yokohama port I enjoyed establishing and enhancing business relationships with partners including APM Terminals. I felt I gained their respect for my fair deal-making approach and tough negotiation. More than lip service While I don’t believe that navigating life expecting to be discriminated against is helpful, it is also important that we acknowledge some realities within our industry. For instance, many companies pay lip service to diversity but only ever make space for one or two women on their boards. Even then, the roles of these female directors do not tend to be central to the company’s core strategies so their influence is limited. Ensuring there is sufficient room for women in senior leadership positions and that they are empowered to drive the strategic direction of the business will deliver powerful results for maritime. Fortunately, I found a rare opportunity to do just this during my next career move, when I was invited to be CEO at APM Terminals Japan. However, yet again I was operating in a male-dominated environment, often being the only female at major events with over 200 people in attendance. Broadening opportunities It’s because of these formative experiences that I understand the importance of choosing people from different backgrounds when recruiting to my team. Having been a pioneer in my different roles, I am determined to give other people from diverse backgrounds the same opportunities to grow and develop and become leaders in their own right. This is a shout out to other CEOs and people who are responsible for talent development, hiring and offering opportunities for growth. In the words of Nike’s commercial, JUST DO IT! We are fundamentally the same if you strip away race, religion, culture and language, as we are all human with the same basic needs. Empowering individuals and boosting maritime I’m committed to supporting the She Sees project by becoming a mentor. I will encourage and empower individuals starting out on their career journeys as I did 25 years ago. I will allow them to grow, make mistakes and learn from them as success does not necessarily happen from the outset. Learning from your failures is one of the best ways to grow. It’s this approach that can ensure a broader pool of talent plays an active role in driving the future success of our industry. Hiring people is an investment for the future and it is self-perpetuating as the ones who are successful will become role models and mentors for those around them. We need more diversity in shipping as this will generate different ideas and approaches to help solve some of the major challenges which the industry is facing like decarbonisation and digitalisation. These issues will only be solved through collaboration, respect and inclusion. This article is part of the Lloyd’s Register Foundation and Lloyd’s Register Rewriting Women into Maritime History initiative – a collaboration with leading maritime organisations to raise the profile of female maritime expertise, experience and leadership, and help promote gender equity, diversity and inclusion."

The Saverys family-led group has reportedly returned to Qingdao Beihai Shipyard for one VLCC and two firm plus two optional suezmaxes. Brokers estimate the VLCC newbuild at around $135m, while the suezmaxes are costing $96m apiece. New York- and Brussels-listed CMB.TECH owns and operates a diversified fleet of more than 150 ships, including tankers, bulkers, containerships, offshore wind vessels and tugs. The company recently sold three of its ageing VLCCs as part of an ongoing fleet rejuvenation programme at a total capital gain of $96.7m. If confirmed, this will be the company’s sixth VLCC at Qingdao Beihai and the shipyard’s first order in the suezmax segment, bringing CMB.TECH’s VLCC fleet to 16 ships, while the suezmax fleet would surpass the 20 mark."

The permit, valid for 50 years, was granted to Saare Wind Energy to construct a 1.4GW wind farm some 11 km off Saaremaa island. The wind farm will be built with 100 turbines, which are expected to be installed and commissioned in the early 2030s. The government bill allows the company the right to occupy and use the seabed for the construction of the wind farm and its associated infrastructure. Saare Wind Energy now has two years to apply for a construction permit, usually valid for five years, before building work can begin. The building permit also includes specific environmental mitigation measures that the developer must comply with. “This is the first building permit in the history of Estonian offshore wind farms – it is an important step towards the production of clean energy,” said Jaanus Uiga, deputy secretary general for energy and mineral resources at the Estonian Ministry of Climate Change. In addition to the Saare Wind Energy plan, the government has initiated proceedings for building permits for 11 other offshore wind farms submitted by OÜ Utilitas Wind, Five Wind Energy OÜ, Tuuletraal OÜ, UAB Ignitis renewables projektai 6, Liivi Offshore OÜ, the Environmental Investment Centre Foundation, and Tuul Energy OÜ."

        "content": "The Dutch government has decided to delay tenders for two offshore wind farms over deteriorating market conditions for offshore wind energy projects. The tenders for IJmuiden Ver Gamma-A and Gamma-B offshore wind sites were originally planned for September. The two wind farms have a capacity of 1GW each. The government stated that the removal of the two areas was also partly due to a lack of large-scale demand for electricity. According to the Dutch authorities, the two sites were not removed completely but will rather be tendered at a later date. Instead, the government opted to open a tender in October for just one location in the North Sea – Nederwiek I-A – with a capacity of 1GW. However, the size was reduced from 2GW. The Dutch Climate Ministry claimed earlier this year that interest in the three sites was very low since developers like Eneco and Ørsted stated that they would not apply to the tender without subsidies. Due to this, the Netherlands claimed it was looking into ways to reintroduce subsidies in its tenders for offshore wind farms, which would attract more potential bidders. The Dutch government said in a statement that it was working on an action plan for offshore wind energy that can improve the investment climate for offshore wind. For the period from 2027 onwards, financial support instruments will also be considered, such as a minimum and maximum price guarantee."

        "content": "Germany’s HGK Shipping, one of the top inland shipping names, has secured government approval to test remote-controlled vessels on the domestic canal network. Following the completion of initial trials earlier this month, HGK Shipping is now allowed to operate the first remote-controlled inland waterway vessel on a route from Scharnebeck to Salzgitter for six months. Duisburg-based HGK has been pushing ahead with using the technology developed by Belgian specialist in remote-controlled shippingSeafarfor some time with the aim to counter the shortage of specialist workers and the challenges posed by the ongoing process of climate change and its associated effects on the long-term capacity of inland waterway shipping as a means of transport. “We’re putting our faith in increasingly digitalising inland waterway shipping together with our technology partner, Seafar, which is operating a so-called remote operations centre in Duisburg, in addition to modernising our fleet. This is an effective lever to increase the attractiveness of this profession when seeking to attract qualified workers,” said Steffen Bauer, CEO of HGK Shipping. The permit was handed over by the German Federal Minister of Transport, Patrick Schnieder. “Inland waterway shipping is facing enormous challenges. The shortage of skilled workers, which will particularly become even more critical in the near future, must not be allowed to become a serious obstacle for this hidden champion among the different modes of transport,” Schnieder said, adding: “It is now necessary to get the technology out of the laboratory and onto the water and put it into action.” Remote-controlled operations on a trial basis with a full crew on board were previously allowed on the river Rhine with a Belgian permit. A full crew will also be on board the vessel during the new test phase, but HGK said the next stage of the test programme could then already mean operating the refitted vessels with a reduced crew. “The goal here is to use personnel in a more flexible manner and enable skippers to spend more time on dry land,” the company explained. Remote-controlled shipping has already been proven in other European countries, primarily in Belgium and the Netherlands."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "The vintage state of the global tanker fleet is leading to severe inefficiencies, with new data showing how many rust buckets have to spend more time not moving or in ballast. Data from broker Gibson shows 51% of the total tanker fleet of 25,000 dwt and above is aged 15 years and older and 22% above the age of 20. When it comes to the dark fleet, 93% is aged 15 and over, and 64% is aged 20 years and older. Vessels aged over 20 years old spend on average 17% more time in absolute terms anchored or moored across size classes compared to those under 20 years old, Gibson analysis of AIS data shows. The strongest difference was seen in VLCCs, with a 32% increase in days spent moored or anchored. In terms of their laden status, vessels aged over 20 years old spend on average 14% more time ballasting in absolute numbers compared to vessels under 20. The strongest difference here was seen in MRs, which saw an increase of 22% in time spent ballasting. “Predictably, tanker utilisation thus decreases with age,” Gibson pointed out in a new report issued on Friday. Vessel utilisation changes further if the ship in question is sanctioned. For example, sanctioned VLCCs over 20 years old are moored or anchored around 67% of the time, and 38% of the time laden with cargo, compared with 59% and 39% for unsanctioned vessels over the age of 20 respectively, indicating lower levels of trading. Mette Frederiksen, head of research and insight at Tankers International, writing forSplashearlier this year about the ageing VLCC fleet, noted that for the ships beyond 18 years, efficiency rapidly deteriorates, with trading capacity dropping by approximately 10% annually as vessels face stricter limitations and a reduced number of charterers can fix them. “The impact of this inefficiency and current landscape of the VLCC market is significant,” Frederiksen wrote. While the total VLCC fleet has increased by over 100 ships in the last five years, the true operational growth in terms of usable capacity is closer to just 60 vessels, according to Tankers International data. Looking ahead, an anticipated 70 new VLCCs will enter the market within the next three years, translating to an 8% nominal capacity increase. However, due to the declining utilisation of older ships, the effective supply growth is projected by Tankers International to be only 1%."

        "content": "Julian Panter, CEO of SmartSea, writes for Splash today. With recent cyberattacks crippling major retailers and exposing the personal data of millions, cybersecurity is once again front-page news. Retailers and financial institutions have been pouring billions into digital defences but in the shipping industry, the same urgency is still lacking. Shipping may not be able to afford this unwillingness to act for much longer. As vessels become more connected, they’re also becoming more vulnerable. Digitalisation has brought tremendous benefits to maritime operations, from real-time cargo tracking, satellite navigation and predictive maintenance for starters, but it has also left us more exposed to cyber threats. A breach at sea wouldn’t just be a matter of stolen data. It could disrupt global supply chains, compromise vessel safety, endanger the lives of crew members and even spark environmental disasters. The Maersk incident in 2020 should have been a wake-up call. That single event cost them hundreds of millions and disrupted operations worldwide. And yet, here we are in 2025, and many operators still haven’t moved beyond the basics of cybersecurity. That cyber-attack, caused by the NotPetya malware, wiped out thousands of Maersk’s systems, from booking to port operations. Recovery took weeks. But that was five years ago. Since then, the cyber-risk landscape has got much worse, with the rise of AI-powered attacks, increasingly sophisticated ransomware gangs, and growing geopolitical tensions driving cyber aggression. My message to the industry is that cybersecurity is no longer just an IT issue. It’s a safety issue, an environmental issue, and a business continuity issue. Despite this, right now many vessels are still running outdated operating systems, using default passwords, and lacking any real-time monitoring or response capabilities. Ports, platforms, and shipping lines are tempting targets for cyber criminals. They operate critical infrastructure yet are often underprepared. In some cases, systems are not even segmented properly, meaning that if an attacker gets in through an innocuous email or a virus-infected USB stick, they can potentially access navigation systems or engine controls. Whilst you can’t always have a dedicated IT team on board a ship, many companies now offer smart, lightweight solutions that can be deployed easily, even on legacy systems. What’s needed now is a shift in industry mindset. We shouldn’t be waiting for another crisis to start taking this seriously as the cost of prevention is always lower than the cost of recovery, no matter what industry you are in. For the maritime industry, shipowners need to view cybersecurity as a core part of safety management, not just a regulatory checkbox. This means training crew, conducting regular risk assessments and investing in systems that offer both visibility and resilience. As ransomware increasingly targets land-based logistics firms, it’s not hard to imagine a future where shipping is the next target. The difference here is that the impact of a successful maritime attack could ripple across the entire global economy, sadly oceans don’t offer safe harbour from cybercrime. In today’s digital era, it’s no longer the wind and waves that pose the greatest threat to the maritime industry, it’s the invisible forces hidden in lines of code. Cyber risks are growing more dangerous by the day, and the future will not wait. The time to act is now, because sailing into tomorrow without robust cybersecurity is like navigating blind through a storm."

        "content": "The Danish government has revealed it would launch a 3GW offshore wind tender this autumn. The country also decided to support developers with two-sided contracts for difference after last year’s tender attracted no bids. The three tenders cover two areas in the Danish North Sea and one in the waters separating Denmark and Sweden. Nordsøen Midt and Hesselø will have a bidding deadline in the spring of 2026, while Nordsøen Syd will have a bidding deadline in the autumn of 2027. The first two are expected to come online by 2032 while the final one is set to be completed in 2033. According to the government’s statement, the three wind farms will consist of 150 turbines of 20MW each. The turbines will have a 150-meter-high tower and a blade diameter of 260 m. The new tender will replace the 3GW North Sea auction from last year, which failed to attract bids due to a lack of government subsidies. Danish authorities revealed that they would offer up to DKK 55.2bn ($8.3bn) for the upcoming tender in total insurance coverage for the upcoming tender, with DKK 27.6bn ($4.17bn) made immediately available. This, however, does not mean that all of the funds will be awarded. “We need more secure green power and energy to make Denmark and Europe independent of energy from Russia. There have been bumps in the road globally in getting offshore wind up in recent years, and that is why we have also agreed that the state will lend a helping hand to the projects if necessary,” said Lars Aagaard, Denmark’s energy minister. The wind farms, when completed, would more than double Denmark’s offshore wind energy production, which currently amounts to 2.7GW. The country has set a target to increase its wind energy production capacity to 14GW by 2030."

        "content": "Ship engine manufacturer MAN Energy Solutions has developed the world’s most powerful two-stroke methanol engine. The engine, rated at 82,440kW at 80rpm, is currently being built by Chinese licensee CSSC-MES Diesel. This will be the first engine of 12 bound for a series of a dozen 24,000 teu container vessels currently under construction – seven at Nantong COSCO KHI Ship Engineering for Orient Overseas Container Line and five at Dalian COSCO KHI Ship Engineering for COSCO Shipping Lines. The company will deliver the first engine in June 2025. Each engine will also feature MAN Energy Solutions’ exhaust gas recirculation turbocharger cutout emissions system, the largest two-string EGR system on a two-stroke engine to date. “By harnessing the potential of methanol, we are bringing the maritime industry closer to zero-emission solutions, and we fully expect methanol to figure prominently as a future fuel across all segments,” said Bjarne Foldager, head of two-stroke business at MAN Energy Solutions. To date, between newbuild engines and retrofits, the company-built engines have accumulated over 600,000 hours running on methanol alone. “As we move towards a multi-fuel future, interest in methanol has grown steadily. While methanol produced from renewable sources is an attractive marine-fuel option due to its low carbon intensity, an engine using green methanol can even provide carbon-neutral propulsion,” added Christian Ludwig, head of two-stroke sales and promotion at MAN Energy Solutions."

        "content": "South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean has detailed how it intends to make its Philadelphia shipyard the top shipbuilder in the US. Hanwha, which spent $100m buying Philly Shipyard from Aker last year, has outlined how it intends to increase production capacity at its American yard from 1.5 ships to 10 a year, a mix of naval and commercial ships, including LNG carriers. The aim is to increase revenues at Hanwha Philly Shipyard ten-fold in a decade to $4bn. An old drydock is being reactivated to help meet these new business objectives which have been massively inflated following the return of Donald Trump to the White House. Trump has spent plenty of time in the first months of his second term in office looking at ways to restrict China’s dominance in the shipbuilding sector, with new US port service fees on China-linked ships set to come into force later this year as well as the creation of a shipbuilding office in the White House. Trump’s actions have been seen as a bonus in ongoing trade discussions between South Korea and the US with other Korean shipbuilding majors also in discussions to get more business out of the US."

        "content": "Ten days on from running into difficulty off Jeddah, the 304 m long, 7,000 teu MSC Antonia remains listed aground by various vessel tracking services, albeit very hard aground in the desert on another continent, a visual example of the increased GPS spoofing ship operators are having to contend with when transiting the Red Sea. Analysis from Windward, a maritime analytics firm, highlighted the spoofing patterns that ended up with the ship aground on May 10 near the Eliza Shoals west of Jeddah, with vessel tracking from MarineTraffic supporting this theory, and satellite images from Pole Star Global showing the vessel resting on a reef, as well as a host of videos on social media. Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC) has yet to reply to questions sent repeatedly bySplashon the state of the ship and how it came to run aground. Ten days on, however, despite being listed as grounded, the ship appears today on various vessel tracking sites, not just on the opposite side of the Red Sea but often far inland, along with other ships. VesselFinder has the ship on Airport Road, south of Port Sudan, myShipTracking has it a few km further inland, while MarineTraffic’s location of the stricken ship places it – and a host of other vessels – some 250 km from the nearest shoreline in the Nubian Desert, the eastern region of the Sahara Desert. Maritime security specialist Ambrey has observed growing GPS interference in conflict zones. These manifest themselves in a constant disruption of the signal over an area, increasing navigational risk to shipping. “These are assessed to be defensive measures by state actors – as seen in the Black Sea, offshore Haifa, or offshore Port Sudan – in response to the increased use of unmanned systems in warfare,” commented Dan Mueller, Ambrey’s senior Middle East analyst. Mueller said the extent of the GPS disruptions offshore war-torn Sudan is particularly concerning, given the volume of traffic and shallow waters south of Port Sudan. Limited optical references for safe navigation constitute an added challenge for mariners sailing the Red Sea without accurate position data. “A continuation of such disruptions in future conflicts is highly likely and will increase the navigational risks to commercial shipping,” Mueller warned. The 2009-builtMSC Antoniamade headlines last August when it lost a number of containers in bad weather while sailing off South Africa. With additional reporting by Bojan Lepic."

        "content": "The Trump administration has allowed the restart of the $5bn Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island, allowing construction activities to resume. The project was halted with a stop work order issued in April 2025 by Interior secretary Doug Burgum, initially stating that more time was needed to assess the project’s previous approvals. He later said on social media that scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration “have revealed that the Biden administration’s rushed approval of the Empire Wind project was built on bad and flawed science.” This move got mixed reviews, even from Republican Party members like Leslie Beyer, who was Donald Trump’s nominee for the assistant secretary role in the Department of the Interior. She said during her confirmation hearing that the order to stop work on the Empire Wind project sent “a dangerous message” as companies needed certainty in the permitting system so they could make financial investment decisions. By the time the stop order was issued, Equinor had already invested over $2.5bn in the project. The stoppage was costing the company up to $50m per week, including 11 vessels on standby. Equinor revealed last week that it was considering terminating the project if no progress was made towards a resolution “within days”. However, Equinor said on Monday that following dialogue with regulators and federal, state, and city officials, the stop work order was lifted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and construction activities will resume. Equinor will perform an updated assessment of the 816MW project economics in the second quarter. The company aims to execute planned activities in the offshore installation window in 2025 and reach its planned commercial operation date in 2027. The project is currently more than 30% complete. When fully operational, it is expected to deliver enough electricity to power 500,000 New York homes. The main facilitator for the lifting of the stop order was New York governor Kathy Hochul, who vowed that she would not give up on the project. According to her statement, she spent weeks pressing president Trump to lift the government’s hold on the wind farm. “After countless conversations with Equinor and White House officials, bringing labour and business to the table to emphasise the importance of this project, I’m pleased that President Trump and Secretary Burgum have agreed to lift the stop work order and allow this project to move forward,” Hochul said. She also noted that the restart of the project saved 1,500 “good-paying union jobs that were on the line”. The United States is a core country in Equinor’s portfolio. Since the early 2000s, Equinor has invested approximately $60bn in energy projects in the country. “I would like to thank president Trump for finding a solution that saves thousands of American jobs and provides for continued investments in energy infrastructure in the US. I am grateful to Governor Hochul for her constructive collaboration with the Trump administration, without which we would not have been able to advance this project,” said Anders Opedal, president and CEO of Equinor."

Each project area may have an installed capacity of up to 500MW of floating offshore wind. Interested parties must submit applications by September 15. According to the Ministry, the allocation of project areas and state aid will take place in two stages, with a maturation phase in between. In the first stage, three project areas will be awarded to the applicants who score highest in a competition based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. The competition for state aid will be conducted after a maturation phase. To participate in the state aid competition, the developer must have submitted a license application and provided a bank guarantee for participation in the auction. The auction will only be held if at least two applications meet the requirements. The winner will be the bidder with the lowest support requirement to realise their project. Bidders will not be permitted to bid higher than the upper limit for state aid of NOK 35bn ($3.4bn). “In addition to providing power to a region with high electricity demand, the announcement presents significant opportunities for new contracts for the supplier industry. Utsira Nord is an important first step in the development of commercial floating offshore wind on the Norwegian continental shelf,” said Terje Aasland, Norway’s minister of energy."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "The vintage state of the global tanker fleet is leading to severe inefficiencies, with new data showing how many rust buckets have to spend more time not moving or in ballast. Data from broker Gibson shows 51% of the total tanker fleet of 25,000 dwt and above is aged 15 years and older and 22% above the age of 20. When it comes to the dark fleet, 93% is aged 15 and over, and 64% is aged 20 years and older. Vessels aged over 20 years old spend on average 17% more time in absolute terms anchored or moored across size classes compared to those under 20 years old, Gibson analysis of AIS data shows. The strongest difference was seen in VLCCs, with a 32% increase in days spent moored or anchored. In terms of their laden status, vessels aged over 20 years old spend on average 14% more time ballasting in absolute numbers compared to vessels under 20. The strongest difference here was seen in MRs, which saw an increase of 22% in time spent ballasting. “Predictably, tanker utilisation thus decreases with age,” Gibson pointed out in a new report issued on Friday. Vessel utilisation changes further if the ship in question is sanctioned. For example, sanctioned VLCCs over 20 years old are moored or anchored around 67% of the time, and 38% of the time laden with cargo, compared with 59% and 39% for unsanctioned vessels over the age of 20 respectively, indicating lower levels of trading. Mette Frederiksen, head of research and insight at Tankers International, writing forSplashearlier this year about the ageing VLCC fleet, noted that for the ships beyond 18 years, efficiency rapidly deteriorates, with trading capacity dropping by approximately 10% annually as vessels face stricter limitations and a reduced number of charterers can fix them. “The impact of this inefficiency and current landscape of the VLCC market is significant,” Frederiksen wrote. While the total VLCC fleet has increased by over 100 ships in the last five years, the true operational growth in terms of usable capacity is closer to just 60 vessels, according to Tankers International data. Looking ahead, an anticipated 70 new VLCCs will enter the market within the next three years, translating to an 8% nominal capacity increase. However, due to the declining utilisation of older ships, the effective supply growth is projected by Tankers International to be only 1%."

        "content": "Korea Marine Transport Co (KMTC) is rejoining the suddenly booming transpacific container trades after a 40-year absence. From Wednesday last week, cargo leaving China bound for the US carries a 30% tariff rate for a 90-day period – a reduction from the higher 145% tariff that was in place for six weeks. This has led to a swift rate increase. Rates published by the Shanghai Shipping Exchange last Friday from China to the US west coast leapt 31% week-on-week, while rates to the east coast jumped 22% as shippers rush to make the most of the mini-reprieve in the tariff war between the world’s top two economies. According to consultancy Linerlytica, KMTC will become the third South Korean carrier in the transpacific trade with the launch of its APX service when it joins the Asia West Coast (AWC) service operated by SeaLead and TS Lines from June 17. The AWC/APX service will be upgraded at the same time, with larger vessels of 6,000-10,000 teu replacing the 2,900-5,600 teu ships that are currently in use. Fast expanding KMTC unveiled at the end of April a weekly service connecting Asia with Mexico. KMTC, founded in 1954, is the world’s 17th largest liner with a fleet size of around 152,000 slots according to data from Alphaliner. Sea-Intelligence, another container consultancy, is forecasting a sharp rise in spot rates in the coming weeks, as well as much more capacity insertion into the transpacific at the expense of blank sailings in other Asian export trades."

        "content": "The UK has imposed sanctions on a British ship finance veteran for allegedly buying tankers for Russia’s shadow fleet. John Ormerod was blacklisted on Tuesday alongside two Russian captains, 18 shadow fleet vessels and 46 financial institutions in the latest wave of British sanctions against Russia. Last year,Financial Timesuncovered how Russian oil producer Lukoil financed the 74-year-old Ormerod, through its shipping division, to purchase at least 25 secondhand tankers from December 2022 to August 2023, totalling over $700m. Reportedly, each tanker was acquired by a special-purpose company that Ormerod established in the Marshall Islands, while Lukoil’s Dubai-based Eiger Shipping provided the funding by making advance payments to charter the ships. Ormerod’s lawyers told the British daily newspaper at the time that he ended his association with the tankers before they were sanctioned and that shipbroker Braemar facilitated at least nine of the transactions. In 1974, Ormerod qualified as a chartered accountant whilst working for Ernst & Young, after which he worked in shipping departments of Hambros Bank, Bankers Trust and Den Norske Bank before setting up his ship finance advisory, Ormerod Allen & Co, in 1990. The UK’s latest move follows over100 tankers blacklistedearlier this month and comes as the EU confirmed its largest ever sanctions packagetargeting 189 vesselsin Russia’s shadow fleet. The British government said it is also working with partners to tighten the $60 oil price cap, enforced in December 2022, that limits the price that Russia can charge for its oil if transported using G7 services like insurance and shipping."

The Houthis would “begin working to enforce a naval blockade of the port of Haifa,” said military spokesman Yehya Saree. “All companies with ships present in or heading to this port are hereby notified that, as of the time of this announcement, the aforementioned port has been included in the target bank,” the Houthi spokesman added. Donald Trump, the American president, claimed earlier this month that after more than 17 months, the Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to a close. However, most liners questioned at recent quarterly results have insisted it is still too early for any resumption of Red Sea transits. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc said a fortnight ago it would be “irresponsible” to resume Red Sea transits based on an unclear ceasefire deal, warning the region remains too volatile for a safe return."

        "content": "VLGC owner and operator BW LPG has decided to drop its investment plans for a liquefied petroleum gas onshore import terminal project in India, citing “heightened market uncertainties influencing the global business landscape”. The project, initiated by BW LPG’s joint venture with Confidence Petroleum India, called BW Confidence, and Ganesh Benzoplast, aimed to develop a cryogenic LPG storage facility at Jawaharlal Nehru Port, with BW LPG contributing about $10m. The dual-listed unit of Singapore’s BW Group, which operates more than 50 VLGCs, said the strategic move to cease the investment will see the company discontinue its involvement in the terminal’s development and maintain its focus on the core business of shipping and trading. “The company will scale back activities within its infrastructure segment to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational agility.” Kristian Sørensen, CEO at BW LPG, noted that the decision “was not made lightly” but that it reflects a realignment of the company’s business priorities in a changing environment. The company logged a net profit of $66.6m for the first quarter of 2025, down from nearly $150m same time last year."

        "author": "Bojan Lepic",
        "content": "A consortium led by Morek Engineering has unveiled its design concept for a new vessel class for the floating offshore wind (FLOW) market, having completed the first feasibility stage. Consortium partners include naval architects Solis Marine Engineering, innovation specialists Tope Ocean, marine operations specialists First Marine Solutions, and Celtic Sea Power. The project is part of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition Round 4, funded by the UK Department for Transport and delivered by Innovate UK. The round is a £206m ($276m) initiative focused on developing the technology necessary to decarbonise the country’s maritime sector. The Future FLOW Installation Vessel (FFIV) design incorporates low-carbon fuels, providing fuel efficiency advantages, a hydrodynamically optimised hull and expanded mooring capacity. This should translate into time and cost savings compared to the current vessels in operation. The vessel concept focuses on a section of the floating wind installation process that is yet to be optimised. It will work with any of the three main anchor types for floating wind turbines being considered by the industry – drag embedment anchors, which require installation by high bollard pull anchor handling vessels, suction piles and driven piles, which require large subsea cranes to install them into the seabed. Regardless of the type, the vessel meets the requirements of the next phase by installing the mooring lines onto the installed anchors, enabling quick connection to floating foundations towed to the offshore site. To maximise mooring line capacity, the vessel has a large below-deck cable tank for synthetic mooring ropes as well as large chain lockers. The consortium is advancing toward the next design stage in which it will focus on the equipment for handling large quantities of synthetic ropes, weather-limit analyses, and regulatory and design challenges for methanol propulsion systems. The target is to secure an approval in principle from a major ship classification society by December 2025. “At present, the global fleet falls far short of what is required for serialised installation of floating turbines and their infrastructure. This innovative concept is the kind of advanced technology innovation the floating offshore wind sector needs to realise the global pipeline of projects,” said Ian Godfrey of Tope Ocean."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Julian Panter, CEO of SmartSea, writes for Splash today. With recent cyberattacks crippling major retailers and exposing the personal data of millions, cybersecurity is once again front-page news. Retailers and financial institutions have been pouring billions into digital defences but in the shipping industry, the same urgency is still lacking. Shipping may not be able to afford this unwillingness to act for much longer. As vessels become more connected, they’re also becoming more vulnerable. Digitalisation has brought tremendous benefits to maritime operations, from real-time cargo tracking, satellite navigation and predictive maintenance for starters, but it has also left us more exposed to cyber threats. A breach at sea wouldn’t just be a matter of stolen data. It could disrupt global supply chains, compromise vessel safety, endanger the lives of crew members and even spark environmental disasters. The Maersk incident in 2020 should have been a wake-up call. That single event cost them hundreds of millions and disrupted operations worldwide. And yet, here we are in 2025, and many operators still haven’t moved beyond the basics of cybersecurity. That cyber-attack, caused by the NotPetya malware, wiped out thousands of Maersk’s systems, from booking to port operations. Recovery took weeks. But that was five years ago. Since then, the cyber-risk landscape has got much worse, with the rise of AI-powered attacks, increasingly sophisticated ransomware gangs, and growing geopolitical tensions driving cyber aggression. My message to the industry is that cybersecurity is no longer just an IT issue. It’s a safety issue, an environmental issue, and a business continuity issue. Despite this, right now many vessels are still running outdated operating systems, using default passwords, and lacking any real-time monitoring or response capabilities. Ports, platforms, and shipping lines are tempting targets for cyber criminals. They operate critical infrastructure yet are often underprepared. In some cases, systems are not even segmented properly, meaning that if an attacker gets in through an innocuous email or a virus-infected USB stick, they can potentially access navigation systems or engine controls. Whilst you can’t always have a dedicated IT team on board a ship, many companies now offer smart, lightweight solutions that can be deployed easily, even on legacy systems. What’s needed now is a shift in industry mindset. We shouldn’t be waiting for another crisis to start taking this seriously as the cost of prevention is always lower than the cost of recovery, no matter what industry you are in. For the maritime industry, shipowners need to view cybersecurity as a core part of safety management, not just a regulatory checkbox. This means training crew, conducting regular risk assessments and investing in systems that offer both visibility and resilience. As ransomware increasingly targets land-based logistics firms, it’s not hard to imagine a future where shipping is the next target. The difference here is that the impact of a successful maritime attack could ripple across the entire global economy, sadly oceans don’t offer safe harbour from cybercrime. In today’s digital era, it’s no longer the wind and waves that pose the greatest threat to the maritime industry, it’s the invisible forces hidden in lines of code. Cyber risks are growing more dangerous by the day, and the future will not wait. The time to act is now, because sailing into tomorrow without robust cybersecurity is like navigating blind through a storm."

The AJ Rahman-led outfit has penned a long-term charter deal with a “renowned Japanese shipowner” for the 42,000 dwt bulker, which will be built at Oshima Shipyard. The vessel, to be namedNorvic Athens, is scheduled for delivery in the second half of 2027. “This partnership marks another step forward in Norvic’s commitment to high-quality, fuel-efficient, tonnage, and long-term strategic growth,” the company said. Founded in 2006 in Toronto, Canada, as a tanker operator, Norvic expanded into dry bulk in 2012. The company returned to its roots in 2023 with the $37m purchase of the 2008-built LR2 Norvic Monica, which was sold for around $42m last year."

        "content": "Young people are happy to move about a lot and crewing managers and shipowners need to bear this in mind, writes Henrik Jensen, the CEO of Danica Crewing Specialists. It isn’t a reflection on their crewing services but just a reality of modern life. Things have changed in the job market, he stresses in this article for Splash. Having a steady crew pool is a significant contributing factor to having safe and smooth operating vessels. Fewer mishaps result in fewer casualties and less damage, which ultimately improves the financial bottom line. Increasing numbers of shipping companies are focussing on maintaining a high retention rate and investing in various tools to achieve this. Cargo owners are following oil majors by concentrating on retention and including compliance in their crew experience matrices as a commercial requirement for doing business with them. In general, most of the retention tools used by the maritime employers offer better financial employment conditions than their competitors, such as keeping salaries above market average levels, rejoining bonus, private medical insurance, provident or pension plans. Alongside are less visible offerings, like proper vessel management, company support, and fair treatment of each seafarer. There are of course many more retention tools like a growing fleet with promotion prospects and job security. Yet, despite all these tools being in place with the purpose of achieving high retention, crew members are still leaving companies, and the end objective is not being met. Are we doing something wrong? Are our efforts wasted? Most probably not, but we are missing something – and that is management of the unavoidable fluctuations. Our retention strategies are based on the ‘older’ generation’s DNA, which is to strive for security and stability. We can meet these needs by offering a competitive financial employment package with benefits, and stable employment through increasing or steady numbers of vessels in the fleet. However, the DNA of the younger generations does include a part that encourages them to explore and try new things, which puts the need for stability in the background and makes them more willing to take risks in the job market. Consequently, even when offered good employment conditions, they are ready to decline them and instead explore new opportunities, causing a constant fluctuation. A shortage of labour in most industries, of course, also contributes to the fluctuation within the maritime sector. It is likely that this fluctuating issue will grow in the future as the younger generations move up through the ranks. Reaching the goal of safely and smoothly operating vessels through a high retention rate is not achievable. In addition to retention, shipping companies must also manage fluctuations. How can we manage the risk of always having a portion of new hands? The answer is through simplification and standardisation, which supports and speeds up the familiarisation process for new joiners. The company’s quality management systems and procedures tend to grow over time. An accident or mishap occurs and, as preventive action, a new procedure or checklist is added. Step-by-step operations become increasingly complex, and new staff will need more time for familiarisation, which they are often not given. Shipping companies should conduct a thorough review of their procedures at least annually to identify outdated, overdone, and no longer needed procedures. In addition, the introduction for new staff should be reviewed. Is it necessary for all new staff to read and understand the top-level quality and safety policies of the company? Perhaps it is more important that they spend time familiarising themselves with the low-level work instructions and checklists relevant to their functions? Organising procedures, instructions and checklists in electronic format, and making the search for a relevant procedure much easier, is also an important way to support new staff (and even old staff). Adding AI to such an electronic filing system, combining several procedures into shorter resumes, is the latest way ahead. Looking at the macro level, if would be helpful if authorities and legislators made fewer and simpler regulations. However, in some technical matters, more specific rules may be beneficial. An example is the IMO resolution on ECDIS which is very open, essentially allowing each manufacturer to develop its own standards, and resulting in the industry having a forest of type-specific ECDIS courses. In conclusion, we must, of course, manage retention. However, times are changing, and we must also consider the behaviour of younger people, who are increasingly willing to change employers more frequently, and it is time to develop defences against the challenges arising from this."

        "content": "Manish Singh from Aboutships writes about the future of maritime autonomy and delegation. As businesses and societies are getting hands on with early applications of agentic artificial intelligence, I am increasingly being asked about what it means for the maritime world. Unlike traditional automation onboard ships or general industries, agentic AI will become increasingly context-aware, autonomous in repetitive and iterative processes, and gradually capable of making consistent decisions on behalf of users to achieve defined goals. So in a sector that is chronically grappling with workforce shortages, complex regulations, and rising operational demands, the implications seem profound. But are they? Maritime operations involve a high volume of repetitive, compliance-heavy, and time-sensitive workflows. With the exponential gains in ship-shore connectivity, we now have fleets that benefit from always-on ship-to-shore data exchange. So we can now deploy AI agents that do more than analyse data—they can act on it. AI hallucinations could prove catastrophic Before we touch upon the obvious risks that come to mind – let us explore some agentic applications ranging from voyage planning to port call optimisation. Guardrails and protection are the key issues, because from a ‘can tech do’ perspective, we can easily envisage application such as: Before you shoot the messenger, I am just hypothesising here because these tasks taken by colleagues at sea and ashore today are reliant on fragmented information, tools and manual intervention. So one should expect with an ever smaller crew onboard, can we start selectively equipping our workforces with intelligent software agents that learn, iterate, and act independently within predefined guardrails. Let’s look at what incremental gains may such agentic use bring to operators. And these only seem to be a fraction of the use cases that could help solve real world immediate issues. But what risks would we be onboarding, if agentic AI was adopted in advance of appropriate risks mitigation and guardrails in place? Delegating decisions at sea— touches safety of human life, marine environment and cargo and exposes considerable societal, compliance and financial exposure if things go wrong. We will need to navigate complex challenges such as: So what do we do? Rejecting the approaching wave of agentic AI would be sheer denial. So early adopters must plan carefully structured deployment, with robust audit trails, user persona or role-based overrides, and hybrid human-AI decision models. Regulatory agencies like IMO and class societies are likely to mandate minimum standards of supervision, fallback logic, and cyber assurance. In terms of our technology ethic the maritime industry must evolve from fragmented digitisation to orchestrated autonomy. This would mean embedding AI agents into integrated marine operating systems, not just standalone tools. It will be vital to proactively equip workforces with training to include human-AI collaboration frameworks. A key area of regulatory evolution will focus on establishing common standards for interoperability and safety assurance across maritime technologies. So in summation, ships a decade from now can expect leading fleets to operate semi-autonomous technologies in data-rich, digitally governed, and agent-enhanced environments. Ships will sail with fewer colleagues onboard, but supported by agentic intelligence in code. Agentic AI, if implemented wisely, won’t just automate tasks—it will amplify maritime workforce capabilities, reduce error, and reshape the economics of fleet management. It’s not the future of shipping—it’s the operating system of future-ready fleets."

The FMC said it is concerned about the conditions created by the wide and uneven range of foreign vessel flagging laws, regulations, and practices warning how many nations have engaged in a “race to the bottom” – a situation where countries compete by lowering standards and easing compliance requirements to gain a potential competitive edge. “By offering to register and flag vessels with little or no oversight or regulation, countries may compete against one another to gain revenue from the associated fees and to minimize the expenses associated with inspecting vessels and ensuring compliance with appropriate maintenance and safety requirements,” the FMC said. The American regulatory body claimed the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has not brought about meaningful change nor deterrence to what it said is a growing global problem. “Patchwork policies and uneven compliance have proven ineffective in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of ocean shipping,” the FMC stated, in the latest American broadside aimed at the IMO, following theUS decision not to attend April’s Marine Environment Protection Committee meetingat IMO headquarters. “As the IMO lacks the authority to enforce vessel registry standards or penalize non-compliant nations, its efforts are unlikely to serve as an effective deterrent or bring about meaningful change to curb abuses. A comprehensive and enforceable approach is needed,” the FMC stated, going on to discuss flags of convenience, open registries, fraudulent registries and the shadow fleet.

        "content": "The shipping situation in the Baltic is tense with Russia trading barbs with its neighbours and militaries getting involved. Poland was forced yesterday to intervene after a ship from the Russian shadow fleet was seen performing suspicious manoeuvres near a power cable connecting Poland with Sweden. Meanwhile, Estonia and Russia have been threatening each other over attempts by the Baltic state to clamp down on shadow tankers, something that saw both militaries chase after tankers in recent days. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for Russian president Vladimir Putin, told reporters yesterday that Russia would defend its vessels in the Baltic. “As recent events related to an attempted pirate attack on one of the tankers have shown, Russia has demonstrated it is capable of responding quite harshly,” Peskov said. This was not the first time Estonia’s tactics have been labelled as pirate actions this week. At a United Nations Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss maritime, Russian representative Vasily Nebenzya called out Estonia’s decision to pursue a shadow tanker as “comparable to piracy”. At the same Security Council meeting, António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, commented: “As threats to maritime security are becoming more complex and interconnected, enhanced coordination and stronger maritime governance are essential.” Nice in the south of France is set to host the 2025 UN Ocean Conference next month. “Without maritime security, there can be no global security,” Guterres stressed. Seabed gas pipelines, power cables and fibre optic cables have all been attacked – likely by merchant ships dragging their anchors – in recent months across the Baltic, forcing NATO to establish Baltic Sentry, a naval protection operation. Baltic Sentry involves a range of assets, including frigates, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and drones. A joint statement from the heads of state or government of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden earlier this year noted: “Russia’s use of the so-called shadow fleet poses a particular threat to the maritime and environmental security in the Baltic Sea region and globally. This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.”"

Walland takes over from Arne Austreid and will oversee the company’s board until 2027. He officially stepped down from Edda Wind on January 1, 2025, after leading the offshore wind support vessel pureplay backed by the shipping heavyweights John Fredriksen, Wilhelmsen and Idan Ofer from April 2021. Walland spent most of his career at Østensjø Rederi, which he headed up from 2016 before joining Edda Wind. Oslo-listed Eidesvik counts 15 OSVs in its fleet, including two construction support vessel (CSV) newbuildings scheduled for delivery in 2026 and 2027. Last year, the company saw another change of leadership, with Helga Cotgrove taking over as chief executive from Gitte Gard Talmo, who resigned in September after spending 22 years at Eidesvik in various management roles."

CompassAir, with a foothold in the Greek and Norwegian shipping sector, delivers expertise across the research, negotiation, and handover stages of the maritime trade lifecycle. The acquisition for an undisclosed sum will see its S&P and chartering products integrated into Sedna’s offering, “enabling commercial teams to spot opportunities, close deals faster, reduce risk, and gain full visibility across negotiations”. Sedna said the move represents a significant step forward in the company’s ambition to build a fully connected platform that unites people, systems, and data across the maritime ecosystem. “This acquisition is a powerful extension of our mission to unify global trade through intelligent communication,” remarked Bill Dobie, founder and CEO of Sedna, adding: “CompassAir brings not only proven technology and deep expertise, but also an exceptional team whose values and vision align closely with ours.” As part of the deal, Yannis Manolessos, CEO of CompassAir, will assume a senior leadership role within Sedna. Founded in 2017, Sedna launched to reduce present email challenges—like inbox overload, lost data, and siloed operations. In March, the company, backed by Insight Partners, bought trade workflow automation platform Flytta, after adding the Copenhagen-headquartered email management specialist Nordic IT last November. “With this acquisition, Sedna becomes the only platform that unites real-time communications, S&P and chartering workflows, and fixture execution in one secure, intelligent workspace,” the company said in a release."

Multiple shipbroking sources have reported that the Tokyo-based shipping giant is letting go of the 2008 Kawasaki-built M Star to an undisclosed buyer for about $46.7m. In July 2010, the same vessel was damaged by an explosion, which was later determined to be a terrorist attack, while transiting the Strait of Hormuz. According to S&P databases, MOL last sold a VLCC in March 2023. The 2005-built Yufusan was sold to China’s Polar Star Management for $52m and today sails as Seeker 8. The largest shipping company in Japan in dwt terms is listed with more than 20 VLCCs, and six more LNG dual-fuelled newbuilds set to deliver from Dalian COSCO KHI Ship Engineering (DACKS) between 2025 and 2028. More than 40 VLCC transactions have been reported year-to-date, either through S&P deals involving older ships or taking modern tonnage vessels out of leases. Most recently, Maran Tankers, a unit of Greece’s Angelicoussis Shipping Group, offloaded its 2007-built 320,500 dwt Maran Canopus for a reported $50m, while another Greek owner, Okeanis Eco Tanker,s exercised options to take back three VLCCs built between 2020 and 2022 from CMB Financial Leasing."

        "content": "The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) is conducting a nonadjudicatory investigation to examine whether the vessel flagging laws, regulations, or practices of certain foreign governments create unfavourable shipping conditions in the foreign trade of the US. The FMC said it is concerned about the conditions created by the wide and uneven range of foreign vessel flagging laws, regulations, and practices warning how many nations have engaged in a “race to the bottom” – a situation where countries compete by lowering standards and easing compliance requirements to gain a potential competitive edge. “By offering to register and flag vessels with little or no oversight or regulation, countries may compete against one another to gain revenue from the associated fees and to minimize the expenses associated with inspecting vessels and ensuring compliance with appropriate maintenance and safety requirements,” the FMC said. The American regulatory body claimed the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has not brought about meaningful change nor deterrence to what it said is a growing global problem. “Patchwork policies and uneven compliance have proven ineffective in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of ocean shipping,” the FMC stated, in the latest American broadside aimed at the IMO, following theUS decision not to attend April’s Marine Environment Protection Committee meetingat IMO headquarters. “As the IMO lacks the authority to enforce vessel registry standards or penalize non-compliant nations, its efforts are unlikely to serve as an effective deterrent or bring about meaningful change to curb abuses. A comprehensive and enforceable approach is needed,” the FMC stated, going on to discuss flags of convenience, open registries, fraudulent registries and the shadow fleet. The investigation will commence with a 90-day public comment period."

Initially, it was reported that all personnel had been accounted for. A fire at the facility left 17 injured, including four critically. All of the injured workers were transported onshore and received medical care. The fire was successfully extinguished, and its cause is under investigation. The US supermajor said the incident happened while the platform, operated by its Angolan arm, Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, was undergoing annual maintenance as part of a scheduled shutdown. Production was halted on May 1. The Agency said yesterday that, contrary to initial statements, one person has been reported missing following the incident. “Government entities and Cabinda Gulf Oil continue to work closely together to mobilise resources to conduct search and rescue operations.

In this pilot project, Norden used certified waste-based biofuel over several voyages, offering an 80-90% life cycle emissions reduction compared to traditional fossil fuels. It then transferred the emissions reductions to Microsoft via its book and claim solution, providing full transparency on the transferred reductions. During the project, Microsoft is expected to reduce its maritime Scope 3 emissions by nearly 10,000 tonnes of CO2e over three years. Norden and Microsoft will engage with the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) to pilot updates to RSB’s globally recognised book and claim system, ensuring it supports credible tracking of sustainable maritime fuel claims."

        "content": "The shipping situation in the Baltic is tense with Russia trading barbs with its neighbours and militaries getting involved. Poland was forced yesterday to intervene after a ship from the Russian shadow fleet was seen performing suspicious manoeuvres near a power cable connecting Poland with Sweden. Meanwhile, Estonia and Russia have been threatening each other over attempts by the Baltic state to clamp down on shadow tankers, something that saw both militaries chase after tankers in recent days. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for Russian president Vladimir Putin, told reporters yesterday that Russia would defend its vessels in the Baltic. “As recent events related to an attempted pirate attack on one of the tankers have shown, Russia has demonstrated it is capable of responding quite harshly,” Peskov said. This was not the first time Estonia’s tactics have been labelled as pirate actions this week. At a United Nations Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss maritime, Russian representative Vasily Nebenzya called out Estonia’s decision to pursue a shadow tanker as “comparable to piracy”. At the same Security Council meeting, António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, commented: “As threats to maritime security are becoming more complex and interconnected, enhanced coordination and stronger maritime governance are essential.” Nice in the south of France is set to host the 2025 UN Ocean Conference next month. “Without maritime security, there can be no global security,” Guterres stressed. Seabed gas pipelines, power cables and fibre optic cables have all been attacked – likely by merchant ships dragging their anchors – in recent months across the Baltic, forcing NATO to establish Baltic Sentry, a naval protection operation. Baltic Sentry involves a range of assets, including frigates, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and drones. A joint statement from the heads of state or government of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden earlier this year noted: “Russia’s use of the so-called shadow fleet poses a particular threat to the maritime and environmental security in the Baltic Sea region and globally. This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.”"

Poland was forced yesterday to intervene after a ship from the Russian shadow fleet was seen performing suspicious manoeuvres near a power cable connecting Poland with Sweden. Meanwhile, Estonia and Russia have been threatening each other over attempts by the Baltic state to clamp down on shadow tankers, something that saw both militaries chase after tankers in recent days. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for Russian president Vladimir Putin, told reporters yesterday that Russia would defend its vessels in the Baltic. “As recent events related to an attempted pirate attack on one of the tankers have shown, Russia has demonstrated it is capable of responding quite harshly,” Peskov said. This was not the first time Estonia’s tactics have been labelled as pirate actions this week. At a United Nations Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss maritime, Russian representative Vasily Nebenzya called out Estonia’s decision to pursue a shadow tanker as “comparable to piracy”. At the same Security Council meeting, António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, commented: “As threats to maritime security are becoming more complex and interconnected, enhanced coordination and stronger maritime governance are essential.” Nice in the south of France is set to host the 2025 UN Ocean Conference next month. “Without maritime security, there can be no global security,” Guterres stressed. Seabed gas pipelines, power cables and fibre optic cables have all been attacked – likely by merchant ships dragging their anchors – in recent months across the Baltic, forcing NATO to establish Baltic Sentry, a naval protection operation. Baltic Sentry involves a range of assets, including frigates, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and drones. A joint statement from the heads of state or government of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden earlier this year noted: “Russia’s use of the so-called shadow fleet poses a particular threat to the maritime and environmental security in the Baltic Sea region and globally. This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.”"

The incident on the Petrovietnam-operated platform happened while a subcontractor was cleaning and dismantling the platform. According to reports, the fire was brought under control within 30 minutes and did not impact the surrounding environment or other oil and gas operations at the surrounding oil projects, which continued to work normally. The Song Doc field had been depleted and ceased operations in February 2024, with no production activities being conducted at the time of the fire. The cause of the fire is being investigated. The small-scale oil field, located about 205 km south of Ca Mau Cape, was discovered in 2006 and had a peak output of around 28,000 barrels per day. The license for the block was initially awarded to Talisman, Petronas Carigali, and PetroVietnam, which formed the Truong Son Joint Operating Company to operate the block. The contract for the well plug and abandonment services, as well as the removal of the platform, was awarded to Petrovietnam Technical Services Corporation and Petrovietnam Drilling.

        "content": "Estonia has launched a €25m ($28.3m) government grant designed to encourage the reconstruction and greening of passenger and cargo ships, tugboats and other port and auxiliary vessels in Estonian ports. This makes Estonia one of the few countries in Europe offering direct financial support in the form of state aid for ship retrofitting. The new grant, enacted by Estonia’s minister of infrastructure, Kuldar Leis, provides shipowners and operators with subsidies covering 15% to 30% of eligible retrofit costs, up to a maximum of €5m per project. For instance, in order to qualify for a 30% support rate, the vessel must be converted into a zero-emission ship. Additionally, factors such as the ship’s flag state and how frequently it visits local ports also influence the rate of support. “Global demand for cleaner maritime transport is growing rapidly. Estonian marine industry companies have the expertise and experience to deliver world-class retrofit services and support shipowners in making their fleets more environmentally friendly,” said Leis. “From design and technical consulting to implementation and maintenance, Estonian ports offer convenient and efficient hubs for retrofit projects.”"

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "A new study by Scope3 emissions tracking specialist VesselBot reveals that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at major global ports continue to rise despite technological advancements and sustainability investments. The report shows Shanghai port recorded the highest emissions (see chart below) at 140,000 tons, surpassing Singapore despite handling fewer vessels, highlighting that vessel numbers don’t directly correlate with emission levels. Port congestion and inefficient operations significantly impact emissions, with US ports reporting the highest congestion levels, particularly in January and February 2025, driven by preemptive shipping ahead of new tariff implementations. “This report reveals the complex relationship between port activity and emissions,” said Constantine Komodromos, CEO and founder of VesselBot. “Our data shows that while more vessels generally mean more emissions, performance and operational efficiency are crucial mitigating factors.” The study quantifies how port shape, terminal availability, vessel dwell times, and engine utilisation during idle periods significantly influence emission levels beyond simple vessel counts. Research published last year by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) shows the potential lives saved from more coordinated port arrivals. Over several years, HKUST studied the impact of maritime emissions on mortality, concluding that 90,000 premature deaths worldwide annually can be attributed to air pollution from ships. The university has since studied a sub-set of those emissions: the emissions caused by the practice of sailing fast and then waiting, and concluded that for every 1% of anchorage emissions reduced, around 400 premature deaths worldwide can be avoided. Getting rid of the sailing fast then waiting practice entirely could prevent more than 10,000 premature deaths annually, the research showed. Another related study published last year made a strong case for shore power at ports across the world. Issued by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), an NGO from Washington DC, the study is the first nationwide American port emissions screening for at-berth vessels. Using the ICCT’s systematic assessment of vessel emissions model and automatic identification system (AIS) data, the study estimated how much pollution is emitted by at-berth vessels and then researchers identified US ports where investments in shore power could meaningfully improve air quality in nearby communities. The study’s estimates show that in the absence of shore power, at-berth vessels emitted approximately 27,000 tonnes of combined air pollutants (NOX, SOX, and PM10) and more than 1.4m tonnes of CO2 in 2019. Of the 129 ports considered in this analysis, 43 high-priority ports and port groups overlapped with lower-income census tracts and areas that do not meet US Environmental Protection Agency air quality standards. The 22-page working paper makes a strong case for shore power – also known as cold ironing or alternative maritime power – to allow at-berth vessels to plug into the local electrical grid and turn off auxiliary engines that would otherwise burn fossil fuel to power essential operations and emit greenhouse gases and air pollutants."

Using the 2022-promulgated Economic Security Promotion Act, Tokyo will aim to revive dormant shipbuilding and repair docks and support the construction of new shipbuilding facilties both at home and overseas. Tokyo and Washington are also close to establishing a Japan-US Shipbuilding Revitalization Fund, with Japanese yards pitching to build car carriers and LNG vessels, as well as investing in yards in the US. The two nations are also discussing naval ships and icebreakers, as well as ways to build a maritime supply chain between Japan and the US that is not dependent on China. China currently holds 70% of global shipbuilding capacity and nearly 90% of repair capacity. Japan’s share of shipbuilding volume was about 50% in the early 1990s, but has now fallen to around 10%. Both Japan and South Korea have been holding many meetings with US officials in recent months to try and pivot away from China’s maritime dominance. In October, the Trump administration is set to enact increased port fees on Chinese-linked tonnage calling in the US, one of a host of measures the US government is taking to try and curb China’s growing maritime power."

The Stamatis Tsantanis-led spinoff of Seanergy Maritime said in its quarterly earnings report that it had injected additional capital into a Norwegian-based joint venture set up to design and build the ECV earmarked for offshore wind and subsea markets, with delivery expected in the second quarter of 2027. The newbuild order was executed last year in partnership with the founders of Wind Energy Construction and Norwind Offshore, and with the support of RGI Marine’s cornerstone investor, United Maritime. United had previously committed $8.5m, which has now been increased to about $10m, or some 30% stake in the project. The additional investment was financed by a $2m short-term bridge loan from Seanergy Maritime, which should be repaid from the previously announced sale of the 2004-built capesize bulker Gloriuship. Established in 2022, United operates a fleet of eight bulkers. The company previously ventured into the tanker sector with the purchase of two 2006-built aframaxes and two 2008-built LR2s for $79.5m, which were later on sold at nearly $60m profit. “This represents a key milestone in our broader strategy to diversify our earnings base beyond dry bulk,” said United’s chief executive and chairman, Tsantanis, adding that the company views the move as a “forward-looking investment with the potential to unlock long-term value”."

In October, Lila Global sold theLila Frontier—a 2004-built sister ship—for approximately $16m, reaping an estimated $4m profit from that transaction. Just last week, market sources linked Lila Global to the acquisition of two 2007-built Hyundai Mipo MR tankers in a $28m en bloc deal, further expanding its exposure to the mid-size product tanker sector. Lila Global’s recent moves signal a tactical rebalancing of its fleet. Known primarily for its dry bulk focus, the company added two capesize bulkers earlier this year—theMaran SailorandMaran Odyssey, both built in 2006 and acquired for $19m apiece. Until recently, its fleet was dominated by bulkers, with 29 such vessels on its books. However, with tanker charter markets showing resilience and asset values firming up, especially for modern or specialised tonnage, Lila Global appears to be diversifying its exposure to capitalise on more liquid opportunities in the wet sector. Fleet valuation service VesselsValue now pegs Lila Global’s fleet at 36 ships valued at approximately $540m, highlighting the company’s rapid portfolio growth and strategic repositioning. Lila Global’s growing prominence in the asset play arena complements the legacy of its sister firm GMS, the world’s largest cash buyer of end-of-life ships. While GMS focuses on ship recycling and demolition markets, Lila Global appears intent on carving out a reputation as a nimble and adaptive player in active shipownership, particularly in niche and opportunistic asset classes."

The Hong Kong-based tonnage provider has reportedly converted its previous order at HD Hyundai Heavy Industries for a pair of 88,000 cu m VLACs into two 157,000 dwt suezmax tankers. Originally placed in October 2024, the debut deal saw the owner of more than 70 ships paying around $126m per newbuild. The suezmaxes, however, will cost about $86m apiece, with deliveries set for June and September of 2027. The newbuilding switch takes Cido’s suezmax orderbook at HD Hyundai yards to six, with four ships contracted in July 2024 at a reported price of $91m each and deliveries in 2026 and 2027."

Compounding the situation, low water levels on the Rhine are limiting barge capacity, particularly out of Antwerp and Rotterdam—further straining inland logistics. Major gateways including Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and Bremerhaven are now grappling with escalating backlogs, as containerships face mounting delays. At the Port of Antwerp-Bruges, operations were further strained by a nationwide strike on May 20. The issue isn’t limited to Europe. Similar patterns are emerging in Shenzhen, Los Angeles, and New York, where the number of containerships awaiting berth has been increasing over the past three weeks, according to Drewry. “Port delays are stretching transit times, disrupting inventory planning, and pushing shippers to carry extra stock,” Drewry noted. Meanwhile, carriers are rerouting vessels and introducing congestion-related surcharges. Adding to the pressure, the transpacific eastbound trade is showing signs of an early peak season, fuelled by a 90-day pause in US–China tariffs, set to expire on July 9."

        "content": "A coalition of major global car carrier operators, known as the Global Ro-Ro Community (GRC), has announced the release of a unified set of guidelines aimed at accurately calculating their fleets’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity. The new initiative has been developed in partnership with the international non-profit Smart Freight Centre (SFC). The six founding members of the GRC—Eastern Car Liner, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line), Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL), Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), Wallenius Wilhelmsen, and ClassNK—have jointly unveiled the guidelines to create a standardised methodology for calculating Scope 3 emissions. These emissions account for indirect GHG outputs across a company’s value chain and are often the most challenging to measure accurately. With growing global interest in tracking the full carbon footprint of goods and services, consistent and transparent reporting methods have become critical. Until now, maritime transport has lacked a harmonised standard for emissions calculation, resulting in inconsistent data and limited progress toward meaningful emissions reductions. The GRC’s new guidelines are based on the internationally recognised ISO 14083 standard and align with the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) framework. “The release of this standard is a milestone not just for our industry, but for global supply chains,” said representatives from the GRC in a joint statement. “By harmonizing how we calculate and report emissions, we’re empowering shippers, carriers, and regulators to make more informed decisions and drive collective climate action.” According to SFC, the next phase will involve collecting real-world performance data on a ship-by-ship basis to generate precise average emission intensity figures for the sector."

The initiative supports Romania’s goal of establishing at least 3 GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2035. The planned study will assess a range of factors including wind potential, marine geotechnical conditions, environmental and biodiversity impacts, and grid connection possibilities. In addition, the study will evaluate how offshore wind projects could coexist with other maritime activities such as fishing, and will consider logistical, security, and transport-related challenges. The ministry is working closely with international partners, including the World Bank and the European Commission, to ensure the success of the project. Energy Minister Sebastian Burduja emphasized the strategic importance of the Black Sea in enhancing Romania’s energy independence and regional influence. “The Black Sea is a strategic energy resource for our country, which we have capitalised on too little so far, but which can become an essential pillar of national and regional energy security,” said Burduja. He highlighted that the initiative is part of a broader effort to modernize Romania’s energy infrastructure. “This call launched by the Ministry of Energy is part of the construction of a new energy architecture for our country,” he added. “The study we are preparing will be the basis for strategic decisions on the concession of offshore perimeters and will provide investors with a clear, scientifically-based vision in accordance with international best practices.” Burduja encouraged stakeholders—including companies, consortiums, and research institutions—to engage in the process, stating, “Together we will transform the potential of the Black Sea into a real engine of the energy transition in Romania.”"

        "content": "The depressed liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier sector sees nearly 60 vessels, according to data from Clarksons Research. In a striking sign of shifting market fundamentals, shipowners—particularly in South Korea—have begun sending older, less efficient LNG carriers to the scrapyards in increasing numbers. According to leading shipbroker Clarksons, four LNG steam turbine ships were sold for demolition in the past week by two South Korean owners. These include two 135,000 cu m steam turbine vessels—Hyundai AquapiaandHyundai Technopia—both built around the turn of the millennium. The ships were sold en bloc for recycling at a price of approximately $565 per light displacement ton (ldt), fetching roughly $19.2m each. In a parallel deal, Hyundai LNG Shipping also soldHL Ras LaffanandHL Sur, both built in 2000, under similar terms. All four vessels are now headed for dismantling in South Asia as part of a broader strategic withdrawal from aging, economically unviable tonnage. With these additions, seven LNG carriers—totaling around 830,000 cu m—have been recycled in the first five months of 2025, nearing the full-year tally of eight vessels (960,000 cu m) in 2024. Market observers suggest the uptick in recycling is driven by the widening performance gap between legacy steam turbine ships and modern, fuel-efficient two-stroke or tri-fuel diesel electric (TFDE) vessels. Older ships are increasingly struggling to compete in today’s spot market, where emissions regulations and fuel efficiency weigh heavily on chartering decisions. At present, headline charter rates tell a stark story: TFDE LNG carriers are averaging about $15,000 a day, while newer two-stroke designs command closer to $30,000 a day, well below sustainable levels for many operators—particularly those holding aging tonnage. The subdued demand is contributing to an accumulation of idle vessels. Nearly 60 LNG carriers are currently inactive, with some market sources indicating a portion may soon follow their older counterparts to the breakers."

Poland was forced yesterday to intervene after a ship from the Russian shadow fleet was seen performing suspicious manoeuvres near a power cable connecting Poland with Sweden. Meanwhile, Estonia and Russia have been threatening each other over attempts by the Baltic state to clamp down on shadow tankers, something that saw both militaries chase after tankers in recent days. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for Russian president Vladimir Putin, told reporters yesterday that Russia would defend its vessels in the Baltic. “As recent events related to an attempted pirate attack on one of the tankers have shown, Russia has demonstrated it is capable of responding quite harshly,” Peskov said. This was not the first time Estonia’s tactics have been labelled as pirate actions this week. At a United Nations Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss maritime, Russian representative Vasily Nebenzya called out Estonia’s decision to pursue a shadow tanker as “comparable to piracy”. At the same Security Council meeting, António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, commented: “As threats to maritime security are becoming more complex and interconnected, enhanced coordination and stronger maritime governance are essential.” Nice in the south of France is set to host the 2025 UN Ocean Conference next month. “Without maritime security, there can be no global security,” Guterres stressed. Seabed gas pipelines, power cables and fibre optic cables have all been attacked – likely by merchant ships dragging their anchors – in recent months across the Baltic, forcing NATO to establish Baltic Sentry, a naval protection operation. Baltic Sentry involves a range of assets, including frigates, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and drones. A joint statement from the heads of state or government of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden earlier this year noted: “Russia’s use of the so-called shadow fleet poses a particular threat to the maritime and environmental security in the Baltic Sea region and globally. This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.”"

Headquartered in Aberdeen, the company has won a combination of new contracts, extensions, and renewals to deliver advisory, design, execution, and operational services for major energy, mining, and infrastructure projects across Australia, Brunei, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Timor Leste, and the Philippines. Among the key awards is a long-term maintenance contract with Esso in Victoria’s Gippsland Basin, aimed at enhancing the operational performance of both onshore and offshore assets. Wood was also selected to provide brownfield engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCm) services for Shell’s Prelude Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility off the coast of Western Australia—the world’s largest floating offshore gas platform. Additionally, the firm secured a front-end engineering design (FEED) contract for Singapore’s second LNG terminal, supporting Singapore LNG Corporation in bolstering the nation’s energy infrastructure and LNG supply security. Ralph Ellis, Wood president of Asia Pacific operations, said: “Demand for energy and resources in the Asia Pacific region continues to soar…We see continued demand for integrated engineering, project delivery and operations solutions across every stage of the asset life cycle. Our pipeline of opportunities underpins Wood’s continued growth in the region.” Wood has been the target of a prolonged takeover attempt by Middle Eastern firm Sidara, which is reportedly considering an offer of around 35p per share, valuing the company at approximately $320. The deal, which has been extended multiple times, includes taking on Wood’s outstanding debt of about $1.1bn, and a capital boost from Sidara of some $450m."

Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for Russian president Vladimir Putin, told reporters yesterday that Russia would defend its vessels in the Baltic. “As recent events related to an attempted pirate attack on one of the tankers have shown, Russia has demonstrated it is capable of responding quite harshly,” Peskov said. This was not the first time Estonia’s tactics have been labelled as pirate actions this week. At a United Nations Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss maritime, Russian representative Vasily Nebenzya called out Estonia’s decision to pursue a shadow tanker as “comparable to piracy”. At the same Security Council meeting, António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, commented: “As threats to maritime security are becoming more complex and interconnected, enhanced coordination and stronger maritime governance are essential.” Nice in the south of France is set to host the 2025 UN Ocean Conference next month. “Without maritime security, there can be no global security,” Guterres stressed. Seabed gas pipelines, power cables and fibre optic cables have all been attacked – likely by merchant ships dragging their anchors – in recent months across the Baltic, forcing NATO to establish Baltic Sentry, a naval protection operation. Baltic Sentry involves a range of assets, including frigates, submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and drones. A joint statement from the heads of state or government of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden earlier this year noted: “Russia’s use of the so-called shadow fleet poses a particular threat to the maritime and environmental security in the Baltic Sea region and globally. This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.”"

        "content": "The Liberian-flagged container shipMSC Elsa 3has sunk approximately 38 nautical miles southwest of Kochi, with concerns growing over potential environmental fallout along Kerala’s coast. The 28-year-old, 184 m long vessel, en route from Vizhinjam to the Port of Cochin, began listing severely early Saturday. The ship, which carried 640 containers—including 13 with hazardous cargo—and over 450 metric tonnes of marine fuel, eventually capsized and sank on Sunday morning, about 14.6 nautical miles offshore. The vessel issued a distress call at 08:00 UTC on Saturday after reporting a 26-degree list to starboard. Indian Navy and Coast Guard teams mounted a swift response, rescuing 21 crew members on Saturday and the remaining three early Sunday as conditions worsened. “The weather was rough, and there must have been some internal issues within the vessel,” said Captain Alexander Ivanov, the MSC ship’s master. “We are grateful to the Indian Navy and Coast Guard for their efforts and flawless communication.” The incident has triggered a high-level environmental response. Over 100 containers are believed to have fallen into the Arabian Sea, with at least 25 confirmed adrift and drifting at an estimated speed of 3 km/h toward coastal districts including Alappuzha, Kollam, Ernakulam, and Thiruvananthapuram. Some of these containers contain hazardous substances such as calcium carbide, prompting urgent coastal alerts. Several containers have already washed ashore, although the total number remains unclear. Authorities have confirmed the leakage of marine fuels—367.1 tonnes of Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) and 84.44 tonnes of diesel. While no major oil slick has been reported yet, the Indian Coast Guard has deployed two vessels and a Dornier aircraft to monitor the situation and spray chemical dispersants. The operation is being led under the National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan. TheMSC Elsa 3, built in Germany in 1997 and operated by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), has a checkered maritime history. Formerly known asJan Richter, the vessel has undergone nine name changes and was previously involved in a collision near Yemen in 2016 and a pirate attack near Nigeria in 2021. Vessels in the region have been advised to avoid the last known position of the sunken ship and to maintain heightened vigilance for drifting containers and potential fuel slicks."

        "content": "The medium range (MR) tanker sale and purchase sector is showing signs of heightened activity. A growing number of Korean-built MR tankers—both older and newer—are being put up for sale, leading to a saturated market of sale candidates. Yet, prices have held surprisingly steady, buoyed by persistent demand for tonnage. Japanese shipping giant Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) is among the notable sellers, having recently offloaded its 14-year-old zinc-coated, 47,000 dwt MR tankerWorld Navigator, built by Hyundai Mipo. According to data from shipbroker Clarksons, the vessel was sold to Greek interests for around $17m, with surveys due. The transaction marks a further softening in the market, following the $18m sale of a sister vessel under similar conditions just last month. While the decline in pricing for older, non-eco MR tankers reflects weakening asset values, broker sources note that average secondhand prices remain relatively resilient. However, expectations of further price erosion persist amid oversupply and muted freight rates. This month has seen a shift in deal structure. Unlike April, which was dominated by en bloc sales, May’s transactions have mostly involved individual vessels, with deals taking place across a geographically diverse set of buyers and sellers. Clarksons also reports that average earnings for non-eco MR tankers currently sit at $19,321 per day—down significantly from the $27,589 daily average seen in 2024. Despite the softer earnings environment, market participants say fundamentals remain viable, sustaining a steady pace of transactions. As the market adjusts to the dual forces of falling values and ongoing demand, industry players are watching closely to see whether the resilience in pricing will continue—or give way to broader corrections in the months ahead."

Signed on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit, the deal marks a major step toward regional energy integration and supports the ASEAN Power Grid initiative. The trilateral pact links Malaysia’s Malaysian Energy Consortium (MYEC)—a joint venture between Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) and Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas)—Vietnam’s Petrovietnam Technical Services Corporation (PTSC), and Singapore’s Sembcorp Utilities, a subsidiary of Sembcorp Industries. The collaboration aims to tap into Vietnam’s rich offshore wind resources to generate renewable electricity, which would be transmitted via subsea cables to Peninsular Malaysia, with future extensions potentially reaching Singapore. As part of the agreement, the three parties will conduct joint feasibility studies focusing on grid interconnection, transmission infrastructure, and the integration of energy storage systems to ensure stable power delivery. The initiative will be closely coordinated with national regulators and is poised to contribute significantly to regional energy security and the transition to net-zero emissions. “This tripartite partnership is a milestone in developing cross-border green infrastructure. It supports our ambition to build an electricity transit hub for the ASEAN Power Grid,” said MYEC representatives Datuk Ir. Megat Jalaluddin Megat Hassan and Tan Sri Tengku Muhammad Taufik, CEO of Petronas in a joint statement. Vietnam is emerging as a key renewable energy hub in the region, with the government prioritising offshore wind development as part of its national energy strategy. “This agreement reflects PTSC and Petrovietnam’s role in driving Vietnam’s energy transition. It marks a new phase of renewable energy investment,” said Tran Ho Bac, general director of PTSC. Meanwhile, Singapore, which aims to import 6GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, views the agreement as a critical move toward securing sustainable energy sources. “This initiative reaffirms Singapore’s role as a regional energy hub and supports our emissions reduction commitments,” added Wong Kim Yin, Group CEO of Sembcorp Industries."

The buying spree, described as the busiest of 2025 so far, includes a mix of chartered vessels MSC is now taking ownership of, and strategic second-hand purchases amid a cooling charter market. Among the most high-profile deals, MB Shipbrokers confirmed that MSC has bid $38.5m for the Navios Tempo, a 4,249 teu panamax containership built in 2010 by New Yangzijiang Shipbuilding and sold by Navios Maritime Partners. VesselsValue data also reveals that MSC has exercised purchase options on a fleet of seven panamax vessels, each with a capacity of about 4,100 teu and built in 2002 by Samsung Heavy Industries. The ships — MSC Katya R, MSC Vidisha R, MSC Julia R, MSC Anisha R, MSC Arushi R, MSC Zlata R, and MSC Vaishnavi R — were previously owned by John Fredriken’s SFL Corporation, a longtime MSC partner. In the post-panamax segment, MSC has acquired the MSC Aquarius and Athens Glory, two 6,492 teu ships built in 2003 by Japan’s IHI. Purchased from Cyprus Sea Lines at $44m apiece, both vessels are equipped with scrubbers. Another notable addition is the Dimitris Y, a 5,936 teu post-panamax built in 2000 by Kvaerner Warnow Werft in Germany. MSC acquired the vessel from Global Ship Lease for $36m, making it the oldest vessel in this latest wave of acquisitions. Industry observers note that many of these vessels were already on charter to MSC, aligning with the company’s strategy of securing operational control over familiar assets."

        "content": "How hybrid connectivity unlocks the future of maritime operations. By Tristan Wood, founder and CEO of connectivity specialists Livewire Digital. A decade ago, the idea of a crew member’s smartphone on the bridge sparked panic among ship operators worried about data bills, security breaches and social-media distractions. Yet today, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) has become standard practice: seafarers use tablets for navigation updates, smartphones for urgent messaging, even GoPros for live‐deck feeds. BYOD taught us that empowering individuals with modern tools elevates safety and productivity at sea. But as devices proliferate, they highlight the limits of single‐connection networks. A tablet might display the latest weather chart, but if the vessel drifts beyond 5G coverage, or if weather conditions obfuscate a satellite connection, access is lost. In theory, in a maritime equivalent of Bring Your Own Network (BYON), vessel operators have a choice of available providers and service contracts, from LEO satellite terminals to private‐LTE , coastal 5G cells and portside Wi-Fi, releasing them from the ransom of any single carrier. Yet the real power of BYON only emerges with the realisation of hybrid connectivity, an invisible software defined layer that can bond diverse connections into a single, resilient super‐network. True hybrid – or heterogeneous connectivity – continuously evaluates throughput, latency and cost across every available link. Instead of forcing you to choose between satellite or cellular, it bonds them all – GEO, MEO and LEO satellites, microwave hops, in-port fibre and 5G, into one virtual pipeline. That aggregation boosts total bandwidth and minimises latency. For example, a bulk carrier sailing from Asia to Europe can seamlessly mix a high-speed Ka-band feed, low-latency coastal 5G and resilient L-band back-ups, all without the crew, passengers or shore teams noticing any disruption. This synergy between BYON and hybrid connectivity paves the way for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). Regulators in Europe have begun authorising remote‐control trials for tugs and short‐sea ferries, and the likes of Lloyds Register are racing to certify autonomy rulebooks. Such vessels depend on uninterrupted streams of high-definition radar, lidar and electro-optical camera data, fused with digital twins and monitored by shoreside operators ready to intervene within milliseconds. Any disruption or break in communications can compromise the feedback loop, turning a routine automated manoeuvre into a safety and compliance nightmare. Heterogeneous connectivity’s real-time bonding gives quantum power to the idea of BYON. Software enabled RazorLink detects link degradation in milliseconds and instantly migrates traffic to the next best route, maintaining encryption and session integrity. For an autonomous ferry charging across a busy channel at 25 knots, this means collision-avoidance commands arrive without delay. For a remote diagnostic session on a drilling rig, it means full-resolution video and telemetry streams never drop. The upside goes well beyond improved safety. Shore-based engineers in Oslo can now monitor a gearbox on a bulk carrier off Brazil in real time, avoiding expensive maintenance port calls. Routing software draws on live swell and wind data instead of outdated forecasts, slashing both fuel use and carbon emissions. Meanwhile, thousands of cruise passengers enjoy seamless, always-on internet without giving a second thought to the complex network that keeps them connected. Cyber-security teams deploy critical patches fleet-wide in seconds, confident that no vessel will stall midway through an update. In an era of geopolitical uncertainty and concerns over network sovereignty, this agnostic resilience is absolutely crucial. Redundancy has steered ships for centuries: twin engines, double hulls and multiple navigation aids. Today, the digital bridge demands the same discipline, confidence and peace of mind. BYOD unlocked individual productivity, BYON gave operators control over their connectivity, and hybrid bonding knits it all into a seamless, bearer-agnostic ecosystem. Mastering that synergy will turn the dream of truly autonomous, safe, zero-incident shipping into reality, where every device, every sensor and every ship enjoys unlimited connectivity."

We’ve been busy this month compiling a magazine you can pick up at Nor-Shipping identifying how ships will operate and look like in 2035. In doing this, we wanted to seek the views of owners, operators, charterers, managers, specialist service providers, and, most importantly seafarers. Too often the gizmos and hardware being installed on ships do not seek enough input and feedback from the folk who are actually going to have to use them. If you design in isolation, you create cost, resistance, and risk. I reckon future platform companies will differentiate themselves by embedding operational feedback loops — including from crew — into design. We polled our readership on a huge range of topics to gauge opinion on how dramatically different ships coming out of shipyards in 10 years’ time will look like. The results? Readers seem to think the exteriors of 2035 newbuilds will look mighty similar to today. Yes, there might be some large fuel tanks on deck, and some form of wind propulsion, but overall ships are not set for a massive change in terms of overall shape. It is inside the vessel where everything is ready for a huge shake-up. Our own conclusion? Ships of the future will still cross oceans—but they’ll do it with some sails, and lots of sensors and software.

        "content": "Maritime identity laundering and the rise of so-called zombie vessels have evolved from a niche tactic into a “systemic enabler of large-scale sanctions evasion” with global authorities unable to keep up, according to a new report from Kpler, a maritime analytics platform. “Zombie vessels represent the bleeding edge of maritime deception – combining digital obfuscation with recycled identities to operate beyond the reach of law and oversight,” wrote Dimitris Kotsias, a market analyst, in the new Kpler report. These ships operate under the stolen identities of vessels long since scrapped, enabling the large-scale evasion of international sanctions and posing grave risks to global maritime safety and regulation. This emerging tactic has evolved into a systemic enabler of illicit trade, with increasingly sophisticated methods of identity laundering now commonplace within the shadow fleet. Without decisive action, identity laundering risks becoming institutionalized within global trade flows Vessel identity laundering is a process where a ship’s real identity is hidden through the manipulation of Automatic Identification System (AIS) signals, hijacked registration numbers, or the reuse of IMO numbers from decommissioned ships. At the most deceptive edge of this practice lies the zombie vessel—a real ship operating under the false identity of a vessel that has already been legally dismantled. In March 2025, the sanctioned VLCCVeronica IIIbegan broadcasting asDS Vector, a tanker scrapped in 2018. By falsifying its AIS signals in the Caribbean and conducting dark ship-to-ship (STS) transfers off Venezuela,Veronica IIIsuccessfully loaded high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) and masked its true origin. This wasn’t an isolated case. In April and May 2025,Veronica IIIreceived three HSFO cargoes from three smaller tankers ferrying oil from the El Palito and Cardon refineries in Venezuela. Satellite imagery confirmed the covert STS transfers. Similarly, the suezmax tankerApushas assumed the identity ofFresia I, a vessel scrapped years ago, allowing it to load Venezuelan cargo under a false name. These deceptive practices pose significant safety and environmental hazards, Kpler warned. Zombie vessels typically lack proper registration, insurance, and compliance with international safety regulations. Their outdated systems and blacked-out AIS transponders heighten the risk of maritime collisions. Furthermore, their anonymity means no clear liability in the event of oil spills or other environmental catastrophes. Worse yet, these vessels may be mistaken as hostile in conflict zones due to their falsified signals, creating risks of accidental military engagement or detention. The rise of zombie vessels also undermines the effectiveness of international sanctions. Grey fleet tankers commonly engage in unreported ship-to-ship (STS) transfers in international waters, rendering the tracking of sanctioned oil flows difficult, if not impossible. Kpler reports that deceptive activity—including AIS spoofing and identity laundering—has surged since 2022, directly correlating with expanded Western sanctions. Efforts to curb these practices are underway. The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) recently prohibited the reuse of IMO numbers from scrapped ships and increased scrutiny on identity changes. However, enforcement remains reactive and slow-moving compared to the rapid evolution of evasion tactics. Experts suggest that only a globally coordinated response backed by advanced technology can begin to address the growing threat. Emerging tools include machine-learning systems for satellite image analysis, cross-border vessel tracking databases, and mandatory AIS integrity checks at ports. Still, the grey fleet and the rise of zombie vessels continue to outpace regulatory capabilities with Kpler’s Kotsias writing: “They highlight an urgent need for global enforcement synchronization, advanced verification technologies, and real-time maritime intelligence. As regulatory frameworks slowly adapt, the burden of detection increasingly falls on proprietary tracking tools and robust market surveillance systems … Without decisive action, identity laundering risks becoming institutionalized within global trade flows, eroding both safety and trust at sea.” “Unknowingly transacting with zombie ships exposes banks and commodity traders to significant legal, financial, reputational, and sanctions risks. These vessels are deliberately operated to deceive and exploit the unsuspecting,” warned Pole Star Global, another maritime data platform, in a recent social media posting. Global insurer Allianz also discussed the “challenges” brought about by zombie vessels, primarily linked to Venezuelan oil trades, in its just published Safety and Shipping Review, while Windward, another maritime analytics platform, has a recent whitepaper out covering the same topic. “Zombie vessels exploit a structural weakness in global maritime compliance: the industry’s overreliance on static identifiers like IMO numbers, vessel names, and flag registries. These data points were designed for uniqueness and permanence, but they weren’t built to withstand intentional manipulation,” Windward explained in its whitepaper, warning that identity laundering at sea is likely to increase. “Static sanctions compliance is no longer fit for purpose. The industry must evolve to prioritize dynamic intelligence, behavioral analysis, and context-rich decision-making,” Windward urged."

The ship ran aground just meters from a summer home in Byneset, narrowly avoiding significant property damage. The officer admitted to falling asleep while on watch at the time of the incident, which occurred around 5:30 a.m. local time. The grounding caused minor damage to the homeowner’s heating system but resulted in no injuries to the 16 crewmembers aboard. The Norwegian Maritime Authority and Trøndelag Police are investigating whether proper manning requirements and rest hours were maintained. TheNCL Salten, a 135 m container feeder vessel, was en route to Orkanger when it veered off course and ran aground in a busy stretch, having completed three port calls within the last 24 hours before the grounding. The ship remains embedded near the homeowner’s property with the Norwegian Coastal Administration overseeing the salvage operation. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about fatigue and watchkeeping practices in the maritime industry. The Norwegian Maritime Authority has previously issued safety messages emphasizing the importance of adhering to rest hour regulations and maintaining proper watchkeeping arrangements to prevent accidents ."

        "content": "Donald Trump backed down on histrade war with China, slashing tariffs by 115% for a 90-day period, leading to a huge box freight rate rise on the transpacific as shippers rushed to meet the deadline. The American president claimed on May 6 that after more than 17 months, theRed Sea shipping crisiswas coming to a close. Donald Trump said Yemen’s Houthis had agreed to halt their attacks on shipping and that Washington would in turn stop carrying out strikes on the Iran-backed rebels. However, the Houthis continue to adopt a belligerent tone, and most liners questioned at recent quarterly results have insisted it is still too early for any resumption of Red Sea transits. The shipping situation in theBalticis tense with Russia trading barbs with its neighbours and militaries getting involved. Poland was forced last week to intervene after a ship from the Russian shadow fleet was seen performing suspicious manoeuvres near a power cable connecting Poland with Sweden. Meanwhile, Estonia and Russia have been threatening each other over attempts by the Baltic state to clamp down on shadow tankers, something that saw both militaries chase after tankers in recent days. Italian tanker and bulker owner and operatorPremudahas concluded a management buyout led by its top executives. The deal spearheaded by chief executive Marco Fiori and chief of finance Enrico Barbieri has seen the acquisition of 100% of the share capital in the Genoa-based company for an undisclosed sum. The transaction is backed by Milan-based pan-European investor Pillarstone, which will stay on as a co-shareholder. May 1 saw theMediterranean Sea officially become an emission control area (ECA)for sulphur oxides (SOx). All vessels operating in the region must now comply with stricter environmental standards whereby they either use maximum 0.10% sulphur content in fuel, or use approved exhaust gas cleaning systems also known as scrubbers. In contrast to North and Baltic Sea ECAs as well as to the most recently agreed North Atlantic ECA, the Mediterranean ECA does not include nitrogen oxides. Shipping got an idea of how vessels could be constructed in the future this month with South Korea’s largest shipbuilder HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering tapping an American firm to gethumanoidsinvolved in the welding process while Dutch shipbuilder Damen set out to develop a 3D-printed workboat. With approval from the Danish Emergency Management Agency, DanPilot and Danelec started a test program forremote pilotage– the first of its kind in the world. The test program created by DanPilot and Danelec allows pilots to guide ships from land, using only advanced data transmitted directly from the vessels."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "René Kofod-Olsen, the CEO of V., writes for Splash today. Everything everywhere all at once. It’s not just the name of an Oscar-winning film but it’s also a fitting way to describe the state of the shipping industry today. On one hand, we’re grappling with unprecedented complexity, from geopolitical uncertainty and tightening regulations to market fluctuations and urgent environmental challenges. At the same time, we’re also seeing innovation at breakneck speeds, digitalisation at scale, cross-industry collaboration and new operational strategies transform the sector, paving the way for a more efficient and sustainable future. Historically, shipowners have managed their operations in-house and steered clear of outsourcing. But in today’s landscape, that operating model is becoming harder to sustain. Managing modern shipping operations now requires navigating multiple domains simultaneously – regulatory compliance, technological innovation, sustainability initiatives, and market volatility – creating a burden that stretches even well-resourced organisations thin. With only 16% of vessels currently under third-party management, many companies lack the scale or broad perspective needed to navigate these interconnected challenges. When these challenges and their impacts are global, shipping companies have to be able to take a similarly global view. The industry stands at a crossroads where strategic collaboration may offer a path to operational excellence and resilience. Professional ship managers bring the expertise, resources and global networks needed to address these challenges effectively. With dedicated departments focused on regulatory compliance, technological innovation and operational excellence, the right partner can offer vessel owners a proven alternative to managing these complex requirements in-house. Shipmanagers’ ability to distribute costs across multiple clients while leveraging economies of scale creates both the efficiency and expertise that individual owners often struggle to match independently. However, successful partnerships are built on more than good intentions – they require rigorous evaluation and selection. If they are to possibly meet the complexities of today’s maritime landscape, vessel owners seeking collaborative solutions must find partners who demonstrate consistent reliability, relevant experience, operational transparency and measurable results. These essential attributes not only distinguish capable maritime service providers but also ensure that the strategic collaborations – increasingly vital in our complex global environment – can deliver genuine value and lasting resilience for all stakeholders involved Take, for example, the rising cost of non-compliance with environmental regulations. EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, CII, and EEXI – all aimed at accelerating shipping’s decarbonisation – create a complex web of compliance requirements that demands sophisticated monitoring, reporting, and verification systems. With compliance stakes higher than ever, the expertise of professional shipmanagers is more valuable than ever. Shipmanagers can leverage their dedicated teams and technologies to provide what individual owners often cannot – a comprehensive, industry-wide perspective that anticipates regulatory shifts, identifies emerging compliance patterns, and implements solutions that keep vessels ahead of evolving standards rather than perpetually racing to catch up. Meanwhile, digital transformation has reached a critical point. Advanced fleet management, predictive maintenance, and AI-driven analytics are now essential to modern vessel operations. But these require significant investment – not just in technology, but in the expertise needed to implement and integrate them effectively. Again, scale is an advantage: ship managers can deploy these investments across larger fleets, creating a powerful data flywheel effect – where more vessels generate richer datasets, which improve algorithms, which deliver better insights, which attract more vessels. This virtuous cycle creates a cohesive digital ecosystem that captures the full operational picture – connecting data points across operations, maintenance, crew management and procurement that would otherwise remain isolated. The mounting operational complexity of modern shipping also directly impacts the human element at the heart of maritime operations. As vessels, regulations, and systems grow more intricate, effective crew retention, engagement and management can no longer be an afterthought. Experienced crewmembers have never been more valuable, or more difficult to retain. According to a DNV study, 81% of seafarers surveyed indicated they required partial or complete training to work with the advanced technologies entering their workplace. Professional managers can not only provide this essential training but also offer structured career pathways, access to state-of-the-art training facilities, and robust welfare programmes that allow seafarers to focus on their core responsibilities, delivering safe and efficient operations amid escalating complexity. The best shipmanagers are not just service providers – they are integrated partners. The siloed approach of the past, where technical, commercial, and operational decisions were made independently, no longer works. This shift isn’t just about cost, it’s about agility, resilience, and long-term success. The ability to consolidate services – from handling compliance to optimising procurement, from managing crew training to implementing new technologies – under a single partner offers vessel owners significant operational and strategic advantages in today’s complex maritime environment. More shipowners are recognising that professional managers do not reduce control. Rather, they enhance it, providing better oversight and fully connected services, spanning technical and crew management, compliance, crew welfare, procurement, technical services, insurance, digital technologies, and advisory services – all in an integrated platform to the benefit of their clients. The real question isn’t whether to outsource, but how quickly owners will adapt to the new reality and tilt the scale between challenge and opportunity in their favour. Those who act now, leveraging specialist expertise, integrated digital systems, and economies of scale, will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly complex world."

        "content": "The Liberian-flagged container shipMSC Elsa 3has sunk approximately 38 nautical miles southwest of Kochi, with concerns growing over potential environmental fallout along Kerala’s coast. The 28-year-old, 184 m long vessel, en route from Vizhinjam to the Port of Cochin, began listing severely early Saturday. The ship, which carried 640 containers—including 13 with hazardous cargo—and over 450 metric tonnes of marine fuel, eventually capsized and sank on Sunday morning, about 14.6 nautical miles offshore. The vessel issued a distress call at 08:00 UTC on Saturday after reporting a 26-degree list to starboard. Indian Navy and Coast Guard teams mounted a swift response, rescuing 21 crew members on Saturday and the remaining three early Sunday as conditions worsened. “The weather was rough, and there must have been some internal issues within the vessel,” said Captain Alexander Ivanov, the MSC ship’s master. “We are grateful to the Indian Navy and Coast Guard for their efforts and flawless communication.” The incident has triggered a high-level environmental response. Over 100 containers are believed to have fallen into the Arabian Sea, with at least 25 confirmed adrift and drifting at an estimated speed of 3 km/h toward coastal districts including Alappuzha, Kollam, Ernakulam, and Thiruvananthapuram. Some of these containers contain hazardous substances such as calcium carbide, prompting urgent coastal alerts. Several containers have already washed ashore, although the total number remains unclear. Authorities have confirmed the leakage of marine fuels—367.1 tonnes of Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) and 84.44 tonnes of diesel. While no major oil slick has been reported yet, the Indian Coast Guard has deployed two vessels and a Dornier aircraft to monitor the situation and spray chemical dispersants. The operation is being led under the National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan. TheMSC Elsa 3, built in Germany in 1997 and operated by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), has a checkered maritime history. Formerly known asJan Richter, the vessel has undergone nine name changes and was previously involved in a collision near Yemen in 2016 and a pirate attack near Nigeria in 2021. Vessels in the region have been advised to avoid the last known position of the sunken ship and to maintain heightened vigilance for drifting containers and potential fuel slicks."

The Oslo-listed company is adding the 2006-builtNganhurrafor an undisclosed sum in a transaction that involves a modest initial payment, with further compensation contingent upon the vessel’s successful redeployment by June 2027. Earlier this year, the company sold the FPSOBW Pioneerto a subsidiary of US oil and gas player Murphy Oil for $125m. BW Offshore highlighted that the acquisition enhances its ability to deliver competitive and timely redeployment solutions, aligning with several visible project opportunities expected over the next few years and also reinforces its strategic positioning versus industry competitors. “The acquisition of the FPSO Nganhurra represents a strategic decision to capitalise on a compelling market opportunity. Given the limited availability of suitable FPSOs for redeployment, securing this unit places BW Offshore in a strong, competitive position,” said Marco Beenen, chief executive of BW Offshore. The 2006 Samsung Heavy Industries-built unit has a production capacity of 100,000 bpd and a storage capacity of 900,000 barrels. The vessel operated for Woodside at the Enfield field offshore Western Australia until 2018 and was later laid up outside Labuan in Malaysia. In July 2022,Yinson Productionagreed with BP to reserve the unit for a planned project offshore Angola. The arrangement granted Yinson an exclusive option to purchase the FPSO, valid through December 31, 2022, with the possibility for BP to extend the option. The agreement also included the potential for a 10-year lease-and-operate contract."

        "content": "Allianz’s latest Safety and Shipping Review makes a stark warning about the dangers posed to the global merchant fleet by the worsening geopolitical climate. “While still posing major challenges and concerns, traditional causes of maritime losses, such as fires and collisions, have decreased over time. However, geopolitical tensions now pose a substantial threat that could offset these gains,” the Allianz report noted, adding: “The industry faces a complex environment marked by attacks on shipping, vessel detentions, sanctions and damages to infrastructure such as critical sub-sea cables, while reports of vessels experiencing GPS interference and jamming are increasing. Insurers have seen a clear increase in large claims related to conflicts, notably from the war in Ukraine and Middle East tensions.” In better news, the large annual report reveals a significant milestone in maritime safety: the global fleet experienced a record low of 27 total losses in 2024, a 20% decrease from the previous year and a 75% decline from 2015 levels. The report highlights that the South China Sea, Indochina, Indonesia, and the Philippines remain the most perilous, accounting for nearly a third of the vessels lost in 2024. Other high-risk areas include the British Isles and the East Mediterranean and Black Sea, each reporting four total losses. Over the past decade, these regions collectively contributed to 681 of the 729 total losses recorded globally. Fishing vessels were the most affected, representing 40% of total losses. Foundering (sinking) was the leading cause of these losses, accounting for 50%, with fires/explosions ranking second at 26%. Notably, over 100 total losses in the past decade have been attributed to fire-related incidents. While total losses have decreased, the number of reported shipping incidents increased by approximately 10% in 2024, totalling 3,310 compared to 2,963 in 2023. The British Isles recorded the highest number of incidents (799), followed by the East Mediterranean and Black Sea (694). Over the past decade, the British Isles accounted for 20% of all reported incidents globally Machinery damage or failure was the predominant cause of incidents, responsible for over half of the reported cases (1,860). Fire and explosion incidents also saw a significant rise, with 250 reported in 2024—a 20% increase year-on-year and the highest total in a decade. This uptick is partly attributed to the transportation of lithium-ion batteries, commonly found in electric vehicles and other battery-powered cargo, which pose unique fire hazards. The review underscores the growing impact of geopolitical tensions on maritime safety. The conflict in Gaza, for instance, led to over 100 ships being targeted by Houthi militants in the Red Sea. Such incidents highlight the vulnerability of global shipping to proxy wars and regional disputes. Additionally, piracy is resurging off the Horn of Africa, further exacerbating security concerns. The report also discussed the rise of the shadow tanker fleet – vessels which often lack proper maintenance, insurance, and regulatory oversight, leading to increased risks of fires, engine failures, and collisions.Allianz estimates that the shadow fleet comprises between 600 to 1,400 vessels, many of which are at the end of their operational lives. Advancements in technology have introduced new challenges to maritime safety, Allianz noted. The use of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become more prevalent, posing threats to ships through potential attacks or surveillance. These technologies are relatively inexpensive and accessible, raising concerns about their misuse by non-state actors or proxy groups. Cybersecurity remains a critical issue, with increasing reports of GPS interference and AIS spoofing. These cyber threats can disrupt navigation systems and compromise vessel safety, necessitating robust cybersecurity measures and regular monitoring of technological vulnerabilities. Fire safety continues to be a significant concern for Allianz. The transport of lithium-ion batteries, particularly in electric vehicles, has led to a rise in onboard fires. These fires are challenging to extinguish and can reignite, posing severe risks to crew and vessel integrity. Many ships lack the necessary firefighting capabilities to address such incidents effectively. Experts advocate for enhanced crew training, improved early detection systems, and the development of purpose-built vessels designed to transport battery-powered cargo safely."

While these are disappointing figures for ship owners, they are not disastrous: owners can turn a decent operating profit at these levels. With nearly five months of the year gone, average earnings of $42,489 a day for VLCCs is only slightly down on $44,877 for the first five months of 2024, which included a bumper January average of over $57,500 a day.

Fleet tracker Kpler reported that Canada’s seaborne exports to China exceeded those to the US for the first time ever in May. Seaborne Canadian exports to China were 290 k bpd in April, while seaborne shipments to the US were 286 k bpd, according to Kpler. Exports from Canada’s west coast have been boosted by the trans-Mountain pipeline building up to nearly 900 k bpd. Canada still pipes around 4 Mn bpd to the US, with the northern neighbour benefiting from a halt in similarly heavy supplies from Venezuela to the US. China has imposed a 10% tariff on US oil, making Canadian alternatives competitive on price. Time will tell what that does to US-China oil freight rates. In the suezmax sector, the recent darling, the route from Guyana to ARA, faced its most difficult month since inception as demand fell and took freight rates with it, recording a 43% fall over 30 days to $28,826 per day on May 23, the lowest reading since the last day of January this year. Rates from West Africa to Europe for suezmax vessels also plunged by 44% to $29,752 in the same period, while cross-Med suezmax rates were down 13% to $36,970. Falling crude oil prices were reported to be supporting refinery throughput and margins, but in Europe refiners have not been rushing to build inventory. This reticence affected the aframax freight market too, with daily earnings from the North Sea to the UK down by 45% to $36,807 and from the North Sea to Germany down by 29% to $ 38,759. In the Caribs, aframax earnings fell by 56% to $22,803 while on the US Gulf to ARA route they were down by 47% to $25,429. Disappointment all round for owners then, but falling crude oil prices and the driving season to come offer some hope. The oil products tanker freight market also dipped in mid-May but recovered strongly so that by the 23rd, the BTCI stood at 724 points, up 8% on 669 recorded on April 23. Global CPP imports reached their highest point this year at a total of 37.1 Mn T for the week to May 23. Chinese refiners are said to be responding positively to falling crude oil prices which are driving up margins and production. With one week of May left, the monthly total Chinese CPP import figure of 8.3 Mn T is already level with 8.3 Mn T for all of April. As with the crude oil market, the Atlantic was weaker than the Pacific. For instance, the Baltic Exchange’s MR Atlantic Basket ended April at $25,709 a day, dipped to a low of $12,929 on May 19 and recovered to $22,394 on May 23. Meanwhile the MR Pacific Basket ended April at $18,070, was largely flat until May 14 then pushed up to $26,612 on May 23. With three quarters of global refining capacity now to be found East of Suez, oil market dynamics now favour products tanker markets in the east. The TCE for the benchmark LR2 voyage from the Mid East to Japan struggled in April and early May but climbed throughout the second half of May to reach $34,696 on May 25, some 32% higher than 30 days previously. Daily TCEs for LR1s on the same voyage lost 22% on the month to April 23 but gained 17% in the following 30 days to sit at a comfortable $29,047 per day. Mid-East refineries benefited from more and cheaper feedstock as OPEC producers in the region opened the spigots. Rates on TC20, the LR2 voyage from the Mid East to NW Europe, rose 26% over 30 days to May 25, sitting pretty at $38,568 per day. Indian refiners were able to take advantage of falling feedstock prices, pushing up throughput and thus demand for shipping. The freight costs for Jamnagar to Chiba rose 38% over the 30 days to May 25 from Worldscale 139 to WS 192. For an MR product tanker, that converts to a TCE rising 73% from $11,478 per day on April 23 to $19,875 on May 23. The seasonal pattern still suggests a steady downswing from here to the end of Q3. As Mr Trump continues to threaten tariffs and disrupt trade patterns, the freight market remains a curate’s egg, with owners’ and charterers’ minds alike spinning at the volatile nature of markets."

        "content": "The prospect of the United States lifting sanctions on Iran has dominated tanker trade headline all month. Recent developments, including US president Donald Trump’s comments suggesting a potential breakthrough in US-Iran nuclear negotiations, have raised expectations of increased Iranian crude exports. Kpler analysts project that a finalised deal could stabilise Iranian crude exports at approximately 1.65m barrels per day, with a potential upside of 100,000 barrels per day. In contrast, a no deal scenario may lead to a 500,000 barrels per day decline in exports by year-end. Currently, Iranian exports average 1.60m barrels per day, slightly lower than the second half of 2024 but still resilient. However, declining Chinese imports and increasing floating storage suggest market challenges. The lifting of sanctions would likely lead to increased Iranian crude exports, necessitating additional tanker capacity. Analysts at SEB, a Swedish bank, note that the return of Iranian crude to compliant markets could benefit the tanker sector, particularly crude tankers. However, the potential reopening of the Red Sea route may introduce new dynamics, potentially impacting tanker demand. Poten highlighted the significance of the Iranian-controlled tanker fleet and the broader dark fleet that has supported sanctioned trades over the past seven years. The return of National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) vessels to the international market could displace older, less efficient vessels, positively affecting tanker demand. However, NITC fleet’s aging vessels may require maintenance and vetting before re-entering the market. Broker Braemar suggested that a US-Iran nuclear deal could be bullish for VLCCs. The reactivation of floating storage and the cessation of ship-to-ship (STS) transfers for Iranian exports would likely increase demand for compliant tankers. Additionally, the potential for increased Iranian oil exports could put downward pressure on oil prices, influencing freight rates. Recent research from Gibson discussed the broader market impact, noting that increased Iranian oil on the water could pressure oil prices and affect shale producers in the US. This dynamic could complicate OPEC+ production policies and influence tanker demand patterns. Xclusiv Shipbrokers observed that a successful deal may accelerate the scrapping of older dark fleet vessels, leading to a reduction in the active tanker fleet. This reduction could improve overall market conditions by decreasing excess supply and enhancing fleet quality. The average age of vessels in the NITC fleet is 17 years, and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines operates ships averaging around 18 years old. Modernising Iran’s maritime fleet would require significant investment and time. The potential lifting of US sanctions on Iran presents both opportunities and challenges for the global tanker trade. While increased Iranian crude exports could boost tanker demand, the return of Iranian-controlled vessels and the broader dark fleet may introduce complexities. The tanker sector’s response will depend on factors such as fleet modernisation, maintenance requirements, and broader market dynamics."

        "content": "The port of Ningbo-Zhoushan in China, the world’s largest port in terms of cargo throughput, has announced three initiatives it has undertaken with three European ports — Hamburg and Wilhelmshaven in Germany, and Valencia in Spain — to create green shipping corridors. The ports involved will work with shipping lines, cargo owners, energy providers, research institutions and other stakeholders to promote zero-carbon technology, clean fuels and smart management systems on designated routes. Key actions include constructing and utilising shore power infrastructure, optimising freight distribution networks, adopting renewable energy solutions and scaling up clean fuel bunkering, with the goal of creating corridors with net-zero carbon emissions from starting port to terminal port. As of 2024, there were 62 green shipping corridor initiatives worldwide, marking a 40% increase from the previous year. These corridors are specific maritime routes where public and private stakeholders collaborate to facilitate zero-emission shipping. While many initiatives are still in the planning or pilot stages, some are advancing toward real-world implementation. Notably, six corridors have progressed from exploration to preparation phases, with feasibility studies, implementation roadmaps, and cost assessments underway. However, the expansion of these corridors faces challenges, particularly the feasibility wall—the financial and logistical hurdles associated with transitioning to zero-emission fuels. The lack of national policy incentives to bridge the cost gap is now identified as the primary bottleneck, potentially limiting further development of green corridor initiatives."

Chambriard clarified that this investment is a subset of Petrobras’ broader spending and is specifically aimed at boosting Brazil’s industrial base. She underscored the company’s commitment to reindustrialisation, job creation, and advancing local technology within the maritime and offshore value chains. The fleet expansion aligns with Petrobras’ plans for increased offshore production, particularly at the Búzios field, where output is projected to reach up to 2m bpd by 2030.

PIL managed total operating profits (EBIT) on container shipping activities of $1.3bn, after liner revenues nearly tripled year-on-year to $3.8bn. The resulting operating margin of 35.3% propels PIL to the top of the rankings for 2024 as a whole, above second place Evergreen Marine and the remaining publicly-reporting top carriers excluding privately-held MSC. PIL ranks 12th in size globally, with a current fleet of 97 ships equal to 423,720 teu, according to Alphaliner data. Moving from last year into Q1 2025, Alphaliner is reporting that the the average operating margin for the leading container carriers fell to its lowest level in four quarters, despite the front loading of cargo by American shippers."

        "content": "As the world waits for a US-China trade deal, it would appear that dry bulk trade is largely flatlining. The Baltic Dry Index looks like repeating last year’s performance of being the least volatile year since 1999. FFA traders have been complaining of a lack of volatility in the forward curve. They report a fear of enough oversupply to cap earnings but not enough to force earnings down to a level where owners begin to consider accelerating demolition plans for elderly tonnage. There has been some month on month movement in earnings. After Lunar New Year affected capesize markets, driving the average TCE for February down to $7,936, it rebounded in March to $20,802 only to subside in April to $16,022 then subside again in May so far to $15,437. On the Australia to China route, earnings were actually up 50% on May 23 compared to April 23, at $17,837 compared to $11,892, but the high percentage only indicates the mediocrity of the quanta. On the Brazil to China route, earnings fell 4% over 30 days to $14,574 on May 23. We’re on track for the least volatile year this century A dismal April for panamax bulk carriers was followed by an uninspiring March. In the Atlantic, the round voyage from and back to Europe sat at an opex-ish $9,873 a month ago, rose to $12,466 on May 9 then petered out, falling back to $9,805 on May 25. The trip out from Europe to China is basically unchanged for an entire month at $17,117 per day. The Mississippi to Qingdao voyage lost 2% over 30 days to May 25 to snooze at $17,607. The Santos to Qingdao grains / beans voyage, despite a switch in Chinese purchases from the US to Brazil, slipped 8% to an unenviable $11,916 per day. The Northeast Asia round voyage traded mostly between $11,000 and $12,000 in April, ending the month at $11,043, but lost ground in May, bottoming out at $9,896 on May 13 and barely recovering to $10,302 as of May 23, down 15% over 30 days earlier. The South China to Indonesia coal voyage was also 15% lower on May 23 than on April 23, at $9,414 – you can read a variety of views on the outlook for Chinese coal consumption in our recent coverage of the Geneva Dry event. The mammoth, 105-day, Singapore to east coast South America round voyage was rated at $12,895 on April 23 and has moved little since before falling in late May to $12,166 as of the 23rd. Overall the P5TC average for May to date is $11,867 following $11,951 in May and $11,411 in March. So far, so Meh. Life has been slightly more interesting for ultramax bulk carrier operators. Rates from the USG to NE Asia rose 27% to $18,714 on May 23, via a peak of $18,800 two days earlier. Ships ballasting from the Indian Ocean to S Africa to load coal for China discharge were assessed at $13,500 per day for the voyage as of May 23, 18% higher than 30 days earlier. West Africa was a happy hunting ground for some ultramaxes, with day rates via the east coast of South America to Europe swelling by 25% over 30 days to $13,307 per day as of May 23. The long voyage from West Africa via the east coast of South America to North China however only added a dysfunctional 3% over the 30 days to May 23 to sit at $14,136. In the Atlantic, a trip westbound from Europe to the US Gulf was rated at a dank $8,236 per day on May 23, down 11% on the month, while the reverse voyage was a sunny 31% more remunerative over the same dates, rising from $14,261 to $16,636. The last three monthly average earnings for Ultramaxes have been $9,865 then $10,093 and in May to date, $10,260. At least the direction is correct, from an owner’s perspective. Handysize bulker owners have less to cheer this month as average earnings to date for May are $10,067 after $10,514 in April and $10,415 in March. The best performing route in Asia has been the round voyage from and to Southeast Asia which has risen 9% to $10,919, while the in the Atlantic the Brazil to Europe voyage has also increased by 9% to $15,800. The reverse route however is down 5% at $6,234. The more northerly trip from western Europe to the US Gulf lost 6% over the month to land at $8,664 on May 23. Overall, May has been a lull in the freight market. Seasonal patterns suggest that earnings should lift off from here to their October peak. Political patterns suggest that all bets are off for the balance of 2025."

The Offshore Wind Technical Resource Assessment, published by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, estimated that an additional 3.5 GW to 18 GW of fixed-bottom offshore wind could be feasibly developed around the Irish coastline, in addition to the 8 GW already committed through phase one projects and the South Coast Designated Maritime Area Plan. While the report acknowledges Ireland’s significant potential for floating offshore wind, it concluded that fixed-bottom remains the less expensive option across all current feasible locations, in the near term, while anticipating floating technology to commercialise. Climate and Energy Minister Darragh O’Brien, speaking at the Wind Energy Ireland Offshore Wind 2025 event in Dublin, emphasized the importance of the report: “”The Offshore Wind Technical Resource Assessment is an important initial step as we look to designate offshore wind sites along our coastline, by providing a high-level assessment of potential areas for project development to inform planning.” The findings will support Ireland’s next phase of offshore wind planning, including comprehensive marine spatial planning and the development of a National Designated Maritime Area Plan for Offshore Renewable Energy. The report was released alongside the government’s Future Framework 2025 Review, which reaffirmed a national target of 20GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040."

        "content": "Donald Trump’s bid to resurrect American shipbuilding faces some stern demographic challenges. The American president has made shipbuilding a central plank of his industrial policies since returning to power in January. However, the maths behind having 250 US-built ships in 10 years’ time look daunting. A new report released by the Open Markets Institute shows that the US produces a mere 0.13% of the world’s large commercial vessels. In 1975, before the elimination of shipbuilding subsidies, the US shipbuilding industry employed 180,000 workers. By 2021, the shipbuilding industry had lost nearly 70% of its shipyards and 45% of its workforce, the report shows, backing up a recent surveys that showed more than 80% of Americans woulds like to see more manufacturing move home, and yet the same poll showed less than 20% of the population would be willing to work in the manufacturing sector. Putting the scale of how far behind American shipbuilding is to its Asian rival, China manufactured more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than US shipyards have built since the end of World War II. James Lightbourn, who runs Cavalier Shipping, an American boutique maritime advisory, has also been delving into the obstacles US shipyards face. In a Substack post, Lightbourn noted that over the past decade, large ocean-going commercial vessels built in the US originated from one of four domestic shipyards: General Dynamics NASSCO (NASSCO), Hanwha Philly Shipyard, Seatrium AmFELS, and the former VT Halter, now part of Bollinger Shipyards. The peak productivity from these four yards during the past decade saw NASSCO churn out six product tankers in 2016, Philly Shipyard managed three product tankers the same year, VT Halter built two container vessels back in 2018, while Seatrium AmFELS built one large commercial vessel in the year 2023.Assuming all four shipyards are simultaneously operating at peak capacity, they produce a total of 12 large ocean-going vessels annually, according to Lightbourn. However, the SHIPS for America Act targets 250 US-built vessels in the strategic commercial fleet by 2035. 250 ships over a 10-year time horizon would be 25 ships built per year. “The U.S. would need to more than double its peak shipbuilding capacity to hit that target–ignoring the major timeline variables of (1) first bringing additional shipyard capacity online and (2) balancing government vs. commercial shipbuilding needs,” Lightbourn wrote. Trump has spent plenty of time in the first months of his second term in office looking at ways to restrict China’s dominance in the shipbuilding sector, with new US port service fees on China-linked ships set to come into force later this year as well as the creation of a shipbuilding office in the White House. South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean has detailed this month how it intends to make its Philadelphia shipyard the top shipbuilder in the US. Hanwha, which spent $100m buying Philly Shipyard from Aker last year, has outlined how it intends to increase production capacity at its American yard from 1.5 ships to 10 a year, a mix of naval and commercial ships, including LNG carriers. The aim is to increase revenues at Hanwha Philly Shipyard ten-fold in a decade to $4bn. An old drydock is being reactivated to help meet these new business objectives which have been massively inflated following the return of Donald Trump to the White House."

        "content": "In the latest twist in the trade war unleashed by Donald Trump, an American federal court has blocked the president’s sweeping tariffs. The Court of International Trade has ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. It has also blocked the separate levies the US imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada. The Trump administration has swiftly lodged an appeal saying: “It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency”. “In practical terms, this adds a new level of uncertainty into the mix for US importers,” commented Lars Jensen, the head of container shipping advisory Vespucci Maritime, via LinkedIn. “Not only do they have to contend with the risks associated with changing tariffs. Now it is also cast into doubt whether or not the announced tariffs will even be implementable – and this also raises the question whether tariffs paid in recent weeks can ultimately be reclaimed. If the tariffs are ultimately (after appeals) found to be unlawfully implemented, shippers should have a good case for getting the paid tariffs back.” Trump backed down on his trade war with China earlier this month, slashing tariffs by 115% for a 90-day period, leading to a huge box freight rate rise on the transpacific as shippers rush to meet the deadline."

        "content": "UK shipbroking group SSY has revealed that it would be further expanding its offshore offering with the launch of a dedicated rig business later this year. Nicholas Wagner-Larsen, an experienced offshore and rig broker, will join SSY in September to head up the new rig division. He is an offshore specialist who has spent his entire 18-year career in the offshore market. For the last 10 years, he has been part of Arctic Offshore Rig in both Singapore and Oslo. Since launching into the offshore sector in 2023, SSY has continued to build out both its global team of experts and value proposition, which includes specialist services in oil, gas, subsea, renewables, and newbuilding. “While SSY has been synonymous with broking excellence for over 145 years, they continue to innovate and to move forward. To be part of this new chapter in establishing a rig business is a unique opportunity and one that I am incredibly excited about,” said Wagner-Larsen. “We’ve been monitoring the rig sector for some time now. While historically, it has seen a significant degree of volatility, the market has entered a new and exciting phase of activity. So, the timing feels right to launch a dedicated business, which in turn enables us to offer our customers a more comprehensive and complete offshore proposition,” added Stanko Jekov, managing partner at SSY. This is a second branch out for the company, as it announced in April that it would be moving into the recycling business. The new unit will be headed up by former Braemar man Harry Conrad-Pickles. The move into ship recycling by the London-headquartered group comes at a time of great need for such services, as 15,000 ships are expected to be scrapped over the next decade."

        "publication_date": "2025-05-29T17:37:53+08:00",
        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "René Kofod-Olsen, the CEO of V., writes for Splash today. Everything everywhere all at once. It’s not just the name of an Oscar-winning film but it’s also a fitting way to describe the state of the shipping industry today. On one hand, we’re grappling with unprecedented complexity, from geopolitical uncertainty and tightening regulations to market fluctuations and urgent environmental challenges. At the same time, we’re also seeing innovation at breakneck speeds, digitalisation at scale, cross-industry collaboration and new operational strategies transform the sector, paving the way for a more efficient and sustainable future. Historically, shipowners have managed their operations in-house and steered clear of outsourcing. But in today’s landscape, that operating model is becoming harder to sustain. Managing modern shipping operations now requires navigating multiple domains simultaneously – regulatory compliance, technological innovation, sustainability initiatives, and market volatility – creating a burden that stretches even well-resourced organisations thin. With only 16% of vessels currently under third-party management, many companies lack the scale or broad perspective needed to navigate these interconnected challenges. When these challenges and their impacts are global, shipping companies have to be able to take a similarly global view. The industry stands at a crossroads where strategic collaboration may offer a path to operational excellence and resilience. Professional ship managers bring the expertise, resources and global networks needed to address these challenges effectively. With dedicated departments focused on regulatory compliance, technological innovation and operational excellence, the right partner can offer vessel owners a proven alternative to managing these complex requirements in-house. Shipmanagers’ ability to distribute costs across multiple clients while leveraging economies of scale creates both the efficiency and expertise that individual owners often struggle to match independently. However, successful partnerships are built on more than good intentions – they require rigorous evaluation and selection. If they are to possibly meet the complexities of today’s maritime landscape, vessel owners seeking collaborative solutions must find partners who demonstrate consistent reliability, relevant experience, operational transparency and measurable results. These essential attributes not only distinguish capable maritime service providers but also ensure that the strategic collaborations – increasingly vital in our complex global environment – can deliver genuine value and lasting resilience for all stakeholders involved Take, for example, the rising cost of non-compliance with environmental regulations. EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, CII, and EEXI – all aimed at accelerating shipping’s decarbonisation – create a complex web of compliance requirements that demands sophisticated monitoring, reporting, and verification systems. With compliance stakes higher than ever, the expertise of professional shipmanagers is more valuable than ever. Shipmanagers can leverage their dedicated teams and technologies to provide what individual owners often cannot – a comprehensive, industry-wide perspective that anticipates regulatory shifts, identifies emerging compliance patterns, and implements solutions that keep vessels ahead of evolving standards rather than perpetually racing to catch up. Meanwhile, digital transformation has reached a critical point. Advanced fleet management, predictive maintenance, and AI-driven analytics are now essential to modern vessel operations. But these require significant investment – not just in technology, but in the expertise needed to implement and integrate them effectively. Again, scale is an advantage: ship managers can deploy these investments across larger fleets, creating a powerful data flywheel effect – where more vessels generate richer datasets, which improve algorithms, which deliver better insights, which attract more vessels. This virtuous cycle creates a cohesive digital ecosystem that captures the full operational picture – connecting data points across operations, maintenance, crew management and procurement that would otherwise remain isolated. The mounting operational complexity of modern shipping also directly impacts the human element at the heart of maritime operations. As vessels, regulations, and systems grow more intricate, effective crew retention, engagement and management can no longer be an afterthought. Experienced crewmembers have never been more valuable, or more difficult to retain. According to a DNV study, 81% of seafarers surveyed indicated they required partial or complete training to work with the advanced technologies entering their workplace. Professional managers can not only provide this essential training but also offer structured career pathways, access to state-of-the-art training facilities, and robust welfare programmes that allow seafarers to focus on their core responsibilities, delivering safe and efficient operations amid escalating complexity. The best shipmanagers are not just service providers – they are integrated partners. The siloed approach of the past, where technical, commercial, and operational decisions were made independently, no longer works. This shift isn’t just about cost, it’s about agility, resilience, and long-term success. The ability to consolidate services – from handling compliance to optimising procurement, from managing crew training to implementing new technologies – under a single partner offers vessel owners significant operational and strategic advantages in today’s complex maritime environment. More shipowners are recognising that professional managers do not reduce control. Rather, they enhance it, providing better oversight and fully connected services, spanning technical and crew management, compliance, crew welfare, procurement, technical services, insurance, digital technologies, and advisory services – all in an integrated platform to the benefit of their clients. The real question isn’t whether to outsource, but how quickly owners will adapt to the new reality and tilt the scale between challenge and opportunity in their favour. Those who act now, leveraging specialist expertise, integrated digital systems, and economies of scale, will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly complex world."

        "publication_date": "2025-05-28T22:52:39+08:00",
        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Allianz’s latest Safety and Shipping Review makes a stark warning about the dangers posed to the global merchant fleet by the worsening geopolitical climate. “While still posing major challenges and concerns, traditional causes of maritime losses, such as fires and collisions, have decreased over time. However, geopolitical tensions now pose a substantial threat that could offset these gains,” the Allianz report noted, adding: “The industry faces a complex environment marked by attacks on shipping, vessel detentions, sanctions and damages to infrastructure such as critical sub-sea cables, while reports of vessels experiencing GPS interference and jamming are increasing. Insurers have seen a clear increase in large claims related to conflicts, notably from the war in Ukraine and Middle East tensions.” In better news, the large annual report reveals a significant milestone in maritime safety: the global fleet experienced a record low of 27 total losses in 2024, a 20% decrease from the previous year and a 75% decline from 2015 levels. The report highlights that the South China Sea, Indochina, Indonesia, and the Philippines remain the most perilous, accounting for nearly a third of the vessels lost in 2024. Other high-risk areas include the British Isles and the East Mediterranean and Black Sea, each reporting four total losses. Over the past decade, these regions collectively contributed to 681 of the 729 total losses recorded globally. Fishing vessels were the most affected, representing 40% of total losses. Foundering (sinking) was the leading cause of these losses, accounting for 50%, with fires/explosions ranking second at 26%. Notably, over 100 total losses in the past decade have been attributed to fire-related incidents. While total losses have decreased, the number of reported shipping incidents increased by approximately 10% in 2024, totalling 3,310 compared to 2,963 in 2023. The British Isles recorded the highest number of incidents (799), followed by the East Mediterranean and Black Sea (694). Over the past decade, the British Isles accounted for 20% of all reported incidents globally Machinery damage or failure was the predominant cause of incidents, responsible for over half of the reported cases (1,860). Fire and explosion incidents also saw a significant rise, with 250 reported in 2024—a 20% increase year-on-year and the highest total in a decade. This uptick is partly attributed to the transportation of lithium-ion batteries, commonly found in electric vehicles and other battery-powered cargo, which pose unique fire hazards. The review underscores the growing impact of geopolitical tensions on maritime safety. The conflict in Gaza, for instance, led to over 100 ships being targeted by Houthi militants in the Red Sea. Such incidents highlight the vulnerability of global shipping to proxy wars and regional disputes. Additionally, piracy is resurging off the Horn of Africa, further exacerbating security concerns. The report also discussed the rise of the shadow tanker fleet – vessels which often lack proper maintenance, insurance, and regulatory oversight, leading to increased risks of fires, engine failures, and collisions.Allianz estimates that the shadow fleet comprises between 600 to 1,400 vessels, many of which are at the end of their operational lives. Advancements in technology have introduced new challenges to maritime safety, Allianz noted. The use of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become more prevalent, posing threats to ships through potential attacks or surveillance. These technologies are relatively inexpensive and accessible, raising concerns about their misuse by non-state actors or proxy groups. Cybersecurity remains a critical issue, with increasing reports of GPS interference and AIS spoofing. These cyber threats can disrupt navigation systems and compromise vessel safety, necessitating robust cybersecurity measures and regular monitoring of technological vulnerabilities. Fire safety continues to be a significant concern for Allianz. The transport of lithium-ion batteries, particularly in electric vehicles, has led to a rise in onboard fires. These fires are challenging to extinguish and can reignite, posing severe risks to crew and vessel integrity. Many ships lack the necessary firefighting capabilities to address such incidents effectively. Experts advocate for enhanced crew training, improved early detection systems, and the development of purpose-built vessels designed to transport battery-powered cargo safely."

        "content": "Pierre Aury explains why sanctioning Russia is not delivering results. In January 2023, just after the European Union enacted its ninth sanctions package against Russia, we wrote: “This clearly confirms the fact that sanctions tend not to work to disrupt military operations.” After nine packages of sanctions, there was no sign of these sanctions having any impact. Fast forward to May 2025, and the EU has just enacted its 17th sanctions package. 17 packages in 27 months – that is a package every month and a half. Being so inefficient so consistently over such a long period of time cannot be by chance; it must be by design. Now, why bring this sanction topic back to the forefront now? It is not only for the pleasure of having fun at the expense of the EU commission but it is because this 17th package is a shipping package. All the others had direct or indirect shipping implications, but this one is targeted mainly at shipping. Shipping appeared first in an EU sanctions package against Russia in the 14thpackage which created a blacklist of 27 vessels involved in helping Russia to wage war against Ukraine. In the 17thpackage, the number of ships on that list has grown to 342 after adding 189 new ships on the list. That list is basically the now infamous shadow fleet. Why is it that all these sanctions packages seem not to work in stopping or even slowing down Russia’s military operation in Ukraine? The answer is multiple-fold. One reason is to be found in the fact that the EU and the US still think that they are the world when they are not anymore. The vast majority of countries in the world are not interested in sanctioning Russia just because the West is telling them to do so. Only 45 countries are sanctioning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine out of a total of 195 in the world. These 45 countries are exclusively in Europe and North America, with the exception of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in Asia. The second reason is probably linked to the complete lack of a user guide accompanying the sanctions packages, leaving people willing to abide in the dark as to how practically to follow the EU rules and giving people not willing to abide the excuse that they don’t know practically how to comply. Another reason can be found in the complete lack of logic of these sanctions. Two examples in shipping: it is perfectly legal to carry Russian oil sold above the price cap from Sakhalin 2 to Japan, the so-called Sakhalin exemption and it is perfectly legal to carry Russian LNG to a European port connected to the European natural gas grid. The reason behind these two exceptions? The inconvenience of having to dispense with Sakhalin oil for Japan and Russian LNG for the EU. Russian nuclear fuel is not covered by any sanctions either. The EU is already working on its next sanctions package – more of the same, expecting a different result."

The New York-listed Texas-headquartered driller has won a new contract from BP which will see the 2003-built ultra-harsh environment unit drill six firm wells for the Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP). The BP-operated NEP is developing infrastructure to transport CO2 from carbon capture projects across Teesside and the Humber to secure storage under the North Sea, with start-up expected in 2028. Noble has experience in CCS drilling, including its work on Ineos-led Project Greensand in the Danish North Sea. The company recently achieved a significant milestone in CCS rig technology by securing technical qualification from the class society DNV for its work on evaluating how CO₂ operations affect rig systems and defining the technical solutions needed to safely support offshore CO₂ operations. Blake Denton, senior vice president of marketing and contracts at Noble, said that supporting the Northern Endurance Partnership advances the company’s role in delivering the well infrastructure behind the UK’s net-zero ambitions and reinforces Noble’s leadership in offshore carbon storage. The rig’s contract, which will be in direct continuation of current employment with BP, is expected to start in the third quarter of 2026 and comes with options attached for additional wells. Financial terms have not been disclosed. The unit is currently on a $145,000 per day deal until September, after which the dayrate will be increased by $10,000, according to Noble’s fleet status report."

        "content": "In the latest twist in the trade war unleashed by Donald Trump, an American federal court has blocked the president’s sweeping tariffs. The Court of International Trade has ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. It has also blocked the separate levies the US imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada. The Trump administration has swiftly lodged an appeal saying: “It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency”. “In practical terms, this adds a new level of uncertainty into the mix for US importers,” commented Lars Jensen, the head of container shipping advisory Vespucci Maritime, via LinkedIn. “Not only do they have to contend with the risks associated with changing tariffs. Now it is also cast into doubt whether or not the announced tariffs will even be implementable – and this also raises the question whether tariffs paid in recent weeks can ultimately be reclaimed. If the tariffs are ultimately (after appeals) found to be unlawfully implemented, shippers should have a good case for getting the paid tariffs back.” Trump backed down on his trade war with China earlier this month, slashing tariffs by 115% for a 90-day period, leading to a huge box freight rate rise on the transpacific as shippers rush to meet the deadline."

The ship ran aground just meters from a summer home in Byneset, narrowly avoiding significant property damage. The officer admitted to falling asleep while on watch at the time of the incident, which occurred around 5:30 a.m. local time. The grounding caused minor damage to the homeowner’s heating system but resulted in no injuries to the 16 crewmembers aboard. The Norwegian Maritime Authority and Trøndelag Police are investigating whether proper manning requirements and rest hours were maintained. TheNCL Salten, a 135 m container feeder vessel, was en route to Orkanger when it veered off course and ran aground in a busy stretch, having completed three port calls within the last 24 hours before the grounding. The ship remains embedded near the homeowner’s property with the Norwegian Coastal Administration overseeing the salvage operation. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about fatigue and watchkeeping practices in the maritime industry. The Norwegian Maritime Authority has previously issued safety messages emphasizing the importance of adhering to rest hour regulations and maintaining proper watchkeeping arrangements to prevent accidents ."

        "content": "Environmental and fishing groups from Nantucket have filed a lawsuit in US federal court in an attempt to challenge the permits for Avangrid’s New England Wind 1 and 2 projects off Massachusetts. Environmental group ACK For Whales, the Wampanoag Tribe, Green Oceans, a coalition of charter fishing groups, and seven individuals are asking the court in their claim to find that the Departments of Interior and Commerce violated the law when they approved the record of decision for the two offshore wind projects. The lawsuit was filed with the federal court in Washington after the organisation asked the Environmental Protection Agency in March to revoke its permit for the project. The plaintiffs argue that by approving the record of decision for the two projects, the Departments of Interior and Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Bureau of Ocean Management violated the Marine Mammal Protection, Endangered Species, Outer Continental Shelf Lands, National Historic Preservation, and Administrative Procedures acts. The lawsuit seeks declarative relief, finding that the government violated these laws, and an injunction to stop these projects from moving forward. “Offshore wind project after offshore wind project, from Revolution Wind, Vineyard Wind and New England Wind to the others, the government was so desperate to rush these projects that it cut corners and violated the law,” said Vallorie Oliver, ACK for Whales’ president. The record of decision for New England 1 and 2 was granted in April 2024, and the construction and operations plan was given several months later. The first 791MW phase is supposed to enter construction this year and start producing electricity by 2029. “This project was permitted illegally and unfairly. We, the fishermen and lobstermen, are losing our grounds to foreign-owned, wind-power plant developers who are decimating sustainable fisheries that employ tens of thousands of US citizens and feed millions of Americans,” added Nantucket lobsterman Danny Pronk."

        "content": "Work-related fatigue among cargo ship crews is growing worse, despite international regulations and onboard monitoring aimed at ensuring sufficient rest for seafarers, according to a new study from Cardiff University’s Seafarers International Research Centre (SIRC). The research, which draws on anonymous survey responses and interviews with over 2,400 maritime workers—including 1,240 from the cargo sector and 1,202 from the cruise industry—highlights persistent challenges with crew fatigue, access to medical care, and overall wellbeing at sea. The reports come days after a cargo ship, theNCL Salten, ran aground near a residential home in Trondheim, Norway. The ship had called at three ports in 24 hours, and the watch officer told authorities he had fallen asleep on the bridge. Investigations are underway to determine if rest hour rules were breached. The Cardiff study reveals that over a third of cargo seafarers surveyed reported not having had enough sleep in the 48 hours prior to completing the questionnaire. The main causes included long working hours, demanding port duties, irregular shift patterns, vessel movement, and onboard noise—all of which have increased since similar studies were conducted in 2011 and 2016. Senior officers, in particular, reported higher levels of work-related anxiety contributing to poor sleep. The study also noted a rise in seafarers citing general anxiety and homesickness as barriers to adequate rest. “Despite better monitoring of staff work/rest hours, fatigue remains an intractable problem for seafarers,” said Professor Helen Sampson, director of SIRC. “Evidence shows that even when the Maritime Labour Convention is followed, seafarers may still not be getting the rest they need.” Sampson also pointed to frequent falsification of work/rest hour records in order to conceal overwork, a problem compounded by the precarious employment status of many crew members. The report also exposes serious gaps in medical support on cargo ships. Nearly 20% of cargo seafarers who had experienced a serious illness or injury at sea reported not receiving timely medical attention. Most vessels lacked a qualified medical professional onboard, with only limited telemedical support available until reaching port. “Access to medical care on board cargo ships is woefully inadequate,” Sampson said. “Having a trained medic onboard would ensure workers are not left suffering for long periods if they are injured or ill when far from land.” The reports call for an overhaul of work/rest regulations, recommending that rest periods be uninterrupted and aligned with adult sleep needs. It also advocates for onboard medical professionals on all vessels, not just cruise ships, private and comfortable sleeping arrangements for all crew, enhanced shore leave opportunities, better food and recreational facilities and access to therapeutic amenities like baths and saunas."

All five developers that were awarded capacity in the offshore wind round submitted their contracts to the country’s Ministry of Economic Affairs earlier this month. The five tender winners were originally announced in August 2024, with a total of 2.7GW in offshore wind capacity. They include Synera Renewable Energy’s 800MW Formosa 6, Shinfox’s 700MW Youde, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners’ 600MW Fengmiao 2, Corio and TotalEnergies’ 360MW Formosa 3, and Enervest’s 240MW Deshuai projects. At the time, the Taiwanese authorities stated that the developers who fail to meet requirements will have their wind farm qualification and capacity revoked. The site space and capacity will be included in future tenders. The two eliminated projects were Enervest’s Deshuai and Formosa 3, developed by Corio and TotalEnergies. The two projects amount to 600MW of capacity. The country’s Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that all five operators submitted their documents and completed the contract signing within the deadline. However, the two operators failed to pass the review. This follows the revocation of the 300MW Haixia 1 from the Phase 3.1 tender, which was cancelled last month. In total, Taiwan revoked 900MW of offshore wind capacity across two separate tenders. Authorities have not yet decided if the 900MW of revoked capacity would be incorporated into the upcoming Phase 3.3 tender."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "A new study from the UCL Energy Institute’s Shipping and Oceans Research Group and UMAS, commissioned by the Global Maritime Forum, concludes that the International Maritime Organization’s recently agreed Net Zero Framework (NZF) sends a strong market signal favouring ammonia dual-fuel ships—particularly from the mid-2030s onward. However, ongoing uncertainties in policy design are holding back early investments in e-fuels and alternative marine fuels. The report uses a total cost of operation (TCO) model to evaluate various fuel pathways under the new regulatory landscape set by the IMO. While the NZF offers clearer direction for shipowners weighing fuel investments, several key policy elements—such as the zero and near-zero (ZNZ) reward mechanism and surplus unit (SU) trading dynamics—remain unresolved. “Many stakeholders were waiting for clarity from the IMO to make long-term decisions,” said Dr Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at the UCL Energy Institute. “While some uncertainties remain, the case for investing in ammonia dual-fuel ships is now compelling—even under conservative policy projections. In contrast, e-fuel producers still lack sufficient policy certainty to move forward at scale without additional government support or market opportunities.” The study finds that ammonia dual-fuel vessels strike the best balance of flexibility, competitiveness, and compliance from the mid-2030s, even without considering future rewards for ZNZ fuels. When likely developments in the reward structure are factored in, e-ammonia could emerge as a cost-effective compliance option as early as 2028. In contrast, ships relying solely on conventional fuels are now projected to be uncompetitive across both the short and mid-term, according to the TCO analysis. Not only do they face higher carbon compliance costs, but they also limit owners’ ability to capitalise on potential upside from future credits or trading mechanisms. The report also addresses the ongoing debate around liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transitional fuel. It finds LNG to be cost-competitive in the near term—particularly into the late 2020s. However, its long-term viability is severely constrained by its carbon intensity and lack of compatibility with the sustainability unit (SU) system without the use of onboard carbon capture. LNG-fuelled ships would need to rely heavily on low-emission drop-in fuels such as bio-LNG or e-LNG—or else face increasing compliance penalties. The volatility in natural gas prices and the uncertain trajectory of abatement technology add further investment risk to LNG pathways. The study underscores the pivotal role of the NZF’s regulatory tools—including the remedial unit (RU) price, surplus unit (SU) trading, and the ZNZ fuel reward mechanism. These tools will ultimately shape the competitiveness of fuels, yet their final design is still in flux. Because of these uncertainties, the authors advocate for fuel and vessel investment decisions to be based on a range of scenario analyses, rather than static assumptions. For ports and bunker infrastructure investors, the analysis offers a strong endorsement for prioritising ammonia-readiness. With demand for ammonia-fuelled vessels projected to rise sharply after 2030—and possibly earlier with favourable policy evolution—early infrastructure investments could yield strategic advantages. For fuel producers, the outlook is more mixed. Conventional fuel and LNG suppliers face growing uncertainty, while biogenic fuel producers have clearer demand signals, provided they can maintain price competitiveness."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "René Kofod-Olsen, the CEO of V., writes for Splash today. Everything everywhere all at once. It’s not just the name of an Oscar-winning film but it’s also a fitting way to describe the state of the shipping industry today. On one hand, we’re grappling with unprecedented complexity, from geopolitical uncertainty and tightening regulations to market fluctuations and urgent environmental challenges. At the same time, we’re also seeing innovation at breakneck speeds, digitalisation at scale, cross-industry collaboration and new operational strategies transform the sector, paving the way for a more efficient and sustainable future. Historically, shipowners have managed their operations in-house and steered clear of outsourcing. But in today’s landscape, that operating model is becoming harder to sustain. Managing modern shipping operations now requires navigating multiple domains simultaneously – regulatory compliance, technological innovation, sustainability initiatives, and market volatility – creating a burden that stretches even well-resourced organisations thin. With only 16% of vessels currently under third-party management, many companies lack the scale or broad perspective needed to navigate these interconnected challenges. When these challenges and their impacts are global, shipping companies have to be able to take a similarly global view. The industry stands at a crossroads where strategic collaboration may offer a path to operational excellence and resilience. Professional ship managers bring the expertise, resources and global networks needed to address these challenges effectively. With dedicated departments focused on regulatory compliance, technological innovation and operational excellence, the right partner can offer vessel owners a proven alternative to managing these complex requirements in-house. Shipmanagers’ ability to distribute costs across multiple clients while leveraging economies of scale creates both the efficiency and expertise that individual owners often struggle to match independently. However, successful partnerships are built on more than good intentions – they require rigorous evaluation and selection. If they are to possibly meet the complexities of today’s maritime landscape, vessel owners seeking collaborative solutions must find partners who demonstrate consistent reliability, relevant experience, operational transparency and measurable results. These essential attributes not only distinguish capable maritime service providers but also ensure that the strategic collaborations – increasingly vital in our complex global environment – can deliver genuine value and lasting resilience for all stakeholders involved Take, for example, the rising cost of non-compliance with environmental regulations. EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, CII, and EEXI – all aimed at accelerating shipping’s decarbonisation – create a complex web of compliance requirements that demands sophisticated monitoring, reporting, and verification systems. With compliance stakes higher than ever, the expertise of professional shipmanagers is more valuable than ever. Shipmanagers can leverage their dedicated teams and technologies to provide what individual owners often cannot – a comprehensive, industry-wide perspective that anticipates regulatory shifts, identifies emerging compliance patterns, and implements solutions that keep vessels ahead of evolving standards rather than perpetually racing to catch up. Meanwhile, digital transformation has reached a critical point. Advanced fleet management, predictive maintenance, and AI-driven analytics are now essential to modern vessel operations. But these require significant investment – not just in technology, but in the expertise needed to implement and integrate them effectively. Again, scale is an advantage: ship managers can deploy these investments across larger fleets, creating a powerful data flywheel effect – where more vessels generate richer datasets, which improve algorithms, which deliver better insights, which attract more vessels. This virtuous cycle creates a cohesive digital ecosystem that captures the full operational picture – connecting data points across operations, maintenance, crew management and procurement that would otherwise remain isolated. The mounting operational complexity of modern shipping also directly impacts the human element at the heart of maritime operations. As vessels, regulations, and systems grow more intricate, effective crew retention, engagement and management can no longer be an afterthought. Experienced crewmembers have never been more valuable, or more difficult to retain. According to a DNV study, 81% of seafarers surveyed indicated they required partial or complete training to work with the advanced technologies entering their workplace. Professional managers can not only provide this essential training but also offer structured career pathways, access to state-of-the-art training facilities, and robust welfare programmes that allow seafarers to focus on their core responsibilities, delivering safe and efficient operations amid escalating complexity. The best shipmanagers are not just service providers – they are integrated partners. The siloed approach of the past, where technical, commercial, and operational decisions were made independently, no longer works. This shift isn’t just about cost, it’s about agility, resilience, and long-term success. The ability to consolidate services – from handling compliance to optimising procurement, from managing crew training to implementing new technologies – under a single partner offers vessel owners significant operational and strategic advantages in today’s complex maritime environment. More shipowners are recognising that professional managers do not reduce control. Rather, they enhance it, providing better oversight and fully connected services, spanning technical and crew management, compliance, crew welfare, procurement, technical services, insurance, digital technologies, and advisory services – all in an integrated platform to the benefit of their clients. The real question isn’t whether to outsource, but how quickly owners will adapt to the new reality and tilt the scale between challenge and opportunity in their favour. Those who act now, leveraging specialist expertise, integrated digital systems, and economies of scale, will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly complex world."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "The number of vessel abandonments has soared nearly 33% year-on-year, with 158 cases already recorded by May 2025, compared to 119 at the same point last year, according to new figures released by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF). These cases have impacted at least 1,501 seafarers—many of whom have been left unpaid, without food, water, or medical care, and in some cases denied access to port facilities for months. The ITF says the trend highlights a worsening humanitarian crisis in the global shipping industry. “Abandonment is a growing, systemic problem,” said Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary. “Behind every number is a human being who has been failed by the industry and the governments responsible for regulating it. The fact that we’re on track to break last year’s appalling record is a sign that urgent reform is needed.” Vessel abandonment typically occurs when shipowners walk away from their financial and legal obligations, leaving crews marooned onboard with no wages or supplies. The ITF and its global inspectorate network have stepped in to recover unpaid wages, reclaiming more than $58.1m in 2024, including $13.5m for abandoned crews. So far in 2025, the ITF has recovered an additional $4.1m for seafarers impacted by abandonment. However, with abandonment cases climbing sharply, the ITF says its ability to respond is being stretched—and enforcement mechanisms are failing. “We’re dealing with owners who vanish, often protected by substandard registries that do nothing,” said Steve Trowsdale, head of the ITF inspectorate. “It’s often impossible to even identify who owns the vessel. This growing impunity is what makes the situation so dangerous.” According to the ITF, the flag of convenience (FOC) system lies at the heart of the crisis, allowing vessels to register under countries with weak regulatory oversight, minimal taxation, and limited transparency. Today, over 50% of the world’s merchant fleet is registered in FOC states, which account for more than 80% of known abandonment cases. In response to recent abuses, the ITF has added Tuvalu and Guinea Bissau to its official FOC list, bringing the total to 45 countries. Both nations have been linked to shadow fleets that move sanctioned cargo and evade scrutiny. “Shipping is the engine of global trade, yet its workers are treated as disposable,” Cotton said. “We must expose and reform the FOC system. Every vessel must carry a flag that proves a transparent, traceable link to its true beneficial owner.” The ITF is calling for a global overhaul of vessel registration systems and more robust enforcement tools for regulators. Key reforms include mandating transparency in vessel ownership, empowering authorities to detain vessels linked to wage theft or abandonment, establishing international accountability standards for FOC registries, and ensuring guaranteed food, wages, and repatriation for seafarers left stranded. “Only through a genuine link between a vessel and its owner—and the political will to enforce international maritime law—can we end this crisis,” Cotton said. With more than 1.5m seafarers supporting 90% of world trade, the ITF has warned that without decisive action, abandonment could become a new norm in global shipping."

        "content": "A federal appeals court has reinstated one of president Donald Trump’s broadest tariff actions, just one day after the US Court of International Trade ruled the move unconstitutional and blocked its implementation—triggering renewed uncertainty across global shipping and supply chains. On Thursday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a temporary stay on the lower court’s decision, allowing the tariffs to remain in place while it considers the Trump administration’s appeal. The plaintiffs, including several small US importers, must respond by June 5, with the government’s response due June 9. The tariffs—dubbed Liberation Day duties by Trump—target a wide range of goods from nearly all major US trade partners, including steep 25% levies on products from Canada, Mexico, and China. Trump had linked those tariffs to allegations that those countries were enabling fentanyl trafficking into the US. The trade court ruled Wednesday that the tariffs exceeded presidential authority and violated the constitution’s delegation of trade powers to congress. While the ruling was seen as a temporary win for importers and logistics providers, the appeals court’s stay has thrown the timing and structure of US tariffs back into flux—complicating planning for ocean carriers, freight forwarders, and shippers who rely on stable trade policy for routing, procurement, and contract terms. The legal battle centers on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump invoked to justify the sweeping measures. The trade court ruled the law was not intended for broad tariff policy, but for narrow emergency action—effectively calling into question the legality of using it for routine trade enforcement. Despite the legal pushback, Trump officials maintain confidence the tariffs will survive the appeal, or will be reimposed under other executive powers. For now, the appeals court stay allows the administration to continue enforcing the tariffs, meaning customs brokers, ports, and cargo operators must continue processing shipments under the higher duty rates. Markets had initially responded positively to the trade court’s ruling, with many in the logistics and import/export sectors hoping for relief from tariffs that have driven up costs across supply chains. Certain sector-specific tariffs—particularly those on steel, aluminum, and automotive parts imposed under separate national security provisions—remain unaffected by the legal rulings, further complicating compliance for importers navigating a patchwork of trade restrictions. Meanwhile, another federal court also ruled Thursday that Trump had overreached by using the IEEPA to impose 10–25% tariffs on a broad range of imports. However, that narrower ruling applied only to a single toy company. The administration has appealed that case as well. Trump’s tariff actions, coupled with an ongoing global shift toward bilateral trade deals, continue to disrupt international shipping routes and supply chain dynamics. Following market backlash in early April, Trump paused further duties for 90 days, which has led to a leap in container bookings and freight rates. Drewry’s World Container Index has increased 21% in the last three weeks with freight rates from Shanghai to Los Angeles now standing at a highly profitable $3,738 per feu, something that has seen a number of smaller carriers reenter the transpacific trades this month."

Nick Chubb, founder of UK maritime innovation consultancy Thetius, takes readers into the future, imagining how ships will operate 10 years from now. May 30, 2035 – 0735 UTC Captain Khan:Good morning, Proteus. Proteus:Good morning, Captain. Would you like a report? Captain Khan:Yes, please. Proteus:Voyage Day 18. We are 148 nautical miles southwest of Látrabjarg. Ice density is forecast at 8/10ths ahead. A strong low-pressure system is forming in the West. COG 074°, Heading 078°, SOG 14kts. ETA Reykjavik: 16:29 UTC, May 30. Propulsion and navigation systems are normal. There was a minor fluctuation in portside coolant pressure at 03:42 UTC, which was within acceptable bounds. I scheduled a diagnostic sweep with Engineering for 09:00. Chief Engineer Vasquez completed a software patch on the auxiliary power generator, a performance boost of 0.2% confirmed. No security breaches or fatigue alerts during unmanned bridge hours. Crew wellness indicators are green across the board. Cook Tanaka’s sourdough starter is also showing promising yeast activity. There was a notable event at 02:17 UTC: Automated collision avoidance was triggered. An unmanned container feeder, Arctic Reach II, had a CPA of 6 cables and a TCPA of 48 minutes. Altered course 3° to starboard and broadcast intentions via VHF Data Exchange. Final CPA was 3 nautical miles, within your standing orders. Would you like to review the footage? Captain Khan:No need, thank you. Proteus:Very well. Environment report, vessel operating within all environmental compliance parameters. Fuel consumption, 27.3 metric tonnes, slightly below forecast (–1.4%). Scrubber and waste systems are functioning normally. No discharges. Minor pH spike (7.3 → 8.6) in one washwater sample at 02:40 UTC, within legal limits but approaching threshold. Logged for system review. Seven-day CII+ rating holding steady at low C, trending upward with current routing, forecast to reach B on arrival at Reykjavik. Our ETA is currently 31 minutes ahead of the scheduled arrival in Reykjavik. Would you like to optimise our speed? Captain Khan:Yes, let’s take a little power out. Proteus:Very well. Captain Khan:Are the tanks ready? Proteus:Yes, Captain. Final tank wash completed at 05:46 UTC. All tanks have undergone methanol-grade wash cycles. Oxygen levels in cargo spaces reduced to below 8% via nitrogen purge. Captain Khan:And what about the pre-arrival data? Proteus:Horizon Dawn is scheduled to berth at Reykjavik Terminal 4A, with the assigned berth confirmed as 4A-METH-02. Remote pilotage is unavailable due to the ice forecast. Pilot boarding has been arranged for 18:30 UTC on May 30, approximately 12 nautical miles north of Faxaflói Bay. The terminal has indicated an estimated dock readiness no earlier than 19:30 UTC. The berth is equipped with automated A-frame mooring systems and a midships manual override. All clearance documentation is on track. The Electronic Notice of Arrival has been filed and acknowledged. The pre-arrival crew list, cargo tank certificate, and ESG compliance report have been submitted without issue. The final declaration of ballast water exchange is waiting in your inbox, I will send it as soon as you have signed it. The harbourmaster has requested real-time tank atmosphere and inert gas status by 12:00 UTC, ahead of the vessel’s coastal approach. As we enter the Reykjavik EEZ, environmental regulations prohibit the discharge of scrubber washwater and bilge effluent within 50 nautical miles of the coastline. The scheduled cargo is green methanol, certified bio-synthetic grade, compliant with Nordic GreenFuel Directive 6.2. The terminal has approved a load of 28,000 cubic metres at a minimum purity of 99.85%, with vapour recovery via closed-loop transfer. Transfer is anticipated to begin late on 28 February, pending final clearance and berth readiness. Methanol vapour suppression logs and leak detection calibration reports must be submitted prior to the commencement of cargo loading. Sludge offload is registered and has been approved by Quay Services, to be completed alongside cargo operations. A terminal-to-ship pre-loading conference is scheduled for this morning at 11:30 UTC on Microsoft Teams. The link is in your calendar. Reykjavik Customs will conduct a passive drone inspection during the approach phase. No boarding is expected unless triggered during the flyover. Captain Khan:Why is pilot boarding scheduled so late? Proteus:The delay appears to be due to limited pilot availability following a backlog of inbound traffic yesterday. Reykjavik Control issued a scheduling update at 06:50 UTC confirming revised boarding times for three vessels ahead of us. Captain Khan:If we slow down for the pilot, we will miss our charterparty window, but if we arrive on our current ETA we will get a Just-in-Time penalty. Proteus:Yes, that’s correct. Would you like me to generate a charterparty Just-In-Time change request? Captain Khan:Yes, please, and prepare a claim against the port too, in case the change request is rejected. Proteus:I’m generating the documents now. It will cite current port congestion and confirmed pilot availability as just cause, with supporting data attached. If approved, this request would reset the arrival time to 18:30 pilot boarding time, allowing you to reduce speed and optimise fuel without incurring performance penalties. Estimated fuel savings: 1.7% over the next 10 hours. The document is ready and in your inbox, waiting for signature. As soon as you sign it will submit it to the charterer’s operations desk and flag it as time-sensitive. Captain Khan:Signed. Submit it and notify me as soon as they respond. Proteus:Understood. JIT request now sent via charter operations channel with timestamp and documentation. Acknowledgement expected within 30–45 minutes. In the meantime, maintaining current speed. I will prompt again if no response is received by 08:30 UTC. Captain Khan:Thank you. If they don’t respond by 08:30, send the claim into the port. These just-in-time penalties make me anxious. Proteus:Understood. In the meantime, would you like me to play your “mindful master mariner” playlist? Captain Khan:Yes, please. At Nor-Shipping, delegates will be able to pick up Ship Concept 2035, Splash’s brand new magazine identifying how ships will operate and what they will look like 10 years from now."

        "content": "The number of vessel abandonments has soared nearly 33% year-on-year, with 158 cases already recorded by May 2025, compared to 119 at the same point last year, according to new figures released by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF). These cases have impacted at least 1,501 seafarers—many of whom have been left unpaid, without food, water, or medical care, and in some cases denied access to port facilities for months. The ITF says the trend highlights a worsening humanitarian crisis in the global shipping industry. “Abandonment is a growing, systemic problem,” said Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary. “Behind every number is a human being who has been failed by the industry and the governments responsible for regulating it. The fact that we’re on track to break last year’s appalling record is a sign that urgent reform is needed.” Vessel abandonment typically occurs when shipowners walk away from their financial and legal obligations, leaving crews marooned onboard with no wages or supplies. The ITF and its global inspectorate network have stepped in to recover unpaid wages, reclaiming more than $58.1m in 2024, including $13.5m for abandoned crews. So far in 2025, the ITF has recovered an additional $4.1m for seafarers impacted by abandonment. However, with abandonment cases climbing sharply, the ITF says its ability to respond is being stretched—and enforcement mechanisms are failing. “We’re dealing with owners who vanish, often protected by substandard registries that do nothing,” said Steve Trowsdale, head of the ITF inspectorate. “It’s often impossible to even identify who owns the vessel. This growing impunity is what makes the situation so dangerous.” According to the ITF, the flag of convenience (FOC) system lies at the heart of the crisis, allowing vessels to register under countries with weak regulatory oversight, minimal taxation, and limited transparency. Today, over 50% of the world’s merchant fleet is registered in FOC states, which account for more than 80% of known abandonment cases. In response to recent abuses, the ITF has added Tuvalu and Guinea Bissau to its official FOC list, bringing the total to 45 countries. Both nations have been linked to shadow fleets that move sanctioned cargo and evade scrutiny. “Shipping is the engine of global trade, yet its workers are treated as disposable,” Cotton said. “We must expose and reform the FOC system. Every vessel must carry a flag that proves a transparent, traceable link to its true beneficial owner.” The ITF is calling for a global overhaul of vessel registration systems and more robust enforcement tools for regulators.

        "content": "Environmental and fishing groups from Nantucket have filed a lawsuit in US federal court in an attempt to challenge the permits for Avangrid’s New England Wind 1 and 2 projects off Massachusetts. Environmental group ACK For Whales, the Wampanoag Tribe, Green Oceans, a coalition of charter fishing groups, and seven individuals are asking the court in their claim to find that the Departments of Interior and Commerce violated the law when they approved the record of decision for the two offshore wind projects. The lawsuit was filed with the federal court in Washington after the organisation asked the Environmental Protection Agency in March to revoke its permit for the project. The plaintiffs argue that by approving the record of decision for the two projects, the Departments of Interior and Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Bureau of Ocean Management violated the Marine Mammal Protection, Endangered Species, Outer Continental Shelf Lands, National Historic Preservation, and Administrative Procedures acts. The lawsuit seeks declarative relief, finding that the government violated these laws, and an injunction to stop these projects from moving forward. “Offshore wind project after offshore wind project, from Revolution Wind, Vineyard Wind and New England Wind to the others, the government was so desperate to rush these projects that it cut corners and violated the law,” said Vallorie Oliver, ACK for Whales’ president. The record of decision for New England 1 and 2 was granted in April 2024, and the construction and operations plan was given several months later. The first 791MW phase is supposed to enter construction this year and start producing electricity by 2029. “This project was permitted illegally and unfairly. We, the fishermen and lobstermen, are losing our grounds to foreign-owned, wind-power plant developers who are decimating sustainable fisheries that employ tens of thousands of US citizens and feed millions of Americans,” added Nantucket lobsterman Danny Pronk."

        "content": "Splash reaches for its crystal ball in launching Ship Concept 2035, a magazine delegates attending Nor-Shipping can pick up for free. To assess the design of tomorrow’s ships our reporters factored in incoming regulations, the runners and riders in the future fuel race, changing seafarer skillsets, port constraints, shipyards, connectivity, and artificial intelligence. The shipping industry is on the cusp of one of its most transformative decades. Driven by decarbonisation, digitalisation, and a shifting geopolitical landscape, the vessels that traverse our oceans in 2035 may look similar at first glance—but beneath the surface, they’ll be smarter, cleaner, and more efficient shaped by technological innovation and regulatory pressure. While hull shapes may remain largely familiar, function is set to redefine the form. “Externally, we need to expect evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, change,” says Ajay Chaudhry, CEO of shipmanagement at Synergy Marine Group. “Constraints like port infrastructure and classification limits will inevitably curtail radical redesigns.” Chaudhry says to expect visible additions like wind-assisted propulsion systems, air lubrication systems, larger and repositioned fuel tanks and some modifications to superstructures to reduce wind resistance. As Stamatis Tsantanis, chairman and CEO of Greek owner Seanergy Maritime puts it: “Function will still dictate form, though sustainability demands will reshape certain visible elements over time.” If the outside will evolve slowly, the inside will undergo a radical transformation, experts surveyed for this magazine suggest. “In 10 years, the smartest ships may look familiar from the quayside, but function entirely differently from within,” says Chaudhry. The smartest ships may look familiar from the quayside, but function entirely differently from within Digital control rooms, sensor-integrated systems, and AI-assisted operations will be standard, according to Shah Irani, chief technology officer at Fleet Management who predicts a convergence of artificial intelligence for predictive safety and operational decisions, internet of things to enable real-time monitoring and diagnostics, big data analytics for route optimisation and predictive maintenance, and finally blockchain to secure and streamline logistics and compliance. These tools, Irani says, will reshape everything from navigation to fuel efficiency. The strongest tailwind in shipping’s transformation is decarbonisation. “The shipping industry stands at a pivotal transformative moment, driven by digitalisation and decarbonisation,” says Nick Copley, co-CEO of Ocean Technologies Group. “First movers who embrace innovation stand to gain a clear and lasting competitive advantage.” “Economy of scale, engine optimisation, and environmental pressures have historically driven design,” says Kristin Omholt-Jensen, the CEO of Maritime Optima, a shipping intelligence firm. “Now, carbon emissions will drive change—sails, propellers, dual fuels—all will influence the future.” “Vessel design will continue to evolve; to address regulatory requirements in particular around emissions and to promote improving operational efficiency,” says Gareth Burton, senior vice president of global engineering at ABS. Yet, challenges abound. As Dr Kanghyun Song, a senior vice president at Korean Register, points out, there are four key uncertainties namely fuel price volatility, regulatory ambiguity, technological immaturity where the likes of fuel cells and carbon capture are still unproven at scale, and finally infrastructure gaps with many ports lacking bunkering for alternative fuels. The tide may bring not only compliance, but competitive advantage To address this, Song says new vessels will need flexible fuel systems and modular configurations that can evolve as regulations and fuels mature. For all the promise of technology, adoption must consider real-world usability. “Technologies should be employed such that they are not only technically sound but also practical and usable in real-world maritime environments,” says Eric Van Der Horn, ABS’s manager of technology. “It is important to understand and listen to the challenges that shipowners and crew face when adopting new technologies,” says Patrick Wadden, marketing and communications manager at coatings specialist GIT. Stefan Schindler, general manager of BestShip, a joint venture of Wilhelmsen Ship Management and MPC Capital, adds: “A common challenge lies in the lack of accurate onboard measurement mechanisms to validate the business case for new technologies. For crewmembers, the biggest concern is often the complexity of maintenance associated with these solutions.” Manufacturers must incorporate seafarer feedback in design to ensure safety, efficiency, and practicality. The move toward smarter, greener ships demands capital. But finally more shipowners are realising the long-term payoff. “The decarbonisation agenda is now forcing a spend-to-save mindset,” says Manish Singh, who heads up UK-based advisory Aboutships. “Owners increasingly see digital investments and predictive tools as ways to manage opex, not just capex.” As fuel prices fluctuate and carbon pricing tightens, digital optimisation becomes a strategic necessity, not a luxury. One barrier to rapid tech adoption is the inherent diversity of the shipping industry. “Shipping is a uniquely complex industry. Unlike land transport or aviation, vessels vary significantly in design, type, and operational profile,” says BestShip’s Schindler. “This lack of standardisation makes it difficult for technology vendors to develop solutions that are universally applicable.” Tailored, modular solutions will likely become the norm, allowing for fleet-specific customisation while maintaining core technology platforms. The next decade will not completely reshape the silhouette of ships, but it will redefine their soul. From AI-driven decision-making to cleaner propulsion, shipping is entering an era of intelligence, efficiency, and accountability. And for those who invest early and wisely, the tide may bring not only compliance—but competitive advantage. To access the whole of Ship Concept 2035 for free online,click here."

This lease is the first of three planned vessel refinancing deals. The other two will be for theFlex ResoluteandFlex Constellation. The decision to refinance all three vessels came after securing up to 37 years of combined contract backlog. The other two refinancing deals should be completed in the second half of 2025, and release $120m in net proceeds, while also extending debt maturities and reducing the overall cost of debt.

The new programme, named SeaBreeze, offers 100% financing, making sustainable technologies more accessible for shipowners aiming to meet evolving emissions targets. Under the programme, the company will partner with wind-assisted propulsion systems manufacturers to offer tailored lease financing solutions for the acquisition and deployment of wind propulsion technologies. The initiative, according to Union Maritime, is set to launch in late 2025 and will address the problem of “limited traditional bank financing” for wind technology equipment. “There is a clear market need for innovative financing solutions, and we are uniquely positioned to fill that gap. We look forward to sharing more as the project progresses,” said Guy Blunden, head of transactions and strategy at Union Maritime."

        "content": "The UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) has confirmed that the upcoming offshore wind auction will be set in August. The prospective commencement date for the Contract for Difference (CfD) Allocation Round 7 (AR7) is August 7, with applications being received until August 27. The upcoming round could be one UK’s most important ones as Offshore Energies UK already revealed that the country is not on track to meet its Clean Power 2030 target of between 43 and 51GW of offshore wind capacity. The organisation stated that the UK needs to secure 8.4GW of new offshore wind capacity in the AR7 round if it wants to stay on course for hitting its desired targets. That big of a number would make AR7 the biggest in history. Results from the auction are expected between December 2025 and February 2026. The Department also separated offshore wind from other technologies, streamlining the approval process. Provisional delivery years for fixed and floating offshore wind have also been set. The projects should be delivered in 2028-29 for fixed and 2029-30 for floating wind. Final confirmation of the delivery years will be confirmed before the round opens. The UK set out a budget of £20.1m ($27.2m) per GW of capacity applying for a Clean Industry Bonus, with a total budget of more than £544m ($736m). The government is also considering allowing fixed-bottom offshore wind projects that have not received planning consent to be part of the tender."

The vessel will continue operating on ONGC’s Cluster 7 field about 210km off the west coast of Mumbai. The initial agreement between the parties was confirmed earlier this year, however, the firm contract was not signed until last Friday. In turn, the bareboat charter will become effective from March 8, for a fixed period of three years with an annual option to extend for up to three additional years. The fixed three-year firm period has an estimated total value of RM451.4m ($106m). The 1998-built vessel, converted to an FPSO by Keppel Shipyard in Singapore in 2014, was working under a nine-year charter which was supposed to expire in March last year. However, that contract was extended by one year. Aside from the charter deal, Bumi Armada and SP Energy signed a second contract with ONGC via its other joint venture, SPAOGSPL, for the operation and maintenance of theArmada Sterling II. It will also be a three-year deal with three annual extension options. The value of the deal is RM127m ($29.8m). The effective date is identical to the one for the bareboat charter."

        "content": "Splash reaches for its crystal ball in launching Ship Concept 2035, a magazine delegates attending Nor-Shipping can pick up for free. To assess the design of tomorrow’s ships our reporters factored in incoming regulations, the runners and riders in the future fuel race, changing seafarer skillsets, port constraints, shipyards, connectivity, and artificial intelligence. The shipping industry is on the cusp of one of its most transformative decades. Driven by decarbonisation, digitalisation, and a shifting geopolitical landscape, the vessels that traverse our oceans in 2035 may look similar at first glance—but beneath the surface, they’ll be smarter, cleaner, and more efficient shaped by technological innovation and regulatory pressure. While hull shapes may remain largely familiar, function is set to redefine the form. “Externally, we need to expect evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, change,” says Ajay Chaudhry, CEO of shipmanagement at Synergy Marine Group. “Constraints like port infrastructure and classification limits will inevitably curtail radical redesigns.” Chaudhry says to expect visible additions like wind-assisted propulsion systems, air lubrication systems, larger and repositioned fuel tanks and some modifications to superstructures to reduce wind resistance. As Stamatis Tsantanis, chairman and CEO of Greek owner Seanergy Maritime puts it: “Function will still dictate form, though sustainability demands will reshape certain visible elements over time.” If the outside will evolve slowly, the inside will undergo a radical transformation, experts surveyed for this magazine suggest. “In 10 years, the smartest ships may look familiar from the quayside, but function entirely differently from within,” says Chaudhry. The smartest ships may look familiar from the quayside, but function entirely differently from within Digital control rooms, sensor-integrated systems, and AI-assisted operations will be standard, according to Shah Irani, chief technology officer at Fleet Management who predicts a convergence of artificial intelligence for predictive safety and operational decisions, internet of things to enable real-time monitoring and diagnostics, big data analytics for route optimisation and predictive maintenance, and finally blockchain to secure and streamline logistics and compliance. These tools, Irani says, will reshape everything from navigation to fuel efficiency. The strongest tailwind in shipping’s transformation is decarbonisation. “The shipping industry stands at a pivotal transformative moment, driven by digitalisation and decarbonisation,” says Nick Copley, co-CEO of Ocean Technologies Group. “First movers who embrace innovation stand to gain a clear and lasting competitive advantage.” “Economy of scale, engine optimisation, and environmental pressures have historically driven design,” says Kristin Omholt-Jensen, the CEO of Maritime Optima, a shipping intelligence firm. “Now, carbon emissions will drive change—sails, propellers, dual fuels—all will influence the future.” “Vessel design will continue to evolve; to address regulatory requirements in particular around emissions and to promote improving operational efficiency,” says Gareth Burton, senior vice president of global engineering at ABS. Yet, challenges abound. As Dr Kanghyun Song, a senior vice president at Korean Register, points out, there are four key uncertainties namely fuel price volatility, regulatory ambiguity, technological immaturity where the likes of fuel cells and carbon capture are still unproven at scale, and finally infrastructure gaps with many ports lacking bunkering for alternative fuels. The tide may bring not only compliance, but competitive advantage To address this, Song says new vessels will need flexible fuel systems and modular configurations that can evolve as regulations and fuels mature. For all the promise of technology, adoption must consider real-world usability. “Technologies should be employed such that they are not only technically sound but also practical and usable in real-world maritime environments,” says Eric Van Der Horn, ABS’s manager of technology. “It is important to understand and listen to the challenges that shipowners and crew face when adopting new technologies,” says Patrick Wadden, marketing and communications manager at coatings specialist GIT. Stefan Schindler, general manager of BestShip, a joint venture of Wilhelmsen Ship Management and MPC Capital, adds: “A common challenge lies in the lack of accurate onboard measurement mechanisms to validate the business case for new technologies. For crewmembers, the biggest concern is often the complexity of maintenance associated with these solutions.” Manufacturers must incorporate seafarer feedback in design to ensure safety, efficiency, and practicality. The move toward smarter, greener ships demands capital. But finally more shipowners are realising the long-term payoff. “The decarbonisation agenda is now forcing a spend-to-save mindset,” says Manish Singh, who heads up UK-based advisory Aboutships. “Owners increasingly see digital investments and predictive tools as ways to manage opex, not just capex.” As fuel prices fluctuate and carbon pricing tightens, digital optimisation becomes a strategic necessity, not a luxury. One barrier to rapid tech adoption is the inherent diversity of the shipping industry. “Shipping is a uniquely complex industry. Unlike land transport or aviation, vessels vary significantly in design, type, and operational profile,” says BestShip’s Schindler. “This lack of standardisation makes it difficult for technology vendors to develop solutions that are universally applicable.” Tailored, modular solutions will likely become the norm, allowing for fleet-specific customisation while maintaining core technology platforms. The next decade will not completely reshape the silhouette of ships, but it will redefine their soul. From AI-driven decision-making to cleaner propulsion, shipping is entering an era of intelligence, efficiency, and accountability. And for those who invest early and wisely, the tide may bring not only compliance—but competitive advantage. To access the whole of Ship Concept 2035 for free online,click here."

        "content": "DP World, in partnership with VIMC Container Lines Joint Stock Company (VIMC Lines), has launched a new coastal and river transport service that is said to cut cargo transit times by 70%. The so-called Mekong Express service connects inland port Cai Cui and deepwater port Cai Mep twice weekly, significantly cutting down travel time from 48 hours to 15 hours using a combined route. The traditional route spans about 367 km, while the new coastal path is shortened to about 200 km, offering a faster, more cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solution for Vietnam’s cargo shippers, DP World explained. The Mekong Express is built to handle both dry and reefer containers, with a capacity of several hundred teu per voyage. Future expansion plans include adding stops at Saigon Premier Container Terminal (SPCT), managed by DP World, and Saigon Hiep Phuoc Port, under the Vietnam Maritime Corporation. In addition to its operational benefits, the new service presents a more sustainable alternative to road transport, producing 60% fewer carbon emissions, DP World added. The operation is also equipped with real-time cargo tracking and carbon monitoring technologies and both partners said they aim to make the service net-zero in carbon emissions by 2026. The launch of the new service is expected to strengthen connectivity across southern Vietnam’s two economic powerhouses, the Mekong Delta Key Economic Region and the Southern Key Economic Region, which together drive much of the country’s industrial output and exports. “DP World is committed to building a seamless, integrated supply chain ecosystem in Vietnam, an increasingly important market for trade in the Asia Pacific region and globally. With the Mekong Express, we are responding to demand for a more efficient and reliable service. This will help support economic development not just within southern Vietnam but throughout the country,” said Glen Hilton, CEO and managing director of DP World Asia Pacific."

The newly launched company, ASBI Shipping, has kicked off operations with the acquisition of two 22,000 cu m semi-refrigerated LPG tankers named Alkaid and Alcor. These mid-size vessels are already secured on a 10-year charter with a BGN subsidiary, with estimated revenue of around $180m through 2035. To support the acquisition, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank provided $57.2m in financing, secured by the two vessels. The move underscores a strategic pivot toward smaller and more flexible LPG vessels that can access infrastructure-limited ports and regional hubs across emerging markets. “This transformation is driving increased demand for smaller, more flexible LPG vessels that can efficiently serve regional hubs and infrastructure-constrained ports,” said Guy Neivens, CEO of Al Seer Marine. Smaller LPG carriers—typically under 30,000 cu m—are becoming essential for growth regions in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, where about 30% of LPG cargoes are now handled by this class of vessel. ASBI Shipping plans to expand its fleet to meet rising demand in these underserved markets. The two partners also co-own ABGC DMCC, a joint venture focused on very large gas carriers (VLGCs). The jv received its first newbuild in July 2023, and counts five VLGCs on fully delivered basis. “Our charter with ASBI aligns with BGN’s focus on securing transition fuel supply chains. Smaller vessels are indispensable for ports lacking VLGC infrastructure, and we anticipate further collaborations,” added Rüya Bayegan, BGN group CEO."

        "content": "With the 60th anniversary of Nor-Shipping now underway, Norway’s most famous shipowner has used the occasion to voice his displeasure at what he sees as Oslo’s lack of interest in shipping. Norwegian-born shipping magnate John Fredriksen has sharply criticised Norway’s political climate for maritime business in an interview yesterday withFinansavisen, a leading Norwegian business daily, on the eve of Nor-Shipping. Fredriksen, now a Cypriot citizen residing in London, declared: “The framework conditions for shipping in Norway have never been weaker than they are now.” His remarks come as frustration grows within Norway’s maritime sector over what many perceive as eroding state support and a dwindling talent pipeline. Fredriksen’s warning reflects a wider unease among Norwegian shipowners, who have long felt sidelined by government policies seen as unfavourable to the shipping industry. His comments coincide with mounting concerns over a shortage of qualified maritime professionals, a shrinking domestic investor base, and the diminished role of the Oslo Stock Exchange in global shipping finance. “Shipping is almost wanted away,” Fredriksen stated, suggesting that successive regulatory decisions have alienated a sector traditionally seen as one of Norway’s most important industries. Fredriksen also shared withFinansavisenhis current investment strategy, telling the newspaper: “We are opportunistic and look for good investments—not necessarily control.” He explained his group’s recent surge in equity purchases across multiple maritime and offshore companies including Star Bulk Carriers, International Seaways and offshore driller Valaris. Fredriksen’s strategy focused on undervalued shipping equities, with the expectation of strong returns as supply tightens and geopolitical volatility reshapes global trade flows. “It can be valuable to have gas in the tank when others run out,” he noted, suggesting that liquidity and timing will be critical differentiators in the coming years. “Shipping has always been cyclical,” he said. “The question is who’s prepared when the cycle turns.” Fredriksen’s comments add weight to the growing debate at Nor-Shipping 2025, where sustainability, regulatory alignment, and investment uncertainty are likely to dominate the agenda. Many Norwegian owners have voiced discontent over the lack of cohesive maritime strategy from the government, particularly as the sector navigates complex decarbonisation goals and rising geopolitical risks. With his flagship company Frontline trading actively on the Oslo Bourse—albeit amid declining local market influence—Fredriksen’s views are expected to resonate with both institutional investors and policymakers."

        "content": "Punit Oza from Singapore consultancy Maritime NXT writes for Splash today. When I started my career in Precious Shipping in 1993, the company was abuzz with then parent group, G. Premjee, looking to secure a deal with Kandla (now Deendayal) Port to operate a berth for its grain trade. It was a new experiment and one that promised to quadruple the daily productivity to 16,000 tons per day. The agreement happened and we operated the berth for years and showed a government-owned port the way forward. Later during the 2000s and 2010-20s at Noble and Klaveness, I got used to discharge rates of up to 25000 tons per day in Kandla for coal and other bulk cargoes. Fast forward to today and I see news that nearly 80,000 tons of coal has been discharged in a day. Congratulations on the fantastic progress in three decades. Automation and technology efficiencies are creating such efficiency surges in other shipping sectors such as container shipping, too. The core issue The global maritime industry is experiencing a profound transformation as ports worldwide implement cutting-edge technologies and operational improvements that are reshaping shipping efficiency and vessel demand patterns. This productivity revolution is fundamentally altering how goods move across oceans and creating ripple effects throughout the shipping industry. Automation leading the charge Port automation has emerged as the primary driver of productivity gains across major terminals worldwide. Advanced technologies including automated container handling systems, AI-powered logistics optimisation, and robotic cargo management are reducing processing times and increasing throughput capacity. These automated systems eliminate human error, operate continuously without breaks, and can process containers at speeds previously unattainable through manual operations. The implementation of automated gate systems, yard cranes, and vessel loading equipment has enabled ports to handle larger volumes with greater precision. Automated terminals can now process containers 24/7 with minimal human intervention, dramatically reducing dwell times and vessel turnaround periods. This technological leap has created a competitive advantage for ports that embrace automation, as shipping companies increasingly favour terminals that can guarantee faster, more reliable service. Regional performance leaders East and Southeast Asian ports continue to dominate global performance rankings, with 13 of the top 20 most efficient container ports located in this region. These facilities have invested heavily in infrastructure modernisation and digital integration, creating seamless operations that set global benchmarks for efficiency. Their success demonstrates how strategic investment in technology and process optimisation can create substantial competitive advantages in international trade. However, productivity improvements are not limited to Asian markets. Ports across Europe, North America, and other regions are implementing similar technologies and achieving significant gains in operational efficiency. The adoption of these improvements is becoming essential for maintaining competitiveness in the global shipping network. The vessel supply surge Enhanced port productivity is creating a paradoxical challenge for the shipping industry by dramatically increasing the effective supply of vessels without adding a single new ship to global fleets. This development poses significant headwinds for shipping companies’ profitability and market dynamics. As ports process cargo more efficiently, vessel turnaround times have decreased from days to hours, effectively liberating ships from port congestion that previously constrained their utilisation. A containership that once completed 12 voyages annually due to port delays can now complete 15 to 18 voyages on the same route, representing a 25-50% increase in effective vessel supply without any new construction. This productivity-driven capacity expansion is flooding the market with additional shipping capacity at a time when many trade routes are already experiencing oversupply conditions. The mathematics are stark: when a vessel spends 30% less time in port, the global fleet’s effective capacity increases by nearly one-third overnight. This artificial capacity injection creates downward pressure on freight rates, as shipping companies find themselves competing with what amounts to “phantom vessels” – the additional capacity unlocked by port efficiency gains. The result is a supply-demand imbalance that threatens shipping profitability across multiple segments. This efficiency-driven oversupply is particularly damaging because it occurs without the natural market corrections that typically accompany capacity additions. Unlike new ship deliveries, which can be delayed or cancelled during market downturns, port productivity improvements are permanent and irreversible. Once implemented, these efficiency gains continue generating additional effective capacity regardless of market conditions, creating persistent downward pressure on shipping rates. Market disruption and profitability pressures The productivity revolution extends beyond operational improvements to create severe market disruptions that threaten shipping industry fundamentals. While faster cargo processing reduces some supply chain costs, the primary beneficiaries are shippers and cargo owners rather than vessel operators. Shipping companies find themselves caught in a squeeze where their effective capacity has increased dramatically while demand growth remains constrained by global economic conditions. This dynamic creates a vicious cycle for shipping profitability. Lower freight rates resulting from oversupply reduce shipping companies’ revenues and cash flows, limiting their ability to invest in newer, more efficient vessels. Simultaneously, the increased effective capacity makes existing older vessels more competitive, as their lower capital costs help offset reduced rates. This extends the economic life of inefficient tonnage that might otherwise be scrapped, further exacerbating the oversupply problem. The concentration effect of high-performing ports compounds these challenges by creating winner-take-all dynamics. Shipping routes that serve automated, high-efficiency ports become oversupplied with vessels seeking to capitalise on faster turnarounds, while routes serving less efficient ports may experience capacity shortages. This geographic mismatch prevents natural market rebalancing and creates persistent rate pressure on the most commercially attractive routes. Structural challenges ahead The momentum behind port productivity improvements shows no signs of slowing, suggesting that shipping oversupply pressures will intensify rather than diminish. Continued investment in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous systems promises even greater efficiency gains that will further increase effective vessel supply. As these technologies mature and costs decrease, smaller ports will gain access to automation tools previously available only to major terminals, potentially multiplying the oversupply effect across the global port network. The shipping industry faces a structural adjustment period where traditional capacity management strategies may prove inadequate. The industry’s historical approach of managing supply through newbuilding cycles and scrapping becomes less effective when productivity improvements continuously inject additional effective capacity into the market. Companies must develop new strategies to navigate this environment of persistent oversupply pressure. The most successful shipping companies will be those that can adapt their business models to operate profitably in a permanently higher-capacity environment. This may require fundamental shifts toward operational excellence, route optimisation, and service differentiation rather than relying on capacity constraints to maintain pricing power. Those that fail to adapt may find themselves increasingly marginalised in an industry where efficiency-driven oversupply has become a permanent feature rather than a cyclical challenge. Additional volume of cargo & constant growth of trade are another way to balance the books. However, with the current trade wars & economic challenges, this becomes more complex. The imports into US ports just in April were down 20%. The way ahead There are multiple ways to deal with these challenges and most of them are company-specific and customer-specific. My immediate advice is that, as a shipping company, don’t just look at the bottom line of your current voyage but analyse how the average voyage time has changed over the years and recalibrate your strategies of building additional volume or trimming your fleet size! Agility is not just about taking actions but pre-empting what actions need to be taken."

        "content": "Danish shipping heavyweight Norden is doubling down on its strategy of converting leased tonnage into owned assets—and then reselling them for profit. The Copenhagen-listed company has offloaded two more unnamed MR tankers for an undisclosed sum, continuing a wave of disposals tied to its purchase-option strategy. The ships officially joined its owned fleet in the second quarter of 2025, after purchase options were taken at the end of last year. S&P sources list the 2018-built MRsNord OlympiaandNord Jewelas added to the owned fleet in Q2, while brokers have recently flagged the sale of theNord Joyand Japan Marine United-built sister vesselJewel, fetching around $37m each. The latest sales bring Norden’s disposal count to 14 ships this year, with eight coming directly from exercised purchase options. In addition, the Jan Rindbo-led owner and operator has also declared a purchase option on another MR tanker that is set to join the company’s fleet of owned vessels in the fourth quarter of 2025."

        "content": "The UK could lose more than half of its offshore oil and gas jobs by the early 2030s unless urgent and coordinated action is taken immediately, a new report claims. A new report from Robert Gordon University, named Striking the Balance, outlines three offshore energy workforce scenarios (low, mid, and high cases) and a need for up to £350bn ($473.4bn) of future investment in the UK’s offshore energy sector between 2025 and 2035. The report suggests a 2030 UK offshore energy workforce requirement for oil, gas, and renewables of between 125,000 and 163,000 jobs, compared to today’s figure of approximately 154,000. However, the specific UK oil and gas workforce is forecast to fall from 115,000 in 2024 to between 57,000 and 71,000 by the early 2030s. That’s equal to losing approximately 400 jobs every two weeks for the next five years. On the other hand, the UK offshore renewables workforce is forecast to increase from approximately 39,000 in 2024 to between 84,000 and 153,000 by 2035. But, there is likely to be limited capacity for the UK offshore renewables sector to host and accommodate the quantity of oil and gas workers becoming available on the job market due to the decline in the oil and gas industry before 2027. Under a high-case scenario, workforce demand levels across the UK could hit over 210,000, but this will require the delivery of an additional 35GW of offshore wind or 6GW per year, and sustaining UK oil and gas activities for an extended period, like policies applied in Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. This also must include up to 40% UK content in capital expenditure work, and around 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030. The current level of UK content in renewables is typically around 25% for capital activities and up to 85% for operating activities. “With nearly 1 in 30 of Scotland’s working population currently employed in or supporting the offshore energy industry, compared to a UK-wide figure of approximately 1 in 220, the potential risks for Scotland’s supply chain and workforce are substantial,” the report said. If Scotland fails to capture the full range of offshore energy opportunities and the oil and gas decline continues to accelerate, the Scottish-based offshore energy workforce could decrease from approximately 75,000 in 2024 to between 45,000 and 63,000 by the early 2030s. “The UK’s lack of joined-up action means that the window of opportunity for delivering a just transition is closing. Inaction or simply slow progress will mean that UK offshore energy job numbers overall could drop by almost 20% to 125,000 by 2030, making the path towards net zero even harder to negotiate,” said Professor Paul de Leeuw, director of the Energy Transition Institute at Robert Gordon University."

One of the largest navigation infrastructure projects in US history has been jointly funded by Congress and the port itself, with essential contributions from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and private marine companies. Conceived more than 30 years ago, the CIP was launched to accommodate the rapidly growing need for larger, more efficient vessels capable of transporting crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and other key commodities. The project deepens the Corpus Christi Ship Channel from 47 to 54 feet MLLW and widens it from 400 to 530 feet, supporting safe two-way vessel traffic. The CIP, with a total investment of $625m, officially broke ground in 2017. Positioned near the prolific Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale, the Port of Corpus Christi is already recognised as the largest crude oil export gateway in the US and the third largest in the world, moving over 2.4m barrels per day. It is also the second-largest US LNG export terminal and a key conduit for petrochemicals, refined products, and agricultural commodities."

        "content": "In the second instalment from Ship Concept 2035, our brand new magazine, Splash identifies where regulators are enforcing change and where they are not. In global shipping, we often talk about regulation as a good thing – and rightly so. Rules are meant to protect the environment, improve safety and support fair labour conditions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other bodies have spent decades creating systems to guide our industry toward higher standards. However, progress comes way too slowly, something our reader poll clearly backs up with around three-quarters of readers believing global legislation will fail to keep up with technological innovation through to 2035. The best-written rules don’t seem to change much at sea Over the past decade, the failure to enforce global shipping regulations has seen regional bodies – led by the European Union – increasingly take matters into their own hands. “Enforcement appears uneven. The playing field unlevel. And the best-written rules don’t seem to change much at sea,” Darren Shelton, a well known shipping commentator wrote in a recent article for Splash, adding: “So we must ask the harder question: what if the real issue isn’t the quality of regulation but the quiet preference for keeping it ineffective?” “Regulatory pressures remain a dominant factor shaping operations,” Emanuele Grimaldi, the chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping, tells Splash, adding: “They demand significant investment and innovation, something that requires clear signals from policymakers to enable businesses to make the long-term investment decisions needed.” Technological innovations and regulations are inseparable and have always evolved together, influencing each other, argues Dr Kanghyun Son, a senior vice president at Korean Register. “Regulations are designed to encourage technological advancements while maintaining flexibility, allowing for gradual implementation when technological progress is slow,” Song says. Bjorn Hojgaard, who heads up shipmanager Anglo-Eastern, says he expects regulations to evolve but legislation will still move slowly relative to actions being taken, especially when trying to strive for uniformity across regions. “We expect regulations to follow the industry and for key players to take on responsibility to lead in a sustainable and ethical manner alongside evolving societal expectations,” Hojgaard says. Concluding, Vikas Pandey, founder and CEO of ShipFinex, a ship finance specialist, suggests that with global regulators behind the curve it will be up to private initiatives and industry consortiums to lead by example, with blockchain providing traceability and accountability to push regulatory bodies forward.

        "author": "Hans Thaulow",
        "content": "A flurry of secondhand tanker sales has emerged across various size segments this week, with MR2 units drawing the most buyer interest in the wet trades. Yet, while steady charter rates have supported asset values longer than expected, multiple brokerages now warn that prices—particularly for modern eco-design vessels—are on the verge of cracking. Among the most noteworthy deals, Danish shipowner Norden has reportedly sold two 50,000 dwt eco MR tankers, theNord JoyandNord Jewel, for $37m each. Built in 2018 at Japan Marine United’s Maizuru Shipyard, the vessels are said to have attracted solid market attention despite a softening sentiment. The sale price is nearly in line with a comparable transaction in April, when the 2018-builtPS Atene—a Hyundai Mipo construction—changed hands for $37.3m. However, brokers suggest this may mark the peak, as eco-design asset values begin to feel downward pressure. One brokerage source noted toSplash: “We have seen prices falling across the board, especially modern eco tonnage. The supply outweighs demand, and that is also shown by the owners’ willingness to test their breakeven levels with spot and forward deliveries.” Meanwhile, vintage MR2 units are also seeing values decline—albeit less sharply. Japanese shipping major Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) has just sold theWorld Navigator, a 14-year-old, zinc-coated, 47,000 dwt MR tanker built at Hyundai Mipo, for approximately $17m. The buyer, believed to be a Greek interest, has reportedly agreed to the deal with pending surveys. This deal further highlights the gradual erosion in vintage tanker values, following the $18m sale of a sister ship under similar conditions just last month. The growing divergence between eco and non-eco tonnage prices signals a shifting balance in the secondhand market. With more owners bringing tonnage to market and buyers showing restraint amid macro uncertainty, brokers suggest we may see an adjustment phase across all tanker classes. In the short term, MR2s remain the most liquid segment, but how long this pricing resilience holds—especially for eco-design ships—remains a key watchpoint for market participants."

        "content": "It was 30 years ago this summer that Nick Brown walked into the Fenchurch Street offices of Lloyd’s Register as a graduate trainee in a career that has seen him work across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, before getting the corner office in early 2021. As CEO, Brown has set out to make his mark by having a greater focus on the core strengths of the British classification society. “Do fewer things, but do them really, really well,” he stresses. Under his watch, Lloyd’s Register is balancing cutting-edge innovation with scalable service delivery. In conversation with Maritime CEO, Brown reflects on how leadership, regulation, and the shipping industry itself are evolving. “Being close to the team, relating to them, and having empathy—those things matter,” he says. Brown sees growth in China, India, and in places across Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines, places that still have plenty of talent still interested in maritime. Too few countries now have a talent pipeline excited about a maritime career However, he warns of declining interest elsewhere: “Too few countries now have a talent pipeline excited about a maritime career,” Brown says. Brown is adapting graduate training to a more flexible, modern structure. “The old model of sending someone wherever the company needs them doesn’t work anymore,” he says. Mobility has declined post-pandemic, and cultural awareness is key to managing global teams, he maintains. Discussing the International Maritime Organisation’s newly unveiled Net Zero Framework, one of this year’s biggest shipping news items, Brown tells Maritime CEO: “It’s much more aggressive than most anticipated,” he says. Comparing it to the European Union’s own emissions schemes, he adds, “This is arguably the most expensive price on CO2 equivalents we’ve seen.” The plan could double or even triple the cost of today’s fuels. Yet, Brown sees it as an opportunity: “It creates the business case to generate tomorrow’s fuels—whatever they may be.” Despite the ambition, Brown is cautious. He highlights the geopolitical uncertainty, making large capital investment decisions risky. Still, there’s optimism for retrofitting. “If you’re heading towards drydock, the return on investment for upgrades is now obvious,” he notes. But the looming question remains: Where will tomorrow’s fuels come from, and will they be accessible in time? Brown is pragmatic when asked to predict the leading fuel of 2035. “It depends on where you are in the world,” he says, pointing out that the availability of bio-feedstock varies greatly by region. For regional trades—like European ferries or Caribbean cruiseships—biogas or biofuel might dominate. But deep-sea shipping will demand more scalable solutions. He’s intrigued by the role nuclear could play, not for direct propulsion but as a power source for generating clean fuels like hydrogen or e-fuels. Ammonia, too, holds promise—if it can be safely deployed. “Safety and training standards must be the top priority,” he insists. The recent acquisition of Ocean Technologies Group marked a strategic pivot for Lloyd’s Register. “Our clients weren’t just asking us to keep their ships compliant anymore,” Brown explains. “They were asking when to upgrade, which fuel to choose, and how to ensure ROI.” Traditional classification was no longer sufficient, Brown argues. By integrating OTG, and its training platforms like Videotel and Seagull, Lloyd’s Register aims to marry compliance with competency. “We’re shifting from 45-minute training videos to microlearning, delivered exactly when needed,” he says. Coupled with OneOcean’s navigational compliance tools, this fusion forms a powerful offering across safety, operations, and sustainability, something he’s keen to tell clients he’s meeting across Asia this week."

        "content": "A who’s who in the Dutch offshore wind sector has appealed to the country’s minister of climate policy and green growth, Sophie Hermans, to keep the country on track towards its target of 21GW of offshore wind capacity by 2031. A letter was sent to the minister by a coalition of, symbolically, 21 organisations, almost universally consisting of major players in the country’s offshore wind game, such as BP, Equinor, VanOord, RWE, Eneco, Vattenfall, Vestas, Siemens Gamesa, and Ørsted, among others. The companies noted that the postponement of tenders for the IJmuiden Ver Gamma in May shows how challenging the current state of offshore wind is. The interest in that tender was very low since majors like Eneco and Ørsted stated that they would not apply without subsidies. “Rising costs and the slow pace of industrial electrification have resulted in significant, often unacceptable risks for the development of new offshore projects,” the coalition said. The solution, according to the letter, lies in the introduction of a contract for difference scheme made for offshore wind, preparation of a fallback subsidy mechanism for 2026 in case a CfD isn’t implemented in time, and the acceleration of industrial electrification while lowering grid tariffs. “Stagnation in offshore wind deployment would have far-reaching consequences for Dutch and European energy security, the energy transition, and the business and investment climate. We want to prevent this and are committed to ensuring a strong and energy-independent Netherlands,” the coalition added."

Everllence remains part of the Volkswagen Group, and the company’s product and service portfolio also remains unchanged. To commemorate the occasion, CEO Uwe Lauber symbolically unveiled the new company nameplate at headquarters in Augsburg, Germany. Simultaneously, similar ceremonies were also held at the company’s other main European locations in Oberhausen, Berlin, Zurich, and Copenhagen. The new name is derived from a combination of two English-language terms – ever and excellence, two attributes that the company believes are at the centre of its image. The first part expresses over 250 years of company history, which included many ‘first-ever’ feats from the first diesel engine to the first diesel-powered ocean-going vessel. “Today, we are no longer known in the market for just engines and turbomachinery, but also as a supplier of large heat pumps, carbon capture and storage, as a driver of climate-neutral shipping, and as part of the hydrogen ramp-up. This is what we want to express with our new name, Everllence,” Lauber said. The renaming is not the first in the company’s recent history, as the MAN Energy Solutions name became an heir to the previously used MAN Diesel & Turbo in 2018."

        "content": "The Danish Energy Agency has extended the electricity production permit for the Samsø offshore wind farm by 10 years. This is the first time in the country’s history that an older offshore wind farm has had its lifetime extended. The EU’s emergency regulations were applied to shorten the permit process. The Samsø wind farm was established in 2002 with an electricity production permit of 25 years. If the plant owner, Wind Estate, did not apply for an extension, the turbines would have to be decommissioned. Following this permit extension, the offshore wind farm will produce electricity for another 10 years until 2037. The wind park has 10 turbines with a total capacity of 23MW, which can produce enough electricity to power between 20,000 and 25,000 households. Since the Samsø farm is almost 25 years old, it was important to ensure that the plant’s structures could withstand continued production. With that in mind, Wind Estate provided an independent analysis of the remaining service life. The company must also carry out an extended service inspection annually when the farm is more than 20 years old. The Danish Energy Agency is currently processing electricity production permit extension applications for the Middelgrunden, Rønland, Nysted, and Horns Rev 1 offshore wind farms. “This is the first time that the Danish Energy Agency has taken a position on whether an existing offshore wind farm can have its electricity production permit extended, and it provides perspectives for similar projects with offshore wind in Denmark,” said Stig Uffe Pedersen, deputy director of the Danish Energy Agency. Denmark is considered a pioneer in the offshore wind world as its Vindeby offshore wind farm was the world’s first such project, constructed back in 1991. It was decommissioned in 2016, The country is also the home to the oldest still-operating commercial offshore wind farm, Tunø Knob, completed in 1995. The wind farm celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2025."

        "content": "The Red Sea shipping crisis – and the need to take the far longer route via the Cape of the Good Hope – has seen the proportion of containerships globally deployed on the industry’s top tradelane jump from a fifth to a quarter of all tonnage, according to a new study from Alphaliner. In just two years, carriers have added 2.26m teu of extra capacity on the Asia-Europe tradelane, bringing the total fleet on this route to 7.8m teu. With 24.4% of the global fleet now trading there, it is by far the largest shipping lane for the liner fleet, according to Alphaliner data (see chart below). Two years ago, the percentage stood at 20.8%. When container carriers reroute from the Suez Canal to travel via the Cape of Good Hope, the Asia–Europe tradelane becomes approximately 3,500 to 4,500 nautical miles (6,500 to 8,300 km) longer, depending on the specific origin and destination ports. This detour usually adds 10 to 14 days to transit times, depending on vessel speed. Donald Trump, the American president, claimed last month that after more than 17 months, the Houthi-inspired Red Sea shipping crisis is coming to a close. However, most liners questioned at recent quarterly results have insisted it is still too early for any resumption of Red Sea transits. For instance, Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc said it would be “irresponsible” to resume Red Sea transits based on an unclear ceasefire deal, warning the region remains too volatile for a safe return. French shipping giant CMA CGM remains the only major global operator to have resumed services through the Suez Canal. From mid-June, CMA CGM plans to reinstate Suez Canal transit for its Med Express (MEDEX) service, backed by French naval protection. While the Asia-Europe tradelane continues to grow, it is not the fastest-growing. Over the last 12 months, Latin America-related services have registered the steepest growth, whereby the fleet deployed in Latin American services is now exactly comparable in size to the capacity of all vessels serving the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent."

        "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US has released the audio transcript from theDalicontainership’s voyager data recorder (VDR) on the night of March 26 last year when it slammed into Baltimore’s largest bridge, creating one of the most high-profile shipping accidents of the decade to date. The minutes leading up to theDali’s catastrophic collision with the Francis Scott Key Bridge involved a series of routine navigation activities, technical difficulties, and finally, a critical failure that led to the accident. At 01:24:59 having left Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore with two pilots onboard, an automatic power changeover circuit engaged, followed almost instantly by multiple loud bridge alarms—a clear sign of a critical electrical fault. This marked the start of the first blackout event that would eventually lead to the collision with the bridge and the deaths of six workers who were patching up the bridge that night. The VDR recorded an expletive from the lead pilot and a second officer call from the master, confirming a sudden problem. The ship had already suffered similar electrical faults hours before while at berth. Although steering appeared initially functional—the helmsman responded to commands—questions arose about system reliability. The master and pilot began issuing urgent instructions: confirming crew readiness on the bow and attempting to assess power loss. The training pilot began making emergency radio calls to secure tug assistance and notify authorities. Within moments, the pilot called for the Key Bridge to be shut down, urgently contacting the Association of Maryland Pilots dispatcher. Simultaneously, the pilot attempted to contact tugboats for assistance via VHF channel 14, while also giving shouted orders to deploy the port anchor. The master echoed these commands, and the crew forward struggled to comply, citing mechanical resistance. At 01:27:25, a security call was made by the training pilot, stating: “Container ship Dali has lost power, approaching the Key Bridge.” Shortly after, the pilot yelled, “Do we have a bow thruster?” The bridge team responded initially “yes,” then seconds later, “not working.” At 01:28:59, the sound of the anchor chain running was recorded—possibly the final desperate attempt to halt the ship. Just seconds later, at 01:29:15, the VDR recorded the sound of a massive rumble—the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The bridge crew reacted with shock and profanities, the VDR transcript shows. The pilot and training pilot immediately issued Mayday-style distress calls to the Coast Guard, reporting the bridge had fallen and requesting immediate assistance. Post-collision, alarms blared. The crew confirmed there were no injuries onboard and began checking for structural damage and leaks. The pilot and training pilot acknowledged they’d been operating under standard procedures when the blackout struck, affirming that steering and speed were normal up until the power loss. Their focus shifted to safety, emergency response, and coordination with the US Coast Guard. This sequence reveals a sudden, catastrophic systems failure—likely electrical in nature—following a routine and well-coordinated departure. Despite timely reactions, the vessel’s crew and pilots were unable to prevent the collision due to cascading failures in propulsion and maneuvering systems. The NTSB in May last year released a preliminary report into theDali’s fatal allision with Baltimore’s largest bridge. The vessel, on charter to Maersk, experienced electrical blackouts about 10 hours before leaving the Port of Baltimore and again shortly before it slammed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of March 26, the report found, with the thousands of tons of the fallen bridge then wedging themselves onto the vessel’s prow. The board said the fatal outage came about four minutes before the crash when electrical breakers unexpectedly tripped, causing a loss of power to all shipboard lighting and most equipment when it was 1 km from the bridge. TheDalicrew restored power, but another blackout occurred about 320 m from the bridge, which stopped all three steering pumps. The crew was unable to move the rudder to steer. Plans are being drawn up to get a replacement bridge up and running by 2028, while insurers have warned theDaliaccident could be one of the largest marine claims in history. Legal cases surrounding theDaliaccident are expected to run for many years, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Readers can access the full Dali VDR transcripthere."

The new carrier is likely to be called South African Shipping Company (SASCO). Crude and chemical tankers as well as containerships, dry bulk vessels and bunker barges are all being eyed by the government, either newbuild or secondhand. All ships would be flagged in South Africa. Safmarine, and its iconic white hulls, was sold to Maersk in 1999, with the Danish carrier taking the decision five years ago to fold the brand."

        "content": "Realistic, pragmatic, or jaded?Splashreaders are a funny bunch. Despite the huge amount of articles and columns carried every week on decarbonisation, 49% of respondents to our survey for our newShip Concept 2035magazine reckon that the majority of the global fleet come 2035 will still be using traditional bunker fuel. Arguably no single facet will shape what ships look like in 2035 more than fuel, so one in two readers are inferring vessels will not have changed much in appearance 10 years from now, even if recent regulations do genuinely mean ships using traditional bunker fuel will be charged a lot more to move cargoes by 2035. Shipping’s long path to decarbonise received a kick earlier this year when member states of the International Maritime Organization agreed on a so-called Net Zero Framework. From 2028, when the measures will come into effect, use of very low sulphur fuel oil and compliance via the purchase of so-called remedial units – essentially carbon credits – could lead to costs of $2,500 a day for a non-eco capesize, rising to $15,000 a day by 2035 as standards tighten, according to calculations from Clarksons Research. We do not envision a one-size-fits-all fuel British consultancy Maritime Strategies International (MSI) has also given an early indication of the impact that the Net Zero Framework will have on the bunker market. By extending the annual fuel consumption estimates calculated for 2024 through to 2035, and applying MSI’s forecasts for bunker prices, it is possible to project the future fuel costs for conventionally-fuelled ships alongside the projected IMO penalties. By this approach, the IMO’s penalties would be equivalent to an 82% premium on top of the fleet bunker costs by 2035 – almost $100bn for the 30,000 ships tracked in MSI’s database. From another perspective, this also highlights the opportunity for the shipping bunker market – an annual pot directed towards drop-in biofuels and low carbon alternatives that could rise to $100bn per year within the next decade. Eman Abdalla, global operations and supply chain director at Cargill Ocean Transportation, says of the IMO’s new green rules, “There isn’t necessarily a well-defined business case for anybody to go and immediately order ships for specific zero-carbon fuels, but at least it has definitely planted the right seeds so that we can start ordering dual fuel vessels or dual fuel capable vessels.” Data from Clarksons Research shows that less than 8% of the global merchant fleet in gt terms today is alternative fuel capable, although more than half of all ships on order will be able to use alternative fuels, a quintupling over the past decade. However, it is important to note that most dual-fuel ships coming out of yards today tend to use traditional bunker fuel most of the time. “I don’t think anybody, including myself, has that crystal ball to say, OK, which zero-carbon fuel is going to be the answer,” Abdalla admits. Putting his own spin on the Net Zero Framework,Splashcolumnist Pierre Aury has some inconvenient truths for shipping, which he shares with readers. “There is simply no solution deployable at scale which can produce a carbon-neutral, whatever that means, shipping industry within a time frame consistent with preventing global warming turning from a runaway train to a slow-motion train wreck,” he says, adding: “We will not be able to power any meaningful number of ships with either kites, sails, batteries, biofuel, hydrogen or nuclear fuel quickly enough so, whatever its level and its formula, the new fuel levy will only lead to more expensive freight and not to actual decarbonisation. This extra cost will drive some marginal efficiency improvements, which by the way will probably be offset by the growth of the fleet.” The new fuel levy will only lead to more expensive freight and not to actual decarbonisation Dr Kanghyun Song, who heads up decarbonisation for the Korean Register, tellsSplash: “We believe that the era of multi-fuel usage in shipping will persist for quite some time.” “While a few leading fuel types will likely garner wider uptake we do not envision a one-size-fits-all fuel,” agrees Bjorn Hojgaard, the CEO of Anglo-Eastern, the world’s largest shipmanager. “There will still be a need to consider wider alternatives, taking into account available resources and risk mitigation through diversification.” Factors affecting relevant fuel choice according to Hojgaard will include route distance, port infrastructure, ship size, ship type, and regulations that may also differ region to region. Depending on vessel type and trading routes, LNG, methanol, and biofuels will likely be the main initial options, KR’s Song reckons. Once the production of green ammonia begins in earnest, ammonia is also tipped by Song to be adopted more widely. “For existing vessels, biofuels may be the only viable alternative, but they will face a severe supply shortage due to limited production,” Song adds. The key factor determining the production of green fuels is the availability of clean energy sources, which means that the generation of renewable power—such as wind and solar—will be critical. Song says countries with strong potential for wind and solar power—such as the US, China, Australia, and those in the Middle East—are expected to become major production hubs. The era of multi-fuel usage in shipping will persist for quite some time Other countries such as India, Colombia, Chile, and Egypt are also emerging as potential hubs for green fuel production, according to Prakash Chandra, a director at Fleet Management. “Their efforts will be vital in creating a robust infrastructure,” he says. Nuclear power is also under consideration, KR’s Song says, but he warns there are still too many issues to resolve before it can be applied to commercial shipping, making near-term adoption unlikely. In terms of what the fuel infrastructure will look like come 2035, Vikas Pandey, founder and CEO of ShipFinex, a ship finance specialist, reckons we will see a hybrid network of retrofitted terminals, floating energy storage units, and AI-optimised fuel distribution networks powered by real-time data analytics. Concluding, Nick Brown, the CEO of Lloyd’s Register, tellsSplash: “The next decade will determine the shape of the industry’s long-term sustainability, demanding not just technological advancements but also greater investment in seafarers and human capital, which remain fundamental to creating the long-term change we need.” To access the whole of Ship Concept 2035 for free online,click here."

        "content": "Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG (HHLA) has decided to invest in another terminal in Ukraine. The company is acquiring 60% of the shares in the Eurobridge Intermodal Terminal in Batiovo in western Ukraine. HHLA sees Ukraine as a hub for continental container transport and is simultaneously strengthening its position in European rail freight transport. The terminal will be operated under the name HHLA Eurobridge Batiovo as a joint venture between HHLA International and the Ukrainian investment company Fortior Capital. The German firm will acquire the majority stake and will continue to develop the terminal together with its rail subsidiary Metrans. The terminal is located near the EU border at an intersection of several international railway corridors, making it an important hub for freight traffic between Ukraine, Hungary, and Slovakia. Thanks to its access to standard and broad-gauge tracks, the terminal is suited as an interface between the European and Ukrainian logistics networks. In the first stage of expansion, the terminal will be able to handle around 100,000 teu annually and is designed for the transhipment of containers, grain, and other general cargo. According to HHLA, the capacity can be expanded if demand requires. With its stake in the Eurobridge Terminal, HHLA is strengthening its presence in Ukraine, which already includes the operation of the HHLA Container Terminal in Odessa and the local rail operator UIC Ukraine Intermodal Company. The new partnership improves access to ports and ensures connections along central transport corridors – from the North Sea and Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. “Container operations are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2025. At the same time, we are expanding our service portfolio to offer customers comprehensive, efficient and sustainable logistics solutions,” said Philip Sweens, managing director of HHLA International. This comes less than a month after the world’s largest liner, MSC,bought50% of the Ukrainian intermodal logistics operator N’UNIT and a 25% stake in the cross-border terminal Mostyska through its growing inland cargo business Medlog. MSC is also the owner of a 49.9% stake in HHLA, with the remaining 50.1% being owned by the city of Hamburg. The liner completed the stake acquisition in late November last year."

The session focused on the intersection of energy policy and maritime decarbonisation, highlighting the sector’s crucial role in the global climate response. Kerry reaffirmed that the US, despite political turbulence in recent years, remains a committed player in the global transition to renewables. “90%of new electricity in the US now comes from renewables,” he told a packed audience. He stressed that although the US formally exited the Paris Agreement under the current Donald Trump administration, “the American people stayed in.” Using Texas—a Republican-led state—as a case in point, Kerry underscored how climate progress transcends partisan divides. “Texas is the biggest producer of wind energy in America. People are acting based on science and common sense,” he said. “We have to keep pushing forward and not get distracted by noise or foolishness.” Kerry also issued a stern rebuke to politicians who undermine international climate accords for political gain. “This is political posturing at its lowest common denominator. It’s dangerous—for our country, for our fellow citizens, and for our standing in the world.” Turning to maritime matters, Höegh Autoliners CEO Andreas Enger welcomed growing regulatory clarity around decarbonisation. “The IMO is beginning to shape global demand for cleaner fuels. That’s an encouraging signal that policy is starting to align with industry ambitions,” Enger noted. Andrew Forrest, a vocal advocate for green hydrogen, echoed the need for bold action, dismissing LNG as an alternative fuel, while Kerry closed with a call for global cooperation across sectors: “The maritime industry is on the frontlines of climate change. What you do next will matter—for the economy, for energy security, and for the planet.”"

        "content": "Tailwind Shipping Lines, the container shipping arm of Germany’s Schwarz Group, has confirmed the acquisition of five 8,400 teu LNG dual-fuel newbuilding vessels originally ordered by fellow German owner Peter Döhle Schiffahrt. The deal marks Tailwind’s first foray into owning newbuilds and underscores its transition from a stopgap logistics solution to a permanent player in the global container market. Alphaliner says each vessel is costing around $120m. The ships, to be constructed at Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI)—a subsidiary of the CSSC Group—are scheduled for delivery across 2027 and 2028. Tailwind, a sister company to German retail giant Lidl, plans to deploy the vessels on its flagship Asia–Mediterranean Panda Express service, which has gained traction for its operational independence and use of less congested, secondary ports. Tailwind was launched in 2022 in the wake of unprecedented logistics disruptions brought about by the covid pandemic. It currently operates a fleet of nine vessels – seven chartered and two owned – ranging in size from 1,380 to 6,881 teu, according to data from Alphaliner."

        "content": "The French government and two offshore wind developers have amended their power purchase agreements, which will enable the shutdown of offshore wind farms during periods of negative prices. The changes permit the farms to either reduce or completely stop production during times of negative pricing. This comes as a response to issues grid operators across Europe face due to excess power generation from solar and wind projects. At the same time, energy demand does not rise quickly enough to soak up all the additional energy. Until this new deal, electricity generated by Électricité de France’s Fécamp and Saint-Nazaire offshore wind farms and Iberdrola’s Saint-Brieuc, which have a total capacity of 1.5GW, was purchased at a fixed price under government subsidies. That sometimes resulted in the electricity being sold at negative prices in the market, straining public budgets and the grid. The new PPAs aim to stabilise supply and demand. The government has already tested the effectiveness of the production reductions at these wind farms from May 10 to May 11. Except for the smallest facilities in the country, most recent renewable energy installations utilise a system that encourages producers to pause operations during times of negative pricing. Even larger offshore wind farms in the country will soon be able to use a similar adjustment mechanism."

Busan’s mayor, Park Heong-joon, has welcomed the planned relocation of the state-owned shipping line, saying: “Having HMM in Busan would catalyse investment, talent attraction, and supply chain innovation in the region.” Labor unions have expressed concern, with the HMM Labour Council releasing a statement urging caution. “We understand the vision, but any relocation must ensure protection of workers’ rights and livelihoods,” it read. Lee has also said he would like to move the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries to Busan, reinforcing the city’s status as a maritime hub. “We want to see Busan not just as Korea’s port, but as East Asia’s maritime brain,” Lee said on the campaign trail last week. The new president is also expected to provide strong support to the nation’s shipbuilders."

The dry bulk arm of the Chinese behemoth COSCO Shipping has teamed up with compatriot Citic Financial Leasing (Citic FL) for 15 firm 80,000 dwt MPPs at Fujian Mawei Shipbuilding with options to double the order. The two companies had earlier signed a charter deal without divulging further details. CITIC FL will provide the financing for the vessels, continuing a financing model COSCO has used in prior deals. A similar structure was seen last year when COSCO partnered with Everbright Financial Leasing to back ten 82,000 dwt bulk carriers under construction at Jiangsu Hantong Ship Heavy Industry. The latest order marks the next step in COSCO Shipping Bulk’s broader fleet expansion scheme. In 2024, the company, which controls around 500 ships from handysize bulkers to very large ore carriers, unveiled plans to diversify its fleet with multiple types of newbuilds already booked for construction across several Chinese shipyards. The MPP series is estimated to cost about $50m each with deliveries slated between 2027 and 2028. Recent newbuilding activity has also included up to 12 newcastlemax vessels booked at CSSC Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding, with sources indicating further newbuilding deals in this segment may be imminent."

The new carrier is likely to be called South African Shipping Company (SASCO). Crude and chemical tankers as well as containerships, dry bulk vessels and bunker barges are all being eyed by the government, either newbuild or secondhand. All ships would be flagged in South Africa. Safmarine, and its iconic white hulls, was sold to Maersk in 1999, with the Danish carrier taking the decision five years ago to fold the brand."

        "content": "In a landmark announcement on the Blue Talks stage at Nor-Shipping, Höegh Autoliners and Nordic Circles unveiled a pioneering agreement that could revolutionise ship recycling and the construction industry alike. The NOK1.3bn ($128m) initiative will upcycle decommissioned vessels from Höegh Autoliners into certified, low-emission building materials—entirely within Norway, without melting, exporting, or heavy emissions. The project marks a major step forward in maritime sustainability and circular economy practices. Up to eight vessels from Höegh Autoliners are set to undergo upcycling, with the first scheduled to be decommissioned in 2026 at AF Offshore Decom in Vats, renowned as one of the world’s most environmentally friendly dismantling facilities. The emissions savings from these eight vessels alone could reach 100,000 tons of CO₂, the two companies claim, directly benefiting the carbon-intensive construction sector. “This is a cradle-to-grave solution,” said Sebjørn Dahl, chief operating officer of Höegh Autoliners. “We aim to be the greenest in deep-sea shipping with a net-zero target by 2040. We’re already investing in green ammonia and building the world’s most eco-friendly car carriers. This agreement lays the foundation for a new green industrial chapter in Norway.” John Jacobsen, CEO of Nordic Circles and its subsidiary Oppsirk, hailed the project as “circular economy at its best,” turning what was once hazardous waste exported to Asia into a valuable domestic resource. “The eight ships will save around 100,000 tons of CO₂ and open the door to mobilising yards and shipping companies across Europe.” The initiative is supported by Norway’s Green Platform public funding mechanism and involves a consortium of top-tier players, including Statsbygg, the municipalities of Oslo and Bergen, Skanska, Green Yard, Equinor, DNB, and SINTEF. AF Offshore Decom is the main contractor, with a value chain rooted entirely in Norwegian technology, labour, and industry. Currently, Turkey holds the EU’s only large-scale ship recycling operations. This Norwegian-led initiative aims to challenge that dominance by creating a domestic and regional circular steel economy. Instead of melting steel—a process responsible for vast CO₂ emissions—this model emphasises reuse under commercial conditions with as much as 97% lower emissions. The long-term goal is to position Norway as a hub for green ship upcycling and secure Europe’s foothold in the global maritime transition."

        "content": "The Lithuanian authorities will relaunch a tender for a second 700MW offshore wind farm next week after the government amended the tender process. The tender for the wind farm was temporarily stopped at the start of the year. The government said at the time that it would re-evaluate the conditions for the tender so that the impact on electricity prices for consumers would be minimal. Now it was revealed that the tender, which will be overseen by Lithuania’s National Energy Regulatory Council (NERC), would be open on June 9. Registration of participants will remain open until September 8. The tender will be valid if two or more developers participate. Income tax paid by the winning developer will be directed to public interest services. The updated terms state that the winning bidder’s transaction price and development fee will be recalculated annually for eight years and will be based on inflation and changes in Lithuanian electricity prices. The government stipulated that any financial contribution by consumers to the offshore wind farm will only be made when the project starts generating electricity, which is expected to be around 2033. The new rules also eliminate grid priority for offshore wind over onshore projects, placing all projects on equal footing."

The move follows a notice of actions by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to impose new fees on vessels calling at US ports if they are Chinese-built, owned, or operated. The measures are part of the USTR’s “Section 301 Investigation of China’s Targeting of the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance.” The action will also extend to foreign-built car carriers, regardless of ownership. “When implemented, the measures will significantly raise the cost of seaborne trade to and from the United States. Additionally, the actions present complex contractual challenges for the shipping industry, which is responsible for transporting around 90 percent of world trade,” said David Loosley, BIMCO secretary general and CEO. In response, the BIMCO documentary committee has prioritised the development of a standard clause to support shipping stakeholders in managing the new regulatory risks. “Given the complexity of the USTR actions, we are treating this as an urgent matter,” said Stinne Taiger Ivø, deputy secretary general and director of contracts at BIMCO, adding: “A subcommittee of legal and commercial experts is already working on the clause, which is expected to be released soon. Further updates will follow upon its adoption.”"

The 81-year-old shipping magnate spoke candidly to Norwegian titleE24this week at Oslo’s Tjuvholmen waterfront, where he was attending Nor-Shipping events. “I try to avoid Norway as much as I can,” Fredriksen said flatly when asked about the Norwegian government’s decision to sell its stake in airline Norwegian, in which he is the largest private shareholder. The entire Western world is on its way down Having long called London home, Fredriksen revealed he has now moved some of his business to the UAE, citing Britain’s new tax regime as a key factor behind the move—but not the only one. Late last year, he closed the London headquarters of Seatankers, one of his private shipping concerns. “Britain has gone to hell, like Norway,” Fredriksen said, expressing dismay over what he sees as creeping dysfunction in both countries. He accused both governments of overseeing environments where initiative is stifled and excessive regulation dominates. Fredriksen didn’t mince words when assessing the broader picture. “The entire Western world is on its way down and home,” he said, lamenting what he sees as a weakening work ethic and complacency in developed nations. He criticised the rise of remote work, calling instead for a return to traditional office culture: “People should get up and work even more, and go to the office instead of having a home office.” Asked about his views on Donald Trump and trade policy, the shipping tycoon dismissed them as “completely hopeless.” Fredriksen’s disillusionment with Norwegian politics and society runs deep. “I gave up on them a long time ago,” he said, noting his departure from the country in 1978. “It has only gotten worse. Norway is completely uninteresting,” he added, with the only positive remark reserved for the country’s public-sector workers: “Norway is good for those who work for the state.” Despite his harsh words, Fredriksen’s shipping empire remains tightly linked to Norway. He retains major stakes in companies such as tanker giant Frontline and seafood powerhouse Mowi. Fellow shipowner Arne Blystad was among those present at the event. He described Fredriksen’s attitude as unchanged despite the geographic shift. “He is a bull, as always,” Blystad toldE24, referencing Fredriksen’s famously aggressive business style. Fredriksen, arguably the most famous name in shipping, does not give media interviews often but has used his trip to Nor-Shipping to get a number of issues off his back. Fredriksen sharply criticised Norway’s political climate for maritime business in an interview on Sunday withFinansavisen, a leading Norwegian business daily. Fredriksen, now a Cypriot citizen, declared: “The framework conditions for shipping in Norway have never been weaker than they are now.” His remarks come as frustration grows within Norway’s maritime sector over what many perceive as eroding state support and a dwindling talent pipeline. Fredriksen’s warning reflects a wider unease among Norwegian shipowners, who have long felt sidelined by government policies seen as unfavourable to the shipping industry. His comments coincide with mounting concerns over a shortage of qualified maritime professionals, a shrinking domestic investor base, and the diminished role of the Oslo Stock Exchange in global shipping finance. “Shipping is almost wanted away,” Fredriksen stated, suggesting that successive regulatory decisions have alienated a sector traditionally seen as one of Norway’s most important industries. Fredriksen also shared withFinansavisenhis current investment strategy, telling the newspaper: “We are opportunistic and look for good investments—not necessarily control.” He explained his group’s recent surge in equity purchases across multiple maritime and offshore companies including Star Bulk Carriers, International Seaways and offshore driller Valaris. Fredriksen’s strategy focused on undervalued shipping equities, with the expectation of strong returns as supply tightens and geopolitical volatility reshapes global trade flows. “It can be valuable to have gas in the tank when others run out,” he noted, suggesting that liquidity and timing will be critical differentiators in the coming years. “Shipping has always been cyclical,” he said. “The question is who’s prepared when the cycle turns.”"

        "content": "Demand for advanced propeller retrofits and energy-saving devices (ESDs) has nearly quadrupled since 2020 to enhance energy efficiency to meet tightening emissions regulations. However, according to a new report from British class society Lloyd’s Register (LR), while high-efficiency propellers can deliver fuel savings of between 3-10%, and popular devices such as rudder bulbs can achieve 3.5% reductions, only 1.74% of the global fleet currently features the rudder bulb, the most popular device, with the report making a strong case for retrofitting, giving clients an idea of payback times for their investments (see below). The orderbook tells a different story, with 8.42% of vessels on order choosing to install ESDs. The proportion of vessels on the orderbook fitted with a particular device is between two and six times higher than for those vessels already in service. In total, more than 10,000 vessels in the existing fleet and orderbook feature some form of propulsion energy-saving technology from newbuild. Added to this are at least a further 1,400 vessels that have had ESDs retrofitted since 2020. The number of installations on existing vessels is growing, showing nearly four-fold growth since 2020, with close to 1,500 vessels contracted to be fitted with devices by the end of 2024. The report also reveals a trend towards retrofitting newer vessels, with more than one-third of 2024 retrofits performed on ships less than ten years old, compared to just 16% in 2020. By 2024, 12% of retrofits were performed on vessels built less than six years ago, a category that saw no retrofits in 2020. Regulatory pressure is identified as the primary catalyst driving this surge in retrofits. LR’s analysis projects that a 20% fuel consumption reduction could save an aframax tanker operator nearly $3m over 10 years through reduced exposure to European regulations alone. Claudene Sharp-Patel, LR’s global technical director, said: “Our research reveals that propeller and ESD retrofits offer ship operators a proven pathway to significant fuel savings, extended regulatory compliance, and meaningful emissions reductions.” Speaking with Splash last week, Nick Brown, the CEO of LR, said that in the wake of the most recent Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting at the International Maritime Organization and the draft of an ambitious Net Zero Framework, this potential new legislation had “turbocharged” the business case to modify existing ships. “It’s suddenly made the return on investment on those investments in existing ships very, very obvious,” Brown said of the proposed Net Zero Framework. British consultancy Maritime Strategies International (MSI) has given an early indication of the impact that the Net Zero Framework will have on the bunker market. By extending the annual fuel consumption estimates calculated for 2024 through to 2035, and applying MSI’s forecasts for bunker prices, it is possible to project the future fuel costs for conventionally-fuelled ships alongside the projected IMO penalties. By this approach, the IMO’s penalties would be equivalent to an 82% premium on top of the fleet bunker costs by 2035 – almost $100bn for the 30,000 ships tracked in MSI’s database."

Fredriksen’s strategy focused on undervalued shipping equities, with the expectation of strong returns as supply tightens and geopolitical volatility reshapes global trade flows. “It can be valuable to have gas in the tank when others run out,” he noted, suggesting that liquidity and timing will be critical differentiators in the coming years. “Shipping has always been cyclical,” he said. “The question is who’s prepared when the cycle turns.”"

Can we take a moment and please stop placing seafarers in a victim role, very few of them have ever asked for? There’s a whole industry that’s come up, focused on the strain of being a seafarer, away from home month after month, sometimes facing rough seas, geopolitical strains, and more. Yes, they do face all of the above – but not all the time. Most seafarers I speak with, and that’s quite a few, are happy with their chosen career. While they themselves may not wish their children to follow in their footsteps, they have no plans to move ashore. And once you start digging, the stories of camaraderie, of shared experiences, of fellowship, of struggles shared and overcome, are many. So many of them beam with pride at how they manage to take excellent care of their family, their parents, their siblings, and often a wide web of their relatives. This pride is gently tempered with gratitude. Gratitude for the parents who often helped them get their education; gratitude to the spouse who keeps the wheels turning at home all the time; gratitude to siblings and relatives who support the seafarer. And gratitude to their fellow seafarers who sail with them. All of this is in the picture above. They tell of near-mythical sunsets with friends, of sunrises, of social activities. They also tell of the occasional feud, which is more often than not settled onboard. Yes, they tell of near-misses, of accidents – none of them try to wave away the risks of the job. But they know them; they are trained to identify, mitigate and handle them; they are surrounded by people who all share the same goal: To come home safe and sound. In my experience, seafarers are no more likely to experience mental issues than any other occupation. In fact, it might be the opposite: Many of them are very resilient and highly adaptive. All these traits tend to self-select seafarers from the very beginning of their career. If you are not resilient, adaptive, and lack the ability to connect with people around you, you are unlikely to pursue a career where you are ganged up with a group of people for days on end. I don’t wish to ignore or belittle the genuine cases of mental problems. These must be handled professionally and with empathy. But right now, we are at risk of placing an entire group of highly skilled, adaptable, and professional workers in a bucket, and I think that is misguided."

The company’s subsidiary, Rubico, has been earmarked to press ahead with the 2021-built 157,000 dwt scrubber-fittedEco MalibuandEco West Coastand list on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Both vessels are currently part of sale-and-leaseback agreements with Chinese financiers, chartered to Clearlake Shipping, and managed by Central Shipping—a company affiliated with the family of Top Ships’ CEO, Evangelos Pistiolis. As part of the transaction, Top Ships is to distribute 100% of the common shares of Rubico to its security holders and said it expects there to be no overlapping board members or management between the two companies. Shareholders will receive one Rubico common share for every two Top Ships shares held on June 16. Top Ships currently counts a fleet of two VLCCs, five suezmaxes and three MR tankers, two of which are 50% owned. Rubico spin-off was first announced in June 2023, with theEco Malibuas part of the scheme and early plans to list on the OTCQX before seeking an eventual uplisting to a major exchange. The company, led by Greek shipping financial advisor Kalliopi Ornithopoulou, said in a SEC filing that following the separation, it intends to adopt a flexible acquisition strategy, eyeing further investments in suezmax tankers and potential diversification into other shipping sectors."

        "content": "Norway’s richest man, John Fredriksen, has launched a blistering critique of the state of life in both Norway and the UK, confirming he is relocating some of his business to the United Arab Emirates to escape what he sees as a Western world in steep decline. The 81-year-old shipping magnate spoke candidly to Norwegian titleE24this week at Oslo’s Tjuvholmen waterfront, where he was attending Nor-Shipping events. “I try to avoid Norway as much as I can,” Fredriksen said flatly when asked about the Norwegian government’s decision to sell its stake in airline Norwegian, in which he is the largest private shareholder. The entire Western world is on its way down Having long called London home, Fredriksen revealed he has now moved some of his business to the UAE, citing Britain’s new tax regime as a key factor behind the move—but not the only one. Late last year, he closed the London headquarters of Seatankers, one of his private shipping concerns. “Britain has gone to hell, like Norway,” Fredriksen said, expressing dismay over what he sees as creeping dysfunction in both countries. He accused both governments of overseeing environments where initiative is stifled and excessive regulation dominates. Fredriksen didn’t mince words when assessing the broader picture. “The entire Western world is on its way down and home,” he said, lamenting what he sees as a weakening work ethic and complacency in developed nations. He criticised the rise of remote work, calling instead for a return to traditional office culture: “People should get up and work even more, and go to the office instead of having a home office.” Asked about his views on Donald Trump and trade policy, the shipping tycoon dismissed them as “completely hopeless.” Fredriksen’s disillusionment with Norwegian politics and society runs deep. “I gave up on them a long time ago,” he said, noting his departure from the country in 1978. “It has only gotten worse. Norway is completely uninteresting,” he added, with the only positive remark reserved for the country’s public-sector workers: “Norway is good for those who work for the state.” Despite his harsh words, Fredriksen’s shipping empire remains tightly linked to Norway. He retains major stakes in companies such as tanker giant Frontline and seafood powerhouse Mowi. Fellow shipowner Arne Blystad was among those present at the event. He described Fredriksen’s attitude as unchanged despite the geographic shift. “He is a bull, as always,” Blystad toldE24, referencing Fredriksen’s famously aggressive business style. Fredriksen, arguably the most famous name in shipping, does not give media interviews often but has used his trip to Nor-Shipping to get a number of issues off his back. Fredriksen sharply criticised Norway’s political climate for maritime business in an interview on Sunday withFinansavisen, a leading Norwegian business daily. Fredriksen, now a Cypriot citizen, declared: “The framework conditions for shipping in Norway have never been weaker than they are now.” His remarks come as frustration grows within Norway’s maritime sector over what many perceive as eroding state support and a dwindling talent pipeline. Fredriksen’s warning reflects a wider unease among Norwegian shipowners, who have long felt sidelined by government policies seen as unfavourable to the shipping industry. His comments coincide with mounting concerns over a shortage of qualified maritime professionals, a shrinking domestic investor base, and the diminished role of the Oslo Stock Exchange in global shipping finance. “Shipping is almost wanted away,” Fredriksen stated, suggesting that successive regulatory decisions have alienated a sector traditionally seen as one of Norway’s most important industries.

        "content": "Mining giant Fortescue is on a worldwide campaign to reshape the future of maritime decarbonisation with its flagship vessel, theFortescue Green Pioneer, at the helm of a push to establish green ammonia as the marine fuel of the future. From Southeast Asia to Western Europe and soon South America, the 75 m long offshore vessel is sailing a message of zero-emissions shipping—backed by real-world results. Fortescue has set a target of eliminating scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian iron ore operations by 2030 and net-zero scope 3 emissions by 2040. Earlier this year, theGreen Pioneermade headlines when it became the world’s first vessel to complete a dual-fuelled ammonia trial in Singapore. Since then, its journey has evolved into a high-profile advocacy mission, stopping at some of the world’s most strategic maritime hubs and political forums. The industry can lead while policymakers catch up In March, the vessel arrived in the UK, berthing in Southampton and London’s iconic Canary Wharf and alongside HMS Belfast on the Thames. It underwent the UK’s first-ever Port State Control inspection of an ammonia-fuelled ship and hosted International Maritime Organization (IMO) decision-makers just as the global body reached a milestone agreement on carbon pricing for shipping. After fuelling up in Rotterdam, the vessel successfully completed a historic international voyage to the south of France via Gibraltar, marking another major breakthrough in demonstrating ammonia’s real-world viability as a marine fuel. TheGreen Pioneer’s mission continues at speed. It is now headed for Monaco to participate in the Blue Economy & Finance Forum, before sailing in a flotilla to Nice for the UN Ocean Conference. Later this year, the vessel is slated to appear at COP30 in Belém, Brazil continuing its global climate diplomacy voyage. Andrew Hoare, head of marine systems and green shipping at Fortescue, commented: “The Fortescue Green Pioneer is proof that industry can lead while policymakers catch up. Every voyage demonstrates that zero-emissions shipping is not theoretical—it’s here, and it works.” He added that scaling green ammonia is essential: “If we can scale green ammonia, we slash emissions, unlock green fuel markets and future-proof trade. But delay will entrench uncertainty, destabilise supply chains, and deepen the climate crisis.” At Nor-Shipping 2025 in Oslo this week, Fortescue’s executive chairman, Dr Andrew Forrest, took direct aim at the industry’s reliance on LNG, calling it a “greenwashing” tactic that undermines genuine decarbonisation. He accused shipping lines and the financial sector backing LNG-powered vessels of “wasting a decade” on expensive, low-impact transition fuels. “The choice is whether to waste the next 10 years on incremental measures that cost more and deliver less—or deliver a real zero fuel standard that drives investment into real maritime decarbonization solutions,” Forrest declared. A new study from the UCL Energy Institute’s Shipping and Oceans Research Group and UMAS, commissioned by the Global Maritime Forum, concludes that the International Maritime Organization’s recently agreed Net Zero Framework (NZF) sends a strong market signal favouring ammonia dual-fuel ships—particularly from the mid-2030s onward. However, ongoing uncertainties in policy design are holding back early investments in e-fuels and alternative marine fuels. The report uses a total cost of operation (TCO) model to evaluate various fuel pathways under the new regulatory landscape set by the IMO. While the NZF offers clearer direction for shipowners weighing fuel investments, several key policy elements—such as the zero and near-zero (ZNZ) reward mechanism and surplus unit (SU) trading dynamics—remain unresolved. “Many stakeholders were waiting for clarity from the IMO to make long-term decisions,” said Dr Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at the UCL Energy Institute. “While some uncertainties remain, the case for investing in ammonia dual-fuel ships is now compelling—even under conservative policy projections. In contrast, e-fuel producers still lack sufficient policy certainty to move forward at scale without additional government support or market opportunities.” The study finds that ammonia dual-fuel vessels strike the best balance of flexibility, competitiveness, and compliance from the mid-2030s, even without considering future rewards for ZNZ fuels. When likely developments in the reward structure are factored in, e-ammonia could emerge as a cost-effective compliance option as early as 2028."

        "content": "In the latest instalment from Ship Concept 2035, our brand new magazine, Splash reporters detail a recent, pertinent workshop at Geneva Dry. Starting off the 2025 edition of the world’s leading commodities shipping event, Geneva Dry, was a specialist workshop sponsored by Inmarsat exploring how connectivity at sea drives digitalisation, decarbonisation and particularly crew welfare. Hosting the panel, prior to the main conference at the Hotel President Wilson in the Swiss city of Geneva, Richard Watts, managing director of HR Maritime, tasked a stellar lineup of speakers with giving a rundown on the subject of how crewing and operations have changed in the digital age and how different areas of shipping and shipmanagement are being impacted. The first panellist to address the room was Audra Drablos, strategy director at maritime connectivity specialist Inmarsat, describing vessels in the past as remote islands compared to connection hubs or remote offices that they are today. Drablos argued that things have really changed for crews in terms of connecting back home and having less feeling of isolation, as well as operationally, because they don’t have to make decisions on their own, but also noted that although massive changes are taking place, this is far from universal. Are we turning a ship into a micromanaged hell? “I was shocked to hear that 13% of vessels still don’t provide connectivity to their crew,” she said, “but things are changing rapidly; there’s been a lot of disruption in terms of connectivity and how it’s delivered.” From the perspective of Silje Moan, chief commercial officer of Norwegian maritime software developer Dualog, changes in connectivity onboard ships over the last 10 years have been moving towards a high- or office-like bandwidth, low-latency situation. “We can move from focusing on saving costs on bits and bytes and compressing absolutely everything to focusing more on what kind of value we can bring to the end user on board and also in the office. Now we don’t have to take into account how much data this will require,” she said. Moving a little bit sideways, the discussion turned to ESG and how connectivity is helping the increasing requirement for collecting data and reporting. Peter Schellenberger, founder of maritime consultancy Novamaxis, highlighted that, while there are positive and negative impacts of connectivity increase, it is “the first real disruptor” that we see on a technology basis in the maritime sector that could hopefully be followed by many others if put in the right frame. “Now we can start thinking about what we are going to do with it meaningfully,” he said. Schellenberger noted that “surprisingly or not”, connectivity is still the number one driver for the crew. “If, as a company, you want to be relevant and retain and win new people, then these are the tools that you have to provide almost no matter what the cost is,” he said, adding that a move to declare connectivity a basic human right for a seafarer is something worth pursuing. Speaking of challenges that come along with better connectivity, Schellenberger called attention to loneliness on board when people disappear in their bunks, a lack of team building and onshore offices pushing more work for their colleagues at sea. “It’s not an enablement of the vessel; it’s an overload of bureaucracy,” he stressed. The microphone was then handed to Shubpreet Singh, senior managing director of strategy delivery at shipmanager V.Ships, who emphasised that the company has a standard of what it wants as a minimum connectivity, but that not all vessels are at the same level. “I have to admit that there are vessels that are more progressive. Vessels that are delivered new from the yard come with certain packages for monitoring the main engines or the systems onboard, and we, as managers, see the benefit of it.” Still, he observed that “the needle and the drivers” for most of the vessels are pointing to having better and more connectivity as an enabler, not just for the commercial work, but also for the crew. “So, going forward, I think the shift would be towards having more enabled vessels,” he said. The panel was put on the spot again with the moderator’s question on whether a move towards more connectivity is seen as all positive or if it is a little bit more nuanced than that. Singh argued for the latter, saying that if connectivity is not used properly, the crew onboard could actually get disabled. “As we are getting more connectivity, we have to unlearn some of the things that we used to do in the past and, you know, relearn so,” he said, explaining that for the masters onboard, the idea is not to always take their autonomy away and that managers as well as owners also have to be mindful and have checks and balances put in place for the mental health of the seafarers. Inmarsat’s Drablos shared that the company is seeing a lot of customers asking whether they can control the amount of internet that’s provided. “We are getting a lot of requests about restricting time so that they can manage fatigue. Basically, they don’t want the crew to be on the internet for such long periods of time,” she said. However, she also maintained that this is done due to the sense of camaraderie on vessels, because, in the past, most people spent their time in mess rooms. “So, bringing the crew back into the mess room, I think, is also another important thing that we need to think about now that we have so much internet connectivity,” she argued. In terms of regulating the crew, Singh reminded delegates that back when the master used to sail out without connectivity, ships still worked. “It’s not as if we had a disaster every day,” he said, adding, “Internet connectivity onboard for crew is like a kid in a candy shop…and if you try to control it, you will have challenging conversations.” Meanwhile, Drablos said that a lot of the crew, when they’re deciding whether to join, the first question they ask is about the internet onboard. “I don’t know anyone on land asking that question in a recruitment process,” she said, noting that it also has to do with the new population coming onto the vessels that are used to having internet all the time. “So, you know, the concept of a floating home and a floating office is something that they think is a basic need.” Dualog’s Moan reckoned limiting internet use is a bit of a minefield but also revealed that certain companies have been working to create a sense of belonging for the new generation of seafarers by giving them their company identity. Speaking from the audience, Manish Singh from Aboutships and a third-generation seafarer, observed that some of the language used during the panel, if seafarers were in the room, they would find it “borderline patronising, if not offensive”. “So we are trusting them with our ships, with our cargo, with the safety of life and the marine environment, but we can’t trust them with connectivity!? Try having that conversation with your children at home. That will tell you where this rhetoric needs to move on,” he said. He further stressed that shipmanagers need to stop taking ships that don’t have the basic levels of connectivity and welfare and that the conversation has to move to digitalisation and decarbonisation. Singh from V.Ships agreed that seafarers don’t need to be patronised and that the company is already preparing them for the new types of vessels, but that in this mass of the seafaring community that’s not really linked to owners or managers, at some time they could lose people, and that there have to be many other solutions that have to be reasons for the seafarers to stay with that company. “There are a lot of intangible things that need to be done, and it’s really a battle of hearts and minds. We are very much at the mercy of making sure that we treat our seafarers equitably, rightly,” he divulged. Adding to the discussion, Dimitris Monioudis, chairman of the technical committee of INTERCARGO, reminded the panel of the necessity of all stakeholders to take part. “Rather than just putting all the focus on the crew or the shipmanager, we should take into account the obligations that other stakeholders, such as ports, fuel suppliers, and charterers have. So, everybody has to play their part,” he asserted. The final question from the audience came from Graeme Somerville-Ryan, founder of Eyesea, asking, “Are we turning a ship into a micromanaged hell?” Coming from the manager’s perspective, Singh told delegates that there’s a lot of “instant gratification” wanted from ships these days, which was not the case in the past. “From a very commercial perspective, it’s about getting the information right here, right now, from a ship manager’s perspective. It’s about getting things right all the time,” he said. Discussion drew to a close with remarks on autonomous ships now, with Inmarsat’s Drablos saying that with the levels of connectivity that the industry is seeing, “it could leapfrog us, but regulation is going to be a burden there for sure”. Dualog’s Moan believed it is not about having autonomous ships as the goal but instead about running an efficient ship. “I don’t think the goal should be to remove the crew but rather to find the correct balance of using IT and the digital to run it efficiently,” she said. Schellenberger closed the session by saying, “What is quite clear is that as long as we don’t have standardisation of the technology, we will always have people on board. So, I will reassure the seafarers who want to join the trade; we will need them for a long time.” To access the whole of Ship Concept 2035 for free online,click here."

Venture Energy aims to connect producers of clean fuels in China to end users around the world, developing plant projects and procuring product both for downstream customers and for the potential future requirements of Wah Kwong and other shipowners. From late 2026, Venture Energy expects to offer methanol supply from a portfolio of plants with nearly 500,000 tonnes per annum of supply fixed. The commercial development of Venture Energy and its operations will be driven by general manager Deepak Devendrappa, who has joined the Hing Chao-led company from methanol giant Methanex Corporation. Devendrappa commented: “China can contribute significantly in terms of lowering green fuel costs for shipping companies and we are committed to working with esteemed companies along this green fuels value chain.” The name of the subsidiary is a nod to Wah Kwong’s heritage, with many of the company’s vessels featuring the name Venture. In March this year, Wah Kwong teamed up with Chinese clean energy producer CIMC ENRIC to offer green methanol bunkering solutions in southern China’s Greater Bay Area and across Asia. Many of China’s leading shipping companies have invested heavily in developing a green methanol industrial chain in recent years, with the country’s maritime sector better placed than most to switch to this alternative fuel."

The entire Western world is on its way down Having long called London home, Fredriksen revealed he has now moved some of his business to the UAE, citing Britain’s new tax regime as a key factor behind the move—but not the only one. Late last year, he closed the London headquarters of Seatankers, one of his private shipping concerns. “Britain has gone to hell, like Norway,” Fredriksen said, expressing dismay over what he sees as creeping dysfunction in both countries. He accused both governments of overseeing environments where initiative is stifled and excessive regulation dominates. Fredriksen didn’t mince words when assessing the broader picture. “The entire Western world is on its way down and home,” he said, lamenting what he sees as a weakening work ethic and complacency in developed nations. He criticised the rise of remote work, calling instead for a return to traditional office culture: “People should get up and work even more, and go to the office instead of having a home office.” Asked about his views on Donald Trump and trade policy, the shipping tycoon dismissed them as “completely hopeless.” Fredriksen’s disillusionment with Norwegian politics and society runs deep. “I gave up on them a long time ago,” he said, noting his departure from the country in 1978. “It has only gotten worse. Norway is completely uninteresting,” he added, with the only positive remark reserved for the country’s public-sector workers: “Norway is good for those who work for the state.” Despite his harsh words, Fredriksen’s shipping empire remains tightly linked to Norway. He retains major stakes in companies such as tanker giant Frontline and seafood powerhouse Mowi. Fellow shipowner Arne Blystad was among those present at the event. He described Fredriksen’s attitude as unchanged despite the geographic shift. “He is a bull, as always,” Blystad toldE24, referencing Fredriksen’s famously aggressive business style. Fredriksen, arguably the most famous name in shipping, does not give media interviews often but has used his trip to Nor-Shipping to get a number of issues off his back. Fredriksen sharply criticised Norway’s political climate for maritime business in an interview on Sunday withFinansavisen, a leading Norwegian business daily. Fredriksen, now a Cypriot citizen, declared: “The framework conditions for shipping in Norway have never been weaker than they are now.” His remarks come as frustration grows within Norway’s maritime sector over what many perceive as eroding state support and a dwindling talent pipeline. Fredriksen’s warning reflects a wider unease among Norwegian shipowners, who have long felt sidelined by government policies seen as unfavourable to the shipping industry. His comments coincide with mounting concerns over a shortage of qualified maritime professionals, a shrinking domestic investor base, and the diminished role of the Oslo Stock Exchange in global shipping finance. “Shipping is almost wanted away,” Fredriksen stated, suggesting that successive regulatory decisions have alienated a sector traditionally seen as one of Norway’s most important industries. Fredriksen also shared withFinansavisenhis current investment strategy, telling the newspaper: “We are opportunistic and look for good investments—not necessarily control.” He explained his group’s recent surge in equity purchases across multiple maritime and offshore companies including Star Bulk Carriers, International Seaways and offshore driller Valaris. Fredriksen’s strategy focused on undervalued shipping equities, with the expectation of strong returns as supply tightens and geopolitical volatility reshapes global trade flows. “It can be valuable to have gas in the tank when others run out,” he noted, suggesting that liquidity and timing will be critical differentiators in the coming years. “Shipping has always been cyclical,” he said. “The question is who’s prepared when the cycle turns.”"

The manager of the vessel, London-based Zodiac Maritime, said that the incident occurred at around midnight local time on June 3 during the vessel’s voyage from Mexico to Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico. The vessel is chartered to China’s SAIC Anji Logistics. The 2006-built car carrier was loaded with 3,159 vehicles, among them 65 fully electric and 681 hybrid-electric vehicles. The crew’s firefighting attempts were not able to bring the situation under control, so they were forced to abandon ship. The 2006-built, 9,469 teu containershipCosco Hellasrescued all 22 crew members from a life raft launched by the car carrier. All members of the crew are safe, accounted for, and uninjured. The Coast Guard said that the vessel was carrying approximately 350 tonnes of gas fuel and 1,530 tonnes of very low-sulphur fuel oil. The Coast Guard CutterMunrowas diverted to the scene, as well as a C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, while an MH-60T Jayhawk helicopter aircrew was staged in Adak to help with the response. The status of the fire aboard the car carrier is currently unclear, however, smoke continues to be seen rising from the vessel. Due to the possible environmental risks from the fuel and vehicle cargo aboard the drifting vessel, the Coast Guard will continue monitoring the situation. Transporting electric vehicles has been a concern for some time now, as several car carriers which were transporting EVs caught fire in the last several years, most recently theFreemantle Highwayin 2023. The fire can last for days due to temperatures of over 2,700 degrees Celsius generated by on fire lithium-ion batteries.

        "content": "Marine construction specialist Allseas has launched a five-year plan to design, develop, and deploy a small modular reactor tailored for both offshore vessels and onshore use. Both uses have their benefits, as nuclear offers energy density with zero emissions and a stable, scalable power supply. Onshore, SMRs can ease grid pressure while providing consistent, carbon-free power and heat. Allseas has selected high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) in the 25MWe range, due to their inherently safe characteristics. This fourth-generation reactor technology generates energy without combustion or emissions. HTGRs are powered by tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles, each containing a uranium oxide core, coated with several advanced protective ceramic layers that securely contain fission products, even under extreme conditions. The reactor self-regulates and remains stable, keeping temperatures well below critical thresholds. In the unlikely event of malfunction, the system automatically cools down and shuts off without active intervention or external cooling. Allseas is also exploring circular approaches to waste management, such as the reuse of graphite and the reprocessing of spent TRISO fuel. In the first year, the company will finalise initial design studies for offshore and onshore use. This will be followed by prototype development and pre-licensing discussions. “Our goal is to start production at a dedicated facility by 2030. Initial deployment will likely begin on land while offshore regulations are finalised, followed by application on our vessels and broader industry adoption. This aligns with our sustainability targets – 30% emissions reduction by 2030, and net-zero operations by 2050,” said Stephanie Heerema, project manager for nuclear development at Allseas."

        "content": "Maritime tech experts discuss how to make sure ships spend less time in port in the latest installment from Ship Concept 2035, our brand new magazine. Any holistic report into how ships will operate in the future such as our brand new magazine, Ship Concept 2035, needs to look at the ports side of the business. What more can be done to ensure ships spend less time at port? Are terminals doing enough to drive efficiency across the supply chain? These two questions were scrutinised at the recent Digital Efficiency Drivers At Port session at Geneva Dry, the world’s premier commodities shipping conference where delegates were given a glimpse of the technology driving change on land. The central theme revolved around transforming talk of innovation into actionable strategies, real-world examples, and measurable results. With a panel of seasoned professionals across maritime technology and analytics, the session explored the digital transformation sweeping ports and terminals globally, and how to practically navigate that change. Kicking off the session, moderator Cynthia Worley, vice president of strategic accounts at UK-based technology firm Sedna, underscored the overwhelming pace of digitalisation, with AI tools like ChatGPT dominating conversations, yet many professionals remain unsure about where to begin or what questions to ask. Ben Palmer, president of Inmarsat Maritime, emphasised that reliable, real-time connectivity is essential for ports and terminals to function efficiently. He drew parallels between the shipping industry and manufacturing facilities, explaining that while the maritime sector is inherently interconnected, it suffers from a lack of true digital integration. Palmer highlighted the need for always-on, global, secure connectivity—likening it to oxygen for digitalisation. He noted that recent advances in satellite-based, multi-band connectivity have finally provided the infrastructure necessary for widespread innovation. However, cultural conservatism and resistance to change still hamper adoption. The industry must adopt new tools and embrace a new mindset Janani Yagnamurthy, vice president of analytics at maritime tech firm Marcura, built on Palmer’s points by identifying mindset, fear of dark data, and integration complexity as key barriers. She emphasised that legacy systems, while functional, often discourage experimentation and that many ports are paralysed by the sheer volume of data. She shared the example of the Port of Gijón in Spain, which successfully adopted a modular, non-disruptive digital approach. Rather than replacing systems outright, they layered sensors over existing infrastructure to start small and scale progressively. This phased model respected financial and operational constraints and allowed data maturity to grow organically. Ingrid Kylstad, managing director of Norwegian solutions provider Klaveness Digital, stressed the importance of not just acquiring digital tools, but also integrating them strategically into workflows. The real value, she argued, comes from transforming how teams operate—not merely digitising existing inefficiencies. Kylstad warned against buying high-potential tools without internal process redesign, drawing a vivid analogy of buying a Ferrari and driving it like a Fiat. Without adapting workflows and ensuring integration, the true ROI remains untapped, leading to eventual disillusionment, she told delegates. Evangelos Efstathiou, CEO of Burmester & Vogel, a laytime and demurrage software company, noted that historical resistance to automation stemmed from fragmented tools and a lack of standardisation. However, with the advent of SaaS platforms and APIs, seamless integration is now more attainable than ever. He advocated for incremental wins to build momentum—starting with small, demonstrable benefits to encourage internal buy-in. Yuriy Kizlevych, co-founder of Overhorn Swiss, a port management specialist, supported this by highlighting the global disparity in terminal performance. He advocated for sharing AI-driven operational data transparently with stakeholders to drive optimisation and competitive advantage. This multi-model, data-sharing environment, he argued, could significantly reshape trade patterns. The panel agreed that while technology enables transformation, trust is what sustains it. Digital adoption is as much a human challenge as a technical one. Tools must empower employees rather than replace them, with training, clarity, and inclusion key to overcoming scepticism. An audience member shared a success story of cloud migration followed by a deliberate pause to let employees catch up. Rather than pushing for continuous upgrades, they emphasised empowerment and ownership, resulting in increased internal innovation. The discussion turned toward the untapped potential of operational data. Kylstad stressed that while many systems now promote transparency and efficiency, the real opportunity lies in using that data to develop new business models—not just for cost savings, but for revenue generation. Efstathiou echoed this by citing an example where a client requested dashboards to prioritise only high-risk voyages, streamlining focus. Aggregating such data could help all stakeholders benchmark performance and identify gaps. Port documentation remains a bottleneck in many operations delegates were told. Yagnamurthy from Marcura addressed the inconsistencies in format, language, and metadata in critical documents like statements of facts (SOFs), notices of readiness, and bills of lading. She recommended robust master data management, data governance, and the use of AI to extract, standardise, and interpret such data—ultimately turning it into an asset rather than a liability. Kylstad suggested that the rise of tools like ChatGPT and intelligent automation will increasingly simplify and democratize access to complex documents, making industry-wide standardisation less critical than it once was. Efstathiou and Inmarsat’s Palmer agreed that while different segments face unique challenges, shared-value ecosystems can offer immense benefits. They encouraged open communication, shared KPIs, and collaborative platforms as a future model. Yagnamurthy foresaw a need to “unlearn every five years” due to rapid changes in AI models and workforce expectations. “As AI and digital ecosystems evolve, the ability to unlearn and relearn every few years will be crucial. Maritime operations are shifting fast, performance metrics are changing, IT is becoming operational, and digital agility will be a defining capability. To stay relevant, the industry must adopt new tools and embrace a new mindset,” Yagnamurthy said. In his closing remarks, Burmester & Vogel’s Efstathiou advised the audience to take an active role—don’t wait for vendors to deliver a perfect solution. Engage, experiment, and drive collaboration between stakeholders, he said, advising that the technology gap between consumer and enterprise tools is narrowing quickly, and those who move fast and smart will win the competitive edge.

        "content": "Sagitta Marine managing director Thomas Zaidman argues why smaller shipowners are a necessary force – not a risk – in the market. The recent Geneva Dry conference saw shipowners converge in huge numbers to listen to panels on many matters of interest to the market across two days. Among them, therisk management workshopraised interesting points about operational risk in dry bulk shipping. However, the characterisation by some of the speakers of smaller owners as inherently riskier or problematic – and predictions of their imminent demise – overlooks the essential role they play in today’s fragmented, performance-driven market. At Sagitta Marine, we believe operational scale is no substitute for operational discipline. In particular we work to counter the false equivalency between smaller company size and higher risk. The assertion that smaller owners or operators are automatically higher risk than larger ones ignores the reality that risk is a function of governance, transparency and operational rigour, not the dwt under management. For smaller operators, reputational risk is existential. It’s for this reason that we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards. As was noted in the workshop, large operators can absorb the results of bad decisions and carry on sailing because they are making money on another and will look to net off losses. We understand that one bad trade can undo years of credibility and as a result we judge ourselves on every business decision, time after time. There are no suitcases full of cash changing hands on a Friday afternoon. We choose our partners as carefully as our clients choose us. It’s true that to be a successful small operator in dry bulk you have to punch above your weight. Over eight years of operation, 400+ voyages carrying 12m tons of cargo, we can demonstrate our credentials – and we are called upon to do this every day. This is despite – or perhaps because – we practice risk control and risk management in our daily operations. We rely on strict vessel vetting, P&I cover that understands our business, use of the futures markets to hedge freight and fuel risk. Managed conservatively, against a physical book of business rather than for speculation, none of these instruments increases risk; indeed, they act to mitigate it. It’s perhaps true that a small operator like Sagitta Marine is exposed to risk in some senses. We don’t have the structure to offset losses or hide them a drawer. For us there’s simply no-where to hide, so we don’t try to. But as a small operator, our lean structure means we are necessarily close to our clients. That gives us short reporting lines and enables a more proactive attitude to opportunities and quicker response times when questions come up. It is an oversimplification to equate a trend towards market consolidation with increased security for counterparties. In today’s market marked by trade disruption, tariffs and geopolitics, agility, niche specialisation and hands-on management are not weaknesses. Rather they are strengths. Many cargo interests today prefer to work with entrepreneurial operators who can tailor solutions and stay close to the trade rather than put their business into a conveyor belt where control and flexibility are reduced, not increased. The biggest mistake would be to take anything for granted, especially in markets as unpredictable as we find them today. We are open to the conversation around how to de-risk shipping – and whether there is a way to do this that the wider industry would accept. It’s undeniably true that the dry bulk space is undergoing a process of transformation that will play out over the next decade. But assuming that large owners are the only ones who can survive this process is fundamentally wrong. All actors – large or small, regional and global – have a role to play in shaping the dry bulk markets for the future. It’s a debate and discussion we welcome and wish to continue. Let’s be clear though, that size is not everything. A large shipping operation is not by itself a proxy for trustworthiness, nor is a small, agile but engaged one an indicator of greater risk."

        "content": "The volume of ship traffic in the Red Sea has increased by 60% since August 2024, now reaching 36 to 37 ships per day. Despite the rebound, volumes remain well below pre-crisis levels, according to Rear Admiral Vasileios Gryparis, commander of the EU’s Aspides naval mission. Gryparis told Reuters that the uptick in merchant shipping through the Bab Al-Mandab Strait followed a reduction in Houthi missile and drone attacks, as well as a ceasefire agreement between the US and Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi movement. Shipping volumes had plummeted to just 20 to 23 ships per day last August, versus an average of 72 to 75 ships before Houthi attacks began in November 2023 in response to Israel’s war in Gaza. Although the recovery is notable, Gryparis emphasised that maritime traffic remains significantly below pre-conflict levels. According to Gryparis, the last known attack on a commercial vessel occurred in November 2024. Since then, the Houthis have narrowed their targets to Israeli-linked vessels or those that have previously docked at Israeli ports. “If your vessel doesn’t fall under those categories, the likelihood of being targeted is extremely low—more than 99%,” Gryparis said. However, he warned that absolute safety could not be guaranteed. Since its deployment, the Aspides mission has provided close protection to more than 450 ships. Despite the relative calm, uncertainty about sending ships through the Red Sea has remained. Last month, US President Donald Trump declared that the Red Sea shipping crisis was nearing an end after more than 17 months. He claimed that the Houthis had agreed to halt their attacks on shipping, and that in return, Washington would stop its strikes on the rebel group. However, the Houthis continue to issue defiant statements, and major global shipping lines remain cautious. During recent earnings calls, most operators indicated it is still too soon to resume regular transits through the Red Sea."

        "content": "Efforts to bring the fire-strickenMorning Midasunder control are facing a significant delay, with salvage teams not expected to reach the drifting vessel until Monday, nearly a full week after the crew abandoned ship. Zodiac Maritime, the manager of the Liberian-flagged car carrier, confirmed that it has appointed Florida-based Resolve Marine to lead the salvage and firefighting response. However, due to the remote location of the incident — approximately 300 miles southwest of Adak Island in the Aleutian chain — the first tug with specialists and equipment is not expected to arrive until June 9. 70 fully electric cars and 680 hybrids were among the cargo onboard theMorning Midaswhen it caught fire on June 3 while en route to Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico. The crew followed emergency firefighting protocols and deployed the vessel’s suppression systems, which Zodiac Maritime says were fully operational. Despite these efforts, the intensity of the blaze forced the crew to abandon ship for their own safety. All crewmembers successfully evacuated using lifeboats and were rescued without injury by the nearbyCOSCO Hellas, a containership responding to the distress alert received by the US Coast Guard. “The ability to monitor other onboard conditions is limited,” Zodiac said, noting that while theMorning Midasremains afloat and trackable via satellite, the fire remains active. A Coast Guard aerial inspection confirmed that smoke continues to rise from the vessel, though there have been no signs of marine pollution. An additional firefighting tug with ocean towage capacity is being arranged to support the operation. The delay in response highlights the logistical challenges of maritime incidents in remote regions like the North Pacific. Adak Island, the closest landfall, lies about 2,000 km west of Anchorage. The cause of the fire and the condition of the cargo — particularly the onboard EVs, which have raised concerns about lithium-ion battery fires in maritime settings — remain under investigation. Many high-profile incidents have drawn attention to the fire risks posed by lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years. The International Union of Marine Insurers (IUMI) recently called for urgent updates to safety protocols aboard car carriers, including advanced detection systems and dedicated EV firefighting strategies. Some operators, like Höegh Autoliners and Wallenius Wilhelmsen, are investing in fire-retardant deck coatings and additional thermal cameras to mitigate risks. Shipowners and insurers alike are pressing for tighter pre-shipment checks, stricter state-of-charge limits during loading, and clearer international guidelines. Fire and explosion incidents also saw a significant rise, with 250 reported in 2024—a 20% increase year-on-year and the highest total in a decade, according to Allianz’s recently published Safety and Shipping Review. Lithium batteries can fail due to mechanical, chemical, or thermal abuse. This failure can lead to a phenomenon known as thermal runaway, where the heat generated becomes self-sustaining, causing temperatures to soar and triggering a dangerous chain reaction. Once thermal runaway starts, it can be almost impossible to stop, often resulting in explosions and fires. Adding to the risk is the toxic vapour produced during battery failure. Industry sources indicate that up to 6,000 litres of vapour per kWh can be released, containing highly toxic substances like hydrogen fluoride. A fire involving an electric vehicle might require 136,000 litres of water over four hours to extinguish, compared to just 10,000 to 17,000 litres over 30 minutes for a traditional combustion engine vehicle."

        "content": "Drewry’s weekly World Container Index (WCI) increased 41% to $3,527 per feu yesterday, the second highest leap dollars-wise since the index was created, with the busy transpacific leading the way once again amid a brief trade detente between the world’s two largest economies, the US and China. Rival spot index, the Shanghai Container Freight Index, published today, increased a more moderate 8% to 2240.35 points. Drewry’s WCI has increased 70% in the last four weeks, as president Donald Trump’s pause on import tariffs led to a resumption of US-bound traffic after the initial collapse of transpacific volumes. Freight rates from Shanghai to Los Angeles have jumped 57% to $5,876 per feu in the past week and 117% since May 8. Spot rates to New York have risen 39% in the past week and 96% in the past four weeks. Judah Levine, head of research at Freightos, a box booking platform, suggested that the sharper climb for west coast rates may reflect shippers’ need for speed and preference for a shorter journey as they frontload ahead of the tariff deadline. The market surge has also spilled over into the charter market Carriers have likewise scheduled record capacity to the west coast through July to serve this anticipated demand, Levine pointed out. “The surge in China-US volumes since mid-May is already leading to significant congestion at some major ports in China and in Singapore and other tranship hubs as well. Some observers are concerned that this jump in demand could overwhelm the ports of LA and Long Beach in a few weeks, though port officials say they are ready to handle the volume increase,” Levine said. Jefferies, an investment bank, commented in a note to clients on the transpacific situation: “Capacity remains constrained due to previous vessel re-routing, and it will likely take until late June/early July for this to be alleviated.” Freight rates from Shanghai to Rotterdam and Genoa have also risen in the past week, by 32% and 38%, respectively, according to Drewry. Sea-Intelligence, a Danish container shipping consultancy, noted in a report published on Sunday that on the transpacific tradelane to the west coast, capacity growth looks set to be in excess of 30% year-on-year in five of the next 11 weeks. Linerlytica, a rival Asian consultancy, noted: “The market surge has also spilled over into the charter market where vessel availability is very low and carriers are still seeking tonnage to take advantage of the large rate hikes.” Linerlytica said there remains little clarity on where the market heads from here as new capacity injections to the US starts to dampen the rate momentum, while uncertainty remains over the sustainability of the volume surge after the 90 day tariff truce ends. Drewry’s Container Forecaster, meanwhile, expects the supply-demand balance to weaken again in the second half, which will cause spot rates to decline again in the second half of this year. “The volatility and timing of rate changes will depend on the outcome of legal challenges to Trump’s tariffs and on capacity changes related to the introduction of the US penalties on Chinese ships, which are uncertain,” Drewry maintained.

The 81-year-old shipping magnate spoke candidly to Norwegian titleE24this week at Oslo’s Tjuvholmen waterfront, where he was attending Nor-Shipping events. “I try to avoid Norway as much as I can,” Fredriksen said flatly when asked about the Norwegian government’s decision to sell its stake in airline Norwegian, in which he is the largest private shareholder. The entire Western world is on its way down Having long called London home, Fredriksen revealed he has now moved some of his business to the UAE, citing Britain’s new tax regime as a key factor behind the move—but not the only one. Late last year, he closed the London headquarters of Seatankers, one of his private shipping concerns. “Britain has gone to hell, like Norway,” Fredriksen said, expressing dismay over what he sees as creeping dysfunction in both countries. He accused both governments of overseeing environments where initiative is stifled and excessive regulation dominates. Fredriksen didn’t mince words when assessing the broader picture. “The entire Western world is on its way down and home,” he said, lamenting what he sees as a weakening work ethic and complacency in developed nations. He criticised the rise of remote work, calling instead for a return to traditional office culture: “People should get up and work even more, and go to the office instead of having a home office.” Asked about his views on Donald Trump and trade policy, the shipping tycoon dismissed them as “completely hopeless.” Fredriksen’s disillusionment with Norwegian politics and society runs deep. “I gave up on them a long time ago,” he said, noting his departure from the country in 1978. “It has only gotten worse. Norway is completely uninteresting,” he added, with the only positive remark reserved for the country’s public-sector workers: “Norway is good for those who work for the state.” Despite his harsh words, Fredriksen’s shipping empire remains tightly linked to Norway. He retains major stakes in companies such as tanker giant Frontline and seafood powerhouse Mowi. Fellow shipowner Arne Blystad was among those present at the event. He described Fredriksen’s attitude as unchanged despite the geographic shift. “He is a bull, as always,” Blystad toldE24, referencing Fredriksen’s famously aggressive business style. Fredriksen, arguably the most famous name in shipping, does not give media interviews often but has used his trip to Nor-Shipping to get a number of issues off his back. Fredriksen sharply criticised Norway’s political climate for maritime business in an interview on Sunday withFinansavisen, a leading Norwegian business daily. Fredriksen, now a Cypriot citizen, declared: “The framework conditions for shipping in Norway have never been weaker than they are now.” His remarks come as frustration grows within Norway’s maritime sector over what many perceive as eroding state support and a dwindling talent pipeline. Fredriksen’s warning reflects a wider unease among Norwegian shipowners, who have long felt sidelined by government policies seen as unfavourable to the shipping industry. His comments coincide with mounting concerns over a shortage of qualified maritime professionals, a shrinking domestic investor base, and the diminished role of the Oslo Stock Exchange in global shipping finance. “Shipping is almost wanted away,” Fredriksen stated, suggesting that successive regulatory decisions have alienated a sector traditionally seen as one of Norway’s most important industries. Fredriksen also shared withFinansavisenhis current investment strategy, telling the newspaper: “We are opportunistic and look for good investments—not necessarily control.” He explained his group’s recent surge in equity purchases across multiple maritime and offshore companies including Star Bulk Carriers, International Seaways and offshore driller Valaris. Fredriksen’s strategy focused on undervalued shipping equities, with the expectation of strong returns as supply tightens and geopolitical volatility reshapes global trade flows. “It can be valuable to have gas in the tank when others run out,” he noted, suggesting that liquidity and timing will be critical differentiators in the coming years. “Shipping has always been cyclical,” he said. “The question is who’s prepared when the cycle turns.”"

Can we take a moment and please stop placing seafarers in a victim role, very few of them have ever asked for? There’s a whole industry that’s come up, focused on the strain of being a seafarer, away from home month after month, sometimes facing rough seas, geopolitical strains, and more. Yes, they do face all of the above – but not all the time. Most seafarers I speak with, and that’s quite a few, are happy with their chosen career. While they themselves may not wish their children to follow in their footsteps, they have no plans to move ashore. And once you start digging, the stories of camaraderie, of shared experiences, of fellowship, of struggles shared and overcome, are many. So many of them beam with pride at how they manage to take excellent care of their family, their parents, their siblings, and often a wide web of their relatives. This pride is gently tempered with gratitude. Gratitude for the parents who often helped them get their education; gratitude to the spouse who keeps the wheels turning at home all the time; gratitude to siblings and relatives who support the seafarer. And gratitude to their fellow seafarers who sail with them. All of this is in the picture above. They tell of near-mythical sunsets with friends, of sunrises, of social activities. They also tell of the occasional feud, which is more often than not settled onboard. Yes, they tell of near-misses, of accidents – none of them try to wave away the risks of the job. But they know them; they are trained to identify, mitigate and handle them; they are surrounded by people who all share the same goal: To come home safe and sound. In my experience, seafarers are no more likely to experience mental issues than any other occupation. In fact, it might be the opposite: Many of them are very resilient and highly adaptive. All these traits tend to self-select seafarers from the very beginning of their career. If you are not resilient, adaptive, and lack the ability to connect with people around you, you are unlikely to pursue a career where you are ganged up with a group of people for days on end. I don’t wish to ignore or belittle the genuine cases of mental problems. These must be handled professionally and with empathy.

The 81-year-old shipping magnate spoke candidly to Norwegian titleE24this week at Oslo’s Tjuvholmen waterfront, where he was attending Nor-Shipping events. “I try to avoid Norway as much as I can,” Fredriksen said flatly when asked about the Norwegian government’s decision to sell its stake in airline Norwegian, in which he is the largest private shareholder. The entire Western world is on its way down Having long called London home, Fredriksen revealed he has now moved some of his business to the UAE, citing Britain’s new tax regime as a key factor behind the move—but not the only one.

He accused both governments of overseeing environments where initiative is stifled and excessive regulation dominates. Fredriksen didn’t mince words when assessing the broader picture. “The entire Western world is on its way down and home,” he said, lamenting what he sees as a weakening work ethic and complacency in developed nations. He criticised the rise of remote work, calling instead for a return to traditional office culture: “People should get up and work even more, and go to the office instead of having a home office.” Asked about his views on Donald Trump and trade policy, the shipping tycoon dismissed them as “completely hopeless.” Fredriksen’s disillusionment with Norwegian politics and society runs deep. “I gave up on them a long time ago,” he said, noting his departure from the country in 1978. “It has only gotten worse. Norway is completely uninteresting,” he added, with the only positive remark reserved for the country’s public-sector workers: “Norway is good for those who work for the state.” Despite his harsh words, Fredriksen’s shipping empire remains tightly linked to Norway. He retains major stakes in companies such as tanker giant Frontline and seafood powerhouse Mowi. Fellow shipowner Arne Blystad was among those present at the event.

The incident occurred on Monday around 12.30 hrs Singapore time, some 80 km southwest of Azhikkal, Kerala. The 4,333 teu vessel, operated by Wan Hai Lines, had 22 crew members onboard at the time. Eighteen crew members were rescued from lifeboats by a passing vessel, though some sustained injuries. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) reported that search and rescue operations are underway, supported by the Indian Coast Guard and Indian Navy. Dramatic images and videos posted by the Indian Coast Guard on the social media platform X showed heavy black smoke billowing from the ship and several containers damaged or displaced. According to Indian officials cited by Reuters, at least 40 containers fell into the sea following a series of explosions and fires. Authorities continue to investigate the cause of the incident and are working to locate the missing seafarers: a Taiwanese national, two Indonesians, and one from Myanmar. The 2005-built vessel was en route to Nhava Sheva in Mumbai from the Sri Lankan port of Colombo, according to AIS data.

        "content": "The Canadian province of Nova Scotia has proposed a major offshore wind project with the end goal of constructing enough turbines to generate 40GW of electricity over the next decade. The premier of Nova Scotia, Tim Houston, outlined the plan, which would, if executed, cover around 27% of Canada’s current electricity demand. Houston hopes that the current Liberal government will support the project, named Wind West, after the incumbent prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, revealed his intention to ramp up the country’s offshore wind capacity. Nova Scotia currently has no operational offshore wind projects. It is currently licensing 5GW of developments by 2030 in five areas. However, if the Wind West plan were to go through, that number would increase eight times. Houston’s plan also includes the construction of a transmission system to distribute electricity to other provinces and anticipates powering green hydrogen production, as well as battery manufacturing, and data centres. “Right now, Nova Scotia is on the edge of a clean energy breakthrough. We’ve been handed a golden ticket, and we cannot afford to let this moment pass us by. This will transform our economy, create jobs and support families – it would be a game changer,” said Houston."

        "content": "US Wind’s wind project off Maryland is now clear to begin construction after receiving the final required permit from the state. The final approval by the Maryland Department of the Environment was for the air quality permit application submitted by the company in November 2023. Under the construction plan, the project, located some 15 km off Worcester County, can have up to 114 wind turbines and four offshore substations. US Wind has not proposed a specific wind turbine model, but it is considering turbine models with individual nameplates of up to 18MW. At most, the wind farm will have a capacity of 2,052MW. “The Department has reviewed the application, and the comments received and has determined that the proposed construction and commissioning of the offshore wind project would not cause violations of any applicable air pollution control regulations,” the Department stated. This was the last permit required from the state, while the final federal permit was awarded by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) in December. “US Wind’s projects will produce massive amounts of homegrown energy and will help satisfy the region’s critical need for more electricity,” said Jeff Grybowski, US Wind CEO. However, further project development is still not clear-cut. Aside from the looming distaste for offshore wind from the Trump Administration, there is an ongoing lawsuit challenging BOEM’s approval. Another issue lies in Sussex County in the state of Delaware, where US Wind power lines from the turbines are supposed to land onshore. The proposed substation is currently under challenge as well. This brand-new Maryland permit can also be challenged through a petition with the Clerk of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental Appeals Board. The decision to grant the permit was immediately hit with opposition in the form of Maryland senator Mary Beth Carozza, who blasted the decision, and even the Ocean City mayor. “The entire economy of our coastal resort town is dependent on tourism, our ecosystem, and commercial fishing, all of which will be significantly impacted if hundreds of these giant eyesores are constructed 10 miles from our beaches,” said Rick Meehan, Ocean City mayor."

Singh will serve as CEO of the newly formed Maris Investments, and has also made an investment alongside GTCR. Singh, a former seafarer, was previously CEO of Ocean Technologies Group, a platform recently acquired by Lloyd’s Register, and before that was with V.Group. In a release, Maris said it will seek to acquire companies in the maritime technology sector to build a market-leading platform addressing critical workflows and enabling digital transformation in the industry. “We are excited to partner with Manish, whose proven track record, deep domain expertise and industry relationships in the maritime space make him an ideal partner to lead this platform,” said Mark Anderson, managing director and head of technology, media and telecommunications at GTCR. “Maritime technology is a compelling industry currently experiencing rapid and transformative digital innovation, and we look forward to leveraging GTCR’s long history of investing in vertical technology businesses to build a market-leading maritime technology company.” Since its inception in 1980, GTCR has invested more than $30bn in over 280 companies, and the firm currently manages approximately $50bn in equity capital. For his part, Singh commented that Maris aims to redefine how maritime workforces and fleets adopt integrated technology and harness data to improve performance, safety and compliance. “This partnership is about transforming how future fleets are operated and governed,” Singh said."

        "content": "Shipping is entering an exciting, potentially transformative era over the coming decade, reckons Ben Palmer, the president of Inmarsat Maritime. The question he has though, is whether the industry will be able to grab all the opportunities out there, or will its conservative, fragmented nature hold it back? “The fundamental shipping business model has not changed since the 18th century,” Palmer tellsMaritime CEO. “Over the last 50 years, ships have got fatter, faster and longer, but they still look pretty much like they did after World War II.” With connectivity growing exponentially, ships and their operations are set for change, Palmer says. This started with crew welfare, and is now moving towards “office-like” connectedness. “There’s a huge amount of tech innovation going on, too. The opportunity to transform is fantastic,” Palmer says, touching on decarbonisation, the cloud, artificial intelligence, and big data. “Ships can be less manpower intensive with more monitoring and all kinds of applications,” he says, while cautioning: “I do have a concern. There is clearly a huge opportunity, lots of drivers to do this, but will shipping have the gumption, the ambition to do this? Shipping has historically not been the earliest adopter, so I would say the jury is still out.” The absence of really muscular standardisation and regulation will be a brake on progress Palmer insists today’s more forward-thinking players are seeing the business case for tech-enabled ships, others in this fragmented business less so. “I see a lot more doing, but there’s still a lot of talking,” Palmer says. Palmer became president of Inmarsat Maritime in late 2021, moving across from defence contractor Northrop Grumman. Maritime featured in his career earlier on with BAE Systems, which was his first posting in the private sector, having started his career with the UK’s Ministry of Defence. Palmer sees shipping’s appetite for innovation as weakened by fragmentation – whether by geography, scale, or flag – as well as its relatively under-regulated nature. “The absence of really muscular standardisation and regulation will be a brake on progress,” he says. The other issue that needs addressing, if shipping is to make genuine tech strides in the coming decade, surrounds recruitment. “The industry has an interesting challenge – attracting people to it, young people, tech-savvy people at sea and on shore,” Palmer says. Different skillsets will be required by shipping’s next generation. The next generation wants to believe in what they are doing, to work for a sustainable business, and to use tech, Palmer says. “Shipping has to get better at telling its story. The fierce war for talent is visceral,” Palmer concludes."

        "content": "Marine geoscience and offshore construction support player Next Geosolutions (NextGeo) has contracted Norwegian shipyard Green Yard Kleven to convert itsNG ExplorerMPSV into a survey vessel. NextGeo bought the 2010-built MPSV, then namedSea Admiral, from Norway’s Beitveit Holding in December last year for €6.75m ($7.7m). At the time, NextGeo said it would invest an additional €3m to €5m in refitting works. The 58-m-long vessel has recently been used in aquaculture but will now be rebuilt for operations in the offshore energy sector, specifically for geophysical, geotechnical, environmental, and UXO seabed investigations. The ship will be equipped with a new accommodation module to increase onboard personnel capacity, as well as meeting rooms, a control room, and offices. It will also be fitted with a launch and recovery system for ROVs. Also, the entire ship will be upgraded to be able to operate in high-temperature waters. All equipment and materials removed from the vessel will either be reused in this conversion, repurposed for other projects at the yard, or sold. Green Yard Kleven has previously been involved in converting this vessel for another owner, and will now extend the vessel’s lifespan once again. The yard will deliver a complete turn-key project to NextGeo, including design and engineering, with its internal technical department supported by Nelton Design. The yard will also deliver equipment, new and second-hand, as well as coordinate the re-classing process. The vessel is scheduled for delivery by the end of 2025. With the addition of theNG Explorer, NextGeo’s owned fleet increased to four. The company also has access to the parent company Marnavi’s offshore fleet of nearly 15 vessels."

The goal is to allow crewmembers to rate and review living conditions onboard vessels, helping to improve overall standards and transparency across the industry. The creator of the site, speaking on condition of anonymity, toldSplash: “My hope is that this website will highlight the positive contributions of seafarers while also shedding light on areas where companies can make meaningful changes—ultimately improving standards and serving as a valuable tool for both maritime professionals and organisations.” Many seafarers work as subcontractors, frequently transitioning between vessels. When accepting a new job, the only information available on popular websites typically consists of exterior images of the vessel. There is little insight into onboard facilities such as gyms, food quality, communications, or cabin conditions. Seafarers are invited to rate ships on this new site, looking at categories including accommodation, downtime facilities, food and drink, wifi, and cleanliness. An update today will take the number of vessels covered on the site to 37,400. While it has launched with an offshore focus, there are plans to cover other types of commercial vessels. The 19-year-old, French-flaggedRS Alegranzacable layer currently ranks as the worst-rated vessel in the database,with one British seafarer leaving this review: “Should not be in service, very loud in rooms from generators. Get a stick to push ur s**t down the toilet. Was told the vessel was on its way to be scrapped and someone bought it to use on a job and it’s still out there now. Food is crap.”"

Connected ships are all the rage these days, discussed at length at myriad shipping conferences and at boardrooms across the world. Improved bandwidth is changing the business of shipping and how vessels and crews operate far out at sea, all happening at astonishing speed and yetSplashreaders do not believe this advance will spread across all ships in the years ahead. Just 10% of readers in our survey believe so-called office onboard will be achieved for 100% of the global merchant fleet by full free broadband internet by 2035. It’s unlikely that full internet broadband will be free for all onboard by 2035 or later, says Tore Morten Olsen, president of maritime at Marlink, a digital solutions provider. “As we have seen in other areas of life and business, users pay one way or the other and remote communication at sea requires more than the average deployment of hardware and software,” Olsen explains, predicting greater competition as new low Earth orbit (LEO) providers offer services and a tiered market in terms of solutions provided at multiple price points. By 2035, full broadband will be a baseline expectation It’s unlikely to be free for all anytime soon, concurs Andrew Airey, who heads up Thai shipmanager Highland Maritime, thanks to the sheer growth in data collection, analysis, action, and CCTV monitoring and interaction requirements outstripping capacity growth. More optimistic is Stamatis Tsantanis, chairman and CEO of Greek owner Seanergy Maritime. “Thanks to falling satellite costs and rising demand for crew welfare and operational connectivity, a large portion – say 75% – of the fleet will likely have free, full broadband access—though full coverage across all vessels may take longer,” Tsantanis tells Splash. Peter Schellenberger, founder of Novomaxis, a shipping consultancy, sees a minimum of 95% having free full broadband in 10 years, citing the 2027 launch of Amazon’s Kuiper service as a “game changer”. “By 2035, full broadband will be a baseline expectation, especially for vessels over 20,000 dwt,” argues Manish Singh, the head of Aboutships, a maritime advisory. The bigger shift for Singh will be how this connectivity enables truly integrated fleet operations — where ship and shore are in constant sync, making decisions together in real time. “The cost/benefit of equipping ships with terrestrial levels of connectivity is so attractive that laggards will find it difficult to compete with connected fleets,” Singh maintains. Turning to the office onboard part of the question posed to readers, Ajay Chaudhry, CEO of shipmanagement at Synergy Marine Group, says this will mean cultural and working practice shifts as it will involve more digital workflow, cross-functional meetings, and real-time owner access. “Connectivity must be paired with capability—the ability to conduct critical operations, access documents, and interact with experts without bandwidth barriers,” says Chaudhry, adding: “By 2035, this will be a standard expectation, rather than an innovation.” Pradeep Chawla, the founder of MarinePALS, a training specialist, concludes by tellingSplashhow he is very much against the whole office onboard thinking. “Seafarers have reached their limits with the number of tasks that they have to do. Yes, we need to give broadband onboard, but not for pushing more tasks to the ship’s staff,” Chawla says. To access the whole of Ship Concept 2035 for free online,click here."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "The global shipbuilding industry is currently experiencing a significant downturn in newbuilding orders, primarily due to regulatory uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. This decline is particularly evident in the dry bulk sector, where new orders have plummeted to what UK consultants Drewry has described as historic lows. In a new report, Drewry cited weak freight rates, high newbuilding prices, extended lead times, and overall market uncertainty for the slump in orders, with owners keen to see how Donald Trump’s tariff war plays out before committing to newbuilds as well as the plans by the US Trade Representative surrounding China-linked tonnage and higher American port fees. 2024 ordering levels represented the strongest year since 2008 Ambiguity surrounding future environmental regulations and the adoption of alternative fuels is also causing shipowners to hesitate in placing new orders. Newbuild ordering as a whole in the first five months of 2025 is down by around 50% year-on-year, according to data from Clarksons Research, albeit from 2024 levels that represented the strongest ordering year since 2008, and with shipyards generally retaining very strong forward orderbook coverage. Clarksons data (see below) show that with the exception of car carriers, dry bulk, shipping’s largest segment, has seen the biggest retreat in new orders this year. Overall newbuild prices have eased recently, with Clarksons tracking prices down 1% since the start of the year. Danish Ship Finance has also forecast that newbuilding prices will decline in the near term, with the number of shipyards securing new orders likely to fall as the appetite for new vessels wanes along with what it sees as softening freight rates. “We expect that current worldwide uncertainties will prevail, with a renewed pressure on freight markets delaying investment decisions. The new wave of shipbuilding expansion will have a downward impact on newbuilding prices, which should weaken during 2025 by more than 10% depending on type and size of ships, despite the resistance that will remain given the considerable orderbooks,” broker BRS predicted in its annual review published towards the end of March."

Two of the 115,000 dwt vessels will be built at HD Hyundai’s Agila Subic Shipyard in the Philippines, with delivery slated for the first quarter of 2028. The third will be built at HD Hyundai Vietnam Shipbuilding’s yard in Ninh Phuoc, scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2028. Data from industry sources tracking Nissen’s activities shows that the company has inked five newbuilding contracts with HD Hyundai shipyards so far in 2025. In addition to the three LR2s, the owner of more than 200 ships has ordered two midsize LPG carriers fromHD Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, priced close to $81m each. These 45,000 cu m vessels are expected to be delivered in the second half of 2027. The cost of the most recent LR2 orders aligns with current market conditions, with the unit being built in Vietnam priced at $73.5m, while the two Philippine-built tankers were contracted at $72.5m apiece. The news comes at a time when new tanker contracting has slowed significantly. According to Clarksons Research, only 75 tankers totaling 8.8m dwt have been contracted globally in 2025 to date — a 67% decline year-on-year in dwt terms and 35% below the 10-year average."

        "content": "For car carriers and LNG tankers, the US Trade Representative (USTR) on Friday rowed back on plans to penalise Chinese-linked tonnage. In April, the USTR detailed plans to start charging China-linked tonnage calling at US ports from the middle of October this year, in a bid to both curb China’s dominance in the field of shipbuilding as well as boost domestic shipyard capabilities. The measures have attracted plenty of criticism with the USTR now deciding it will charge Chinese-linked car carriers not on a car equivalent unit basis, but on net tonnage, suggesting that this is easier to apply. For LNG carriers, the office of the USTR has listened to the concerns raised byAmerican energy producers. Under earlier guidelines from the USTR, LNG shippers would have been required to move 1% of US LNG exports on US-built, operated and flagged vessels within four years or risk losing their LNG export licences. The US LNG industry has made clear its concerns this rule could block exports or disrupt the energy business, with the USTR deciding to remove the threat of removing export licences. Only three of the 800 LNG carriers in the fleet today are US-built, all dating back to the 1970s."

Justice4Mariners, a law firm that represents survivors of maritime injury and abuse, is counsel for the survivor — now a graduate of the academy — as well as a second victim, a licensed Merchant Marine officer. “This is a watershed moment for the maritime industry,” said attorney Ryan Melogy, founder of Justice4Mariners, graduate of the USMMA, and former merchant marine officer. “We have not seen the DOJ bring criminal charges for a sexual assault at sea aboard a US-flag cargo vessel in more than a generation. This is a huge, historic turning point for maritime safety.” “My client endured a horrific betrayal while serving her country at sea — and still found the strength to graduate and earn her licence,” Melogy said. “She and the second survivor I represent have both showed extraordinary courage, patience, and determination in making these historic criminal charges possible.” The charges stem from events first reported in October of 2022, whenCNNrevealed that Merrone allegedly drugged two cadets aboard the US-flag cargo shipLiberty Gloryand raped one of them. Merrone had previously been convicted of false imprisonment and battery in Florida, yet continued working in the commercial fleet for years, and the USMMA continued to send cadets to serve aboard his ships. “This case is about more than one captain — it’s about a broken system consisting of US government agencies, maritime labor unions, and commercial shipping companies that have worked cooperatively for decades to protect known sexual predators and silence their victims,” Melogy added. “That system is finally failing.”"

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will seek this week to get as many as 10,000 commercial ships signed up to help with its scientific mission to get a better understanding of the planet’s seas and oceans. “Understanding the ocean requires continuous observation,” the UN body stated. UNESCO has been equipping ships with scientific measuring instruments that transmit real-time data to its Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). More than 2,000 vessels are already equipped, with a new target to involve 10,000 commercial vessels by 2035. Ships will be equipped with meteorological and oceanographic instruments that transmit real-time data, helping to better assess the effects of climate disruption, anticipate extreme weather events, and improve maritime safety. The secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez, is also in Nice this week, calling on the international community to demonstrate the “power of multilateralism” by renewing global commitments and actions to protect the ocean. “We all have a responsibility to safeguard our precious marine environment and resources, on which we all depend. Governments, industries, civil society: this is our ocean, our obligation – and our opportunity,” Dominguez said. The UN Ocean Conference is being hosted jointly by France and Costa Rica with more than 50 heads of state attending. “We have a duty to mobilise because the science is clear and the facts are there,” declared Emanuel Macron, the French president, on Sunday, during a visit to Monaco, at the closing of a forum on the blue economy and finance. “There is the possibility of sustainable fishing. There is the possibility of sustainable maritime transport. There is the possibility of sustainable tourism,” Macron insisted."

        "content": "With the global maritime industry grappling with a tightening talent pool, ageing officer demographics, and rising demands for digital and adaptive skills, Anglo-Eastern, the world’s largest shipmanager, has unveiled Mission 30, a landmark initiative aimed at empowering young talent within its seafaring ranks. The program sets an ambitious target: to increase the percentage of management-level officers under 30 years old from 1% today to 30% by 2030. According to the 2021 Seafarer Workforce Report by BIMCO and the International Chamber of Shipping, the average age of management-level officers has steadily increased, with under-30s now forming a shrinking minority at sea. “We’ve observed a shift in our workforce at sea – while most of our chief officers and second engineers were once under 30, today only about 1% of our management-level officers fall into this age group,” said Vinay Singh, group managing director of marine HR at Anglo-Eastern. “This trend poses a potential challenge as we gear up for the future—one that demands adaptability, digital fluency, and agility for innovations such as dual-fuel systems, AI integration, and smart ship technologies.” To reverse this trend and fast-track talent development, Mission 30 introduces a suite of support measures tailored to young officers and cadets including personalised career ladder maps, and targeted training and assessment. “Our goal is to create structured, transparent pathways to leadership at sea,” said Singh. “We invite all young seafarers to seize this opportunity—to grow faster, lead sooner, and become the next generation of maritime professionals. With the right support and ambition, we can help them reach new heights in their sea career before 30. We look forward to helping them get there.”"

        "content": "Can improved connectivity onboard lead to more seafarers extending their time onboard before pursuing a career ashore? The second installment of Connectivity with Inmarsat, a special report contained within Ship Concept 2035, our new magazine. Shipping faces a shortage of qualified staff at sea, a problem that risks becoming more acute over the next 10 years. One way to help fix the problem is to ensure people stay longer in their jobs at sea with many experts saying for this to happen connectivity must improve. The availability of internet access is now a critical factor in seafarers’ career decisions, something that will only become more important in the years ahead. “Improved connectivity is an essential expectation for people coming out to sea,” says Pradeep Chawla, the CEO of training specialist MarinePALS. “You cannot explain to an 18-year-old who is used to connectivity of one gbps to accept a VSAT connection of two or four mbps.” Improved connectivity is an essential expectation for people coming out to sea “New entrants may not even join the industry if the comms plans are not conducive,” warns Peter Schellenberger, who runs Novamaxis, a consultancy. By 2028, Schellenberger predicts that 90% of quality vessels will have a LEO type comms plan. “By staying connected with family and accessing digital resources, seafarers can enjoy a better quality of life, which can positively impact their well-being and job satisfaction. This, in turn, may lead to longer tenures at sea,” says Stamatis Tsantanis, chairman and CEO of Greek owner Seanergy Maritime. Improved internet access can significantly reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation amongst seafarers. The ability to stay connected with family and friends via video calls, messaging, and social media can help seafarers remain a part of family milestones and important life events in real-time, and maintain a connection with the outside world, which can reduce the emotional distance between shore and sea, alleviate feeling of being alone during long ocean voyages, boost morale, and create a more positive and motivated work environment. By enhancing work efficiency and providing access to a wealth of online options in their free time, a more rewarding work-life balance can be achieved. From communicating with family and friends, managing personal matters, and following the latest news to watching sports, movies, and listening to music, a reliable internet connection opens up a world of opportunities to seafarers, allowing them to relax and enjoy their free time as they wish, which is essential for their overall wellbeing. “The work-life balance can make a career at sea more sustainable,” says Niraj Nanda, chief commercial officer of shipmanagement giant Anglo-Eastern. “Connectivity helps facilitate meaningful social interaction with friends and family ashore and supports recreational engagement like browsing and streaming—both of which ease the psychological burden of long voyages,” says Ajay Chaudhry, CEO of shipmanagement at Synergy Marine Group. “By prioritising safety, improved connectivity onboard can positively impact seafarers to extend their careers at sea,” Nanda says. “Better connectivity can help improve operational efficiency and the well-being of seafarers onboard, thereby contributing to a more fulfilling and secure work environment,” he says. “Improved connectivity allows seafarers to access news, digital banking and services, entertainment, and educational resources. Staying informed and entertained can make their time onboard more fulfilling,” says Shah Irani, chief technology officer at Fleet Management. Moreover, as Nanda points out, access to online medical and mental healthcare services, therapy, and video consultations by trained professionals can help reduce the distance between specialists and the seafarers who may require their services. This can positively impact the physical and psychological well-being of seafarers by improving medical care onboard, thus reducing the need for port visits, medical sign-offs, and diversions, and the relevant costs. We have to stop waving connectivity as a magic wand With access to online courses and studies, seafarers can further their knowledge, training, and qualifications during their free time onboard. This enables seafarers to enhance their skills and advance in their careers in the industry, which can be a strong motivator for extending their time at sea. Manish Singh, a former seafarer and shipmanager who now runs advisory Aboutships, cautions readers that connectivity by itself is not a panacea to the seafarer shortage issue. “We have to stop waving connectivity as a magic wand,” he says, predicting that even “laggard” fleets will have fast, reliable and cheap internet soon. “Longer term crew retention has more to do with a sense of inclusion, purpose and through-career visibility,” Singh argues. Better connectivity helps with wellbeing and continuity, he concedes, but retention also needs recognition, upskilling, and agency for colleagues onboard. “I envisage seafarers will feel more connected into the overall workflow as we embrace a connected and data-driven ecosystem,” Singh concludes.

The goal is to allow crewmembers to rate and review living conditions onboard vessels, helping to improve overall standards and transparency across the industry. The creator of the site, speaking on condition of anonymity, toldSplash: “My hope is that this website will highlight the positive contributions of seafarers while also shedding light on areas where companies can make meaningful changes—ultimately improving standards and serving as a valuable tool for both maritime professionals and organisations.” Many seafarers work as subcontractors, frequently transitioning between vessels. When accepting a new job, the only information available on popular websites typically consists of exterior images of the vessel. There is little insight into onboard facilities such as gyms, food quality, communications, or cabin conditions. Seafarers are invited to rate ships on this new site, looking at categories including accommodation, downtime facilities, food and drink, wifi, and cleanliness. An update today will take the number of vessels covered on the site to 37,400. While it has launched with an offshore focus, there are plans to cover other types of commercial vessels. The 19-year-old, French-flaggedRS Alegranzacable layer currently ranks as the worst-rated vessel in the database,with one British seafarer leaving this review: “Should not be in service, very loud in rooms from generators. Get a stick to push ur s**t down the toilet. Was told the vessel was on its way to be scrapped and someone bought it to use on a job and it’s still out there now. Food is crap.”"

        "content": "Maersk has shown the way for other shipping sectors to radically shift ship design with the decision it took earlier this decade to shift accommodation blocks forward for a series of methanol-fuelled boxships. Other sectors are now looking at similar shifts. Two new projects focus on relocating the crew living quarters and navigation bridge from their conventional aft position to the bow of the vessel. In a joint development project between Lloyd’s Register (LR), HD Hyundai Mipo Dockyard (HMD), and PanOcean, a new ultramax bulk carrier design has been introduced, featuring a forward accommodation block. This layout, traditionally used only in niche vessel types, is being reimagined to address a new challenge: spatial limitations for integrating decarbonisation technologies. Similarly, a second initiative—an approval in principle agreement between LR, HMD, and the Liberian International Ship & Corporate Registry (LISCR)—revealed plans for a 50,000 dwt MR tanker with forward accommodation. The novel configuration is designed to enhance visibility for wind-assisted propulsion (WAPS) while providing space for technologies such as ammonia dual-fuel systems and carbon capture units. Discussing the new tanker design, Sung-Gu Park, LR’s president of Northeast Asia, commented: “This project demonstrates the urgent need for commercially viable and regulation-ready vessel designs that accommodate decarbonisation technologies without compromising operational efficiency. It represents our shared commitment to enabling the maritime industry’s transition to net-zero through intelligent design, practical innovation, and collaboration.” Historically, forward accommodation blocks have been restricted to specialised vessels—such as heavylift ships, ice-class vessels, Great Lakes bulkers, and river barges—where visibility, cargo access, or regional constraints justified the layout. Now, the push for low- and zero-carbon operations is driving shipbuilders and owners to re-evaluate legacy designs. The aft-located superstructure, once ideal for balancing cargo and machinery, has in the view of some naval architects become a bottleneck for modern emission-reduction technologies, many of which require significant real estate and specialised positioning onboard."

However, since the rig has already committed to move to Cameroon for other operators, this has enabled more favourable terms. The company claimed that the terms compare “very favourably to offers received from other rig owners” earlier this year and last year. “Our rig selection process has been made a little more complex by the opportunity to coordinate our timing with that of other nearby oil and gas companies, including Addax Petroleum in particular, however, I believe it has resulted in a very good commercial outcome for all parties,” said Jeremy Asher, Tower Resources chairman and CEO."

        "content": "Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, a joint venture between Shell New Energies and EDF Renewables, has filed a request to cancel its wind project off the coast of Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the request, filed with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, the developer listed the Trump administration’s opposition to wind energy and the escalated cost for developing offshore wind projects. Atlantic Shores was supposed to develop two distinct phases. The first was a 1,510MW project with around $1.9bn in economic benefits to New Jersey. Combined with the second project, the 197 offshore wind turbines would have produced enough clean energy to power more than 1m New Jersey homes and would have a capacity of 2.8GW. The project development already hit a major bump in the road when one half of the joint venture, Shell, decided to withdraw from the project in February and take a $996m impairment associated with Atlantic Shores. EDF Renewables booked a $980m impairment for the project soon after. This would not be the only obstacle, as the Trump administration withdrew an air quality permit for the project in March. Last week, Atlantic Shores petitioned the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to withdraw its earlier offshore renewable energy certificates order, which allowed the project to start development. “Due to the uncertainty caused by the Presidential Wind Memorandum, the subsequent loss of the Air Permit, and other actions taken by the current administration more generally, [Atlantic Shore’s] parent company has been forced to materially reduce its personnel, terminate contracts, and cancel planned project investments,” the petition said."

Backed by Xiangyu’s extensive expertise in international commodity trading and Shunda’s mining operations in Guinea, Shunyu aims to control the full logistics chain from ore extraction in Africa to steel and energy markets in China. The aim is to shift project cargo and industrial equipment westbound from China to Africa, and then move iron ore and other commodities from Guinea back to China. The company recently completed its maiden voyage, delivering 21,000 cu m of Chinese equipment to Guinea. Rather than rely solely on chartered capacity, Shunyu plans to gradually build its own fleet, taking cues from Xiangyu’s existing shipping platform, which currently operates six vessels, including both bulk carriers and deck cargo ships."

The program sets an ambitious target: to increase the percentage of management-level officers under 30 years old from 1% today to 30% by 2030. According to the 2021 Seafarer Workforce Report by BIMCO and the International Chamber of Shipping, the average age of management-level officers has steadily increased, with under-30s now forming a shrinking minority at sea. “We’ve observed a shift in our workforce at sea – while most of our chief officers and second engineers were once under 30, today only about 1% of our management-level officers fall into this age group,” said Vinay Singh, group managing director of marine HR at Anglo-Eastern. “This trend poses a potential challenge as we gear up for the future—one that demands adaptability, digital fluency, and agility for innovations such as dual-fuel systems, AI integration, and smart ship technologies.” To reverse this trend and fast-track talent development, Mission 30 introduces a suite of support measures tailored to young officers and cadets including personalised career ladder maps, and targeted training and assessment. “Our goal is to create structured, transparent pathways to leadership at sea,” said Singh. “We invite all young seafarers to seize this opportunity—to grow faster, lead sooner, and become the next generation of maritime professionals. With the right support and ambition, we can help them reach new heights in their sea career before 30. We look forward to helping them get there.”"

        "content": "After years of market instability, tight supply conditions, and volatile prices, the global natural gas market is entering a new phase—characterised by a significant wave of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply growth, backed up by an extensive orderbook of gas carriers on order in China and South Korea. To support transparency during this shift, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has launched a new tool: the Global LNG Capacity Tracker. The online resource, now publicly available, provides real-time, detailed data on LNG liquefaction capacity expansions worldwide. With approximately 670bn cu m per year of global LNG liquefaction capacity currently in place, the market is poised for unprecedented expansion. According to the IEA’s new tracker, nearly 290bn cu m per year of new LNG export capacity is expected to come online between 2025 and 2030—all from projects that have already secured final investment decisions (FIDs) and are now under construction. This represents the largest wave of LNG capacity additions ever recorded, with the potential to reshape global energy flows and price dynamics over the next decade. The trajectory of this buildout remains fluid. Factors such as construction delays, additional project approvals, progress on dormant but approved developments, and shifting market conditions could all impact the pace and volume of capacity that ultimately comes online. To address this, the tracker will be updated regularly, reflecting new developments as they unfold. To match supply growth, record numbers of gas carrier newbuild contracts have been signed in the 2020s. Latest data from Clarksons Research shows there are 337 LNG carriers on order – equivalent to 56.1m cu m in capacity – representing 44.6% of the extant fleet, the highest extant/newbuild ratio of any commercial shipping sector."

In a joint development project between Lloyd’s Register (LR), HD Hyundai Mipo Dockyard (HMD), and PanOcean, a new ultramax bulk carrier design has been introduced, featuring a forward accommodation block.

It represents our shared commitment to enabling the maritime industry’s transition to net-zero through intelligent design, practical innovation, and collaboration.” Historically, forward accommodation blocks have been restricted to specialised vessels—such as heavylift ships, ice-class vessels, Great Lakes bulkers, and river barges—where visibility, cargo access, or regional constraints justified the layout. Now, the push for low- and zero-carbon operations is driving shipbuilders and owners to re-evaluate legacy designs. The aft-located superstructure, once ideal for balancing cargo and machinery, has in the view of some naval architects become a bottleneck for modern emission-reduction technologies, many of which require significant real estate and specialised positioning onboard."

One tender is for the acquisition and processing of geophysical data in ultra-shallow waters off São João da Barra. The acquisition, processing, and interpretation services will use electrical tomography, bathymetry, and topography to a depth of around 10 m, across an area of 1.5 sq km. The second involves the acquisition of geotechnical data in shallow and ultra-shallow water and beach environments. A DNV study for the World Bank Group, conducted in 2024, claimed that Brazil’s offshore wind energy potential exceeds 1.2TW, with 480GW from fixed foundations and 748GW from floating foundations. The study claimed that the offshore wind sector could support Brazil’s green hydrogen targets and could drive economic growth and job creation, potentially generating up to 516,000 full-time equivalent jobs and contributing $168bn in national gross value added. This was followed by Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva authorising the development of offshore wind farms in the country in January this year. According to the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, there were 103 offshore wind farm projects in Brazil awaiting licensing approval as of December 2024."

In May, as part of the wide-ranging 17th package of sanctions 189 ships, mostly aged tankers, were blacklisted. If endorsed by member states, it would become the EU’s 18th sanctions package since February 2022 The European Commission is also proposing a significant reduction in the Group of Seven (G7) price cap on Russian seaborne oil—from $60 per barrel to $45—in an effort to slash Russian energy revenues. Von der Leyen confirmed the price cap adjustment will be discussed at next week’s G7 summit in Canada. “My assumption is that we do that together as the G7. We started that as G7, it was successful as a measure from the G7, and I want to continue this measure as G7,” she said. Lowering the price cap, if implemented, could have a mixed impact for the compliant tanker fleet, as trading of Russian Urals below the $60 cap has encouraged compliant trading of these barrels in recent months, according to Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB). “A reduced cap would likely lessen the compliant fleet’s participation in this market. However, should tighter sanctions on Russia lead to reduced overall exports, necessitating replacement of ‘compliant’ barrels from alternative origins, we see this as a net positive for the compliant fleet,” analysts at SEB said. The new sanctions package also targets 22 Russian banks and extends financial restrictions to entities outside Russia that help circumvent existing sanctions. Additionally, the plan includes a ban on the direct or indirect use of the Nord Stream pipelines that connect Russia to Germany. The move follows similar efforts by the United Kingdom, which last month sanctioned more than 120 tankers involved in covert oil shipments and signaled talks with allies to tighten enforcement of the $60 oil price cap. Globally, over 700 tankers have now been blacklisted as part of efforts to limit Russia’s oil revenues."

Container manufacturing in China is at higher levels than 2024’s record figures. According to Linerlytica, an Asia-based consultancy, new container inventories in China climbed to a record high of 1.55m teu as of late May. “Concerns over container shortages proved to be unfounded despite the delays in returning empty containers from Europe and North America given the ready availability of new boxes with both carriers and lessors taking advantage of the recent drop in new equipment prices to order more boxes,” Linerlytica noted in its most recent weekly report. Already more than 2.3m new containers have been produced this year, with Linerlytica forecasting that the massive production spurt will ensure there’s no repeat of the Chinese box inventory crisis of 2021 when inventories dropped to just 0.1m teu."

        "content": "Mediterranean Shipping Co, the world’s largest containerline, is reportedly keen in buying one of Europe’s largest shipyards. Romanian media reports suggest the Gianluigi Aponte-founded company has contacted the Romanian government expressing an interest in taking over the Mangalia shipyard, previously controlled by Damen, and Daewoo Shipbuilding prior to that. MSC is keen to use the site for constructing cruise ships, ropax vessels, and tugboats. MSC has yet to reply to questions sent by Splash earlier today. The Mangalia yard, once jointly operated by the Dutch Damen Group and the Romanian state, slipped into insolvency in 2024 after Damen withdrew from the joint venture. In recent weeks, however, activity has resumed at the site. Two vessels are currently under repair, and an additional one is expected shortly. Approximately 800 workers are back on-site. MSC is not the only player eyeing Mangalia’s strategic facilities. Turkish shipbuilder Desan has also entered into negotiations with Romanian authorities to rent production capacity and labour from the yard. Despite the revitalised activity, the shipyard’s financials remain dire. According to Romanian business outlet Profit.ro, total creditor claims amount to around $400m. The yard which boasts three drydocks can trace its origins back to 1976. In 1997, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) took it over for a period of 20 years at which point Damen came in."

        "content": "Poland has announced that its first offshore wind auction will be held on December 17, 2025. Developers will compete for contracts supporting the construction of projects with a total capacity of 4GW. The auction will determine which offshore wind projects will be awarded 25-year contracts for difference (CfD). These contracts will give producers the right to cover negative balances for electricity, stabilising revenue, and reducing market risk. The developers who offer the lowest price for electricity from future farms will be declared the winners. The offered price cannot be higher than the maximum price announced by the country’s Minister of Climate and Environment. Depending on the location, the maximum price will range from PLN 485.71 ($130) to PLN 512.32 ($137.3) per MWh. Winning bidders will be given seven years from the auction to start producing electricity. The financing of the support system for offshore wind farms will be carried out from the renewable energy fees collected by the electricity transmission system operator. For the auction to be valid, at least three valid bids must be submitted. Equinor and Polenergia have already submitted their pre-qualification application for the 1,560MW Bałtyk 1 offshore wind farm project to participate in the auction. If the auction cannot be held in 2025 due to a lack of interest or an insufficient number of eligible developers, it will be pushed back to 2026."

        "content": "Will improved connectivity onboard improve competence in shipping? The latest installment of Connectivity with Inmarsat, a special report contained within Ship Concept 2035, our new magazine. Improved onboard connectivity significantly enhances competence in shipping, according to many people surveyed for this magazine. Enhanced connectivity facilitates real-time communication between onboard crews and shore-based teams. Through video conferencing and collaborative platforms, seafarers can receive immediate guidance, partake in virtual training sessions, and engage in knowledge sharing, thereby improving operational efficiency and decision-making. Andrew Airey, who heads up Thai shipmanager Highland Maritime, argues that if connectivity brings true assistance to shipboard personnel in more efficiently handling their duties and reducing their workload and stress levels then it can clearly improve the industry. “Enhanced bandwidth enables real-time training, remote mentoring, and smoother digital operations. Competence increases as crews can access updated safety protocols, predictive maintenance alerts, and decision support tools,” says Shah Irani, chief technology officer of Fleet Management. Tore Morten Olsen, president of maritime at Marlink, questions whether accessing training remotely between work and sleep is the right environment. “Training that builds competence – whether in person, remote or virtual – needs to be delivered in the right environment to encourage learning and teamwork,” Olsen says. Pradeep Chawla, the founder of MarinePALS, a training specialist, has statistics that back up how online training directly leads to better safety and better performance in vetting and port state control inspections. Ajay Chaudhry, the CEO of shipmanagement at Synergy Marine Group, maintains that real-time access to simulators, troubleshooting support and feedback on performance all transform learning into what he describes as a “continuous loop”. However, the tech must be complemented by human systems, Chaudhry argues. We’ve seen best results when connectivity enables, not replaces, professional development “Leadership, feedback culture, and accountability. We’ve seen best results when connectivity enables, not replaces, professional development,” Chaudhry says. “With the right infrastructure, even vessels that are far out to sea become floating learning environments that empower crew to solve problems in real time.” Connectivity is only the toolbox or enabler, argues Peter Schellenberger, the head of Novomaxis, a consultancy. “It is now up to the industry to find correct use cases and applications to maximise efficiency,” he says, stressing the importance of training for both shore and seagoing staff. “Applications are live faster than regulations so it is up to the companies to work with their learning providers to cover the ground,” Schellenberger says. Quite so, agrees Nicholas Goubert, co-CEO of online learning giant Ocean Technologies Group. Improved connectivity onboard promises massive gains in the speed of deployment whereby as soon as a solution is ready it can be consumed by seafarers wherever they are located, Goubert says. “This makes the process of building competency much more agile especially when regulations are moving fast and people want to respond to dynamic threats,” Goubert says. Improved connectively also opens up the possibility of richer learning experiences such as cloud simulation, virtual reality, and gamification, he adds. In terms of operations, connectivity is crucial in facilitating technology deployment and digitalisation of the maritime industry. “Reliable connectivity allows for real-time monitoring and management of vessel operations, including navigation and maintenance. This leads to optimised fuel consumption, reduced downtime, and improved safety,” says Niraj Nanda, chief commercial officer of Anglo-Eastern. Reliable connectivity is also essential for driving innovation in the maritime industry. Anglo-Eastern, for instance, continues to explore innovative technologies, including drone deliveries, augmented reality, and AI, to further drive efficiency and sustainability. A notable example is the company’s remote maintenance support, which revolutionises equipment troubleshooting and enables swift issue resolution without requiring on-site specialists. Real-time performance feedback, shore-based support, and system diagnostics become possible with connected ships It’s not just competence, per se, that will improve, according to Manish Singh, the founder of British advisory Aboutships. Decision making will change massively, he says. “Real-time performance feedback, shore-based support, and system diagnostics become possible with connected ships,” Singh says, discussing the rise of embedded training, remote decision support, and automated compliance — all of which he believes will raise technical competence and reduce human error.

In aggregate, the 11 listed largest global carriers today – minus privately held MSC – have a combined market capitalisation of just over $165bn, up from around $60bn at the start of the decade, according to Alphaliner data. COSCO, Maersk, and Hapag-Lloyd each now have a similar value to well-known consumer brands such as Delta Airlines, Kraft Heinz and Kellogg’s John McCown, a veteran shipping analyst and head of Blue Alpha Capital, reported that the container sector achieved a net profit of $9.9bn in the first quarter of 2025, with HSBC forecasting sector-wide profitability at least for Q2 and Q3. In a recent report, McCown highlighted the industry’s remarkable profitability compared to the pre-pandemic era. Between 2016 and 2019, the sector incurred cumulative losses of $8.5bn on revenues of $681.2 billion, resulting in a negative profit margin of 1.3%. In contrast, from 2020 through 2024, the industry saw significant improvements, with net income margins of 8.1%, 36.8%, 42.7%, 9.6%, and 18.3%, respectively. Drewry’s Container Forecaster, meanwhile, expects the supply-demand balance to weaken again in the second half, which will cause spot rates to decline again in the second half of this year. “The volatility and timing of rate changes will depend on the outcome of legal challenges to Trump’s tariffs and on capacity changes related to the introduction of the US penalties on Chinese ships, which are uncertain,” Drewry maintained. Liner bosses will be watching closely for details out of London, where US and China trade officials reached some form of trade truce, which will still need to be approved by the leaders of both countries."

        "content": "JP Morgan’s shipowning affiliate, Bermuda-based Global Meridian Holdings, has cashed in on its early bet on eco-design tankers, selling off the same vessels that marked its entry into the segment six years ago—reaping healthy capital gains in the process. According to multiple shipbroking sources, Global Meridian is offloading two 49,999 dwt MR tankers—Clearocean Mary and Clearocean Maria—for approximately $30m each. These 2014-built ships, originally constructed at SPP Shipbuilding in South Korea, were purchased in 2019 for $27m apiece under their former names Alpine Mary and Alpine Maria. While the $3m per-vessel gain represents a modest capital appreciation, it does not account for the significant earnings the vessels likely generated from chartering activities over the past six years—a period marked by strong MR tanker demand and favorable rates. The deal also reinforces the premium commanded by first-generation eco tankers, which remain in demand despite being more than a decade old. In stark contrast, a recent sale of the non-eco 2011-built PS Capri (51,000 dwt, STX Offshore) fetched only $18.35m, underlining a growing divide in valuation tied to fuel efficiency. Eco MR tankers such as the Clearocean units are equipped with Tier II engines and advanced hull forms, giving them a fuel efficiency advantage of around 20% at comparable speeds over older tonnage. Retrofitting older ships to meet similar efficiency standards would require substantial investment—another factor driving buyer interest toward eco units. The sales appear to be part of a broader portfolio realignment at Global Meridian Holdings, which currently controls a fleet of 28 tankers, according to VesselsValue data. The firm, operating under J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s maritime investment platform, has made selective moves in the shipping market, capitalising on asset cycles while deploying capital in strategically timed entries and exits."

        "content": "Maersk has shown the way for other shipping sectors to radically shift ship design with the decision it took earlier this decade to shift accommodation blocks forward for a series of methanol-fuelled boxships. Other sectors are now looking at similar shifts. Two new projects focus on relocating the crew living quarters and navigation bridge from their conventional aft position to the bow of the vessel. In a joint development project between Lloyd’s Register (LR), HD Hyundai Mipo Dockyard (HMD), and PanOcean, a new ultramax bulk carrier design has been introduced, featuring a forward accommodation block. This layout, traditionally used only in niche vessel types, is being reimagined to address a new challenge: spatial limitations for integrating decarbonisation technologies. Similarly, a second initiative—an approval in principle agreement between LR, HMD, and the Liberian International Ship & Corporate Registry (LISCR)—revealed plans for a 50,000 dwt MR tanker with forward accommodation. The novel configuration is designed to enhance visibility for wind-assisted propulsion (WAPS) while providing space for technologies such as ammonia dual-fuel systems and carbon capture units. Discussing the new tanker design, Sung-Gu Park, LR’s president of Northeast Asia, commented: “This project demonstrates the urgent need for commercially viable and regulation-ready vessel designs that accommodate decarbonisation technologies without compromising operational efficiency. It represents our shared commitment to enabling the maritime industry’s transition to net-zero through intelligent design, practical innovation, and collaboration.” Historically, forward accommodation blocks have been restricted to specialised vessels—such as heavylift ships, ice-class vessels, Great Lakes bulkers, and river barges—where visibility, cargo access, or regional constraints justified the layout. Now, the push for low- and zero-carbon operations is driving shipbuilders and owners to re-evaluate legacy designs. The aft-located superstructure, once ideal for balancing cargo and machinery, has in the view of some naval architects become a bottleneck for modern emission-reduction technologies, many of which require significant real estate and specialised positioning onboard."

        "content": "A court in Taiwan has sentenced a Chinese national, identified only as Captain Wang, to three years in prison for intentionally damaging an undersea communication cable connecting Taiwan’s main island to the Penghu archipelago. This verdict marks the first conviction related to the severing of Taiwan’s critical undersea infrastructure. On February 25, 2025, the Togolese-flagged cargo vesselHong Tai 58, under Wang’s command, was observed anchored off Taiwan’s southwestern coast near the undersea cable route. Despite multiple warnings from Taiwan’s coast guard, the vessel remained in the area. Shortly after the ship departed, Chunghwa Telecom reported a disruption in the undersea cable. Investigations revealed that the cable had been severed, and theHong Tai 58was subsequently detained for further inquiry. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence indicating that the ship’s electronic charts clearly marked the location of undersea cables, suggesting that Wang was aware of the potential risks. Additionally, the vessel’s movements were inconsistent with standard anchoring procedures, with patterns indicating deliberate actions that led to the cable’s damage. Wang initially denied any wrongdoing but later conceded that he “might have broken the cable.” This incident is part of a series of undersea cable disruptions around Taiwan. In response, Taiwanese authorities have intensified monitoring of vessels, particularly those linked to Chinese interests and operating under flags of convenience. TheHong Tai 58itself has been under scrutiny for its suspicious activities. Reports indicate that the vessel had changed its name multiple times, using interchangeable steel plates (pictured) to display different identities, includingHongtai 68andShanmei 7. The incident also mirrors similar concerns in other regions, such as the Baltic Sea, where undersea cables have been targeted, prompting calls for enhanced maritime security protocols."

Once complete, Davie expects to finalise the acquisition in the coming months. James Davies, president and CEO of Davie, said: “We share a vision with Gulf Copper to make Texas a world-class hub for American icebreaker and complex ship production. Texas is ready to lead a new golden age of American shipbuilding—backed by our commitment to delivering ships on time, on budget, and in service of national security priorities.” “A successful deal will open a new chapter for Gulf Copper,” said CEO Steve Hale. “For the first time in decades, complex shipbuilding could return to Galveston and Port Arthur—this time backed by one of the world’s fastest-growing specialised shipbuilders. Davie brings a bold vision: to make Texas the cornerstone of their US expansion. That means opportunity for our employees, our partners, and our communities.” The planned acquisition would fulfill the commitment Davie made in July 2024 to explore a permanent presence in the US. Davie already has operations in Québec, and Helsinki—the latter has built around 50% of the world’s icebreaker fleet. Once the transaction is complete and contracts are secured, Davie plans to invest $1bn to upgrade and expand capacity in Galveston and Port Arthur."

        "content": "Two recent ship casualties are making daily headlines in India, and stirring debate about cracking down on ageing vessels passing through the nation’s waters. Nearly three weeks after the 28-year-oldMSC Elsa 3capsized off the coast of Kerala, the state’s coastal police have officially registered a criminal case against Mediterranean Shipping Co, the vessel’s owner, as well as the ship’s master, and its crew. The move follows mounting public pressure and criticism of the government’s perceived inaction in the aftermath of the high-profile maritime incident, which has seen pollution wash up on a long strip of Indian coastline. The 1997-built containership was en route from Vizhinjam Port to Kochi when it sank on May 25, approximately 25 km southwest of Alappuzha. The vessel was carrying over 600 containers, including hazardous cargo and tonnes of marine diesel fuel. Several containers washed ashore along Kerala’s coastline, while plastic pellets, known as nurdles, were scattered across the shores of Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram. Additionally, small oil slicks were reported along the Alappuzha coast. The case brought against MSC and the ship’s crew cites rash navigation and negligent conduct. Meanwhile, another accident in Kerala is also garnering many headlines. Indian authorities have successfully attached a towline to the burning 20-year-oldWan Hai 503 containership,which caught fire off the Kerala coast on Monday and looks like a constructive total loss. The fire, which erupted between Beypore and Azhikkal ports, has continued to rage across sections of the ship despite intense firefighting from the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and a specialist team from the Marine Emergency Response Centre. The ship remains afloat, enveloped in thick plumes of smoke, as authorities now weigh next steps amid mounting environmental and safety concerns. An initial plan to tow the 4,333 teu ship to New Mangalore Port has been shelved due to the persistent threat of a large explosion. The fire has crept dangerously close to fuel storage tanks holding 2,000 tonnes of fuel oil and 240 tonnes of diesel. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services has warned that fallen containers from the ship may drift toward the Kerala coast—specifically between Kozhikode and Thrissur—as well as parts of southern Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka in the coming days. The ship remains adrift, shifting its position and complicating drift forecasts. While there has been no structural failure reported on the vessel aside from a 15° list to port, the presence of 143 containers with highly dangerous cargo remains a pressing concern. Of the 22 crewmembers on theWan Hai 503, 18 have been rescued and four remain missing—two from Taiwan, one from Indonesia, and one from Myanmar. Search and rescue operations are ongoing by air and sea. Among the five injured, one Chinese national has been discharged, while two others remain in intensive care in Mangaluru."

        "content": "Can improved connectivity onboard lead to more seafarers extending their time onboard before pursuing a career ashore? The second installment of Connectivity with Inmarsat, a special report contained within Ship Concept 2035, our new magazine. Shipping faces a shortage of qualified staff at sea, a problem that risks becoming more acute over the next 10 years. One way to help fix the problem is to ensure people stay longer in their jobs at sea with many experts saying for this to happen connectivity must improve. The availability of internet access is now a critical factor in seafarers’ career decisions, something that will only become more important in the years ahead. “Improved connectivity is an essential expectation for people coming out to sea,” says Pradeep Chawla, the CEO of training specialist MarinePALS. “You cannot explain to an 18-year-old who is used to connectivity of one gbps to accept a VSAT connection of two or four mbps.” Improved connectivity is an essential expectation for people coming out to sea “New entrants may not even join the industry if the comms plans are not conducive,” warns Peter Schellenberger, who runs Novamaxis, a consultancy. By 2028, Schellenberger predicts that 90% of quality vessels will have a LEO type comms plan. “By staying connected with family and accessing digital resources, seafarers can enjoy a better quality of life, which can positively impact their well-being and job satisfaction. This, in turn, may lead to longer tenures at sea,” says Stamatis Tsantanis, chairman and CEO of Greek owner Seanergy Maritime. Improved internet access can significantly reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation amongst seafarers. The ability to stay connected with family and friends via video calls, messaging, and social media can help seafarers remain a part of family milestones and important life events in real-time, and maintain a connection with the outside world, which can reduce the emotional distance between shore and sea, alleviate feeling of being alone during long ocean voyages, boost morale, and create a more positive and motivated work environment. By enhancing work efficiency and providing access to a wealth of online options in their free time, a more rewarding work-life balance can be achieved. From communicating with family and friends, managing personal matters, and following the latest news to watching sports, movies, and listening to music, a reliable internet connection opens up a world of opportunities to seafarers, allowing them to relax and enjoy their free time as they wish, which is essential for their overall wellbeing. “The work-life balance can make a career at sea more sustainable,” says Niraj Nanda, chief commercial officer of shipmanagement giant Anglo-Eastern. “Connectivity helps facilitate meaningful social interaction with friends and family ashore and supports recreational engagement like browsing and streaming—both of which ease the psychological burden of long voyages,” says Ajay Chaudhry, CEO of shipmanagement at Synergy Marine Group. “By prioritising safety, improved connectivity onboard can positively impact seafarers to extend their careers at sea,” Nanda says. “Better connectivity can help improve operational efficiency and the well-being of seafarers onboard, thereby contributing to a more fulfilling and secure work environment,” he says. “Improved connectivity allows seafarers to access news, digital banking and services, entertainment, and educational resources. Staying informed and entertained can make their time onboard more fulfilling,” says Shah Irani, chief technology officer at Fleet Management. Moreover, as Nanda points out, access to online medical and mental healthcare services, therapy, and video consultations by trained professionals can help reduce the distance between specialists and the seafarers who may require their services. This can positively impact the physical and psychological well-being of seafarers by improving medical care onboard, thus reducing the need for port visits, medical sign-offs, and diversions, and the relevant costs. We have to stop waving connectivity as a magic wand With access to online courses and studies, seafarers can further their knowledge, training, and qualifications during their free time onboard. This enables seafarers to enhance their skills and advance in their careers in the industry, which can be a strong motivator for extending their time at sea. Manish Singh, a former seafarer and shipmanager who now runs advisory Aboutships, cautions readers that connectivity by itself is not a panacea to the seafarer shortage issue. “We have to stop waving connectivity as a magic wand,” he says, predicting that even “laggard” fleets will have fast, reliable and cheap internet soon. “Longer term crew retention has more to do with a sense of inclusion, purpose and through-career visibility,” Singh argues. Better connectivity helps with wellbeing and continuity, he concedes, but retention also needs recognition, upskilling, and agency for colleagues onboard. “I envisage seafarers will feel more connected into the overall workflow as we embrace a connected and data-driven ecosystem,” Singh concludes.

This will be the first round to focus solely on fixed-bottom offshore wind technology. The DOE chose fixed-bottom offshore wind due to its established track record, cost-efficiency, and scalability. However, DOE undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara stated that the country was still “keeping the door open” for floating wind. “As global experience grows and the technology matures, the DOE will reassess its inclusion in future auction rounds. For now, our focus is to build momentum with fixed-bottom projects that can succeed under current technical, regulatory, and infrastructure conditions,” she said. The DOE invited stakeholders, developers, port operators, and transmission companies to review the round’s terms of reference and submit feedback by June 18. The country already has a clean energy generation target of 15.3GW by 2030, with 3 to 6GW expected to come from offshore wind sources."

Signatories to the charter were still 12.2% behind the minimum international climate goals set by the IMO in 2024, up from 9% the previous year. The 34 charterers and shipowners featured in the report represent around 18% of global wet and dry bulk cargo transported by sea in 2024. External conditions were cited in explaining the difficulties in getting sufficient climate alignment scores. “Operational barriers such as regional port limitations (e.g. draft restrictions), challenging weather patterns, inefficient routing, and reliance on short-term charters contributed to alignment shortfalls,” signatories to the charter said in a release today. The Sea Cargo Charter was launched five years ago to provide a global framework for assessing and disclosing the climate alignment of chartering activities. Its primary goal is to promote transparency and accountability in the shipping industry by aligning chartering activities with the climate targets set by the IMO, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. Notable members include ADM, Anglo American, Bunge, Cargill Ocean Transportation, Chevron, COFCO International, Dow, Equinor, Gunvor Group, Klaveness Combination Carriers, Louis Dreyfus Company, Maersk Tankers, Norden, Shell, TotalEnergies, and Trafigura. The Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) developed by the IMO is the intensity metric used by the Sea Cargo Charter, adapted to reflect the full lifecycle CO2e emissions. “Being at the crossroads of French, EU and IMO emissions regulations, Rubis values the use of EEOI as a single metric to assess our performance,” said Hervé Chretien, head of supply and shipping at Rubis Energie, a signatory since 2021. “Sustainability in shipping is now an operational imperative. Customers are looking for partners who can move cargo responsibly,” commented Cheng Fan, head of commercial at Golden-Agri Maritime, a signatory since 2022."

        "content": "Occasional columnistSantosh Patil on how rising disorder is reshaping our industry. The second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy which states that systems naturally progress from order to disorder is well-known. Today, few sectors reflect this principle more vividly than the global shipping industry. This rising disorder—or entropy—is reshaping the maritime world. There are several factors that influence this – geopolitics, regulatory changes and technological advancements. Geopolitical dynamics contribute to a state of entropy in the shipping industry. Political instability, conflicts, and diplomatic tensions create an environment of uncertainty and unpredictability through disruptions in shipping routes, delays, and increased security risks, impacting the overall efficiency of the shipping sector. Navigating complexity The recent geopolitical changes and conflicts, including Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Palestine and the subsequent Houthi fallout, have had significant implications for the shipping industry. The introduction and evolution of environmental regulations add a layer of complexity and uncertainty to the industry. As regulations change, shipping companies must adapt their operations to comply with new environmental standards. The dynamic nature of environmental regulations introduces entropy by requiring continuous adjustments in ship design, fuel choices, and operational practices to meet evolving environmental compliance requirements. Rapid technological advancements, such as the development of autonomous ships, digitalization, and green technologies, contribute to entropy in the shipping sector. These innovations bring both opportunities and challenges. The adoption of new technologies requires substantial investments and adjustments in operational procedures. The pace of technological change adds a level of uncertainty as shipping companies navigate the complexities of integrating these advancements into their fleets. The interplay between geopolitical dynamics, environmental regulations, and technological advancements intensifies the overall entropy in the shipping industry. Geopolitical tensions can influence the adoption of certain environmental regulations, and political decisions may impact regulations as well as the pace of technological innovation in the sector. Mitigating its impact in the shipping sector requires global collaboration and efforts to bring stability in geopolitical relations. Diplomatic resolutions to conflicts and the establishment of clear and consistent international regulations contribute to a more stable environment for shipping operations. This facilitates long-term planning and investment in innovative technologies, reducing uncertainty in the industry. Harnessing disorder Entropy is not always negative. In shipping, disorder has often catalysed profits and growth. We have seen this with pandemic induced disorder which helped shipping companies make more profits than all the FAANG companies put together. Similarly, the Russia Ukraine conflict, Suez Canal disruption and Middle East crisis led to increased ton-mile demand – a key measure in shipping that indicates the overall demand for maritime transport, with longer distances or higher cargo volumes increasing the ton-mile demand. These geopolitical and logistical challenges have reshaped global trade routes, compelling vessels to take longer, alternative journeys to ensure the continuity of supply chains. For instance, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has disrupted traditional energy supply, redirecting trade flows of crude oil, LNG, and agricultural commodities to distant markets. The Suez Canal blockage showcased the vulnerability of a critical chokepoint, forcing ships to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope, drastically extending travel distances. Likewise, tensions in the Middle East have impacted the security and stability of vital maritime corridors like the Strait of Hormuz, pushing shipping companies to adopt longer, safer routes. These developments underscore the increasing importance of adaptability in global shipping dynamics, further driving up ton-mileage across the industry. In conclusion, while entropy introduces disorder and uncertainty, it also drives adaptability and innovation within the shipping industry. The ability to navigate geopolitical shifts, regulatory complexities, and technological advancements showcases the resilience and indispensable nature of shipping. This resilience not only stabilises global trade but also demonstrates the intrinsic value of shipping as the backbone of international commerce, capable of weathering even the most turbulent of global challenges."

        "content": "NR Marine Services has commissioned UK-based ship designer Chartwell Marine to design a new CTV, which will be capable of supporting older generation assets, now referred to as legacy turbines. These vessels will still be constructed and outfitted with modern technologies to maximise vessel fuel efficiency and comfort. The so-called Defiant class vessel is a 20 m CTV with IMO Tier 3 compliance, featuring a step-free forward deck, mounted superstructure, and modern furnishings and materials used in larger CTVs. The Defiant class vessel will be able to service most legacy turbines but can also be tailored to different projects, from a water jet propulsion system for shallow water sites and hybrid options where budgets allow, to internal modularity to suit different racking and seating solutions. “Following an internal fleet review along with external market research, the data shows that there is a potential to replace older tonnage, which is between 10-15 years old, for near-shore projects, which have a lifespan that warrants investment in new CTVs,” said Richard Thurlow of NR Marine Services. “The Defiant hosts a modern, clean and spacious environment but on a smaller highly efficient platform that suits the smaller harbours, short transit sites and shallow water projects,” added Ben Colman of Diverse Marine."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Maersk has shown the way for other shipping sectors to radically shift ship design with the decision it took earlier this decade to shift accommodation blocks forward for a series of methanol-fuelled boxships. Other sectors are now looking at similar shifts. Two new projects focus on relocating the crew living quarters and navigation bridge from their conventional aft position to the bow of the vessel. In a joint development project between Lloyd’s Register (LR), HD Hyundai Mipo Dockyard (HMD), and PanOcean, a new ultramax bulk carrier design has been introduced, featuring a forward accommodation block. This layout, traditionally used only in niche vessel types, is being reimagined to address a new challenge: spatial limitations for integrating decarbonisation technologies. Similarly, a second initiative—an approval in principle agreement between LR, HMD, and the Liberian International Ship & Corporate Registry (LISCR)—revealed plans for a 50,000 dwt MR tanker with forward accommodation. The novel configuration is designed to enhance visibility for wind-assisted propulsion (WAPS) while providing space for technologies such as ammonia dual-fuel systems and carbon capture units. Discussing the new tanker design, Sung-Gu Park, LR’s president of Northeast Asia, commented: “This project demonstrates the urgent need for commercially viable and regulation-ready vessel designs that accommodate decarbonisation technologies without compromising operational efficiency. It represents our shared commitment to enabling the maritime industry’s transition to net-zero through intelligent design, practical innovation, and collaboration.” Historically, forward accommodation blocks have been restricted to specialised vessels—such as heavylift ships, ice-class vessels, Great Lakes bulkers, and river barges—where visibility, cargo access, or regional constraints justified the layout. Now, the push for low- and zero-carbon operations is driving shipbuilders and owners to re-evaluate legacy designs. The aft-located superstructure, once ideal for balancing cargo and machinery, has in the view of some naval architects become a bottleneck for modern emission-reduction technologies, many of which require significant real estate and specialised positioning onboard."

The annual Geneva Dry, which debuted in 2024, is fast becoming one of the most influential shipping conferences in the world, bringing together shipowners, charterers, traders, brokers, tech firms and analysts for high-level dialogue across the entire dry bulk value chain—from operational realities to macroeconomic drivers. This year’s edition saw 825 delegates from more than 40 countries attend the two-day event with organisers forced to issue a Sold Out sign in the weeks leading up to the April event. Commented John Xylas, the chairman of INTERCARGO, the international association for dry bulk, shipping’s largest sector: “Geneva Dry has quickly established itself as a must-attend event on the maritime calendar. As a speaker representing INTERCARGO, I found it to be a unique platform for honest, high-level discussion on the future of dry bulk shipping. Geneva Dry delivers sharp insight and meaningful dialogue, a standout event in the maritime year and Switzerland is the perfect host.” Geneva Dry has quickly established itself as a must-attend event on the maritime calendar Florence Schurch, secretary-general of SUISSENÉGOCE, Switzerland’s commodity trading association, said: “Geneva Dry reinforces Switzerland’s role as an essential hub for global dry bulk trade, fostering dialogue across the value chain.” The 2026 version – due to be held on April 28 and 29 – opens with two digital focused workshops, followed by a commodities outlook, then a session on risk management followed by a spotlight on chartering. Day Two opens with a digital efficiency drivers session, then moves onto decarbonisation, followed by familiar sessions on minor bulks, agri-commodities, coal and iron ore. “With a global audience gathered in the world’s most significant dry bulk centre, you simply cannot miss Geneva Dry,” said Tim Huxley, who heads up Hong Kong shipowner Mandarin Shipping, while William Fairclough, the managing director of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport Holdings, highlighted the “unparalleled” opportunity to connect with key industry figures. You simply cannot miss Geneva Dry “Valuable industry insights and networking opportunities and the high calibre of attendees make Geneva Dry an attractive destination,” Fairclough said. Both Fairclough and Huxley are confirmed speakers for next year’s summit as are Alex Albertini, the CEO of Marfin Management, Andrea Olivi, global head of shipping at Trafigura, John Michael Radziwill, chairman of CTM, Karim Coumine, head of commercial shipping for minor bulk at Anglo American, Mette Asmussen, lead maritime sector initiatives at the World Economic Forum, Milena Pappas, commercial director at Star Bulk, Olivia Lennox-King, the COO at Cetus Maritime, Peter Weernink, chairman of SwissMarine, and Rob Aarvold, global CEO of SeaTrek Bulk. Registration is now open with limited numbers of delegate passes available and organisers urging people thinking of attending to sign up early. Commented Grant Rowles, the event’s co-founder, “Staying ahead in dry bulk requires more than just reading the market—it requires engaging with it. Geneva Dry 2026 offers a uniquely informed, globally networked, and forward-looking space to do exactly that.” Find out more about the agenda for Geneva Dry 2026 atwww.genevadry.comand register aș a delegatehere."

        "content": "A rare and urgent joint advisory issued by United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, Maritime Security Centre – Horn of Africa, and Joint Maritime Information Centre has set alarm bells ringing for ship operators passing through the Middle East. The advisory warns of an increased threat level in the Arabian/Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and the Gulf of Oman, citing “increased tensions within the region which could lead to an escalation of military activity having a direct impact on mariners.” At the heart of the warning is the deepening crisis between the US and Iran, with a sixth round of diplomatic talks over Tehran’s nuclear program reportedly scheduled for this week. However, the tone between both governments has grown increasingly hostile. US president Donald Trump reaffirmed his stance that military action remains on the table if a satisfactory agreement on Iran’s nuclear ambitions is not reached. In response, Iranian minister of defence Aziz Nasirzadeh warned that any US military provocation would result in retaliatory strikes on US bases across the Middle East. Israel, maintaining a hardline position throughout the negotiations, has continued to threaten unilateral military action against Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. According to regional analysts, domestic pressure on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is mounting—raising the likelihood of a preemptive airstrike. There is growing concern that such action may occur with the cooperation or logistical support of the US, triggering regional escalation. The Houthis in Yemen – who have been waging a campaign, backed by Iran, against merchant shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden for the past 18 months – warned yesterday that any military attack from the US or Israel on Iran will plunge the region into war. “We are . . . at the highest level of preparedness for any possible American escalation against us,” a Houthi source toldNewsweekon Wednesday. “Any escalation against the Islamic Republic of Iran is also dangerous and will drag the entire region into the abyss of war. . . . It is certainly not in the interest of the American people to become involved in a new war in service of [Israel].” Significant movements on the diplomatic and defence fronts add further urgency to the joint advisory. The US Embassy in Iraq is reportedly preparing for a planned evacuation due to rising security threats, while the US State Department has ordered the withdrawal of nonessential personnel and their families from diplomatic posts in Bahrain and Kuwait, and US military dependents in Bahrain have been cleared for temporary departure, indicating the seriousness of the perceived threat."

        "content": "How much of daily manual operations at sea will be made redundant by 2035? The latest from Ship Concept 2035, our new magazine. How has your job changed over the past 10 years? Is the workload similar? That’s the kind of thoughts we asked Splash readers to contemplate in our survey with one of the key questions posed asking how much of daily manual operations at sea will be made redundant by 2035. For all the hype about tech’s ability to streamline every facet of work, most respondents felt that the vast majority of manual operations would still be performed by seafarers 10 years from now. “We see technology as an enabler that will remove a lot of the mundane repetitive tasks allowing maritime professionals at sea and ashore to focus on the parts of the operation where they can add more value,” says Nick Copley, co-CEO of Ocean Technologies Group, a training specialist. Advancements in automation will change the way work is performed, and possibly where those jobs are performed, according to Copley, but seafaring knowledge and skills will still be needed to ensure safe, reliable and responsible shipping for many years to come. “Enhanced connectivity facilitates training, remote support, and real-time data exchange, contributing to better decision-making and operational competence,” says Masaki Matsunaga, executive vice president at ClassNK, who, like Copley, sees seafarers continuing to carry out the majority of manual operations. Routine monitoring, reporting, and maintenance diagnostics will be automated or shifted ashore by 2035, predicts Ajay Chaudhry, who heads up shipmanagement at Synergy Marine Group. “We anticipate up to 40% automation of current manual tasks over the next decade, but also a commensurate rise in new skill demands for those going out to sea,” Chaudhry tells Splash. However, tasks requiring immediate judgment, evaluation, or coordination, and any form of emergency response, will always need people onboard, he stresses. As an example, Chaudhry sites how the first law of the sea is to help those in peril, saying it is hard to see how an autonomous vessel could undertake even the most basic of the search and rescue operations that seafarers perform every day. That said, Chaudhry does admit machinery reliability also needs to evolve. “Systems such as ballast water treatment and exhaust scrubbers continue to demand significant manual intervention across the fleet—highlighting that automation must be paired with robust design and ongoing technical support,” he points out. Manish Singh, who leads Aboutships, a UK maritime advisory, sees up to half of repetitive tasks disappearing from seafarer daily routines come 2035. “Some maintenance activities will shift from done while at sea to done while in port and involve in-port crew,” he says. Retained roles will focus on watchkeeping, critical safety and compliance, mooring, cargo care, repairs and maintenance, Singh reckons while a lot of the onboard workflow will be digitally assisted in areas such as reporting, routing, and documentation. “With better connectivity and extensive sensors onboard, decision support systems, and AI tools, much of the manual monitoring and form-filling will go,” Singh predicts.

        "content": "Israel launched wide-scale strikes against Iran this morning, targeting nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders, stating that the operation will continue “as long as necessary”. Immediately thereafter, Iran vowed “severe punishment for Israel” and has sent more than 100 drones to attack Israel. The UKMTO advised that there is presently no evidence of commercial shipping being targeted by Iran. However, the British security office also warned of the potential for a rapid escalation in tensions, adding that there is a risk of the Houthis from Yemen – Iran’s allies – broadening their targeting in the region. Global oil prices have surged today as markets begin to factor in the risk of key waterways coming under threat. Vanguard, a maritime security consultancy, stated that although there is no increased maritime threat towards commercial shipping, tensions in the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman remain at heightened alert due to increased military activity, air defence operations, and possible GNSS interference. Jefferies’ data shows overall the Middle East market represents 40% of total crude oil trade, 33% for LPG, 23% for LNG, 12% for refined products, 5% for containers, and 3% for dry bulk. SEB, a Swedish bank, said today’s fighting was positive short-term for tankers, with long-term impacts likely more negative with demand disruptions from higher oil prices likely to have a negative longer-term impact. Similarly, for LNG and LPG, SEB said short-term there would be a positive impact on rates, noting risk to volumes and demand in the case of disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz. Lars Jensen, who has been covering the Red Sea shipping crisis from day one over the past 18 months, noted via LinkedIn the risks of a partial closure of the Strait of Hormuz, could see oil prices increasing further, and leading to global container lines avoiding the region, in turn, choosing to tranship boxes outside of the Middle East, heightening the risk of wider Asian ports congestion. “Iran is not adverse to interfering with commercial shipping, as for example seen in their seizure of 14,000 teuMSC Arieslast year. The vessel is still held by Iran,” Jensen added."

        "content": "As the IMO finalises global mandates for maritime decarbonisation, Alexander Tancock, CEO of InterContinental Energy (ICE), discusses how the timing for green e-fuels couldn’t be better – and how it is now up to the shipping industry to commit. If we can’t deliver ammonia near $650 per tonne, in large volumes, we don’t have a market. But if we can, and I believe we can, shipping has a viable, scalable path to net zero. ICE has spent the past decade building a pipeline of giga-scale green hydrogen and ammonia projects designed with one mission: deliver up to 46m tonnes per annum of cost-competitive green e-fuels by 2050. With the International Maritime Organization (IMO) set to enforce binding emissions reductions from 2028, and with alternative fuel propulsion systems finally approaching readiness, the question for shipping is no longer when to act, but whether the fuel will be there in time. The answer is it can be…but the shipping industry needs to commit to offtake soon because of the long lead times needed for the best projects to proceed. ICE’s Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH) in Western Australia is a good example of the sort of project that shipping will rely on for low-cost and high-volume green e-fuels. Already in development for five years, it spans an area over half the size of Denmark, will have a production capacity of up to 28m tonnes per annum of green ammonia, and is targeting first phase production in the early 2030s at a price of sub-$650 a tonne. That timeline is no accident: When we look at engine readiness and the IMO mandates – the early 2030s are when we see significant demand emerging and we are syncing our delivery to that curve. And it seems the shipping sector is paying attention. Two years ago, InterContinental Energy wasn’t on the shipping community radar. Now, I was just invited to deliver the opening keynote speech at Nor-Shipping’s Maritime Hydrogen Conference. The change is real. That change is being driven by the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, which includes a global fuel standard and tiered GHG pricing and penalties. With well-to-wake accounting on the horizon, scalable green ammonia mega projects, with zero point-of-use emissions, become an increasingly attractive long term supply choice. But the shipping sector faces a moment of truth: Supply and demand must evolve together. Without credible, bankable demand signals, even the most advanced projects won’t make it to final investment decision (FID), and therefore supply will not materialize in time. A scalable system for a global challenge At the heart of ICE’s delivery strategy is our P2(H₂)Node architecture: a patented modular ‘Lego block’ architecture that combines renewable generation, electrolysis, and ammonia synthesis at the point of resource. By eliminating long-distance power transmission and centralising infrastructure around scalable modules, we are cutting capex by as much as 20% – leading to a direct reduction in green e-fuel prices. Our nodes aren’t just a technical configuration; they’re a strategy to reduce project risk and increase customer confidence. Each node functions as a self-contained production unit. With a gigawatt-scale layout optimised for solar and wind co-location, our approach not only reduces cost, but also makes green certification simple, since only renewable energy is used for inputs. Green ammonia production at this scale requires not just good solar and wind conditions, but integrated logistics, port infrastructure, and a development strategy that spans decades. We are building in Australia and Oman because the conditions, both natural and political, are aligned for this success. Building the first node for a project is the hardest part. It needs support, it needs government help. But once it’s built, every node after that is cheaper, faster, and easier – and that’s how we can scale product and continually reduce cost to customers. WGEH isn’t in fact one mega project, it is 35 repeatable Lego blocks that will be built in series, one after the other, delivering increasing annual output for more than two decades. For shipping, this isn’t just theoretical anymore, and if demand warrants, we are ready to double the construction rate. We already have the engineering and land access; it’s purely a function of demand. The role of the Australian government has been vital. Programmes like Hydrogen Headstart, the Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive, and dedicated export frameworks offer a level of certainty few countries can match. We have always chosen partners carefully. Not just financial or technical, but geopolitical. Governments that understand what’s at stake – and Australia gets it. The shipping community’s move to make Some shipowners are already taking steps by entering MOUs, conducting bunkering trials, and retrofitting vessels to be ammonia-ready. But the broader industry has yet to deliver the bold procurement commitments that would catalyse low cost production at scale. The reward for those who act early could be significant. Under the IMO’s Net-Zero Fund model, early adopters will likely benefit from credit trading mechanisms and preferential financing. Regulatory momentum is aligned with strategic advantage. Green ammonia is no longer a theoretical future fuel. It is a ready-now solution that can scale with demand and meet compliance head-on…provided customers commitment. We’ve built the model. The infrastructure is planned. The economics work. What’s needed now is offtake. If the demand signal comes, we’ll deliver. But this time, the signal has to come from shipping."

        "content": "A court in Taiwan has sentenced a Chinese national, identified only as Captain Wang, to three years in prison for intentionally damaging an undersea communication cable connecting Taiwan’s main island to the Penghu archipelago. This verdict marks the first conviction related to the severing of Taiwan’s critical undersea infrastructure. On February 25, 2025, the Togolese-flagged cargo vesselHong Tai 58, under Wang’s command, was observed anchored off Taiwan’s southwestern coast near the undersea cable route. Despite multiple warnings from Taiwan’s coast guard, the vessel remained in the area. Shortly after the ship departed, Chunghwa Telecom reported a disruption in the undersea cable. Investigations revealed that the cable had been severed, and theHong Tai 58was subsequently detained for further inquiry. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence indicating that the ship’s electronic charts clearly marked the location of undersea cables, suggesting that Wang was aware of the potential risks. Additionally, the vessel’s movements were inconsistent with standard anchoring procedures, with patterns indicating deliberate actions that led to the cable’s damage. Wang initially denied any wrongdoing but later conceded that he “might have broken the cable.” This incident is part of a series of undersea cable disruptions around Taiwan. In response, Taiwanese authorities have intensified monitoring of vessels, particularly those linked to Chinese interests and operating under flags of convenience. TheHong Tai 58itself has been under scrutiny for its suspicious activities. Reports indicate that the vessel had changed its name multiple times, using interchangeable steel plates (pictured) to display different identities, includingHongtai 68andShanmei 7. The incident also mirrors similar concerns in other regions, such as the Baltic Sea, where undersea cables have been targeted, prompting calls for enhanced maritime security protocols."

An in-depth Inmarsat survey of nearly 400 seafarers working on merchant ships, offshore support vessels or high-end fishing vessels across the globe shows that seafarers are increasingly experiencing a sense of a ‘floating home’ when it comes to their time onboard, a portent of what’s to come over the next decade. Seafarers spend an average 8% of their annual salary on internet connectivity, the survey found, with the cost split equally between their usage at home and onboard their vessels. When at sea, video calling, voice calling, and messaging family and friends were the most popular uses for the internet, with a huge majority saying the connections positively impacted their mental wellbeing. Seafarers spend an average 8% of their annual salary on internet connectivity During long voyages, seafarers said they were 23 times more likely to feel positive effects from these personal interactions, rather than negatives. Staying in touch with friends and family were the main reasons given for needing connectivity, although seafarers also cited managing work-related tasks as important, as ships increasingly depend on real-time data for both compliance and competitive advantage. Around two thirds of respondents put personal video or voice calls and text messaging in their top three uses for connectivity. Less critical, but still pronounced, were top three preferences for social media (51%), web browsing (34%) and watching movies, TV shows, sports or other streamed content (29%). A small proportion identified shopping (11%) and gaming (8%) as top three online activities. However, while 97% of these seafarers actively manage their own data usage at sea, more than four out of five said they exceeded their limit – with more than a third saying it happened often. Furthermore, a mixed picture emerged regarding satisfaction with connectivity at sea. Of those surveyed, 28% said they were dissatisfied with the cost, while more than half said they would be willing to pay more for better connections. Overall, internet usage among seafarers increases while they are in port, with 61% reporting higher usage and only 15% using it less. On average, seafarers use the internet 18% more while in port compared to when they are at sea. Although those who use their mobile phone plans often find it cheaper than vessel connectivity, the majority of the survey respondents (52%) indicated a preference for ship connectivity over their mobile plans or port wifi. In a remarkable finding, 83% of the surveyed seafarers expressed concern about security and privacy while using a vessel’s internet – with one in nine of the seafarers reporting a data security issue, such as hacking or data loss, while connected to a vessel’s internet. Clearly, for this seafaring constituency, work remains to be done on security before a ship can truly merit the comfort of a floating home."

        "content": "Kerala’s coast is witnessing an alarming spate of maritime mishaps, with a third ship-related incident reported within a span of weeks, prompting legal action, firefighting operations, and mounting concerns over environmental and economic fallout. On Thursday, the Kerala High Court ordered the conditional arrest ofMSC Manasa F, currently anchored at Vizhinjam Port, following a damages claim filed by Mangalath Cashews. The Kollam-based exporter alleges that its cargo, lost aboard the sunkenMSC Elsa 3off the Alappuzha coast last month, was under the operational control of Mediterranean Shipping Company, which also manages the MSC Manasa F. A judge issued the arrest order after the petitioner, citing the imminent departure of theMSC Manasa Fand MSC’s lack of physical assets in India, claimed $180,000 in damages. The order will be rescinded only if the claimed amount is deposited in court or adequate security is furnished. While the legal drama played out in a courtroom, another fire incident at sea was unfolding. On Thursday, a container onboard the Singapore-flaggedInterasia Tenacityignited while the ship was transiting off the Kerala coast en route from Port Klang, Malaysia, to Nhava Sheva, Maharashtra. The vessel, carrying 1,387 containers and manned by 21 Filipino crewmembers, issued a distress call that prompted the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) into action. The ship’s captain later reported the fire under control and declined further aid. Authorities confirmed no injuries, but the ICG continues to monitor the vessel’s condition, citing the recent pattern of accidents as cause for continued vigilance. Meanwhile, a major emergency operation is still underway aboard the Singapore-flaggedWan Hai 503(pictured), which caught fire on June 9 while located approximately 42 nautical miles off Beypore in the Arabian Sea. The vessel’s fuel and hazardous cargo have posed a grave ecological risk, with dense smoke still emanating from its cargo hold days after the fire began. On Thursday, an Indian Air Force helicopter dropped 2,600 kg of fire-retardant chemical powder on the deck (see video below), successfully reducing visible flames. However, internal fires continue to smoulder. The ICG has begun towing the ship into deeper waters to mitigate coastal risks, while the salvage firm T&T Salvage prepares to assume full control once conditions stabilise. Search efforts remain ongoing for four missing crewmembers, while another tug has been dispatched to replace theOcean Warrior, which returned to port due to a technical fault. Additionally, oil removal from the sunkenMSC Elsa 3wreck—plugging bunker leaks and initiating hot tapping—is also underway, aiming to eliminate further pollution risks within three days."

The first agreement involves the establishment of a joint venture focused on enhancing drydocking and shipbuilding infrastructure within the Gulf Cooperation Council, while also exploring growth opportunities in other international markets. The duo has also signed a letter of intent with India’s marine services, ports, logistics, and technology group JM Baxi on creating green ship recycling facilities. AD Ports said JM BAXI is a strong advocate for sustainable practices in this area and supports the adoption of the Hong Kong Convention. Last year, ASRY became part of a memorandum of understanding with Danish shipping and logistics group Maersk, SULB Company, and APM Terminals Bahrain to evaluate and establish a ship recycling initiative in Bahrain. The deal envisioned the kingdom’s transport and telecommunications ministry and the ministry of industry and commerce providing regulatory support to ASRY for equipping the yard and docks for the ship recycling process. The third agreement between AD Ports Group and ASRY involves the formation of a joint working group to identify and pursue investment opportunities in ports and terminals, aiming to bolster the region’s maritime infrastructure through a shared strategic framework. These latest developments build on the earlier formation of ASRY Marine, a joint venture between ASRY and Noatum Maritime, to deliver integrated marine services in Bahrain. “Following the successful formation of our recent joint venture with ASRY, we look forward to deepening our collaboration across the maritime realm. We have already developed strong working ties, and this agreement opens the door to create more value and growth across our operations. Exploring opportunities to establish green ship recycling facilities is also very important for us, ensuring that vessels are retired in a safe and environmentally responsible manner,” said Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, managing director and group CEO, AD Ports Group."

        "content": "A University of New South Wales academic’s research using ocean currents to optimise shipping routes is making waves in Australia. To find more efficient routes for cargo ships, associate professor Shane Keating, a researcher in oceanography and applied mathematics at UNSW Sydney, has developed an algorithm using ocean models and AI. “With better ocean forecasts, ships can use the power of currents as they travel, reducing fuel use and cutting emissions,” Keating said. His innovation will deliver ocean forecasts to the shipping industry under UNSW Sydney spinout company, CounterCurrent. The company is built on 15 years of research studying ocean currents with a focus on forecasting, satellite remote sensing and data science. “The algorithm is like a Google Maps for the sea, giving the most efficient route in real time based on the behaviour of ocean eddies,” Keating claimed. Keating is an expert in a type of ocean current called eddies, swirling circular currents that are the oceanic equivalent of atmospheric storms. Eddies are found in every ocean basin and make up 90% of the kinetic energy of the ocean, but they aren’t well represented in existing ocean current forecasts. By better incorporating ocean eddies in forecasts, Keating has argued that commercial ships can harness these currents to find more efficient routes across the ocean. Most ships travel the shortest distance between two points on the Earth’s surface. It’s known as a great circle route. But that route, although it’s the shortest distance, is not the most fuel efficient route because ocean currents are constantly moving the ship off that perfect geometrical line. The ship has to use its engines and therefore burn more fuel to stay on the line. By going with ocean currents, ships will travel slightly longer distances over the surface of the Earth, but they’ll travel more efficiently because they’re moving with ocean currents rather than against them. One of the reasons this is possible is due to improved satellite technology, which now provides images that allow eddies to be tracked. Keating began to look at how satellites could be used to measure the ocean from space after completing his doctoral degree in astrophysics at the University of California San Diego. “In the past few decades, satellite technology has completely revolutionised the way we look at the ocean,” he said. “Before the satellite era, our picture of the ocean was of a giant bathtub of seawater with just a few large ocean currents – like the Gulf Stream and the East Australian Current. “Thanks to satellites, we now know that the ocean is highly turbulent and chaotic, like our atmosphere, and is filled with thousands of ocean eddies that can range in diameter from ten to 300 kilometres and depths of up to 2,000 metres.” Although eddies rotate slowly, with current speeds of up to two metres per second, the fact that seawater is 800 times denser than air means that each of these eddies has more momentum than a tropical cyclone. The view of ocean currents got a major upgrade in December 2022 with the launch of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite. SWOT is a joint US-French satellite mission capable of mapping ocean currents with ten times the resolution of existing satellite technology. Keating is a member of the international science team for the SWOT satellite and leads the Australian SWOT working group (AUSWOT), a consortium of researchers and stakeholders working to support the SWOT mission in the Asia-Pacific region. Data collected from commercial vessels also plays an important part in helping improve the understanding of ocean currents and how they might be changing in a warming world. Having tested his technology on more than a hundred vessels, Keating has been able to demonstrate consistent fuel savings which he claimed are up to 20%. He is now engaging with several shipping companies and shipbuilders to commercialise the technology and make it accessible to the wider industry quickly. “It’s a win-win for shipping companies,” said Keating. “They can save money and meet their emissions reductions targets right now, without any modification to the vessel or change in the vessel transit time. “My hope is that, within the next five years, this research will change the way that ships cross the ocean so that shipping companies can meet their emissions targets.”"

        "content": "As the IMO finalises global mandates for maritime decarbonisation, Alexander Tancock, CEO of InterContinental Energy (ICE), discusses how the timing for green e-fuels couldn’t be better – and how it is now up to the shipping industry to commit. If we can’t deliver ammonia near $650 per tonne, in large volumes, we don’t have a market. But if we can, and I believe we can, shipping has a viable, scalable path to net zero. ICE has spent the past decade building a pipeline of giga-scale green hydrogen and ammonia projects designed with one mission: deliver up to 46m tonnes per annum of cost-competitive green e-fuels by 2050. With the International Maritime Organization (IMO) set to enforce binding emissions reductions from 2028, and with alternative fuel propulsion systems finally approaching readiness, the question for shipping is no longer when to act, but whether the fuel will be there in time. The answer is it can be…but the shipping industry needs to commit to offtake soon because of the long lead times needed for the best projects to proceed. ICE’s Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH) in Western Australia is a good example of the sort of project that shipping will rely on for low-cost and high-volume green e-fuels. Already in development for five years, it spans an area over half the size of Denmark, will have a production capacity of up to 28m tonnes per annum of green ammonia, and is targeting first phase production in the early 2030s at a price of sub-$650 a tonne. That timeline is no accident: When we look at engine readiness and the IMO mandates – the early 2030s are when we see significant demand emerging and we are syncing our delivery to that curve. And it seems the shipping sector is paying attention. Two years ago, InterContinental Energy wasn’t on the shipping community radar. Now, I was just invited to deliver the opening keynote speech at Nor-Shipping’s Maritime Hydrogen Conference. The change is real. That change is being driven by the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, which includes a global fuel standard and tiered GHG pricing and penalties. With well-to-wake accounting on the horizon, scalable green ammonia mega projects, with zero point-of-use emissions, become an increasingly attractive long term supply choice. But the shipping sector faces a moment of truth: Supply and demand must evolve together. Without credible, bankable demand signals, even the most advanced projects won’t make it to final investment decision (FID), and therefore supply will not materialize in time. A scalable system for a global challenge At the heart of ICE’s delivery strategy is our P2(H₂)Node architecture: a patented modular ‘Lego block’ architecture that combines renewable generation, electrolysis, and ammonia synthesis at the point of resource. By eliminating long-distance power transmission and centralising infrastructure around scalable modules, we are cutting capex by as much as 20% – leading to a direct reduction in green e-fuel prices. Our nodes aren’t just a technical configuration; they’re a strategy to reduce project risk and increase customer confidence. Each node functions as a self-contained production unit. With a gigawatt-scale layout optimised for solar and wind co-location, our approach not only reduces cost, but also makes green certification simple, since only renewable energy is used for inputs. Green ammonia production at this scale requires not just good solar and wind conditions, but integrated logistics, port infrastructure, and a development strategy that spans decades. We are building in Australia and Oman because the conditions, both natural and political, are aligned for this success. Building the first node for a project is the hardest part. It needs support, it needs government help. But once it’s built, every node after that is cheaper, faster, and easier – and that’s how we can scale product and continually reduce cost to customers. WGEH isn’t in fact one mega project, it is 35 repeatable Lego blocks that will be built in series, one after the other, delivering increasing annual output for more than two decades. For shipping, this isn’t just theoretical anymore, and if demand warrants, we are ready to double the construction rate. We already have the engineering and land access; it’s purely a function of demand. The role of the Australian government has been vital. Programmes like Hydrogen Headstart, the Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive, and dedicated export frameworks offer a level of certainty few countries can match. We have always chosen partners carefully. Not just financial or technical, but geopolitical. Governments that understand what’s at stake – and Australia gets it. The shipping community’s move to make Some shipowners are already taking steps by entering MOUs, conducting bunkering trials, and retrofitting vessels to be ammonia-ready. But the broader industry has yet to deliver the bold procurement commitments that would catalyse low cost production at scale. The reward for those who act early could be significant. Under the IMO’s Net-Zero Fund model, early adopters will likely benefit from credit trading mechanisms and preferential financing. Regulatory momentum is aligned with strategic advantage. Green ammonia is no longer a theoretical future fuel. It is a ready-now solution that can scale with demand and meet compliance head-on…provided customers commitment. We’ve built the model. The infrastructure is planned. The economics work. What’s needed now is offtake. If the demand signal comes, we’ll deliver. But this time, the signal has to come from shipping."

The 4,000 dwt newbuilds, slated for delivery in 2027, will feature hydrogen fuel cells and battery propulsion systems. The Ørsta-based company currently operates two 1983- and 1984-built bulk carriers on the Møre coast, transporting sand, stone, asphalt mix, and other specialised cargo on fixed contracts. One of the newbuilds, both of which have been designed by Naval Dynamics, will, following delivery, go on a contract with compatriot Nordasfalt. The price for both newbuilds has not been divulged. The overall project is backed by Enova with around NOK85m ($8.5m) and the NOx Fund, as well as financial assistance from NRP and technical assistance from the Green Shipping Program. “We have developed this project over several years, received good support and found a concept for the new ships that we have great faith in. Existing bulk carriers are outdated, and we therefore had to think completely new. After a careful assessment of technology maturity, cost-effectiveness and secure access to fuel, the choice fell on hydrogen ships with hydrogen fuel cells,” said Torstein Holsvik, technical director at Møre Sjø."

        "content": "Australian energy major Santos has received a non-binding takeover proposal from a consortium led by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). The takeover offer by a consortium of ADNOC subsidiary XRG, Abu Dhabi Development Holding Company, and Carlyle received early endorsement from the Santos board. The proposal is for the acquisition of all the ordinary shares on issue in Santos for a cash offer price of A$8.89 ($5.76) per share. The price is a 28% premium to the last closing price of A$6.96. The proposal follows two confidential proposals from the consortium to acquire 100% of Santos Shares on March 21 for $5.04 per share and on March 28 for $5.42 per share. At $5.76 a share, the latest offer values Santos at $18.7bn, based on an exchange rate of 0.6480 A$ for $1 on June 13. With debt included, the total value of the company stands at $23.7bn. If the transaction goes through, it will be the largest all-cash takeover in ASX history, according to FactSet data. The proposal is subject to the satisfactory completion of confirmatory due diligence by the consortium and the negotiation and execution of an agreed scheme implementation agreement with Santos on customary terms and conditions. If the companies reach an agreement over a scheme implementation agreement, the board will unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the offer, unless a superior proposal is made. Right after the news was made public, the South Australian government threatened to intervene if the takeover was “not in the interests of South Australians”. Energy and Mining Minister Tom Koutsantonis said that he would fight to keep Santos’ headquarters in Adelaide, which was of “strategic and vital importance to the state”."

        "author": "Splash",
        "content": "Consolidated data, curated by suppliers who understand the market is most likely to drive value, writes Staci Satterwhite, CEO of ABS Wavesight. Shipping is often encouraged to take lessons from other industries. Just as they have benefited from digital transformation, shipping has a unique opportunity to leverage data to drive operational efficiency, enhance safety and increase commercial opportunity. The process of digitalisation has taken root in shipping, but it suffers from a familiar challenge of fragmentation and perceptions of low value. Some of the stumbling blocks are technical, but many stem from the need for software creators to think less like a developer and more like a shipowner. Here are five simple ideas to achieve digitalisation that buyers can leverage and sellers can work towards, based on quantifiable results. 1. Profitable operations are the primary objective For shipowners and operators, the primary need in achieving digital transformation is to access complex and sometimes disparate information and ideas within a single pane of glass to improve operations. The aim is to harness all the available data to create insights that create value and help management run a better business, not just to deploy software because they feel they have to. Shipping is a value creation business. The software it adopts must drive revenue growth and reduce expenses. Most often it is the consolidation of data that drives value creation. In fact, uniting data sources is key to enabling the shipping industry to embrace the next technology wave machine learning, AI and predictive analytics. 2. Know where the market is – and where it’s going. The early stages of digital transformation are often marked by disruption, and there are plenty of examples of apparently simple changes from paper to digital that have faced resistance. Digitalising medical records seems an obvious way to share data between users in different locations but suspicion of change meant it wasn’t always welcomed at first. Once there was a robust use case, that resistance fell away. Swap patient scans for data on vessel status, condition of equipment and expected weather, and superintendents and crew start to see what it can do for them in their day-to-day work. Add in the potential of AI, predictive data analytics and risk-based intelligence to provide real-time updates to personnel and it’s possible to enhance safety and enhance regulatory compliance. The challenge is pushing the adoption curve past the point where the benefits can be felt more easily by any operator. Resistance to change still exists, and we need to recognize that some in shipping believe that collecting, storing and sharing data creates more transparency than they require. 3. Work on your relationships – they are key to success So, will better vessel operations software be adopted more widely? The answer of course is yes, not least because the potential of machine learning and AI turns the tide into a tidal wave. Owners need to understand that a transparent approach and data-driven relationships are the way this industry is moving. A data-driven strategy exposes the way you run your business toward your partners in a way that simply wasn’t possible even a decade ago. That creates understandable resistance; too many internal stakeholders still view it as a necessary evil and haven’t made the leap toward recognizing the value it can bring. Compliance and reporting are obvious first steps but not enough of the industry is seeing vessel management software as a performance tool that can create genuine, lasting benefits. 4. Think like an investor To innately commercial beings like shipowners, thinking like an investor comes naturally. The challenge for software providers is to make their solutions more investable. Just like shipowners, software providers need to realise the imperative of creating value and bringing the elements together. This includes the day-to-day business of shipping and ship management. But beyond the kind of familiar condition monitoring that drives safety and maintenance routines, visibility can create value by providing vessel data that supports charter earnings and even value in the second-hand market. The maritime industry is experiencing profound change and just like other sectors, there will be winners and losers in terms of those operators who prefer resistance to progress. The progressive influx of AI into our daily working lives will only increase the data transparency that marks out the companies that can adapt to the new data-driven reality. 5. Be ready, things will change faster than you expect In a world where the data can make the difference between profit and loss, holding on to old ways of thinking may be a threat to the bottom line. Embracing the data opportunity increases the odds not just of survival but of rising to the top. Any market defined by multiple small players will go through a consolidation phase as value starts to become evident or external drivers like regulation start to exert pressure. That’s when it pays to have a mindset that identifies the value not just in corporate consolidation but in bringing together the right elements of data and decision making, too. It would be wrong to sit on our hands and think that regulation will eventually do this job for us. True, new safety and environmental regulations will bring more transparency. But how much better would it be to recognise that change is happening and get ahead of the wave before it breaks?"

        "content": "The conflict between Israel and Iran stretched into a fourth consecutive day on Monday, rattling global energy markets and placing the maritime industry on edge. While Israeli airstrikes have so far avoided directly targeting Iran’s crude oil infrastructure, a reported explosion at a natural gas plant near the massive South Pars field over the weekend has escalated concerns of broader regional destabilisation, while Iran has claimed it has successfully hit the Israeli port city of Haifa. The spectre of a widening war in the oil-rich Middle East—which accounts for nearly a third of global crude flows—has driven energy prices and tanker freight rates sharply higher, as shipowners, traders, and insurers weigh the growing risks of operating in the region. Amid the intensifying conflict, maritime authorities have flagged significant electronic interference affecting commercial vessels across the Middle East. The Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC)—part of the US-led Combined Maritime Forces—confirmed Saturday that ships operating near the Persian Gulf and eastern Mediterranean have reported false positioning signals and severe GPS jamming. A now-familiar circular spoofing pattern was observed off the coast of Haifa, a result of distorted GPS signals, according to data reviewed by commercial tracking platforms. The JMIC has urged ship operators to closely monitor navigation systems and prepare alternate communication and positioning methods to avoid incidents at sea. Although Iran’s oil export terminals have not yet been hit, analysts remain focused on the potential for Iran to retaliate by disrupting traffic through the Strait of Hormuz—a vital artery through which about 20m barrels per day of crude and products transit. While a full closure of Hormuz is seen as unlikely and logistically unsustainable, a partial disruption through harassment, seizure, or limited attacks on ships remains plausible. Shipbroker Gibson warned that even minor disturbances could shrink the pool of shipowners willing to transit the strait, driving freight rates higher and potentially shifting demand to Atlantic Basin crude and other safer load zones. There is growing concern that Iran may activate proxy forces to expand the conflict beyond the gulf. Maritime security analysts are warning that the Houthi rebels in Yemen, whose naval capabilities have been targeted by US strikes earlier this year, may resume attacks on Red Sea shipping in a show of support for Tehran. UK-flagged vessels were issued warnings Friday against transiting the southern Red Sea. ظهرت إشارة عدد كبير من السفن على شكل دائرة قبالة ميناء حيفا نتيجة التشويش المستمر على نظام GPS شرق المتوسط#ship#port#sea#marine#gps#shippingpic.twitter.com/C4t0D55eX6"

Finnish investigators later escorted the vessel towards a Finnish port after identifying it as the likely cause of the disruption. Three senior officers aboard—the master, chief mate, and second mate—are now suspected of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with telecommunications. The Finnish police have now transferred the investigation results to prosecutors for a decision on formal charges."

        "content": "A recent survey carried bySplashand Inmarsat, published inShip Concept 2035, reveals a maritime industry poised for profound change by the next decade, driven by accelerating technological advancements. While optimism abounds for enhanced safety and efficiency, significant challenges remain concerning workforce adaptation, energy transition, and the ability of global legislation to keep pace. A striking finding from the survey indicates that nearly half (49%) of respondents believe more than 50% of daily manual operations at sea will be made redundant by 2035. This anticipated surge in automation is expected to lead to a significant shift in crew numbers, with a combined 50% expecting either less or much less crew onboard. Consequently, the survey highlights a critical need for reskilling and upskilling, with a large majority anticipating that 50% or more of existing crewmembers will require new training to adapt to emerging technologies like digital twins and autonomous vessels. Future seafarers will need new skills in areas such as data analysis, cybersecurity, remote operations, and software management. The survey shows a strong expectation that IT will lead to a decrease or significant decrease in maritime incidents. However, this increased reliance on technology introduces new vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity emerges as the paramount safety concern with increasing automation, followed by equipment malfunction and human error in oversight, underscoring the need for robust digital defences and comprehensive training. Despite the push for digitalisation, the vision of a fully connected office onboard with free, full broadband internet for the entire fleet appears to be a more distant reality, with respondents anticipating only a small percentage of the fleet will achieve this by 2035. Communication methods between vessel and shore are expected to evolve significantly, moving towards more data exchange and AI-driven solutions. Perhaps one of the most pressing concerns highlighted by the survey is the widespread belief that global legislation will struggle to keep pace with technological innovations through 2035, with a resounding 74% of respondents expressing this view. This potential regulatory gap could create uncertainties and hinder the smooth adoption of new advancements. Furthermore, despite the ongoing drive towards decarbonisation, a substantial portion of the global fleet is still expected to rely on traditional bunker fuel by 2035, with 50% of respondents projecting that 50% or more of the fleet will still consume traditional bunker fuel. Full results of the survey are carried below."

The 1,000MW capacity wind farm will be among the first investments funded by the Mediterranean Blue Partnership (MBP), a multi-donor fund supporting a sustainable blue economy in the southern Mediterranean and Red Sea. The project is set to begin construction by 2029. This aligns with the country’s national strategy to secure more than 52% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. So far, the country’s renewable projects revolved around solar energy and onshore wind development. The World Bank claimed recently that Morocco has large potential for offshore wind energy. It also stated that, apart from generating clean electricity, the country could also use it to produce green hydrogen. Morocco has a high potential to exploit offshore wind, particularly along its Atlantic coast, with high wind speeds are shallow waters. The Essaouira coast was chosen because of these factors and its strong and consistent marine winds, with average speeds reaching 11 meters per second. “This project is part of a dynamic that combines energy independence, industrial attractiveness and economic competitiveness,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition."

        "content": "Japanese shipping giant Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL), Malaysian state energy firm Petronas and the country’s top shipping line, MISC, have launched a joint venture to build and operate liquefied carbon dioxide (LCO2) carriers. The JV called Jules Nautica will aim to become a leading owner of LCO2 carriers, facilitating the transportation of LCO2 to designated CO2 storage sites across the Asia Pacific region, the companies said in a joint release. The new company plans to work closely with both carbon-emitting industries and CO2 storage providers to create an integrated supply chain that addresses growing environmental and regulatory demands, the trio added. The partners recently completed front-end engineering design (FEED) for a 62,000-cubic-meter LCO2 carrier, developed by the Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute (SDARI). The vessel has received preliminary approval from DNV, positioning it as one of the most advanced low-pressure, low-temperature LCO2 carriers in the industry. “This joint venture will play a crucial role in the transportation of LCO2, which is indispensable for cross-border CCS projects. The three companies coming together emphasize the need for collaboration within the industry to help realize CCS, said Takeshi Hashimoto, MOL’s president and CEO, adding that the collaboration will lead decarbonisation efforts beyond Malaysia and Japan and will “contribute to the realisation of a carbon-neutral society.” In related news, K Line Energy Shipping (KLES), a London-based subsidiary of another Japanese shipowner Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line), and Singapore-based floater owner and operator Yinson Production, part of the Malaysian Yinson Group, announced a collaboration to develop floating storage and injection units (FSIUs) and LCO2 carriers for European CCS projects."

FSIUs are being considered for several projects, including the Havstjerne carbon storage project in Norway. The Havstjerne carbon storage project is 40% owned by Stella Maris CCS, a unit of Yinson Production. Yinson Production operates a fleet of floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) and floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessels while K Line has managed for the past year two liquefied CO2 carriers for the world’s first commercial CO2 transport and storage service. K Line and Yinson Production have been working together in the FPSO sector since 2018. Both parties co-own FPSOs Anna Nery and John Agyekum Kufuor in Brazil and Ghana, respectively. Kei Onishi, corporate officer of K Line, said: “By combining their offshore engineering expertise with our experience in CO2 shipping, we are developing an offshore unloading capability and bespoke transport solutions to serve a broader range of CO2 storage sites. This will complement traditional port-to-port transport models for the CCS value chain and offer emitters greater flexibility in meeting their decarbonisation goals.” Pictured above, an illustration of a FSIU in the foreground, receiving cargo from a LCO2 carrier in the background."

        "content": "US supermajor ExxonMobil has hired EnerMech for flowline decommissioning of the Hoover-Diana fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Under the contract, won following a competitive tender, EnerMech will decommission subsea flowlines, and the scope will include flushing, pigging, and filling the lines to remove hydrocarbons and prepare for safe decommissioning. The operation will require multiple service lines, including coiled tubing, pressure pumping, chemical services, filtration, separation, and pipeline gauging. This involves flushing of the umbilical, pipeline flushing, and seawater fill operations for the subsea flowline loop, as well as nitrogen flushing via subsea vessel, coiled tubing services, and final seawater filling for the Northern Diana flowline. Hoover and Diana fields lie about 260 km south of Galveston, Texas. Diana is located mostly within East Breaks blocks 945 and 989 in 1,460 m of water. Hoover lies in Alaminos Canyon blocks 25 and 26. The fields were discovered in 1990 and began production in 2000. “With many offshore assets reaching the end of their lifecycle, the decommissioning market in the Gulf of Mexico is expanding rapidly,” said Charles ‘Chuck’ Davison Jr, EnerMech CEO."

I think we have all seen the nature of news these days has changed a great deal in the past 20 years, with the dawn of the internet and the information revolution. Instead of the daily newspaper and news programming on a small number of channels three times a day, the news media has unlimited online space to fill – and it must fill that space 24 hours a day. The appetite for supplying news stories means we have an endless supply of bad news with clickbait headlines, designed to catch your attention. And maritime news is no different. Anyone who knows me well enough will be aware that I deal with actual facts – and as we have Day of the Seafarer coming around, it’s time to present the world with those facts. Rightly so, people are keen to stamp out sexual harassment onboard vessels. But the data that we are seeing reported is wildly inaccurate from sources that cannot be verified. The fact is sexual harassment in our industry is not worse than many sectors on land. Of course that does not mean we ever want to be complacent, far from it. There is a lot of good to say about a career in the maritime industry, and very few people are saying it. For instance; while women fight to gain pay equality in other industries even today, in the maritime industry we have had equal pay for male and female seafarers for many decades. While many nationalities have faced racial discrimination for many decades in entering certain industries, the maritime industry is one of the most diverse sectors in the world. According to the International Labour Organization many Southeast Asian countries are among the world’s top maritime countries, as the sector employs more than 2m workers in both Indonesia and Vietnam, more than 1.8m in the Philippines, more than 1m in Thailand, and hundreds of thousands in Myanmar and Cambodia. That includes people working in our industry, especially the cruise industry. So what can be done to make our industry better? What we don’t have is a whistleblowing system, which allows a full and proper reporting of wrongdoing. It is a requirement under EU law, but we still don’t have one. It is also a fact that many other industries also do not have a system of this nature in place – so why cannot the maritime industry be better than others, and put one in place? It’s time to build up our industry instead of tearing it down. We are here and ready to promote ourselves in the world as modern and forward-thinking; ready to welcome a new generation to our crews."

        "content": "The UK Crown Estate has revealed its proposal to invest up to £400m ($542.5m) of capital in the supply chain of the country’s offshore wind sector. The Crown Estate, a collection of marine and land assets and holdings that belong to the monarch, has stated in its new Powering Offshore Wind publication that it would focus on supportive investments into new onshore enabling infrastructure over the medium term. These investments are intended to support the construction of new infrastructure, including ports, supply chain manufacturing, and research and testing facilities. “Insufficient supply chain capacity is recognised as a key constraint to further offshore wind deployment. Investing in and building this enabling infrastructure will allow the UK to drive forward its clean energy transition and create growth opportunities within local communities,” the Crown Estate explained. A new £350m Supply Chain Investment Programme is being established to invest in the construction of new port and supply chain infrastructure that will support accelerated delivery of UK offshore wind projects. Furthermore, the organisation’s £50m Supply Chain Accelerator supports early-stage project development and is currently running its second funding round, having awarded nearly £5m to 13 organisations in December 2024. The second round is seeking to award up to £15m and has an expanded scope to include UK ports and port-related infrastructure. “Building out enabling infrastructure is critical if we are to accelerate deployment off our coasts, derisk projects for investors and create local economic opportunities,” said Ben Brinded, head of investment at The Crown Estate."

        "content": "India has announced plans to launch an offshore wind energy tender totalling 4GW in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. The country’s minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi, said that wind will play “a critical role” in achieving India’s net-zero emissions target by 2070 and the goal of generating 50% of power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. This announcement comes after the renewable energy budget for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 increased by 53% to just over $3bn. Joshi added that India currently has the world’s fourth-largest installed wind capacity and ranks third globally in renewable energy generation. The minister also said that their renewables push will continue with the expansion of wind projects into new states like Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha, as well as launching more offshore wind tenders. The country will also be looking to integrate wind with solar and storage for round-the-clock renewable power and invest in AI-based forecasting and grid infrastructure. India also has the advantage of producing 33 models of wind turbines, ranging from 225kW to 5.2MW, which can both meet domestic demand and are competitive globally. India also revealed its new Wind Energy Roadmap and the Wind Manufacturing Roadmap, intended to be guiding frameworks for building a “resilient and self-reliant” wind ecosystem in the country."

Israel’s conflict with Iran is into its sixth day, with theNew York Timesreporting Iranian officials will consider laying mines along the Strait of Hormuz if the US does enter the war. Amid the deteriorating security situation in the region, war risk insurance premiums for shipments to Israel are now as much as three times higher than a week ago, according toReuters. The US president held a meeting Tuesday afternoon in the White House Situation Room with his national security team on the Israel-Iran conflict, with his team considering joining the strikes against Tehran. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates has provided some details of yesterday’s big tanker collision to the south of the strait. The Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI) announced that preliminary information regarding the accidental collision between two ships in the Sea of Oman, approximately 24 nautical miles off the coast of the UAE, indicates that the incident was caused by a navigational misjudgment by one of the vessels with GPS spoofing clearly evident in the hours prior to the collision. The ministry added that the incident resulted in minor surface damage to the outer hulls of both ships, a small oil spill, and a fire that broke out in the fuel tank of one of the ships. Relevant authorities swiftly intervened and extinguished the fire. No injuries were reported among the crewmembers of either vessel. Persistent reports of electronic interference have been impacting navigational systems in the region. The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) and the US-led Combined Maritime Force’s Joint Maritime Information Centre (JMIC) have both issued advisories regarding interference, particularly emanating from the vicinity of Iran’s Port of Bandar Abbas. This disruption is directly affecting vessels’ ability to accurately transmit Automated Identification System (AIS) data, creating significant operational and navigational challenges for maritime traffic. Shipping rates in the Arabian Gulf have already soared, with some owners expressing reluctance to operate in the region."

TheWan Hai 503incident drew widespread attention after the vessel, carrying over 1,700 containers—including more than 140 with hazardous cargo—suffered a series of explosions and caught fire while transiting from Colombo to Mumbai. The Indian Coast Guard and navy mounted a large-scale firefighting and rescue operation, managing to evacuate 18 of the 22 crewmembers onboard. The fire-wrecked ship has since been towed further away from the coastline. On Tuesday, a body believed to be one of the missing crewmembers was found washed ashore in Alappuzha. This followed the discovery on Monday of a lifeboat and a container from theWan Hai 503on the same stretch of coastline. Police are working to confirm the identity of the deceased. The case against theWan Hai 503’s owners mirrors legal proceedings already underway related to theMSC Elsa 3, a container vessel that sank off Kochi last month. In that case, the Kerala Coastal Police also registered charges against the responsible parties, citing negligence and lapses in safety compliance. The Kerala High Court today issued a conditional arrest order for the Liberian-flagged containershipMSC Polo II,a sister vessel to the sunkenMSC Elsa 3, in response to a cargo loss claim filed by Sans Cashew India.

        "content": "Engineering contractor LiftOff has revealed its design for a new major component exchange vessel (MCEV). The MCEV is a purpose-built vessel designed to transport multiple generators and gearboxes, making it ideal for both large-scale and smaller major component exchange projects. According to LiftOff, it will significantly shorten response times. The DP2 MCEV features a custom up-tower crane with nacelle-mounted winches, enhancing safety by removing direct load connections to the vessel. The aft deck is equipped with a motion-compensated platform that carries cargo and major wind turbine components. A motion-compensated walk-to-work system ensures efficient crew and small component transfers. “With a rapidly expanding offshore wind energy market, combined with an ageing fleet of installed wind turbines, operators face increasing delays due to limited jack-up and heavy-lift vessel availability,” the company said. The vessel does not require seabed contact, unlike jack-up vessels, eliminating the need for pre-arrival site characterisation. The vessel also enables faster transit between turbines and sites, further reducing downtime. “The MCEV allows us to scale our services and better support wind farm owners, operators and turbine OEMS across the globe,” said Eelko May, managing director of LiftOff."

        "content": "The 2004-built shadow aframax tankerConico Atlashas been sold for scrap following mounting regulatory pressure and a high-profile entry denial at India’s Vadinar port earlier this year. The vessel, previously known by names includingAndaman SkiesandDelta Pioneer, is currently en route to the Alang shipbreaking yards on the west coast of India, according to MarineTraffic data. TheConico Atlasgrabbed headlines in March when Indian port authorities refused the ship entry due to inadequate and suspicious documentation. At the time, the tanker was registered under Aurelius Ship Management, following earlier affiliations with Aqutb Alshamali Marine Services and Radiating World Shipping—companies often associated with the so-called dark fleet involved in opaque oil trades and sanctions evasion. Prior to its latest identity, the Comoros-flaggedConico Atlassailed under multiple names and ownership arrangements, all of which added layers to its checkered record. Both Aqutb Alshamali Marine Services and Radiating World Shipping are known for their ties to tankers implicated in transporting sanctioned or non-compliant crude oil, especially out of Russia and Venezuela. Data from the International Maritime Risk Rating Agency (IMRRA) lists Aqutb Alshamali Marine Services with a fleet risk rating of 42%, placing it in the agency’s orange caution category. Notably, theConico Atlasshares a close lineage with another 111,000 dwt aframax that was sent to the breakers just last month at an unusually young age of 20. That vessel had reportedly been under intense scrutiny by several governments for transporting non-compliant Russian crude. Years before entering shadow fleet operations, both theConico Atlasand its recently scrapped sister ship were part of the Greek tanker company Delta Tankers. The sale of theConico Atlascomes at a time when the tanker demolition market is beginning to see more activity."

        "content": "Norwegian equipment supplier Wee.no has launched ContainerWheels 2-in-1, a patented system designed to make container transport more flexible. The system allows for lifting and towing containers, slashing the need for heavy machinery or permanent infrastructure. ContainerWheels 2-in-1 consists of two galvanised modules and a front drawbar. Each module features dual solid wheels and a manual crank-lift mechanism. The units slide into the container’s forklift pockets, allowing users to lift the container approximately 15 cm off the ground. Once elevated, the container can be towed with a forklift, car, wheel loader, or tractor. The system will initially be available in two models, capable of handling loads of 10 and 20 tonnes, respectively. Inventor and product developer at Wee.no, Rune Wee, explained: “ContainerWheels 2-in-1 is designed to meet the requirements of companies that frequently move or reposition containers in ports, warehouses, construction sites, storage facilities, or recycling stations. The system is both robust and practical to utilise, and is constructed to handle uneven terrain during transport.”"

        "content": "A new research centre dedicated to advancing sustainable shipping has been launched by Scotland’s University of Strathclyde in partnership with Germany’s Oldendorff Carriers. The Oldendorff Research Centre for Sustainable Shipping will drive actionable research to advance the decarbonisation of maritime operations, aligning global climate targets with operational realities at sea. The centre will address evidence gaps critical to an effective industry transition, focusing on technological, operational, and human factors, including the impacts of decarbonisation measures on crew. Key research areas will also encompass the design of next-generation, energy-efficient vessels, the integration of alternative fuel systems, and the application of AI-driven decision-support systems. Dr Torsten Barenthin, Oldendorff’s director of research and development, commented: “Decarbonising the maritime sector is the greatest operational challenge the industry faces and will continue to face in the years ahead. Addressing it requires not only collaboration, but also a willingness to engage with the difficult issues that remain unexamined in much of the current discourse. The centre is designed to generate insights that extend beyond Oldendorff and deliver measurable impact across the global fleet.” As part of the centre activities, a scientific research paper on the round-trip efficiency of various e-fuels is being prepared. The Oldendorff Research Centre for Sustainable Shipping is the latest in a number of high-profile maritime decarbonisation research centres that also include Singapore’s Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation and the Copenhagen-based Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping."

        "content": "The United Kingdom has escalated its maritime pressure campaign on Russia, unveiling a new sanctions package at the G7 Summit in Canada that targets 20 additional tankers linked to Vladimir Putin’s shadow oil fleet with the European Union likely to follow suit. The 30-entity sanctions list unveiled by prime minister Keir Starmer and foreign secretary David Lammy includes not just vessels, but also shipping companies, crewing firms, and shell entities suspected of facilitating illegal oil trades and circumventing the G7 oil price cap. The vessels named in the new sanctions are believed to be part of a fleet operating under deceptive flags, falsified documentation, and complex ownership structures designed to obfuscate links to sanctioned Russian oil interests. Many of the tankers on the list have previously raised red flags for performing ship-to-ship (STS) transfers in high-risk zones and engaging in AIS (automatic identification system) spoofing. Newly sanctioned entities include Rosneft Marine (UK), Orion Star Group and Valegro, firms implicated in crewing and managing tankers connected to sanctioned Russian energy firms. Two UK-based businessmen—Vladimir Pristoupa and Olech Tkacz—were also sanctioned, accused of funneling over $120 million in high-tech electronics to Russia through a web of shell companies. “These sanctions strike right at the heart of Putin’s war machine, choking off his ability to continue his barbaric war in Ukraine,” Starmer said yesterday."

        "content": "Governors and attorneys general of a dozen US states are voicing their opposition to offshore oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Attorneys general of Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and, most recently, California filed comment letters with the US Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) The latest letter came from California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who joined a coalition of 10 attorneys general in urging the federal government to exclude all planning areas in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans from the upcoming 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. The final program will determine which ocean areas could be opened to lease sales for oil and gas activity during the current five-year planning period, which covers the period 2024-2029. “President Trump is once again taking action to line the pockets of his Big Oil friends. This time, he’s expanding oil and gas development by attempting to drill in our coastal communities. There is no compelling need to risk our marine and coastal resources for the limited supplies of fossil fuels off our coasts,” Bonta said. He pointed out that the US already produces more oil and gas than any other country and exports more than it uses, and that gasoline demand has been dropping since 2019, especially on the east and west coasts. Separately, the governors of North Carolina and South Carolina opposed offshore drilling on their coasts in a letter to BOEM. The Bureau is evaluating the American coastline for potential sites to drill for natural energy resources, and potential new leases could be given on the Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina coasts, which, by a resolution signed by President Donald Trump in his first term, are supposed to be protected until 2032. In the bipartisan letter, Democratic governor Josh Stein and Republican governor Henry McMaster asked the administration not to lift the moratorium. The two Carolinas have around 800 km of ocean beaches and over 9,650 km of coastline. “These decisions to protect the Carolina coast from offshore oil and gas exploration, development, and production were responsive to the significant bipartisan concerns of business leaders, residents, and local and state elected officials about the risks that these activities pose to the economy and environment of our states,” they wrote. They added that every North Carolina and South Carolina coastal municipality has passed a resolution opposing offshore drilling and seismic testing, reaffirmed by other municipalities and counties, as well as state legislators and members of Congressional delegations from both parties. This opposition to offshore drilling follows a total of 18 attorneys general filing a lawsuit in federal court in May challenging US president Donald Trump’s order to shut down offshore wind projects, stating that such a move was “unlawful and can jeopardise the continued development of a power source critical to the states’ economic vitality, energy mix, public health, and climate goals.” The lawsuit names New York, Massachusetts, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington State as the plaintiffs."

I think we have all seen the nature of news these days has changed a great deal in the past 20 years, with the dawn of the internet and the information revolution. Instead of the daily newspaper and news programming on a small number of channels three times a day, the news media has unlimited online space to fill – and it must fill that space 24 hours a day. The appetite for supplying news stories means we have an endless supply of bad news with clickbait headlines, designed to catch your attention. And maritime news is no different. Anyone who knows me well enough will be aware that I deal with actual facts – and as we have Day of the Seafarer coming around, it’s time to present the world with those facts. Rightly so, people are keen to stamp out sexual harassment onboard vessels. But the data that we are seeing reported is wildly inaccurate from sources that cannot be verified. The fact is sexual harassment in our industry is not worse than many sectors on land. Of course that does not mean we ever want to be complacent, far from it. There is a lot of good to say about a career in the maritime industry, and very few people are saying it. For instance; while women fight to gain pay equality in other industries even today, in the maritime industry we have had equal pay for male and female seafarers for many decades. While many nationalities have faced racial discrimination for many decades in entering certain industries, the maritime industry is one of the most diverse sectors in the world. According to the International Labour Organization many Southeast Asian countries are among the world’s top maritime countries, as the sector employs more than 2m workers in both Indonesia and Vietnam, more than 1.8m in the Philippines, more than 1m in Thailand, and hundreds of thousands in Myanmar and Cambodia. That includes people working in our industry, especially the cruise industry. So what can be done to make our industry better? What we don’t have is a whistleblowing system, which allows a full and proper reporting of wrongdoing. It is a requirement under EU law, but we still don’t have one. It is also a fact that many other industries also do not have a system of this nature in place – so why cannot the maritime industry be better than others, and put one in place? It’s time to build up our industry instead of tearing it down. We are here and ready to promote ourselves in the world as modern and forward-thinking; ready to welcome a new generation to our crews."

        "content": "French energy major TotalEnergies has been awarded the N-9.4 offshore concession in the German North Sea by the country’s Federal Network Agency. Located in the North Sea, approximately 150 km northwest of the German island of Heligoland, the N-9.4 concession covers an area of around 141 sq km and will enable the development of a 1GW offshore wind farm. The concession is granted for a period of 25 years, extendable to 35 years. The concession is located near the N-9.1 and N-9.2 sites, jointly owned by RWE and TotalEnergies. The French firm intends to prioritise the development of this cluster and leverage synergies to optimise construction and operating costs for the benefit of its customers. The company will pay €18m ($20.7m) to the German federal government in 2026, which will be allocated to marine conservation and the promotion of environmentally friendly fishing practices. An annual contribution of €8.1m ($9.3m) will be paid for 20 years to the electricity transmission system operator responsible for connecting the project, starting from the commissioning of the site. TotalEnergies’ portfolio in offshore wind has a total capacity of 23GW, with most farms bottom-fixed. These projects are in the United Kingdom, South Korea, Taiwan, France, the US, the Netherlands, and Germany. The downside of the auction round was that it included negative bidding, which makes offshore wind more expensive. Negative bidding also reduces the number of interested offshore wind developers, with only two bidders willing to participate in this round. “Negative bidding creates additional costs which must be passed on to consumers and the wind energy supply chain. It may be a short-term gain for finance ministries. But it’s a long-term cost for society”, said Giles Dickson, WindEurope CEO. The second German offshore auction round will take place in August. It will auction two sites with a total capacity of 2.5GW. These sites will be centrally predeveloped. The auction will use a combination of negative bidding and non-price criteria."

The incident, which took place on December 25, 2024, involved the severing of the Estlink-2 power cable and communication lines—key arteries supporting energy and data flows in the Baltic region. According to Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation, theEagle Sdragged its anchor for nearly 100 km along the seabed, damaging the Estlink-2 cable at depths of up to 90 m. The vessel, flagged in the Cook Islands, was carrying 35,000 tons of oil at the time of the incident. Finnish investigators later escorted the vessel towards a Finnish port after identifying it as the likely cause of the disruption. Three senior officers aboard—the master, chief mate, and second mate—are now suspected of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with telecommunications. The Finnish police have now transferred the investigation results to prosecutors for a decision on formal charges."

        "content": "A new hydrogen fuel cell system tailored for maritime applications has been unveiled by Singapore-based Proteus Energy in partnership with French hydrogen fuel cell specialist Symbio. The modular system, known as the Proteus Maritime Fuel Cell Solution, is intended for deployment on vessels such as harbor craft, coastal ships, offshore support vessels, and inland waterway vessels. The first product in the lineup, the Proteus75, offers a 75 kW output per fuel cell stack, with scalability through stack combinations. Symbio is jointly owned by Michelin, Stellantis, and Forvia, and has previously supplied hydrogen systems for road vehicles including cars, buses, and trucks in Europe. Designed to support both all-electric and hybrid vessel propulsion, the marine-adapted system can be configured as a modular power pack or integrated directly into a vessel’s structure to extend operational range and reduce battery strain in hybrid configurations, Proteus explained. Fuel cell stacks for the system will be produced at Symbio’s facility in Lyon, France. The first deliveries of the system are projected for early 2026, pending type approval from class society DNV, expected later in 2025. “The maritime industry needs viable clean energy solutions today,” said Lars Gruenitz, CEO of Proteus Energy, adding: “We are providing a high energy density solution that is compact and lightweight, which is critical for vessels where space and weight considerations are imperative. This best-in-class system is the logical and most cost-effective choice to help operators make a quantum leap in their decarbonization efforts”."

They stated that such a move was “unlawful and can jeopardise the continued development of a power source critical to the states’ economic vitality, energy mix, public health, and climate goals”, and that Trump has no authority to make such a decision. The lawsuit, led by New York attorney general Letitia James, names New York, Massachusetts, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington State as the plaintiffs. The judge in charge of the case, William G. Young, stated during a hearing that he would allow the case to proceed against Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. However, actions against Trump and cabinet secretaries, who are also named as defendants, would be dismissed. Young believes that the states can proceed with claims that the order violates the Administrative Procedure Act. He did add that the president’s agenda was to “bet the country’s energy future on fossil fuels”, but that it was not “for this court to question that.” The Wind Directive has stopped most wind-energy development despite it creating billions of dollars in economic activity and tax payments and supplying more than 10% of US electricity. The attorneys general want the administration to resume permitting under applicable laws and existing standards and timelines. The government representatives and the attorneys general are clashing over what the halt means. While the Trump administration claims it is just a pause and not a halt, and that it would last until secetary Burgum reviews the environmental impact of those permits. However, no timeline was given. The attorneys general claimed that anything without an end date should be considered a “categorical and indefinite halt.”"

        "content": "As EV-related fires continue to challenge the maritime industry – with incidents like theMorning Midasblaze in the North Pacific (pictured) – operators are urgently seeking more effective solutions. A new brine-based firefighting system, developed by Skansi Offshore in close cooperation with naval architect Knud E. Hansen, now offers a simple answer using only salt and water. The system is operational aboardNorrøna, sailing the world’s longest ropax route, and is scheduled for installation on two new roro vessels under construction. Unlike traditional fire suppression methods – which act from the outside and often fail to extinguish the core fire – the brine system targets the battery directly from inside the vehicle. In the event of a fire, one window is penetrated, and cold, saturated brine is delivered directly into the cabin. This allows the fluid to pool around the battery compartment, rapidly cooling the cells, limiting oxygen exposure, suppressing flammable materials, and even short-circuiting and depowering the battery. “We believe this system sets a new standard. It’s low-tech in the best way – reliable, proven, and easily maintainable. Most importantly, it addresses the real issue: heat – not just the flames, but the fire inside the battery” said Finn Wollesen, managing director of Knud E. Hansen. In a full-scale fire test conducted in the Faroe Islands, the system extinguished a fully developed EV fire in under one hour, including response times. In contrast, lithium-ion battery fires often burn for 24 hours or more when left to self-extinguish, and can reignite multiple times. The retrofittable system features a 16 cu m cooled brine tank set at –19 °C, a redundant pump system, a heat exchanger connected to a vessel’s refrigeration system, and fire hydrants located on the EV deck."

The accident occurred at 1:14 am Dubai time on Wednesday between two tankers, the 23-year-oldAdalynnsuezmax and the Liberian-flaggedFront EagleVLCC, near the Khorfakkan anchorage in the Gulf of Oman. The impact resulted in a fire aboard theAdalynnand prompted the swift evacuation of its entire crew. Lars Barstad, the CEO of Frontline, discussed the accident on stage at Marine Money’s New York gathering yesterday, saying what had transpired was the “nightmare” for any shipowner. He described the incident as having “a three football field long tanker fully laden with crude oil sailing at 13 knots and then all of a sudden you end up in a collision with a vessel that you don’t know who owns it, you don’t know who manages it, and you don’t know who insures it.” Barstad highlighted the difficulty of the situation, stating that it’s customary to establish contact with the other owner to manage the situation and ensure the safety of seafarers and the environment, but this was not possible in this instance, helping to explain how “crazy” this market has become with the rise of the dark fleet. “We’ve been very vocal on how dangerous this situation can become with the dark fleet but here we had a very, very close call of having 2m barrels of crude oil in a big sheet in the Middle East,” Barstad told delegates. While the Frontline tanker did not spill oil, there is a slick emerging from theAdalynn, with Greenpeace reporting that as of yesterday satellite images suggest the size of the slick stood at more than 15 sq km, expanding rapidly. The United Arab Emirates has provided some details of the collision. The Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI) announced that preliminary information regarding the accidental collision between two ships in the Sea of Oman, approximately 24 nautical miles off the coast of the UAE, indicates that the incident was caused by a navigational misjudgment by one of the vessels with GPS spoofing clearly evident in the hours prior to the collision. Persistent reports of electronic interference have been impacting navigational systems in the region. The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) and the US-led Combined Maritime Force’s Joint Maritime Information Centre (JMIC) have both issued advisories regarding interference, particularly emanating from the vicinity of Iran’s port of Bandar Abbas. This disruption is directly affecting vessels’ ability to accurately transmit Automated Identification System (AIS) data, creating significant operational and navigational challenges for maritime traffic. “The ongoing interference with navigational signals in the Gulf marks a shift from conventional threats to more complex electronic disruptions. This evolution significantly increases the risk for commercial vessels, especially in strategic chokepoints,” maritime analytics firm Windward stated in an update."

        "content": "Tensions in the Middle East have reached a boiling point this week as senior US officials reportedly prepare for a potential military strike on Iran, a move that threatens to ignite a wider regional conflict. According to aBloombergreport citing individuals familiar with the matter, the US is actively planning for the possibility of a weekend strike in response to escalating hostilities between Iran and Israel with with theNew York Timesreporting earlier in the week Iranian officials will consider laying mines along the Strait of Hormuz if the US does enter the war. Freight markets are reacting swiftly. VLCCs have surged to nearly $55,000 a day, more than doubling from just a week ago when global averages hovered in the mid-$20,000 a day range. LR2 tankers have similarly spiked to over $45,000 a day, their highest level since July 2024. This surge is particularly significant given that 60 to 65% of global VLCC and LR2 liftings are tied to the Middle East region, according to data from Jefferies, making these vessels the most exposed to geopolitical turbulence in the Persian Gulf and surrounding waters. The Greek Ministry of Shipping issued an advisory earlier this week, urging all Greek-flagged vessels to avoid Iranian waters wherever possible. The advisory cites historical risks to freedom of navigation and merchant ship safety, particularly near Iran’s shores, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Gulf of Oman. The most immediate impact has been felt in the insurance markets. According to Marsh McLennan, the world’s largest marine insurance broker, hull and machinery insurance rates for vessels transiting the Strait of Hormuz have jumped more than 60% in just a matter of days. Premiums have risen from 0.125% to 0.2% of a vessel’s value. For a $100m tanker, this pushes insurance costs from $125,000 to $200,000—with brokers warning that prices could rise further if an actual strike materialises. Insurers are also closely monitoring electronic interference, which has been affecting navigational systems in the region, particularly near Iran’s Port of Bandar Abbas. The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) and the US-led Combined Maritime Force’s Joint Maritime Information Centre (JMIC) have issued multiple advisories warning ships of GPS spoofing and signal anomalies. A collision between two tankers near the strait earlier this week—one of which reportedly transmitted irregular positioning data—has heightened suspicions of deliberate interference. Insurers are also increasingly concerned about the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group expanding its targeting of commercial vessels. Several speakers at Marine Money Week 2025 in New York yesterday discussed the Israel-Iran conflict and its implications for shipping, with most senior tanker executives dismissing the likelihood of a prolonged closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Svein Moxnes Harfjeld, CEO of DHT Holdings, said there was no precedent for a closure of the strait, while Lois Zabrocky, CEO of International Seaways, said China and India, massive importers of Middle Eastern oil, would do all they could to make sure the strait remains open. Lars Barstad, the CEO of Frontline, another major tanker owner, described the market dynamics since the Israel-Iran conflict kicked off last Friday as a “Mexican standoff” between charterers and owners. Knut Traaholt, the CFO at Flex LNG, reckoned Iran would sue for peace, and the country had no interest in blocking the strait, a vital source of revenues for the Middle Eastern republic. John Boots, CFO of CoolCo, added historical context, pointing out that even during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and the two Gulf Wars, the strait was never properly closed. Kristian Sørensen, CEO of BW LPG, discussed the current rush to secure LPG cargoes and ships out of the Middle East as all as the US as an alternative."

This move marks the first time Australia has imposed sanctions against the shadow fleet. The vessels within the fleet are operating using deceptive practices, such as flag-hopping, disabling tracking systems, and operating with inadequate insurance. Australia’s minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, said that the sanctions reinforce the country’s “consistent commitment to ensuring Russia and those enabling its illegal invasion of Ukraine face consequences”. “Australia has imposed over 1,400 sanctions in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We will continue to take coordinated and decisive action to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and disrupt Russia’s ability to fund its aggression,” Wong stated. She also called on Russia to “immediately end this war and withdraw from Ukrainian territory”. “The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) is particularly grateful to minister Wong and her team for leading the charge on this initiative. These sanctions send a strong and necessary signal that Australia will not be complicit in funding Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine,” the organisation said. The AFUO also urged the Australian government to fully close this sanctions loophole by banning the import of all petroleum products refined from Russian crude oil. This week, the UK unveiled a new sanctions package at the G7 Summit in Canada that targeted 20 additional tankers linked to Russia’s shadow oil fleet. In May, the EU agreed to sanction an additional 200 ships, increasing the number of sanctioned vessels to around 340. The EU’s 18th package of sanctions against Russia is expected to be announced next week."

The incident, which took place on December 25, 2024, involved the severing of the Estlink-2 power cable and communication lines—key arteries supporting energy and data flows in the Baltic region. According to Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation, theEagle Sdragged its anchor for nearly 100 km along the seabed, damaging the Estlink-2 cable at depths of up to 90 m. The vessel, flagged in the Cook Islands, was carrying 35,000 tons of oil at the time of the incident. Finnish investigators later escorted the vessel towards a Finnish port after identifying it as the likely cause of the disruption. Three senior officers aboard—the master, chief mate, and second mate—are now suspected of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with telecommunications. The Finnish police have now transferred the investigation results to prosecutors for a decision on formal charges."

        "content": "ABS has issued approval in principle (AIP) to HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) and HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE) for a concept of a floating small modular reactor (SMR)-powered power module. The design is intended to generate electricity offshore and near shore, supporting port facilities and onshore communities. The AIP is the second for a floating nuclear power barge design from HD KSOE and is the latest step in a long running collaboration with ABS on nuclear technologies, including another power barge design and a 15,000 teu nuclear propelled containership. “Floating nuclear power facilities show promise in supporting power grids, microgrids, industrial and port operations, data centres, and other uses. Additionally, today’s advanced nuclear technology has a different risk profile from traditional reactor technology with state-of-the-art designs and with lower enrichment fuels, making commercial offshore and maritime applications more viable,” said Patrick Ryan, ABS’s chief technology officer. ABS published the industry’s first comprehensive rules for floating nuclear power in October last year. Christopher Wiernicki, ABS’s chairman and CEO, told delegates attending February’s New Nuclear for Maritime Houston Summit: “New nuclear is a transformational technology. It disrupts the commercial model, the economics of shipping, as well as the operation of vessels and of course their design. Not only does it offer zero carbon operations but higher power with faster transit speeds, increased cargo storage due to the elimination of fuel storage and it unlocks the potential for reverse cold ironing where the vessel powers the port. Finally, critically, it eliminates the need to bunker fuel potentially over the entire lifespan of the asset.”"

The GranMorgu project is located 150 km off the coast of Suriname and is the first oil and gas development off the country’s shores. TotalEnergies ordered theGranMorguFPSO from SBM Offshore back in November last year. Under the deal, the company, in partnership with Technip Energies, will construct the FPSO. The award followed the completion of FEED studies and the final investment decision on the project. The French firm also awarded billions in deals to Saipem and TechnipFMC for work on the project. In total, the two companies won contracts worth $2.9bn. In May this year, Staatsolie arranged a $1.6bn loan with a group of 18 international, regional and local banks and financial institutions to partly finance its 20% participation in the project."

        "content": "Splash gets a little help in reporting from a recent tech conference. No longer are artificial intelligence (AI) and automation speculative technologies waiting on the horizon; they are already actively redefining the contours of modern shipping. A recent event in Oslo, jointly hosted by Orca AI and Bureau Veritas, brought together top minds from the likes of Torvald Klaveness, Hoegh Autoliners and Anglo-Eastern to showcase how data, AI, and automation are ushering in a new era. Central to this transformation is the drive for heightened operational efficiency and optimised supply chains. Ernst Meyer, CEO of Torvald Klaveness, highlighted how AI-powered decision-making and data analysis are enabling his company to rethink traditional shipping paradigms. A prime innovation is their development of combination carriers that can transport both wet and dry cargo within the same voyage, nearly eliminating inefficient ballast trips. This revolution in efficiency is made possible by what many are calling the connectivity leap. Traditional satellite communications limited ships to minimal data exchanges. But the advent of affordable low-orbit satellite constellations like Starlink is enabling real-time data transfer and visibility, bridging the longstanding connectivity gap. This digital link is vital for AI implementation, allowing real-time performance monitoring, weather avoidance, voyage optimisation, and more. With impending environmental regulations, such as the IMO’s carbon pricing mechanism potentially tripling fuel costs by 2033, the imperative to reduce waste and optimize voyages has never been stronger. Experts like Christian Hall, head of digital projects at Hoegh Autoliners, noted that manufacturers now offer real-time engine tuning advice directly to ships, reducing wear and fuel consumption. Torbjorn Dimblad, chief information officer at Anglo-Eastern, emphasised that data-driven insights for fuel savings have become a cornerstone of modern fleet operations. Beyond efficiency, AI is proving revolutionary in improving maritime safety—an area long plagued by human error and fatigue. Yarden Gross, CEO and co-founder of Orca AI, emphasised that AI acts as a “co-pilot,” not a replacement. The intent is to automate routine tasks, alleviate crew workload, and dramatically enhance situational awareness. This is critical, especially as crews face increased pressure navigating through increasingly congested and unpredictable waters. AI systems, like those from Orca AI, use advanced thermal cameras and deep learning algorithms to detect hazards even in fog or heavy seas. Gross shared that one fleet using their platform saw a 74% drop in near misses over 18 months—a tangible improvement that has already led to internal policy changes. Alerts on close encounters, speed violations, and erratic vessel behaviour are now part of a ship’s digital toolkit, helping officers respond faster and more effectively. These tools do not diminish human responsibility but enhance a crew’s ability to act decisively. Moreover, the integration of intuitive interfaces aims to make these systems accessible and trusted by mariners, especially important as the next generation of tech-savvy seafarers enters the workforce. Despite the promise of AI and automation, industry experts acknowledge several hurdles. A major one is the lag between technological capability and regulatory frameworks. Gijsbert de Jong, marine chief executive nordics, Bureau Veritas pointed out that while AI can perform many autonomous functions today, regulators remain cautious—particularly about liability. The IMO’s Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) Code is under development, but progress is slow. Trust also emerges as a barrier. Seafarers, already overwhelmed with operational responsibilities, may be sceptical of AI systems or struggle with complicated data interfaces. The consensus is clear: user interfaces must be streamlined and insights must be actionable, not overwhelming. As Anglo-Eastern’s Dimblad said, continuous crew training is essential for successful adoption. Moreover, collaboration among vendors and shipping companies remains limited. Seamless integration of systems is key to delivering coherent decision support tools, but currently, too many ships operate with siloed solutions. Additionally, cybersecurity threats loom larger as vessels become more connected and reliant on cloud-based analytics. Looking forward, the 2030s are set to be a dynamic decade for shipping. While onboard automation will evolve, it’s the shoreside operations—like fleet monitoring and route optimisation—that may see the most dramatic transformation through AI. The new digital tools are expected to change not just how ships operate, but also how decisions are made on land. As AI becomes a core competency, maritime companies that fail to invest risk losing their competitive edge. But those that embrace this transformation stand to gain not only in efficiency and safety, but also in regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. As Orca AI’s Gross aptly put it, “Companies that don’t lean into AI now will simply fall behind. The digital voyage has begun, and it’s moving fast.” This article was created using NotebookLM and ChatGPT."

Gijsbert de Jong, marine chief executive nordics, Bureau Veritas pointed out that while AI can perform many autonomous functions today, regulators remain cautious—particularly about liability. The IMO’s Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) Code is under development, but progress is slow. Trust also emerges as a barrier. Seafarers, already overwhelmed with operational responsibilities, may be sceptical of AI systems or struggle with complicated data interfaces. The consensus is clear: user interfaces must be streamlined and insights must be actionable, not overwhelming. As Anglo-Eastern’s Dimblad said, continuous crew training is essential for successful adoption. Moreover, collaboration among vendors and shipping companies remains limited. Seamless integration of systems is key to delivering coherent decision support tools, but currently, too many ships operate with siloed solutions. Additionally, cybersecurity threats loom larger as vessels become more connected and reliant on cloud-based analytics. Looking forward, the 2030s are set to be a dynamic decade for shipping. While onboard automation will evolve, it’s the shoreside operations—like fleet monitoring and route optimisation—that may see the most dramatic transformation through AI. The new digital tools are expected to change not just how ships operate, but also how decisions are made on land. As AI becomes a core competency, maritime companies that fail to invest risk losing their competitive edge. But those that embrace this transformation stand to gain not only in efficiency and safety, but also in regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. As Orca AI’s Gross aptly put it, “Companies that don’t lean into AI now will simply fall behind. The digital voyage has begun, and it’s moving fast.” This article was created using NotebookLM and ChatGPT."

        "content": "Seafaring remains one of the world’s most dangerous professions, according to a major new report, which surveyed 147,000 people in many different jobs across the world. According to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll Focus On report, 25% of ocean workers report having experienced harm from their work in the past two years, compared to 18% of other workers – the highest level recorded among any sector polled (see chart below). Despite high rates of harm, too few ocean workers have received occupational safety and health (OSH) training. Over two thirds (68%) of ocean workers said they never have, while only a quarter (25%) have received recent training in the last two years. Lloyd’s Register Foundation also found that ocean workers have experienced more harm from severe weather than any other group of workers. One third (33%) of ocean workers reported having personally experienced serious harm from severe weather in the last two years, compared to 20% of other workers. These statistics reflect the fact that, unlike many in the general workforce, ocean workers face direct exposure to the increasing intensity of severe weather events, from storms to unpredictable ocean conditions. Professor Maximo Mejia, president of the World Maritime University, commented: “Seafaring and commercial fishing have traditionally been recognised as the world’s most hazardous occupations. Aside from already challenging conditions that have perennially been associated with shipboard life, our ocean workers face new and even more serious risks brought about by climate change. The World Risk Poll provides us with important and updated data and evidence that should inform any policy designed to protect not only our ocean workers, but the planet itself.” Chirag Bahri, international operations manager at the International Seafarers Welfare and Assistance Network (ISWAN), and a former seafarer, added: “In addition to the harsh weather, ocean workers have to deal with a variety of internal issues which lead to anxiety and stress, such as loneliness, working with a diverse and international crew, and being physically separated from their loved ones. This study emphasises that ocean workers are also subject to quiet storms in the form of insufficient training and fear of job loss. Their wellbeing is just as important as the work they do, so they should receive better training that helps to promote their occupational health and safety. The global economy depends on their resilience and power, and in order to safeguard the environment and humanity, we must adopt sustainable solutions.”"

        "content": "Governors and attorneys general of a dozen US states are voicing their opposition to offshore oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Attorneys general of Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and, most recently, California filed comment letters with the US Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) The latest letter came from California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who joined a coalition of 10 attorneys general in urging the federal government to exclude all planning areas in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans from the upcoming 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. The final program will determine which ocean areas could be opened to lease sales for oil and gas activity during the current five-year planning period, which covers the period 2024-2029. “President Trump is once again taking action to line the pockets of his Big Oil friends. This time, he’s expanding oil and gas development by attempting to drill in our coastal communities. There is no compelling need to risk our marine and coastal resources for the limited supplies of fossil fuels off our coasts,” Bonta said. He pointed out that the US already produces more oil and gas than any other country and exports more than it uses, and that gasoline demand has been dropping since 2019, especially on the east and west coasts. Separately, the governors of North Carolina and South Carolina opposed offshore drilling on their coasts in a letter to BOEM. The Bureau is evaluating the American coastline for potential sites to drill for natural energy resources, and potential new leases could be given on the Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina coasts, which, by a resolution signed by President Donald Trump in his first term, are supposed to be protected until 2032. In the bipartisan letter, Democratic governor Josh Stein and Republican governor Henry McMaster asked the administration not to lift the moratorium. The two Carolinas have around 800 km of ocean beaches and over 9,650 km of coastline. “These decisions to protect the Carolina coast from offshore oil and gas exploration, development, and production were responsive to the significant bipartisan concerns of business leaders, residents, and local and state elected officials about the risks that these activities pose to the economy and environment of our states,” they wrote. They added that every North Carolina and South Carolina coastal municipality has passed a resolution opposing offshore drilling and seismic testing, reaffirmed by other municipalities and counties, as well as state legislators and members of Congressional delegations from both parties. This opposition to offshore drilling follows a total of 18 attorneys general filing a lawsuit in federal court in May challenging US president Donald Trump’s order to shut down offshore wind projects, stating that such a move was “unlawful and can jeopardise the continued development of a power source critical to the states’ economic vitality, energy mix, public health, and climate goals.” The lawsuit names New York, Massachusetts, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington State as the plaintiffs."

        "author": "Sam Chambers",
        "content": "Japan is weighing bold steps to rejuvenate its once-dominant shipbuilding industry, including the establishment of a government-backed national shipyard, as part of a wider strategy to restore maritime manufacturing capabilities critical to national security. The proposal, submitted to prime minister Shigeru Ishiba by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday, calls for the rehabilitation of dormant shipbuilding and repair facilities, alongside incentives for public and private investment in next-generation shipyard infrastructure. Japan once commanded nearly 50% of global shipbuilding output during the 1990s. Today, its market share has plummeted to around 10%, trailing far behind China, which controls 70% of global newbuild capacity and an astounding 90% of repair capacity, and South Korea, its long-time regional rival. The sharp decline has been fuelled by fierce pricing competition, with Chinese and Korean yards benefiting from extensive state subsidies and scale advantages. The most recent blow came in May, when new ship orders at Japanese yards fell 48% year-on-year to just 884,100 gt, according to figures released this week by the Japan Ship Exporters Association (JSEA). Amid the slump, Japan’s shipbuilding sector received a jolt of fresh leadership. Yukito Higaki, president of Imabari Shipbuilding—the country’s largest shipyard—was appointed this week as the new chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Association (JSIA), becoming the first leader from a dedicated commercial yard rather than a diversified heavy industry firm like Mitsubishi or IHI. At a press conference, Higaki outlined an ambitious target: regaining at least 20% global market share by 2030, doubling current levels. “To become a price leader who has the power to control pricing, we must at least achieve a 20% global market share by 2030,” said the Imabari boss. Higaki also expressed openness to cooperation with the US, especially under the Trump administration’s push to revive American shipbuilding. Tokyo and Washington are preparing to launch a Japan-US Shipbuilding Revitalization Fund, designed to channel investment into both domestic and US-based yards. Japanese firms are eyeing contracts to build car carriers, LNG carriers, and ice-class naval vessels for the US market, potentially positioning themselves as strategic alternatives to Chinese suppliers. Discussions have included naval collaboration, icebreaker production, and the establishment of a bilateral maritime supply chain decoupled from China. The US is also expected to raise port fees on Chinese-linked tonnage calling at American ports later this year, part of a broader effort to curtail China’s maritime dominance. Japan’s revitalisation plan will be underpinned by the 2022 Economic Security Promotion Act, which enables the government to directly support industries deemed vital to national interest. Yet time may be running out. According to Danish Ship Finance, unless Japanese shipyards win a substantial wave of new orders, average utilisation rates could plummet from 50% this year to just 20% by 2027. This looming drop threatens not only industrial output, but the retention of skilled workers. “Yards in Japan may find themselves underutilised, pointing to a mismatch between output capacity and commercial competitiveness,” Danish Ship Finance warned in a report issued last month."

UK, French and German foreign ministers will hold talks with their Iranian counterpart in Geneva today as part of efforts to end the Israel-Iran conflict It comes after the White House says Donald Trump will decide in the next two weeks whether the US will join Israeli strikes on Iran, a significant de-escalation from earlier hawkish comments made in Washington. Trump has delayed making a decision as he thinks there’s a “substantial chance” of talks, according to his press secretary . Traffic passing through the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world’s most important energy arteries, remains robust as the two maps from a week ago and today from MarineTraffic show. Maritime traffic patterns are shifting however in response to heightened threats in the region. Between June 11 and 18, analytics firm Windward identified more than 35 LPG tankers stationary in Omani waters — an 82% increase over expected levels. The median duration of port calls for 89 tankers in Saudi Arabia during the week ending June 19 dropped to 19 hours, 37% lower than the prior week. This marks the shortest median duration since monitoring began in August 2021. “In the Strait of Hormuz, GPS jamming — rather than hijacking vessels or blocking commercial traffic — appears to be the preferred tactic of grey zone aggression by regional actors, as it threatens without directly impeding maritime flow,” Windward noted in a report published yesterday. Tuesday saw a fiery collision between a Frontline VLCC and a suezmax belonging to Russia’s shadow fleet with GPS spoofing detected in the hours leading up the accident."

        "content": "Seafaring remains one of the world’s most dangerous professions, according to a major new report, which surveyed 147,000 people in many different jobs across the world. According to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll Focus On report, 25% of ocean workers report having experienced harm from their work in the past two years, compared to 18% of other workers – the highest level recorded among any sector polled (see chart below). Despite high rates of harm, too few ocean workers have received occupational safety and health (OSH) training. Over two thirds (68%) of ocean workers said they never have, while only a quarter (25%) have received recent training in the last two years. Lloyd’s Register Foundation also found that ocean workers have experienced more harm from severe weather than any other group of workers. One third (33%) of ocean workers reported having personally experienced serious harm from severe weather in the last two years, compared to 20% of other workers. These statistics reflect the fact that, unlike many in the general workforce, ocean workers face direct exposure to the increasing intensity of severe weather events, from storms to unpredictable ocean conditions. Professor Maximo Mejia, president of the World Maritime University, commented: “Seafaring and commercial fishing have traditionally been recognised as the world’s most hazardous occupations. Aside from already challenging conditions that have perennially been associated with shipboard life, our ocean workers face new and even more serious risks brought about by climate change. The World Risk Poll provides us with important and updated data and evidence that should inform any policy designed to protect not only our ocean workers, but the planet itself.” Chirag Bahri, international operations manager at the International Seafarers Welfare and Assistance Network (ISWAN), and a former seafarer, added: “In addition to the harsh weather, ocean workers have to deal with a variety of internal issues which lead to anxiety and stress, such as loneliness, working with a diverse and international crew, and being physically separated from their loved ones. This study emphasises that ocean workers are also subject to quiet storms in the form of insufficient training and fear of job loss. Their wellbeing is just as important as the work they do, so they should receive better training that helps to promote their occupational health and safety. The global economy depends on their resilience and power, and in order to safeguard the environment and humanity, we must adopt sustainable solutions.”"
